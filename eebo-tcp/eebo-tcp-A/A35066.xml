            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Excellence of History is so well writ of, by some few, that it were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion to repeat, and vanity to add to what they have said: yet it is allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to regrate the frequent Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror even of great Historians, in writing what they too easily believe, without sufficient A vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and thereby imposeing Falshoods for Truth. If these
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64880:4"/>
Errors fall on Things and Actions, they oft-times cause, at least occasion great Mischeifs; Thus our Scots Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, tho' justly placed in the first Rank, have inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Nation, whilst on Design to give a Frame to our <hi>Ius Regni,</hi> some of them have screwed the Soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity up to Precipices; Others with as little Truth, and less Civility, depressing it to unsufferable Lowness: whence the great evil of Civil War hath too oft Sprung. At other times they have cast dirt on persons, either by their Supine Ignorance in not searching Records, before they publish their Collections; or upon malitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to avenge some Disappointments. Amongst others, our Historians have foully fail'd, in relating what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>King Robert</hi> the seconds Marriage, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy of his Succession; and the fairest Excuse that can be made for them, is to cover their fault with the shade of others, who, tho' prior to them, yet did writ at a great distance from the Actions and Persons of whom they wrote, and rushed into Falshoods, because they did writ without proof, and choosed rather to make a Criminal Noise, than to keep Innocent Silence: For had our Historians been at the trouble to look into our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords before they wrote our History, they had saved mine in vindicating our Royal Line and all the Hereditary CROWN'D HEADS in <hi>Europe</hi> from the Tash of Bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, in their Descent from <hi>Robert</hi> the second, King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and from <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> or <hi>More</hi> his Wife, who in their Relations, is falsly stated a Concubine; whereas what hereafter follows, will prove near to a Demonstration, that She was his lawfull Wife, &amp; so well secured in that Title, that her Husband could not be allowed to quarrel it, tho' he had inclined to do so, as indeed he never did. Our four Historians <hi>Major, Boetius, Lesly and Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64880:4"/>
have followed one another, in relating that <hi>Robert</hi> the STUART of SCOTLAND, Grand-child by a Daughter to <hi>Robert</hi> the first, &amp; Nephew to <hi>David</hi> the second, whilst he was STUART of <hi>SCOTLAND</hi> &amp; Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Children by <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> who was not his Wife, and since it were needless to repeat the words of all the four; I shall take <hi>Buchanans</hi> as the last, and of greatest credit, who speaking of the beginning of King <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>ds.</hi> Reign, <hi>page</hi> 318 in the Francfort Edition of his History in <hi>Octavo,</hi> gives this account.</p>

               </note>But if I prove that <hi>Eupheme Ross</hi> died not in the 2<hi>d.</hi> year of King <hi>Robert</hi>'s Reign, but lived many years there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; that will falsifie the first Assertion of the foresaid Paragraph. If <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> whom he calls the Daughter of <hi>Adam Mure,</hi> did not only bear two Daughters to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> but six, then our Historians have not been well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the State and Concerns of that Family. If <hi>John, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> eldest Son was Earl of <hi>Carrick, Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teith,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Badinoch,</hi> in the first year of King <hi>Roberts</hi> Reign; then it is false that these Honours and Estates were bestowed upon them by their Father af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the 3<hi>d.</hi> year of his Reign: If they were bestowed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them in <hi>Eupheme Ross</hi>'s Lifetime, then it is false that they were bestowed upon them sometime after her Death. If the Convention of Estates or Parliament, who declared <hi>John</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Robert</hi> by <hi>Elizabeth Mure</hi> to be his Successor in the Crown, was kept and did so declare in the first year of King <hi>Roberts</hi> Reign, and whilst Queen <hi>Eupheme</hi> was alive; then it is false that this Convention was kept, and did give this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after her death, and after the 3<hi>d.</hi> year of King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Reign. And if it appear plainly, that <hi>Robert Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Stratherne,</hi> did, whilst he was in these Stations, and long before he was King, own <hi>John</hi> his eldest Son by <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> to be his eldest Son and Heir, and did share his Fortune and Honours with him, and that he was so owned in all publick Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by his Father, by his Fathers Vassals, and by those who contracted with his Father and him, both <hi>Laicks and Ecclesiasticks,</hi> and that by many reiterated Acts; If he was so owned openly by King <hi>David Bruce</hi> before his Death; then it is a sure Truth that he was so, nor could his Right of Legitimacy, and Filiation be taken
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64880:5"/>

And if it be true, that not only his Father, but the whole Estates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Parliament conveen'd, immediatly upon <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>ds.</hi> coming to the Crown, and in the first year of his Reign, did owne <hi>John</hi> as the undoubted Heir and Successor to <hi>Robert</hi>; and if at that time he was so own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Queen <hi>Eupheme</hi> and all her Relations; And if <hi>Elizabeth Mure</hi> was dead before the year 1364; then it is false that her Children were advanced by her being married to the King in the year 1373, or after <hi>Eupheme Rosses</hi> death: And <hi>John</hi> the eldest Son's Right and Title is beyond all Controversie, tho' not beyond all Calumny. And lastly, If <hi>Elizabeth Mure</hi> was so far from being a mean Person or a Concubine, that she was a Person of such Quality, and near Relation to <hi>Robert</hi> her Husband, that he was at the Trouble to procure a Dispensation from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that at considerable Expenses, for Allowance to marry her, before he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: And if this Dispensation was granted several years before he was King, and many years before <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phame Ross's</hi> death; Then the Insinuation of her Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Imputation of her being a Concubine, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth of her being married three years, at least, after King <hi>Robert</hi> was KING, and indeed the whole of this Comment and false Relation, appears to be a scandalous Libel.</p>

               <p>Here is only the Most authentick Evident, which perhaps <hi>Europe</hi> can shew, giving an irrefragable Proof, that <hi>John</hi> afterwards called <hi>Robert,</hi> eldest Son to <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> was in the first year of his Fathers Reign, owned and acknowledged, as his eldest lawful Son and Heir, and undoubted Successor to the Crown; and that in the lifetime of Queen <hi>Eupheme,</hi> to which her Son in law the Earl of <hi>Douglass</hi> his Seal amongst others, is appended: And therefore <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> his Mother, was lawful Wife to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> afterwards KING; and consequently it is false that these Children were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly legitimat by King <hi>Roberts</hi> marrying their Mother after Queen <hi>Euphems</hi> death, and after the third year of his Reign, And that the Act of Parliament recognizing <hi>Iohn</hi> as such, was past in the fourth year of the said King's Reign. This solemn Act and authentick Record yet extant, doth evidence to a Demonstration, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of those negligent <hi>Historiographers,</hi> who did write so confidently, what this Act and Instrument doth so clearly canvel: Nor is it so by this great Act only, but by very many other authentick Documents standing in Record, as a Charter granted on the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune Anno Regni primo</hi> to <hi>Allan Lawder</hi> of <hi>Whitsled,</hi> and the other Charters before mentioned, and twenty others not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which all bear Record, that in the first year of King <hi>Robert</hi> the seconds Reign, and in Queen <hi>Euphems</hi> Lifetime, the KING, the Prelats, the Lords, and all who received Charters from the King, did look on the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64880:11"/>
said <hi>John</hi> as his undoubted eldest Son and Heir, Earl of <hi>Carrick</hi> and <hi>STEWART</hi> of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> and the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters granted to, and received by Queen <hi>Eupheme</hi>; by her Son <hi>David</hi> and her Son <hi>Walter</hi> for services to the King and his Heirs, do carry in them, <hi>John</hi> is the undoubted eldest Son and Heir.</p>
               <p>Albeit what is said seems demonstrative enough, yet to leave no part of this injurious Lybel unransaked; We shall next shew, that before <hi>Robert</hi> the second, yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many years before, whilst he was Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi> and STEWART of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> JOHN his Son was owned by him, and by the whole Nation, as his eldest Son and Heir.</p>
               <p>There is a Charter, wherein <hi>Robertus Senescallus Scotiae, Comes de Strathern, &amp;</hi> Joannes Senescallus <hi>fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us noster primo-genius &amp; Haeres,</hi> confirm a Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by <hi>Reginaldus More, Pater Wilielmi More, Equitis</hi> to the Abbacy of <hi>Pasly,</hi> recorded in their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, which, tho' it want a Date, yet there follows in the same Register, a Charter given by the said <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Senescallus Scotiae,</hi> confirming all Gifts given by his Predecessors and himself to the Abbacy of <hi>Pasly,</hi> dated <hi>anno</hi> 1361, which was nine years before he was KING; In which, amongst other Witnesses, <hi>Joannes Senescallus Dominus de Kyle primogenitus noster,</hi> is one: Which verifies also, that his Father did communicat his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Estate with him at that time. This Charter is recorded in Fol. 39. of the Register of <hi>Pasly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1328. on the thirteenth of <hi>February,</hi> there is a Submission recorded in the said Register of <hi>Pasly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Procurator of the said <hi>Abbacy,</hi> called <hi>Andrew Kelcho,</hi> who was Prior of the Abbacy on the one part, and Reginald <hi>More</hi> or <hi>Mure</hi> Procurator for the Master Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

and Monks of <hi>Simpringhame,</hi> concerning 40 Merks of Annuity, payable by the Abbacy of <hi>Pasly</hi> to <hi>Simpringhame</hi>; and assigned by them to the said Reginald: On which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, the Abbot is decerned to pay the 40 Merks to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginald and his Successors, he getting a sufficient Write from those of <hi>Simpringhame,</hi> to secure <hi>Pasly</hi> for what they pay: And for further Security to the Abbacy Reginald and his Son Sir <hi>William</hi> consign a Write disponing his Lands of <hi>Sanackar, Camsestrang, Doulargis, Cowdams, Stafflour</hi> and <hi>Hormisdale,</hi> lying in the Baronies of <hi>Renfrew</hi> and <hi>Cowall,</hi> in Warrandice to the Abbacy, for securing them until he produced the said Writing from <hi>Simpringhame,</hi> as said is; he having failed for two years to procure the said security from <hi>Simpringhame,</hi> those of <hi>Pasly</hi> addressed to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi> STEWART of SCOTLAND, and to JOHN his eldest Son and Heir, Who were Superiors of the Lands disponed by <hi>Reginald</hi> to them, for their Security, desiring a Charter, whereby they might be seased in the saids Lands; Which <hi>Robert</hi> and his said Son did grant, and it is recorded <hi>in Folio</hi> 16. of the old Register of <hi>Pasly</hi>: The Charter is long, and therefore I have only abstracted out of it, what is useful for our purpose, as follows.</p>

               <p>These Charters and many others extant on Record, do sufficiently evince, that <hi>John</hi> Son to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> was own'd by his Father, as his eldest Son and Heir, and did share with him, in his Honours and Estate long before he was KING, longer before <hi>Eupheme Rosses</hi> death; yea, in the whole tract of her Lifetime, and likeways by <hi>Eupheme Ross</hi> her self, and by her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who did take all their Charters, either with the said <hi>John</hi>'s Consent, or admitting him as Witness in their Writings, under the Designation of the King's eldest Son and Heir. It is also clear, that he was owned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Designation by his Fathers Vassals, who did take their Charters from the Father always with His Consent, with the solemnity of his Seal, as well as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and always under the Designation of his eldest

Son and Heir. The Bishops, Lords and Gentlemen of the best Quality in the adjacent Countrey owned him as such, in being Witnesses with him, under that Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But if such a Cloud of Witnesses and Writings do leave any doubt, then that of a whole Kingdom can leave none: And this we have also; For the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> had no Right to dispose of their Moveables by Testament: King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi> had promised ta give them this Priviledge, yet had not performed it before his death; King <hi>David Bruce</hi> his son, in one of his last Parliaments, passes a Deed, by way of Act, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating his Fathers Promise and Resolution; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ratifies the said Promise, and of new grants and confirms to all the Bishops in Scotland Power and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to dispone their Moveables by Testament: Which authentick Act and Deed stands recorded in the Records of the Great-Seal, and is as follows.</p>

               <p>By this notable Charter, <hi>verbatim</hi> Extracted from the authentick Records, it is evident that <hi>JOHN</hi> afterwards called <hi>Robert</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> was eldest Son and Heir to <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> not after the third year of <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>ds.</hi> Reign, nor after <hi>Eupheme Ross's</hi> Death, but in King <hi>David Bruces</hi> Reign, 37. years before <hi>Eupheme Ross's</hi> Death.</p>
               <p>Now if King <hi>David Bruce,</hi> and the whole States of the Kingdom do solemnly Recognize and owne <hi>JOHN</hi> eldest Son and Heir to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Robert</hi> was KING, and whilst he was married on <hi>Eupheme Ross,</hi> and if all his Vassals and Neighbours did own him also as such, and his Father likewise do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always so.</p>
               <p>And if his Father, Queen <hi>Eupheme,</hi> &amp; Queen <hi>Euphem</hi>'s Children did own him as such, after he was KING; And if the whole Estates of the Kingdom have, by the most solemn and authentick Document that is extant
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64880:16"/>
in all our Records, or perhaps in Christendom, and sealed it with their Seals, which is as yet extant in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Custody; then our Historians Assertion of <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Mure</hi>'s being a Concubine, and of her Children's being Bastards, until they were forsooth legitimat by a Marriage, after <hi>Eupheme Rosses</hi> death (And which Marriage was many years after <hi>Elizabeth Mur's</hi> death, since in an autentick Document after adduced, she is spoke of, as dead, <hi>anno</hi> 1364, and her eldest Son is Witness in that Document) which had been both frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent and without Fond in Law, is false, and the whole Superstructure against the Honour of that Lady and her Children, and against the lawful Succession and just Rights of the Crown do fall, as founded on groundless Assertions and Untruths; Since the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Papers do prove, that <hi>Elizabeth Mure</hi> was lawful Wife, and her Children, lawful and eldest Children to <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>second,</hi> and that the Right of Succession was due to them thereby, and not by any subsequent Marriage, nor by any Act of Parliament: And therefore <hi>Elizabeth Mure</hi> or <hi>More</hi> was first and lawful Wife to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> STEWART, and thereafter KING of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> was his eldest Son and apparent Heir, antecedently to the Act of Parliament, and to <hi>Eupheme Rosses</hi> death.</p>
               <p>As the foregoing Collection and Abstracts do fully verifie, that <hi>Elizabeth Mure</hi>'s Children were recogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and owned as King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>seconds</hi> eldest lawful Children, and his Son as his eldest Son and undoubted Heir, before <hi>Robert</hi> was King, so soon as he was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King, and in the whole Tract of his Reign, before he married <hi>Eupheme Ross,</hi> during her Marriage, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64880:17"/>
after her Death, and that by no less evidence, than au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Deeds and Instruments extant, both on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and in their Originals, and with no lower Avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than Kings and Parliaments in Parliament conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and many other authentick Documents of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Faith besides; a few of which, much more all do make so strong a Probation of <hi>Elisabeth Mure's</hi> Marriage, and the Legitimation of her Children, that they could not be redargued by <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> himself, if he would, and are stronger proofs thereof, than any perhaps in the World, can produce after so long a time; yet to confirm this truth, I shall add one, whch is not in our Records, but in a very publick one, the notice whereof, came to my knoledge lately by Mr. <hi>Forbes</hi> who came from <hi>Doway,</hi> and had an authentick Extract, which he gave me, whilst he was Prisoner here; And very long after I had made the former Collection. It is an Abstract of a Charter gtanted by <hi>Robert</hi> STEWART of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi> in the year 1364. Whereby he gives, grants and founds a Chaplanary in the Church of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and that for performing an Obligation, under which he did ly to the Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> as delegate from the Pope, to grant to the said <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi> a Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Marriage to be contracted betwixt him and <hi>Elisabeth Mure,</hi> by reason of his Affinity, and Consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity with her. The Original of which Charter, with its Seals and Subscriptions, is as yet extant and entire in the <hi>Scots</hi> Colledge of <hi>Paris,</hi> whether it was carried by <hi>James Beton</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and depositat there with many other authentick Records of that Bishoprick.

               <p>This Charter granted on the 12. day of <hi>January,</hi> 1364. in performance of a former Obligation, and on so long before, that the eldest Son of the Marriage with <hi>Elisabeth, viz. JOHN,</hi> is a Witness in this Deed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Designation of the Lord of <hi>Kyle,</hi> and eldest Son and Heir to the said <hi>Robert</hi>; so that the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for a Marriage to be contracted, could be no less than ten or twelve years before that Date. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Marriage with <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> was not in the year 1373. altho' <hi>Eupheme Ross</hi> had then died, as she did not for six years thereafter: but the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age behoved to be, at least 20 years before he was King, and 29 years before <hi>Eupheme Ross</hi> died, according to <hi>Fordan's</hi> account of her Death, and 23 years before her Death, according to <hi>Buchannan</hi> and <hi>Boetius</hi>; and if there were no more to canvell the Authority of the groundles Histories, but this single Document it were more than sufficient: For it first proves that <hi>Elisabeth Mure</hi> was a person of Quality, of Consanguinty and near Relation to the King; and it is very probable she might have been so, since the Baron of <hi>Rowallan</hi> was of near neighbour head to the Lords of <hi>Kyle,</hi> and a proper Match for any of the Daughters of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: and who by authenitck Documents yet upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and extent in <hi>Rowallans</hi> Charter-Chest, appears to have been Heretor of 100 Merk-lands, of Property and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64880:20"/>
Superiority, of old extant above these 300 years, which is more than the Estate of ordinary Barons: and our Historians telling she was the Daughter of a Knight called Sir <hi>Adam Mure,</hi> and there being then no Families of that Name in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of that Quality but <hi>Rowallan</hi> &amp; <hi>Abercorn,</hi> those of <hi>Abercorn,</hi> who were co-temporary with <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> were Reginald the Father, and Sir <hi>William</hi> the Son, and Reginald Son to Sir <hi>William,</hi> but no Sir <hi>Adam,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by several Writs extant in the Records of <hi>Pasly,</hi> in the Reigns of K. <hi>David Bruce, Robert the</hi> 2d. and <hi>Robert</hi> the 3d. there are several Charters and Writings on Record, granted to those of <hi>Abercorn,</hi> by the said <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> of <hi>Strathern,</hi> but never with the Designation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguineus, or importing any Relation, whereas this Dispensation evinces, that the Family of <hi>Elisabeth Mure,</hi> was in Consanguinity to the said <hi>Robert</hi>: Nor was it a Disparagement for any Earl to marry a Knights Daughter: and about that very time, King <hi>David Bruce</hi> did marry the Daughter of Sir <hi>John Logie</hi>; and <hi>Robert</hi> the third then called JOHN shortly thereafter, whilst PRINCE of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> did marry the Daughter of Sir <hi>Drummond,</hi> Predecessor to the now Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> as appears by a Charter following on a Contract of Marriage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the PRINCE, and the said Lady in several Lands, <hi>anno Regni</hi> 3. which is extant in the Rolls of the Great Seal.</p>
               <p>This Charter of Mortification to the Church of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gow</hi> likewise evinces, that this Lady was so far from being a Concubine, that the Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi> was at the pains to procure a Dispensation from the Pope, before he could have her in Marriage: And by the tenor of the Paper, it is clear that the Dispensation was obtained before the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64880:20"/>
Marriage was consumate. And yet the eldest Son of the Marriage is a conjunct Disponer in this Charter with his Father, of ten <hi>Merks Sterling</hi> to the Chaplain of <hi>Glasgow</hi> in the year 1364. In which year, and in this most authentick Document, under the Sign and Seal of her Husband, before famous Witnesses, she is spoke of as dead at that time.</p>
               <p>Nor was there so great a Disparity betwixt the first and second Marriage, for <hi>Eupheme Ross</hi> was but a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, when he married her, and Widow to the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi>; as a Charter granted by <hi>David Bruce, anno,</hi> 1341. to <hi>Robert SENESCALLVS</hi> his Nephew, and <hi>Eupheme</hi> Countess of <hi>Murray</hi> his Wife, of the Lands of <hi>Methven</hi> does prove, and is extant in the Records.</p>
               <p>And to evince further, that there is certainty enough of <hi>Elisabeth Mures</hi> being <hi>Rowallans</hi> Daughter, there are in <hi>Rowallans</hi> Charter-chest, these following Writings.

               <p>BY which Evidents, t'is clear, that in the time of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> there was a Sir <hi>Adam Muir</hi> of <hi>Rowallan</hi>; that he was also in the time of <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> that he had a Son called also Sir <hi>Adam,</hi> who in <hi>K.

               </p>
               <p>AND for further proof, Mr. <hi>David Chalmers,</hi> one of the Senators of the Colledge of Justice, a man of Learning and Probity; in an Abridgement writ by him, of all the Popes, Emperors, Kings of <hi>FRANCE, SCOTLAND</hi> and <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> which was Printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and dedicated to King <hi>HENRY</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; and grounding his Proofs, as to <hi>Scots</hi> matters on <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got</hi> and Bishop <hi>Elphinston,</hi> (who indeed only transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and gave some Addition to <hi>Veremudus</hi>) and on the Collections of <hi>John Swinton,</hi> and <hi>John Campbel</hi> two Church-men; in Relation to this Subject, hath these words: <hi>Ce Roy de Escosse (viz. ROBERT</hi> the 2<hi>d,) meurant laissa de Elizabeth fille, d' Adam Mure</hi> Baron <hi>de Rowallan, trois fils &amp; deux filles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>John Lermond,</hi> Chaplain to <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop. of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> in his Collection of the <hi>Scots</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64880:22"/>
Antiquities, asserts that he saw a Testificat under the hand of <hi>Roger Mcadam</hi> a Priest, bearing, that he the said <hi>Roger</hi> did marry <hi>Robert</hi> the great STEWART of <hi>SCOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,</hi> to <hi>Elisabeth Mure</hi> Daughter to <hi>Rowallan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Testimonies are Proofs, as much as is ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required for Historical Narrations: But the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Writs bearing the first Sir <hi>Adam</hi> of <hi>Rowal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> and <hi>Polkelly,</hi> to have been co-temporary with King <hi>David Bruce,</hi> and consequently when <hi>Robert</hi> the Great <hi>STEWART</hi> was a Youth; and that the 2<hi>d.</hi> Sir <hi>Adam</hi> is alwise designed <hi>CONSANGVINEVS</hi> by King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> and by his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> Earl of <hi>Fife,</hi> Governour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and both Sons to to the said <hi>Elisabeth Mure,</hi> puts it out of all Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doubt, that this Lady was a Daughter of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>There is such a heap of Absurdities and Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as well as Falshoods in the Forgery of this Fable, that in pity to our Historiographers, I will prosecute it no further, hoping it may teach all future Writers, to have better Avouchers for their Assertions, than common bruit and open Fame, or to take on Trust; what's writ by former Authors, without authentick Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>The Proofs of this Marriage are so strong and clear,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Objest.</hi> 1.</note> as to leave no Doubt, except that of their being too clear; for why should one design his Son always his eldest Son and Heir, unless it had been doubtful that he was so?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:64880:23"/>As this is but a silly Conjecture, in ballance with the least of the former Evidences, so it will only occur to those, who are little acquainted with the Stile of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings at that time; for there are hundreds of Charters by privat Subjects standing on Record, then and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after with the very like Designations.</p>
               <p>A second scruple is, why should a Parliament recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize <hi>JOHN</hi> to be King <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>ds.</hi> Son and Heir,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> unless there were ground to doubt it? And that an Act of Parliament was necessary to make that be believed.</p>
               <p>But if they read this, that they call an Act of Parliament Recognizing <hi>John</hi>'s Title, they will find a Narration sufficient to answer their Objection; and those who are acquaint with our History, know that it was ordinary for our Kings to make publick Declarations of their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Sons Succession: <hi>David</hi> the first did send <hi>Malcolm</hi> his eldest Grand-child, by <hi>Henry</hi> the Prince, with <hi>Mc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duff</hi> Earl of <hi>Fife,</hi> through the whole Kingdom, to be shewen and declared as his successor and Heir: but this Custom was judged more necessary by King <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> and his Successors; For the debate in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, betwixt the <hi>Baliol</hi> and the <hi>Bruce,</hi> having brought the Kingdom to the very Brink of Ruine; King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi> before his Death, did in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament declare, that <hi>David</hi> his Son was his undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Heir and Successor; albeit, at that time, he had, neither Son nor Brother but <hi>David</hi> only. Which is one of Mr. <hi>Cookes</hi> mistakes, who writes as if <hi>Edward Bruce</hi> his Brother were then alive, whereas he was dead long before.</p>
               <p>King <hi>David Bruce,</hi> after his Fathers Example, did in a Parliament at <hi>Scoon,</hi> Publish and Declare that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> his Sisters Son, was his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64880:23"/>
Heir and Successor, albeit, at that time, there was none of that Family to compete with him.</p>
               <p>And as this Instrument, before insert, does narrate that this wise King, in Example of his Predecessors did publish this Document; so neither wanted their good Reasons, why these three last Kings should have done so; the Crown having been, but lately before transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Baliols</hi> to their Family: so that albeit there was no shadow of Competition in their own Family; yet there was no imprudence in engaging the Parliament to own their Succession, and to put frequent Bars u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Door against the Race of the <hi>Baliol,</hi> which then did exist both in the <hi>Baliol</hi> and the <hi>Cumming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last frivolous Objection is:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Objest.</hi> 3.</note> why did our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians unanimously assert <hi>Elisabeth Mure's</hi> being marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> after <hi>Eupheme Ross's</hi> Death, that is to say, there are very great proofs that <hi>Elisabeth Mure</hi> was King <hi>Roberts</hi> Wife, but some will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth, unless you tell why our Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did ly: to which this is a sufficient Answer; you should believe truth, because it is proven, and reject the Assertion, which is redargued by so many Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations: but if you will allow me, after clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of their Error, to make some Excuse for their rash Injuries; I offer these Conjectures, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Major,</hi> the eldest of these Historians, wrote his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the beginning of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign, some 200. years after <hi>Elisabeth Mure's</hi> Marriage, he cites no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, nor can we learn of any that he had, except the Manuscript of the Continuator of <hi>Fordan,</hi> an obscure
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64880:24"/>
man whose Writings shew, that he did take common Reports as Proofs and Warrants for his Assertions; but <hi>Fordan,</hi> who wrote before that time, hath not the least Assertion of this, so considerable a matter, had it been true; and <hi>Majors</hi> Philosophy, as well as his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, does sufficiently shew, that he did take for truth, what others reported at Random.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boetius's</hi> Business was to give good Latine to the Collections of his Predecessors, and he was happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in Writing, had he not unhappily stuffed it, with too many Fables, which we must only impute to his easie Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lesly,</hi> had no Design in writing his History, but to assert his Queens Right, and resent the Injuries done her; and therefore minded little to put his Authors to the Test of Record.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buchanan,</hi> who was to support a bad Design by writing excellently, his care was not to canvell Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods, especialy when they contributed to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as this Imputation, bound on <hi>Elisabeth Mure</hi> and her Succession, did; and albeit the first must needs have founded the Account on false Report, and never looked into the Records, which had they done, that which now appears clearly to us in redarguing that Falshood, would certainly have done so to them: so the succeeding Authors have this Excuse (tho' I confess a bad one) that they found their Falshood on what was writ before them: And perhaps even the first of them, by a supine inadvertence having heard, that <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> after Queen <hi>Euphem's</hi> Death, had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64880:24"/>

               </p>

               <p>This Charter gives you Account of 4. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Sons of King <hi>Robert</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> and two Concubines, never mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our Histories, <hi>Moram</hi> seems to have been the last of the two Concubines, because her Son <hi>John's</hi> Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bears a Tailzie of his Lands to the youngest Son of <hi>Mariota,</hi> and failing of him to the second Son of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riota,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64880:25"/>
and failing of him to the eldest Son of <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ota</hi>: For another Charter, granted to <hi>Mariota</hi> of the Lands <hi>de nigra Aula,</hi> and others makes <hi>JOHN</hi> to be her eldest Son, <hi>Alexander</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> what this <hi>Mariota</hi> or <hi>Moram</hi> were, I know not, that being nothing to our purpose: But if any pleases to palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our Historians Error, by their placing <hi>Moram</hi> the last Concubine, for <hi>Elisabeth Mure</hi> the first undoubted Wife, they may for me, so they likewise tell that <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabeth Mure</hi> was dead long before the year 1364.</p>
               <p>And thus the Propsition of this whole syllogism being undenyable, the Assumption being proven by so many <hi>Mediums,</hi> I presume no rational man will deny his Assent to the Conclusion, and confess that <hi>Elisabeth Mure</hi> was the first and lawful Wife of <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> STEWART of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> and that all her Children were lawful Children, and the eldest called first <hi>IOHN,</hi> and thereafter <hi>ROBERT</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> was the lawful undoubted Heir of the Crown.</p>
               <p>And his Title behoved to be esteemed sacred by the whole Nation, when they so peaceably obeyed him and own'd his Soveraignity, altho he was one of the weakest men, both of Body and Mind, that ever was amongst our Kings: which also Guarded him and his Infant Children from the Rebellion of his Subjects, and the Usurpation of his Relations, albeit Occasions see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to favour such Inclinations in his Uncle the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, a man of great Wisdom and Action, and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent very long in the Royal Power; and who as some write, wanted not Inclinations to aspire, had he not been keep't down, by his Brother and Nephew's just Title.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64880:25"/>And had there been a Shadow of Right in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Eupheme Ross,</hi> who were strengthened with so many and so great Relations in the Kingdom, it had been a meanness in them, never to claim their Right, from so silly a Brother, and infant Nephews,</p>
               <p>But the Impediment did ly in the undoubted Title of <hi>ROBERT</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> and of his Son <hi>James</hi> the 1<hi>st.</hi> which made the whole Nation resent the Attempt made for the Crown by the Children of <hi>Eupheme Ross,</hi> in the Earl of <hi>Athol's</hi> murdering of <hi>James</hi> the first, by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of that Deed famous over <hi>Europe</hi>; and moved most certainly from the then Notoriety of King <hi>JAMES'S</hi> Title.</p>
