            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>That the Trade to Affrica, is only Manageable by an Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Letter to a Member of the Preſent Houſe of Commons,
by a Gentleman in the CITY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEing no leſs your Servant upon the account of your Merit and Quality, than of the many Acts
of Friendſhip that you have at all ſeaſons exerciſed towards me; you have an indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Right of Commanding my Service, and I own my ſelf obliged to yield you an entire
Obedience in all that you are pleaſed to exact, which lieth within the Circle of my
Power to perform.</p>
            <p>Now, I need not tell you, that the <hi>Affrican Company</hi> as Eſtabliſhed, did, neither mould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a Society, upon a previous Combination of a few Wealthy and Covetous Gentlemen;
nor did they enter into the preſent Method of managing that Commerce, by wreſting it out of the
hands of others, that had promoted and improv'd it to the Honour of the Government, and to a
National advantage; but they Embarq'd in it upon the Invitation and Encouragement of King <hi>Charles</hi>
II. and His <hi>Privy Council,</hi> as well as upon the Perſwaſion of many other Perſons of Quality and
Senſe; and this they did at a Juncture and Seaſon, when it was fallen under ſuch a Decay, that it
was apprehended by all people of Thought and Proſpect, to be in danger of being totally loſt.</p>
            <p>And as it could not then eſcape your <hi>Obſervation,</hi> no more can it now your <hi>Memory,</hi> that the
<hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> was about twenty years ago, not only ſo abated, but ſunk to ſuch a degree, that it
became a matter of <hi>State,</hi> challenging the utmoſt Wiſdom and Care of his then Majeſty, and of
thoſe of the profoundeſt prudence, and of the largeſt Mind, for the publick good, who were at
that time in the Miniſtry, how to Revive and Reſtore it, ſo as to render it conſiſtent with the Honour
of the Government, uſeful to the <hi>American</hi> Plantations, and of ampler advantage to the Nation,
both in the <hi>Export</hi> of our <hi>Manufacture,</hi> and in the ſupplying us with larger quantities of the <hi>Produce</hi>
which <hi>That</hi> Countrey yields, and <hi>Ours</hi> doth require.</p>
            <p>Nor is it unworthy of remark, that the Credit and Reputation of the Trade to <hi>Affrica</hi> was then
ſo low, that tho' encourag'd by the Kings Invitation to all His Subjects, to joyn in the recovery of
it; and tho' further'd by the Subſcriptions of many Wealthy, Prudent, and Great Men, who upon a
National, rather than Perſonal Motives, purſu'd the reſtoring the Kingdom to a gainful ſhare in it;
yet the <hi>Book</hi> laid open for receiving <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> proportionate to ſuch an Undertaking, continu'd ſo
above <hi>Nine Months,</hi> ere a Stock could be obtain'd adequate to ſo large a <hi>Coaſt,</hi> where not only ſo
many difficulties were to be encountered and conflicted with, but where ſo great and expenſive Forts
and Defences were to be Erected for the ſecuring the Traffick there, and the preſerving thoſe Factors,
Officers, and Servants that ſhould be employed in it.</p>
            <p>And as the whole Stock, after ſo much time waſted in attendance upon <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> amounted at
laſt but to <hi>One Hundred</hi> and <hi>Eleven Thouſand Pounds;</hi> ſo thoſe who have from that time hitherto
been entruſted with the Conduct thereof, have not only preſerved it entire for the ſupport of that
Trade, but notwithſtanding the vaſt Disburſments they have been at in Purchaſing and Erecting
Caſtles, and Forts for the ſecurity of it, they have made ſuch improvements both in the encreaſe of the
<hi>Stock,</hi> and the enlargement of the <hi>Traffick,</hi> as thoſe parts are capable of admitting.</p>
            <p>But as all publick Undertakings, tho' firſt attempted at the expence of a few, are upon the being
improved to Perſonal and National Advantage, liable to be invaded by ſelfiſh and avaritious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who after they have declined the hazzard and expence needful either to give birth unto, or to
bring ſuch deſigns to perfection, are covetous to participate in the gain of them; ſo it hath been the
misfortune of the preſent <hi>African</hi> Company, to have their Trade broken in upon, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
ariſing by a Traffick which they had recovered to the Nation, and rendred ſafe to the Dealer,
Raviſhed from them by <hi>Interlopers,</hi> who while they purſue nothing but their private Intereſt, do
cover themſelves with the Mantle of pretended Zeal for publick Liberties and Rights.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, the whole <hi>Stock,</hi> that was either Originally, advanced, or which upon an improvement
hath been reſerved out of the <hi>Dividends,</hi> for the carrying on and encreaſing of the <hi>African</hi> Trade,
being entruſted and lodged in the hands of a certain number of <hi>Managers,</hi> you cannot therefore but
commend the Integrity of the preſent <hi>Governing Members</hi> of the <hi>African</hi> Society, and their Fidelity to the
Truſt repoſed in them, if they do not tamely abandon either their own Cauſe and Intereſt, or the Cauſe
and Intereſt of thoſe for whom they are <hi>Truſtees,</hi> and of whoſe Eſtates they are Guardians; but if by
all thoſe ways that are Juſt and Legal, they endeavour to defend and vindicate their own and the
Companies Right, to a quiet and undiſturbed Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Affrican</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>And whereas through the <hi>Companies</hi> having no other Authority for precluding others from that
Trade, but what they derive from <hi>Charters</hi> granted unto them by our late Kings, ſeveral have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29751:2"/>
taken the confidence, not only to diſpute the Power of our Kings in the granting <hi>Charters</hi> of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but have in defiance of thoſe <hi>Charters,</hi> challenged a Liberty of Trade into thoſe parts of
<hi>Africa,</hi> which are reſerved unto the <hi>Company</hi> by them; you cannot avoid praiſing the Temper,
Modeſty, and Prudence of the <hi>African</hi> Society, who from a ſenſibleneſs of their own incompetency
to Judge of the Validity of <hi>Charters</hi> granted by Sovereign Princes, and for the preventing Quarrels
with their fellow Subjects, and the obviating expenſive Suits in Courts of Law, did the laſt Seſſion
apply in way of Petition to the Legiſlative Power, for obtaining a Law in Confirmation of what they
have hitherto only enjoyed by <hi>Charter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which as it hath given occaſion, to thoſe no leſs peeviſh than clamorous Papers againſt the <hi>Company,</hi>
that led you to require my thoughts on this Subject; ſo I doubt not, but both to diſcover unto you the
frivolouſneſs and impertinency of all thoſe Allegations, upon which a certain ſort of angry Men are
endeavouring to alter the preſent Method of the <hi>Affrican</hi> Trade; and withal, to demonſtrate unto
you, that the taking it off this <hi>Foot</hi> and <hi>Baſis,</hi> will prove the ſubverſion and ruin of it.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the benefit of the whole <hi>Community,</hi> and not the profit of a few, as the Complainants
themſelves do acknowledge, is the Standard whereby we are to Judge, both of the neceſſity and of
the National benefit of all particular Commerce and Traffick, and of the ſeveral Regulations under
which they are to be managed; I do thereupon affirm, that the <hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>Affrica,</hi> can neither with
Honour to the Government, Profit to the Kingdom, nor with ſafety to the Merchant, be carried on
and upheld in any other Method, ſave that of an <hi>Incorporated Company,</hi> and of a <hi>Joynt Stock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can any thing adminiſter greater Evidence that I am not miſtaken, than that all the <hi>European</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who are Competitors with the <hi>Company</hi> in that Trade, do in this way both ſupport their Traffick
thither, and enlarge it there. For tho' it might be poſſible, that ſome Nations, either upon worſe
motives, or by meer caſualty and chance, might fall into this way of Traffick thither; yet it is
impoſſible that all ſhould concur and centure in one and the ſame method, but upon an evident im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicableneſs
of managing it with ſafety and advantage in any other manner.</p>
            <p>And as there is no managing of that Trade, but under the protection of <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Caſtles;</hi> ſo
they could never have been erected, nor can they be maintained, but by an <hi>Incorporated Company</hi>
acting upon a <hi>Joynt Stock.</hi> 'Tis only under the protection of <hi>Caſtles, Forts,</hi> and an <hi>Armed Strength,</hi>
that the <hi>Companies</hi> Factors, Servants and Goods, can be ſafe from the Treachery and Rapine of the
<hi>Natives,</hi> and from the Violence and Depredation of their <hi>European Rivals.</hi> Were it not by reaſon
of thoſe places of Shelter and Defence, none of thoſe whom the <hi>Company</hi> is forced to employ for
tranſacting their buſineſs, would ever be perſwaded, or able to live amongſt ſo perfidious a people
as the <hi>Negroes</hi> are known to be. Nor could any thing leſs, than the ſecurity enjoy'd by <hi>Forts</hi> and
<hi>Caſtles,</hi> encourage the Merchant to venture his Eſtate into a Country, where his Effects muſt otherwiſe
lie expoſed both to Hoſtility and Treachery,</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Affrican Trade</hi> cannot be ſupported to any advantage, without large quantities of
Goods upon the place, waiting for, and attending a Market; ſo nothing but <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Caſtles</hi> can
prove ſecure Warehouſes for the preſervation of thoſe Goods in the <hi>interim.</hi> Nor are they only the
ſafe Receptacles, both of the Commodities exported thither, till they can be vended, and of thoſe
purchaſed there, till they can be tranſmitted hither; but they are alſo the only <hi>Stores</hi> for Food and
Phyſick, without which, neither Factors, Souldiers, nor Sailers could be ſupply'd with the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
much leſs accommodated with the comforts and conveniencies of life.</p>
            <p>Nor can any Body of Men, but an <hi>Incorporated Society</hi> acting by, and upon a <hi>Joynt Stock,</hi> gain
and maintain ſuch an <hi>Intelligence,</hi> as may upon ſo vaſt and extended a Coaſt, either give life unto,
or procure an advantage by <hi>Trade.</hi> As perſons trading thither unprovided of ſetled Factors and Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
can neither have an extended nor a certain and conſtant <hi>Intelligence;</hi> ſo without ſuch an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,</hi>
there is no knowing what may be vended of our <hi>Manufacture</hi> in the ſeveral parts of <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
nor what may be obtained of their <hi>Produce.</hi> For as all Commerce there, is managed by way of
<hi>Barter;</hi> ſo every place doth neither take off the like quantity of our Commodities, nor afford the
like proportion of their own. Nay, it often happeneth, that through an eruption of War among
the <hi>Natives;</hi> thoſe places which adminiſter a large and gainful Trade one year; yield either none,
or that which is, both very little in it ſelf, and as little beneficial to us in another.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is only by means of an <hi>Incorporated Company;</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their Dealing and
Trafficking with the <hi>Natives,</hi> can be reſtrained to a due Obſervation of the Rules and Meaſures of
Humanity, Truth and Juſtice. For as Traders at random, do ſeldom propoſe any thing, beſides
and beyond their private ends, ſo it is eaſie to be imagined, on what Inſolences, Frauds and Rapines,
ſcattered and particular Men will venture, upon the hope and proſpect of enriching themſelves,
when there is no Common and Eſtabliſhed <hi>Society</hi> accountable for the miſcarriage of every individual.
And eſpecially ſeeing it is indifferent to them, whether the Trade be loſt for ever afterwards to the
Nation; Provided that they have by Treachery and Violence, compaſs'd before hand the Wealth
that they aimed at. Nor is it probable, that they who come ſeldom, and may be but once into
thoſe parts, and who have none reſiding upon the place to be reſponſible for their behaviour, ſhould
comport themſelves with that temper Moderation, and Juſtice, that the Servants of, and the Agents
for the <hi>Company</hi> are obliged to do, and that, not only becauſe their Factors who remain upon the
place, are liable to the Revenge and Recentment of the <hi>Natives,</hi> for every misbehaviour towards
them; but becauſe the Offenders themſelves are accountable upon their return hither, in caſe they
be complained of by the <hi>Companies</hi> Correſpondents and Agents from thence</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:29751:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nor can any Society but that which is Eſtabliſhed upon, and which acteth in the way of a <hi>Joynt
Stock,</hi> either enlarge the <hi>African</hi> Trade further, or preſerve it in that extent to which it is already
brought, and whereby it is become ſo profitable to the Nation. For as there are no Kings of
thoſe extended Territories, and of that uncontrouled Soveraignty, upon the <hi>African</hi> Coaſt, who
upon the having Reſidents from hence with them, can allow and ſecure unto the Merchant any
large and ſafe Trade; ſo there are no Cities or great Towns where through the ſetling <hi>Conſuls</hi> and
Factors, we may as is practic'd in other parts of the World, drive a ſafe Commerce for the Sale
of our own Commodities, and for the Purchaſe of theirs. But the Chief Trade of <hi>Africa,</hi> is either
managed at the Companies Caſtles and Forts where the Neighbouring Natives buy what they want
and ſell what they can ſpare, or elſe it is maintained by the ſending ſmall Veſſels to the remoter
Parts and Rivers, where by <hi>Barter</hi> our own Goods are put off, and theirs fetcht away. Both which
ways of Traffick as they are only practicable by a Company managing a Trade upon an United
and Joynt-Stock; So they are inconſiſtent with, and repugnant unto the granting every one that
will a right to Trade.</p>
            <p>Further, As there is no carrying on the <hi>African Trade,</hi> to ſuch an advantage, as may both
encourage the Merchant, and reward his Coſt, Hazard and Induſtry; but by having large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
as well as various ſorts of Commodities lodged in the Country to attend both the Seaſon, and
the Changeableneſs of Trade; ſo nothing can be more evident, than that as this is not practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
without Caſtles and Forts where Goods may be ſecured, no more is it to be effected to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
which it ought, by what is Tranſported by <hi>Single Adventurers</hi> and in <hi>Private Cargoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again as there is no preſerving the Trade of <hi>Africa</hi> without the being able and provided, to
aſſiſt thoſe Princes, in whoſe Territories our Traffick lies, with Money, Arms, and Ammunition,
to impower them againſt thoſe with whom they are in War; ſo this being an undertaking which
no Single and Private Perſon, either will or can pretend unto, it may therefore lay every think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man under a Conviction, of the Neceſſity of an <hi>Incorporated Company</hi> and a <hi>Joynt Stock,</hi> for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
the Exigencies, which the preſerving the <hi>African</hi> Trade, the gaining and keeping the
love of the Natives, and the preventing their being obliged to the Aid and Aſſiſtance of
other <hi>Europeans,</hi> and thereby coming under a dependance upon them, may crave and beſpeak a
Relief and Supply of.</p>
            <p>Moreover, As nothing but an <hi>Eſtabliſhed Company acting upon a Joynt-Stock,</hi> can either at firſt
raiſe, or for any long time maintain Forts and Caſtles; ſo were it not for thoſe upon the <hi>Coaſt</hi> of
<hi>Africa,</hi> where the Company hath both ſupplies of Men, to furniſh their Ships with Navigators, in
caſe of Mortality among the Sailors, and Stores of Timber to repair them upon decay, as well as
other neceſſaries to relieve them under loſſes, it would many times be impoſſible to perform their
Voyages, ſo that ſeveral Ships muſt be left to periſh upon the Coaſt either through want of Men
to Sail them, of Materials to render them Navigable, or of Supplies to relieve the Mariners.</p>
            <p>Finally nothing doth more demonſtrate that the <hi>African Trade,</hi> ought to be managed in the way
of a <hi>Joynt Stock,</hi> than that both the <hi>Open</hi> and the <hi>Regulated Way,</hi> have upon Tryal and Experience
been found diſhonourable to the Nation, and deſtructive of that Commerce. For whereas that
Trade, though Incorporated by King <hi>James</hi> the firſt lay open to all that would engage in it, during
the whole time of the laſt Civil War, yet inſtead of its being rendred thereby either Honourable
and Advantagious to the Kingdom, or Safe and Enriching to the Managers, the Traders grew poor,
and moſt of the Traffick was loſt from the Nation, and the little that remained, lay at the diſcretion
of thoſe who Rival us in Commerce. And whereas the miſerable Eſtate, to which it was reduced,
by every Mans Trading <hi>ad libitum</hi> gave an occaſion <hi>Anno</hi> 1662 to the Revival of the <hi>African</hi> Trade,
under the care of an <hi>Incorporated Company,</hi> and upon the <hi>Fond</hi> of a <hi>Joynt Stock;</hi> ſo that Company
through the loſſes which they ſuſtained by the violence of the <hi>Dutch An.</hi> 1664, became neceſſitated to
throw it into a more unconfined method, and to give liberty to any ſhips to Trade into thoſe parts
under the <hi>Regulation</hi> of <hi>Three Pounds per Tun.</hi> But alas even this Method, after a Tryal of ſix years,
was ſo far from being found ſubſervient to the profit of the Kingdom and the enlargement of the
<hi>African Trade,</hi> that the King upon a belief that it would be loſt to the Nation, if ſuffered to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
on that Foot, did with matureſt advice both of Stateſmen and Merchants give an <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi>
to the preſent <hi>African</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>Of which after the fulleſt enquiry I can make into its Conduct, I may preſume to ſay, That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Society hath more fully anſwer'd the ends of its Inſtitution, than that hath done. For as it
hath rendred the <hi>African</hi> Trade ſafe to the Kingdom in defiance of all our Competitors, ſo in token
of their having preferred the profit of the Nation to their own gain, they have uſed to carry out
greater quantities of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures than the <hi>Conſumption</hi> of thoſe parts doth <hi>require,</hi> or their
<hi>produce require.</hi> Nor have they ſince they were Incorporated, exceeded <hi>Seven per Cent.</hi> for One
Year with another in all their <hi>Dividends,</hi> but whatſoever they have gained beyond that, by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
and prudent management of the Stock, it hath been all applyed either to the enlarging, or
to the ſecuring of the Trade.</p>
            <p>And Sir ſuffer me to tell you, That as the loſs of 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in caſe of the ſuppreſſion of the
Company, can be no great prejudice to perſons, who for the moſt part have not above 4 or 5 Hundred
Pounds in the Stock, and who beſides their having conſiderable Eſtates in Land, do many of them
drive a Trade to other places; ſo were it not out of reſpect to the proſperity of the Kingdom, more
than out of regard to their private gain, they would inſtead of oppoſing, purſue the laying open the
<hi>Guiney</hi> Trade. Seeing there can be nothing more apparent, than that through the knowledge they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29751:3"/>
have of the Country, and by reaſon of the Intereſt, which their Factors and Servants have acquired
them among the Natives, they are in a condition upon ſuch a Change and Event, to ſupplant and
ruine all thoſe who ſhall preſume to drive the <hi>African</hi> Trade in competition with them.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, to come to what ſome men ſtile Objections againſt the <hi>African Company,</hi> I do think
it may be no rudeneſs to ſtile them groundleſs and impertinent aſſertions. For whereas,</p>
            <p>I. <hi>They do charge the Company,</hi> with hindring the vent of the Woollen Manufacture, by Trading
inconſiderably themſelves, nor ſuffering others, a tenth part of the product of <hi>England</hi> is not Exported for
<hi>Guiney,</hi> as might be, if the Trade were open, or managed by a Regulated Company. <hi>I do hereunto
anſwer ſeveral things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This Objection reflects on the Wiſdom of the Company, as much as upon their Honeſty; and
it makes them falſe to their own Intereſt, as well as unkind and unjuſt to the Nation.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis a groſs miſtake, that a Trades being <hi>Open,</hi> or its being Incorporated, giveth the meaſure
of what may be exported of our Manufacture. Seeing that depends upon what the Natives there
can take off, and give us returns for, and not upon what the Nation here can make, or the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
carry thither. Nor is it the ſelling much in one year, but the conſtant vent that either the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or the Traders ſhall grow opulent by. And this can be much better effected by an <hi>Incorporated
Company,</hi> than by particular perſons trading at random.</p>
            <p>3. The Company is ſo far from being chargeable for ſending leſs thither than can be vented, that
they had, by their laſt advices, in their Caſtles and Forts Goods unfold, to the value of 80000 pounds.</p>
            <p>4. Whereas the Trade when managed from hence by every Man at pleaſure, became both a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the Nation, and was by our Rivals wreſted from it, through our having abuſed the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
with falſe and decayed Ware, who though never ſo ſimple, yet being cheated once, they
would not be ſo twice; the Company hath not only recovered the credit of the Nation, and retrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Trade, by taking care to have all the Commodities good in their kinds, which they export
thither, but they have much enlarged it, by furniſhing the <hi>Negroes</hi> with ſuch Ware as their mean
and indigent condition will allow them to take off, and have enriched and promoted the Trade of
the Kingdom, by the Fabrick of ſeveral new Manufactures not made before in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas it is Objected,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> That the Company advanceth the Trade of other Nations, ſeeing by forbearing to ſupply the
Coaſt with Goods, other Nations fill it and beat us out of Trade with their Manufactures, when our own
would at the ſame time ſell better among the Natives, if we would ſupyly the Market.</p>
            <p>Now tho moſt of what is here ſuggeſted, be only a Repetition of what was lately alledged, and
is already anſwered, and ſerveth rather to declare the pregnancy of their Malice, than either the
Fertility of their Wit, or their integrity; yet for the ſilencing of their Clamour, as well as the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
their Importunity, I do offer theſe ſeveral things in way of Anſwer.</p>
            <p>I. That were it not for the <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Caſtles</hi> which only an <hi>Incorporated Company,</hi> Trading upon
a <hi>Joynt Stock,</hi> can maintain; Foreigners inſtead of leaving us any ſhare in that Trade, they would
Engroſs the whole. Nor is it to be ſuppoſed, that private perſons can upon their narrow. <hi>Fonds,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
againſt the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Craft</hi> of thoſe other <hi>European</hi> Nations, who manage their Traffick thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a <hi>Joynt Stock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. As it is by means of <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Caſtles,</hi> that other Nations have acquired and ſecured a Trade
upon the <hi>African</hi> Coaſt, ſo there is no hindring or abridging them in the venting of their own <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,</hi>
unleſs we can beat them out of thoſe <hi>Strengths</hi> and <hi>Fortreſses.</hi> Which as it may be unjuſt for
any to attempt; ſo I'm ſure that the laying the <hi>African Trade open,</hi> hath not the leaſt tendency to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
it. But the throwing it either into <hi>that,</hi> or into a <hi>Regulated</hi> Method, were, inſtead of gaining
upon our <hi>Competitors,</hi> or a weakning of them in their Traffick to become a prey unto them, and
to loſe our own, or at beſt to hold it precariouſly upon the Terms, and in the Degrees that they
ſhall think fit to allow.</p>
            <p>III. 'Tis a renouncing of all Truth and Modeſty, and an attempting to impoſe upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by Impudence and Falſehood, to ſay that other Nations beat us out of our Trade with their
<hi>Manufactures;</hi> ſeeing there is no Nation whatſoever, that vendeth thoſe quantities of <hi>Woollen</hi> Goods
there, as the <hi>Engliſh African Company</hi> doth. And if Men would ſo far hearken to Reaſon, as to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
a regular courſe for narrowing and abridging our Foreign <hi>Competitors,</hi> in what they are now in a
condition to ſell to the Natives of <hi>Africa,</hi> it muſt be by preventing the Exportation of our <hi>Wool,</hi>
and thereby denying them the means of <hi>fabriquing</hi> Cloaths in their own Territories at home, and not
by reſtraining them from tranſporting them to <hi>Africa</hi> when they are made, or from ſelling them
when they are there.</p>
            <p>IV. The Authors of this Objection muſt be perſons of a ſtrange Forehead, and muſt take thoſe
to whom they Addreſs to be very credulous and eaſie of belief, ſeeing the chief Complainant
Mr. <hi>Gardner</hi> well knows, that the laſt year the Ship <hi>Swan</hi> found the <hi>African</hi> Coaſt ſo well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by the <hi>Company</hi> with <hi>Engliſh Manufacture,</hi> that of a ſmall Cargo in which the Owners had a
ſhare, of twenty Sayes conſigned to the Maſter <hi>Giles Daniel,</hi> to be ſold at any place on the Coaſt,
between <hi>Cape Mount</hi> and <hi>Taccarada,</hi> yet the ſaid Maſter in 49 days ſtay on that Coaſt, could ſell
but two pieces of Sayes, ſo was forced to leave the other 18 at the <hi>Companies Castle,</hi> together with
ſeveral other Goods, for want of vent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29751:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>And whereas it is objected, 3dly.</hi> That the Company ſet what Price they pleaſe upon the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
of <hi>England,</hi> ſo lower the Price of Wool, ruine the Workers and Dealers in the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
becauſe there is but one Buyer.</p>
            <p>To this, how frivolous ſoever it be in its ſelf, and how much deſpiſed by Men of Senſe and
Thought, I ſhall to gratifie the querulous humour of thoſe Gentlemen, return theſe few things by
way of Reply.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis impoſſible that the <hi>Company</hi> ſhould be able to fix and determine the price of the <hi>Woollen
Manufacture,</hi> ſeeing the whole Trade to <hi>Africa</hi> cannot take off the hundred part of what is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briqu'd
in <hi>England.</hi> Nor therefore,</p>
            <p>2dly. Can it be ſubject to one Buyer, ſeeing there are many hundreds that Trade to other places,
who buy of the Clothiers as well as they.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> All <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> whither proper for <hi>Guiney</hi> and bought up by the <hi>Company,</hi>
or more agreeable to the vent in other places, and purchaſed by the reſpective Dealers thither,
are much fallen from what they formerly went at, and that not upon the account of the Trades
being managed by a ſingle Buyer, but by reaſon of the plenty and cheapneſs of <hi>Wool</hi> at home, and
of the great <hi>Manufacture</hi> of <hi>Woollen Cloaths</hi> made by our Competiters in Trade abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Moſt of the Goods ſent to <hi>Africa,</hi> being of a different Quality from that which is vended
elſewhre; it is not to be imagined that the Labourers in the <hi>Woollen Manufacture,</hi> would meerly
for the gratifying of the <hi>Company,</hi> concern and employ themſelves about what they need, if they
did not find their profit and advantage in it. Nor,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thy.</hi> Did I ever hear that thoſe clamorous Gentlemen, have at any time for the encouraging the
<hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> been willing to afford a higher price than others have bought for.
And were I to enquire into their conduct in relation to the Commodities they deal in, I do not
doubt but that they would be found to act with leſs Honour and Generoſity, as well as with leſs
Mercy and Juſtice, than thoſe do whom they accuſe and ſlander.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is objected,</p>
            <p>4. That the Company ruineth Their Majeſties Plantations, partly by not ſupplying them with a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
quantity of <hi>Negroes,</hi> partly by taking exceſſive Rates for thoſe they ſell, and partly by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
the Planters with <hi>Negroes</hi> that are unfit.</p>
            <p>I do thereunto anſwer many things.</p>
            <p>I. That by all which doth yet appear in the ſeveral <hi>Papers</hi> publiſhed by the Complainants, they
only ſeek a liberty for themſelves to Trade, but have propoſed no advantages, either to this Nation,
or the <hi>American Plantations,</hi> but what they do already enjoy by the <hi>Affrican</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The <hi>Company</hi> hath and doth yearly Import more <hi>Negroes</hi> into the <hi>Plantations,</hi> than the
<hi>Planters</hi> have at reaſonable Rates, been either willing, or able to pay for. And it were more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
thoſe angry and calumniating Gentlemen, to propoſe ways whereby the <hi>Planters</hi> may pay
the <hi>Company</hi> the Debts they have contracted, being indebted to the <hi>Company</hi> above <hi>170000l.</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
than to clamour becauſe they do not truſt them, beyond the hope and proſpect of any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> It is not likely that private Traders, either would or could Import more <hi>Negroes</hi> than the
<hi>Company</hi> doth. Nor is that the thing which is aimed at, but the deſign is, that the Rich <hi>Planters</hi>
having liberty to fetch <hi>Negroes,</hi> may furniſh themſelves with the beſt, and then to oblige thoſe <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
that are poor and needy, to take off the worſt upon ſuch terms, as they ſhall think fit to ſell them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> As it is demonſtrable, that the <hi>Company</hi> are both abler, and will find their Intereſt in it, to
bring more <hi>Negroes</hi> than private <hi>Traders</hi> can do; ſo it is no leſs evident, that the indigent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous
<hi>Planters</hi> will be more mercifully, as well as equally dealt with by the <hi>Companies Factors,</hi>
whoſe buſineſs it is to carry themſelves indifferently to all, than they can expect or hope for from
their fellow <hi>Planters,</hi> whoſe advantage it is to ſupplant, if not ruine to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> The great increaſe in the <hi>Produce</hi> of the <hi>Plantations,</hi> ſince the <hi>Company</hi> had the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Negro Trade,</hi> is both a ſufficient confutation of their wanting hands, and of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies</hi>
neglecting to ſupply them. For as it is by <hi>Negroes,</hi> that their ground is cultivated, and the
whole product of it Manufactured; ſo it is eaſie to conclude, that they have not been ſcanted in
hands, by the vaſt encreaſe of the <hi>Produce</hi> of their grounds beyond what it was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> Nor is it poſſible for the <hi>Company</hi> to enhance the price of <hi>Negroes,</hi> ſeeing that as they
cannot in expectation of a Market, without loſs as well as expence, keep them for any long time
after their arrival at the <hi>Plantations,</hi> and by conſequence cannot preſcribe a Rule to the Buyers;
ſo the <hi>Company</hi> not being the alone ſellers, they muſt comply with the Rates that others are willing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29751:4"/>
to diſpoſe them for. For as every Maſter of a Ship is furniſhed with <hi>Negroes</hi> to ſell, through the
<hi>Companies</hi> allowing him one of five towards the defraying the Freight of the reſt, ſo it is obſerved
that they do uſually ſell theirs at a dearer price, tho' for ready payment, than the <hi>Company</hi> have for
their own, albeit, obliged to allow credit in a very large meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7thly.</hi> As the <hi>Company</hi> would not have departed from that Order of the Council the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>Nov.</hi>
1680. by which they were reſtrain'd to certain prices at <hi>Jamaica</hi> for their <hi>Negroes,</hi> if the <hi>Planters</hi>
would have complied with the payments that they were to make, and have taken them by Lott, and
not by Head; ſo that Order was upon a full hearing at the Council the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1684. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
and Repealed by reaſon of the <hi>Planters</hi> ill payment. And yet it can be proved that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Cancelling that Order, the <hi>Company</hi> was ſo careful of the <hi>Plantations,</hi> that from the
year 1680. to 1688. they made Proviſion to ſupply <hi>Jamaica</hi> by ſending Cargoes to purchaſe 25000
<hi>Negroes,</hi> whereby the Debt on that <hi>Iſland</hi> to the <hi>Company,</hi> encreaſed <hi>40000l.</hi> more than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the making that Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, whereas it is objected,</hi> That the Company doth greatly oppreſs Their Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
by their exacting 30 and 40 <hi>per Cent</hi> for thoſe Ships, which they afford Licenſe unto, to Trade
to <hi>Guiney.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I have likewiſe divers things to Reply.</p>
            <p>1. That it is unjuſt to complain of that, as an injury, which they deſired as a favour. And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
may have juſt reaſon to take it amiſs, that what they yielded in order to prevent the clamour
of a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> and to beget a general ſatisfaction, ſhould give occaſion for a new accuſation, and
encreaſe the cry.</p>
            <p>2 As the Company upon their firſt ſettlement, propoſed by a Declaration which they Emitted for
the Encouragement of the <hi>Plantations,</hi> that they would deliver <hi>Negroes</hi> at <hi>Barbadoes</hi> for 15 pound a
head; at the <hi>Loward Iſlands</hi> for 16 pound; and at <hi>Jamaica</hi> for 17 pound; ſo it is obſervable that the
<hi>Planters</hi> after ſeveral <hi>Contracts</hi> made for <hi>Negroes</hi> upon thoſe Terms, where the firſt that departed
from being concluded by thoſe Offers, and that renounced the benefit of them; for they choſe rather
to give from 30 to 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to have ſuitable <hi>Cargoes,</hi> and to take the benefit of the <hi>African
Trade,</hi> than ſubmit to be ſupplyed by the <hi>African Company</hi> at the aforementioned Rates.</p>
            <p>3. The utmoſt that the Company have taken, doth not exceed what may be juſtly expected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſupport of their Charge, the intereſt of their Money, and the liberty of fetching <hi>Angola
Negroes.</hi> For as the Companies Annual Charge is 15 <hi>per Cent.</hi> on the whole Trade; ſo being out of
their Money about two years, it may well be expected they have 10 or 12 <hi>per Cent. per Annum</hi>
more where they give credit for Goods in the way of Trade, and whereby in all probability the
Buyers may pay the Company with their own Money.</p>
            <p>4. The Company in order to ſilence all Complaints, and to create a ſatisfaction in all Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Subjects, have this year declared, That whoſoever will buy their own Cargoes, and oblige
themſelves to Trade only beyond the <hi>Cape Foamoſa,</hi> ſuch ſhall thereupon have Licences granted them
at the rate of 15 pound <hi>perCent.</hi> And ſeeing the <hi>Company</hi> through their being at the Charge of <hi>15000l.
per Annum,</hi> for preſerving the <hi>African Traffick,</hi> do not trade at a cheaper rate themſelves, it cannot
be accounted a burthen impoſed upon their fellow Subjects to take of them the ſame terms.</p>
            <p>So that now Sir upon the whole, I do not only preſume the having given you ſatisfaction in this
matter, but I have that confidence in the Wiſdom and Juſtice of the Parliament, as to promiſe my
ſelf that ſo Judicious and Auguſt an Aſſembly, will be ſo far from laying the <hi>African Trade Open,</hi>
which were in effect to deſtroy it, that they will by a Law confirm that Right unto the Company,
which they have been ſo long in the poſſeſſion of by a <hi>Charter.</hi> And as I can be under no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
that ſo wiſe a <hi>Body</hi> as the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> will deprive a <hi>Society</hi> of their <hi>Property,</hi>
which their <hi>Caſtles</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi> unqueſtionably are, without allowing them a juſt and valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
ſo I dare affirm, That all which is hitherto propoſed for their ſatisfaction, is not only fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
and uncertain, but wholly impracticable Nor doth it ſeem reaſonable, that after they have
by vaſt Expence, excellent Conduct, and indefatigable Induſtry recovered, enlarged and ſecured a
Trade, and made it of as National Advantge, as it is well capable of being, that others ſhould
ſtep in both to rob them of the profit, and to worm them out of it. And as ſuch a <hi>procedure</hi> muſt
infallibly diſcourage all Men from undertaking any Noble and Generous Deſign hereafter: So it is
eaſie to foreſee how fatal and miſchievous this may prove to our Poſterity, if it doth not to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Generation.</p>
            <p>Nay Sir, ſuffer me to tell you, That the ſetling the <hi>African Trade</hi> under a <hi>Regulated Company,</hi>
which is the great Method, that crafty and confident Men do propoſe, and which weak Perſons are
inclined to hearken unto; will be ſo far from rendring it more enlarged and National, that it
will reduce it into fewer hands than it now is in, and will exclude many from all benefit by it, who
under the preſent Eſtabliſhment, have both a ſhare in it, and do partake of the gain and profit ariſing
from it. For while it is ſupported and carryed on by a <hi>Joynt Stock,</hi> Perſons of all Qualities, Sexes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29751:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Ages, are capable of being Adventurers in it, and of having equal Advantage by it with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Managers</hi> themſelves; whereas upon the exchanging this way of management into the Method
of a <hi>Regulated</hi> Company, not only all <hi>Females, Children</hi> and <hi>Perſons of great Figure and lofty Title,</hi>
muſt be ſhut out, but it muſt immediately lapſe into a few hands, and thoſe ſuch who are both the moſt
wealthy and opulent, and whoſe alone <hi>Province</hi> is Traffick and Commerce.</p>
            <p>Yea whereas ſome intregneing Gentlemen ſtudy to flatter and delude ſeveral Perſons of Interſt, to
deſtroy the preſent <hi>Incorporated African Company,</hi> and to eſtabliſh a <hi>Regulated</hi> one in its room, and
that upon a ſuggeſtion that the Members of the <hi>latter,</hi> will both ſupply the <hi>Plantations</hi> with more
<hi>Negroes,</hi> and at <hi>cheaper Rates,</hi> than thoſe of the <hi>former</hi> hath done, I will therefore farther add,
that nothing is more demonſtrable, than that diſappointment in both theſe muſt neceſſarily attend
ſuch a change. For as Merchants diſintereſted in the <hi>Plantations,</hi> will never engage themſelves in
the <hi>Negroe</hi> Trade, both becauſe of the vaſt credit they will be forced to give, and by reaſon of the
uncertainty in payment that they muſt at laſt ſubmit unto; ſo we may be ſure, that how careful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the rich Planters will be to provide for, and to furniſh themſelves with a multitude of luſty
hands; yet they will not judge it for their Intereſt to ſupply their poor Neighbours, either with ſuch
