            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Appeal for Judgement, Unto the Righteous Principle of God in every Conſcience, againſt the Perſecutors of the INNOCENT.</head>
            <p>A Woful Lamentation is taken up for you, who make it your work to perſecute the innocent peaceable People of God, and do deviſe curſed and wicked ſnares, to bring them under the penalty of the late cruel and bloody Edict, in malice forged againſt the Righteous, and in greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice by many of you put in execution; God Eternal judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and us in this matter. I do chalenge you all in the fear of God, one by one (I ſay, our Perſecutors) to make it appear what wrong is it we have done to the Nation in general, or to any one of you in particular, that we muſt be made the mark of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable fury, and that nothing will ſerve or ſatiate that blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty ſpirit, but an utter extinction and extermination of us all out of our native ſoil, where God Eternal hath given every one of us a lot; and as we are Engliſh-men and a free-born People, our Intereſt is as large and ample, in that lot by God beſtowed on us, as yours is who perſecute us; and we have as much right to breath in <hi>England</hi> as your very ſelves, (ſetting your places aſide) ſeeing it is given us of God, and enjoyed through his favour, and not of man. Muſt it be ſo, that except we do proſtrate that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>s Life that God hath raiſed in us through the Son of his Love, at the feet of your perverſe wills, that we muſt not abide in the Land of our Nativity, but be moſt cruelly baniſhed from Wives, Children and Relations? and except we will commit the deadly ſin (that is) to ſin againſt the Light of God in the Conſcience, muſt we be expoſed to ſeek our ſuſtenance in an unknown Land, and there to ſpend the remnant of our dayes, which are but few? the Will of our God be done, <hi>and let his Will be my Life for ever, ſaith my ſoul:</hi> But let this be unto you known, It is for well-doing, and not for any evil, that any of you can, or ever could juſtly charge or accuſe us with; and in God's fear we challenge any of you our Perſecutors, to prove our Meetings <hi>ſeditious,</hi> or that we do, or ever did contrive <hi>Inſurrections</hi> therein. What though you have a Preſident which ye urge, Is it anything to us? we are clear from henceforth and for ever from that ſpirit; and as for any falſe Charge or Accuſation againſt us concerning our Meetings, as hath been ſaid, it never could nor will be proved, that we were or are <hi>ſeditious,</hi> or <hi>Contriver of Inſurrections;</hi> Therefore God Eternal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and judge in the Conſciences of all concerning this thing, and make Deciſion, holy Father, that our Innocency may appear to our Adverſaries. And our Lives and Practives are well known unto the People of this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore we do make our Appeal to the Juſt Principle of thee in them for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our Life in which we have held forth the Teſtimony of Truth amongſt them, is of a longer date and ſtanding than yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and not a certain Sect, as hath been ſaid; for our gathering is out of Sect and Schiſm, into that Life that erreth not, and in which is no rent; And this will God Eternal in due time make known, not only to the People of this Nation, but unto the whole World. And do not call this your Cruel work of Perſecution, <hi>Execution of Juſtice,</hi> as I have heard ſome; for the Execution of Juſtice is a work of another kind, than to come with armed men amongſt a company of innocent men and women, (who are really met together in the Peace and Fear of God, to worſhip him in the movings of his Power, Life and Spirit, which is neither ſubject to time nor place, becauſe that that Life &amp; Spirit comprehends both) and moſt inhumanely to hale them out, and ſo to lead them before men appointed to ſend them to Priſon, and then to drive them like flocks of Sheep through your ſtreets unto your diſmal holes, there to remain during the wills of our Drivers; who, becauſe they would accelerate and haſten their <hi>Cruel Work</hi> begun, they even take the ſhorteſt way to deſtroy us, by cutting ſhort the time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their <hi>Cruel Edict,</hi> having a liberty allowed them therein <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ime recompence every one according to his work. And is not Juſtice perverted, and Truth turned into a Lye amongſt many of you? caſt your eyes abroad, and behold, behold, the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wickedneſs that is committed here in and about this City, of all ſorts; O what <hi>Swearing, Whoring, Drunkenneſs, Carding, Dicing, Stage-playing, Puppit-playing,</hi> and <hi>Mountebank Shewes,</hi> with all manner of <hi>unclean, obſcene, wicked</hi> and <hi>ſcameleſs Sports</hi> and <hi>Vanities</hi> are practiſed, and moſt of them allowed without controul, and as I have heard ſay, <hi>licenced by Authority.</hi> Now here is Juſtice to be done, and the Execution of it would be pleaſing both to God and good men.</p>
            <p>O take pitty and compaſſion upon the young and tender plants of this great City, who are poiſoned dayly with theſe abominable practices above-mentioned! O turn your Sword upon theſe <hi>curſed vanities,</hi> which tend to nothing but the ruine both of body and ſoul! My Life hath been bowed down even unto death, having felt the weight of theſe wickedneſſes committed in and about this City, and conſidering with ſorrow the ſtate of the Youth and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Plants of this place, who are made to drink-in the poiſon of the <hi>Devils Drollery,</hi> poured forth of theſe <hi>execrable Bottles,</hi> who manage thoſe <hi>curſed practices</hi> above-mentioned. Conſider, conſider, are theſe Meetings to be tolerated, and to enjoy full fruition of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ours to be ſuppreſſed? Are theſe more congruent with a righteous and well-diſciplin'd Government, than Meetings to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>God Eternal</hi> in his Spirit and in his Fear? And are they more for the Benefit and Profit of a Nation, than they that wholly are peaceable in all their practices, as Experience hath ſhewed, and could never be otherwiſe proved? Let God's juſt Principle in all your Conſciences anſwer unto theſe things, and give Judgment: And what you do, or may be ſuffered to do unto us, we in the Will of <hi>God</hi> forgive you; and know and be aſſured of this, we have no enmity unto any particular of you whatſoever, and to ſuch as know not what they do, we can ſay, <hi>Father forgive them.</hi>
