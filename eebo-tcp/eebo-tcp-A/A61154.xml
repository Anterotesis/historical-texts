         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

INFORMATION
OF
Josiah Keeling,
OF THE
Parish of St. Butolph without Aldgate,
In the County
Of Middlelsex, Salter,
Taken the 12th of Iune. 1683.</head>
            <p>THis Informant Deposeth and saith, That some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that His Majesty went last to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> about
a Fortnight or Three Weeks as he remembers, Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Goodenough</hi> (under-Sheriff to Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Cornish,</hi> late Sheriffs of <hi>London)</hi> did at the <hi>Sun-Tavern</hi>
behind the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> take this Informant aside, and ask him how
many Men he this Informant could procure to take away the Life of the
King and Duke of <hi>York:</hi> He having begun his Discourse with this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
by telling him that we (meaning thereby himself, this Informant,
and other Citizens of <hi>London)</hi> were like to be in Slavery, and to
lose our Charter: To which Question this Informant answered,
to the best of his Remembrance, That he could not procure any to do
that work. This Informant further saith, That meeting the said <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>
a second time, while His Majesty was yet at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> he
told this Informant, That the only way to prevent Shedding of
Blood, was to take off the King and Duke privately, and renewed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99396:3"/>
his Former Request to me (this Informant) to procure what Men I
could, towards the Effecting of it; and upon this Occasion he met
me often in <hi>London,</hi> and came down to my House. This Informant
further saith, That he at the Solicitation of the said <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and
others, did speak to divers Persons that Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> had told
this Informant there were several Men that would be Concerned
in taking off the King and the Duke, and they wanted more to make up
their Complement, which were to be Forty in number. Among the
Persons that this Informant spoke to, there were Three, <hi>viz. Iames
Burton,</hi> of <hi>Wapping White Chappel,</hi> Cheese-Monger; <hi>William Thompson</hi>
Carver of the same; and <hi>Andrew Barber,</hi> Instrument-maker of the
same: That Meeting by Appointment at the <hi>Mytre-Tavern</hi> within
<hi>Aldgate,</hi> with one <hi>Richard Rumball</hi> a Malster-man, living at a place
called <hi>The Rye</hi> (if this Informant mistakes not the Name) within
two miles of <hi>Hoddesden,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford,</hi> or thereabouts,
did agree on the Saturday next before His Majesties Return from
<hi>Newmarket</hi> last to go down to the <hi>Rye,</hi> being the House of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Rumbal,</hi> and there to effect their Design of taking off the King and
the Duke. The manner whereby they proposed this should be Effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That the said <hi>Rumbal</hi>'s House where they were to meet, being
by the High-ways side, they that were to be Actors in the Fact,
were to hide themselves under a Wall or a Pale; and when His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Coach should come over against the said Wall or Pale, Three or
Four were to Shoot with Blunderbusses at the Postilion and the
Horses; and if the Horses should not drop, then there were to be Two
Men with an empty Cart in the Lane near the place, who in the
Habit of Labourers should run the Cart thwart the Lane, and so to
stop the Horses; besides those that were to shoot the Postillion and
Horses, there were several appointed to shoot into the Coach
where His Majesty was to be, and others to Shoot at the Guards that
should be attending the Coach. This Informant further saith, That
meeting with Mr. <hi>Robert West,</hi> of the <hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> Barrister, they
went to the <hi>Dolphin</hi>-Tavern in <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Lane, behind the <hi>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>yal
Exchange,</hi> where they met the said <hi>Rumball,</hi> and one <hi>Hone</hi> of
<hi>Southwark,</hi> (as this Informant believes he was either a Carpenter or
a Joyner) and they discoursing together, when His Majesty would
come home from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rumball</hi> said, He heard that he
would come that night: Mr. <hi>West</hi> said he had heard that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
would not come till <hi>Munday;</hi> and, said he, I hope he will not
come till <hi>Saturday,</hi> that is the <hi>Saturday</hi> come Sennight. To which
<hi>Rumball</hi> replyed, I hope so too. If he do not, said Mr. <hi>West</hi> to <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi>
why then how many Swan-Quills? how many Goose-Quills?
and how many pair of Crow-Quills, will or must you have? Whereto
<hi>Rumball</hi> answered, Six Swan-Quills, twenty Goose-Quills, twenty or
thirty (the informant doth not exactly remember which) pair of
Crow-Quills, with Ink and Sand proportionable. This Informant ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either the said <hi>West,</hi> or else the said <hi>Rumball,</hi> what was meant by
those several sorts of Quills; Was answered, That by the first were
meant, Blunderbusses; by the second Muskets; by the third, Cases
of Pistols; by the Ink and Sand, Powder and Bullet. This Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
seeing <hi>Rumball</hi> the same Week that His Majesty returned
Home, told him he had seen the King passing by his House, and that if
he had but Five Men with him, he could have done his Business, and
the Dukes, for that there were but Five Life-Guard-men with them.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99396:3"/>
This Informant further saith, That the said <hi>Geodenough</hi> about a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
ago, came to this Informants House, and going from thence to
the Coffee-House, he told him, after he had pulled out some Papers,
that he this Informant must take one of the said Papers; who asking
the said <hi>Goodenough,</hi> what he must do with it? he the said <hi>Goodenough</hi>
answered, that he must take to his assistance nine or ten Men, such
as he could trust, to the end they might consult all the House-Keepers,
Journey-men and Apprentices, to see what number of men might be
raised upon occasion, either to justifie the Act, if the King and Duke
should be taken off, or if not, what strength could be made up in
Case of an Insurrection or a Rebellion: And he being told by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant,
that we were well, indeed better than any other Nation,
(that is) much happier if we could be quiet, otherwise we should
involve the Nation in Bloud and Confusion; He replyed, That he was
clearly for taking off the King and the Duke, and then there should be
quickly an end to it. And this Informant further saith, That the two
Papers now produced by him, were delivered to him by the said
<hi>Goodenough,</hi> and that the Paper beginning with these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
4. <hi>From White-Chappel Southeast,</hi> and ending <hi>Round Goodmans
Fields,</hi> was Written with <hi>Goodenoughs</hi> own hand, as this Informant
believes. And this Informant saith, That he had received a Third Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
from the said <hi>Goodenough,</hi> which he gave into the hands of one
<hi>Ioseph Helby</hi> a Carver of <hi>Limehouse,</hi> who put it into his Pocket, but
said he would not meddle in it. This Informant further saith, That
the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> told him he had divided the City and Subburbs
into Twenty Parts, and shewed this Informant the Names of the
Divisions in Writing, having, as he said, taken it out of the Map.
In the Company of the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> and this Informant was one
<hi>William Rumball,</hi> the Brother of the said <hi>Richard Rumball,</hi> to whom
a Paper was offered, but he would not meddle. In each Division
there was to be one Principal Man, to take to his assistance eight
or nine more as he thought convenient; but he Named none of them
to this Informant. This Informant further saith, That on <hi>Thursday</hi>
last he going into the <hi>Salutation-</hi>Tavern in <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi> was told
there were above-Stairs some Acquaintance of his; he going up, found
the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> there, together with one <hi>Wade, Nelthrop,</hi> and
the aforesaid <hi>West,</hi> all Barristers at Law; they called this Deponent
in Jest by the Name of <hi>Gulick;</hi> and he asking them what they meant
by it, they told him, <hi>Gulick</hi> was a brave Fellow and headed the
People at <hi>Cologne,</hi> and they hoped to see this Informant do the same
at <hi>Wapping;</hi> and they asked how their Friends did in <hi>Wapping</hi> and
what Strength they could make there: The Informant answered,
They would do well enough there, and concluded they were privy to
the Design. In this Company was one they called Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi>
who went over with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and came back with his
Corpse; as also one they called Colonel, whose Name this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
does not know. This Informant further saith, That the said
<hi>Richard Rumball</hi> in the Conversation above-mentioned with the said
<hi>Burton, Thompson,</hi> and <hi>Barber</hi> and this Deponent, affirmed, That to
take off the King and the Duke would be a Keeping of one of the <hi>Ten
Commandments,</hi> since it would prevent a Rebellion, whereby abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Bloud must be shed. This Informant further saith, That
he asking <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Goodenough</hi> on the <hi>Thursday</hi> above-mentioned,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99396:4"/>
what Care was taken for Arms, he was answered, That he need not
take Care of that, for there was Provision already made; and that
the said <hi>West</hi> recommended Secrecy above all things to this Deponent,
otherwise the present Design miscarrying, they should never be able to
Retrieve it. <hi>West</hi> further told this Deponent on <hi>Easter-Eve,</hi> That since
the Design to be executed upon the King's Return from <hi>Newmarket</hi> had failed, they intended to take the King and Duke off between <hi>Windsor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi>

            <p>THese Informants being in Company with <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi>
this 14th day of <hi>Iune,</hi> between the hours of Twelve and
One, at the <hi>Dolphin-Tavern</hi> behind the Exchange; and the said
<hi>Iosiah Keeling</hi> asking him what account he had of those Twenty
Divisions that he had made of the City, or to that effect; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That he had an account of <hi>Lee</hi> a Dyer in <hi>Old-street, Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
and that he could raise him 500 Men: And the said <hi>Goodenough</hi>
being asked by the said Informants where those Men should have
Arms and Ammunition, and also where other men that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to be Raised should have the like: It was Replyed by the said
<hi>Goodenough,</hi> That there were Twenty Thousand Pounds already
promised, which should be had upon Demand, and that the said
Money was to be distributed to the Twenty Principal Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
proportionably to the Lists of Men they brought in; or the
said <hi>Goodenough</hi> Replied to that effect: The said <hi>Goodenough</hi> further
adding, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and all his Friends would be
concerned in raising the said Money; and that the said Duke would
be at the Head of the said Party, which they propounded to be Four
Thousand in number, and that many more would quickly fall in.
And the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> further said, that a certain Colonel (whom
the Informant takes to be Colonel <hi>Romsey)</hi> would advance Eight
Hundred or a Thousand Pounds towards Paying for Arms. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99396:4"/>
the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> further said, that <hi>Wade</hi> the Counsellor of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol</hi>
or thereabouts, kept in Town two or three hundred pounds,
towards paying for Arms. And the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> being asked what
he would Contribute towards the carrying on of the said Design, (he
being a Rich Man) he answered that he had about threescore pounds in
Plate and fifty or threescore pounds in Gold, and had he more it should
all go to the same use: And the said <hi>Iosiah</hi> asking him what Provision
of Horse there was, the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> answered that there were a
hundred ready, and Men to Mount them, and if occasion be, there
should be more in readiness; and the said Informants further say, that
the said <hi>Iosiah,</hi> being asked by the said <hi>Goodenough,</hi> what Progress he had
made upon those Papers he had entrusted with him, and <hi>Iosiah</hi> shewing
him the Paper of Number Three (which <hi>Goodenough</hi> owned to have
been delivered by him to the said <hi>Iosiah,</hi> with two Papers more) and
telling him all was well enough with us, but asking him withal, what
we should do for Arms and Ammunition, he the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that if there was Faith in Men, Money should not be wanting
to buy Arms and Ammunition; and that he was to meet this night
them that were principally concerned. And these Informants say, that
the said <hi>Iosiah</hi> (being desirous to pry into the secrets of their design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Tower)</hi> propounded to the said <hi>Goodenough,</hi> that a Person with
the Staff of a Constable should bring in a Man bound as an offender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lieutenant, or Major <hi>Roe;</hi> and that at the same time, another
Person should be brought in upon the same Coulour, and by that means
secure the Guard at the Gate, till such time that a Body of Men which
was to be lodged in the Corner-house of <hi>Thames-street</hi> or the next to it,
should come to their help; For which proposal the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
the said <hi>Iosiah</hi> very much, clapping him upon the back. And
the Informant <hi>Iosiah</hi> asking what to satisfie our People we should do for
a few Arms, he answered, that the said <hi>Iosiah</hi> should have Money to
buy them. <hi>Iosiah</hi> then askt him what Gun-smith he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him to, adding whether he had not best deal with Mr. <hi>West</hi>'s
(meaning Mr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>West</hi> the Lawyer's Gun-smith)? Whereto the said <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi>
answered, that Gun-smith was a very honest Fellow, and that
he need not distrust him: The said <hi>Iosiah</hi> further askt him, saying, you
must have some Arms; Are those disposed that were to be sent to <hi>Rye?</hi>
Whereto <hi>Goodenough</hi> answered, they were not. Then the said <hi>Iosiah</hi>
askt him if they were at <hi>West</hi>'s House, or at the Gun-smiths; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Goodenough</hi> answered, they were at the Gun-smiths; who lived in
<hi>Sheer-lane,</hi> on the left hand, as one goes from <hi>Fleet-street:</hi> And the said
<hi>Iosiah</hi> asking the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> whether they went on with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Killing the King and the Duke between <hi>Windsor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi>
he the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> replyed No, because they did not usually
go together, but they would do it at the Bull-Feast in <hi>Lyon fields.</hi> And
these Informants further say Not.</p>

            <p>ANd this Informant further saith, That several Gentlemen,
<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Roope,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitton Gerrald,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> and
one other, whose Name this Informant hath forgot, who as
they said came to visit their honest <hi>Wapping</hi> Men, that this
Informant would recommend to them for such, and also to Dine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99396:5"/>
with them at some Tavern, which was the <hi>Fortune</hi> at <hi>Wapping,</hi> where
was Mr. <hi>Samuel Gibbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edmund Hunt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Ferguson,</hi> with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other persons that this Informant doth not remember, where the
aforesaid Gentlemen began to drink Healths, some of which were as
followeth: To the Man that first draws his Sword in defence of the
Protestant Religion, against Poperty and Slavery: Another was to
the Confusion of the Two Brothers, Slavery and Popery; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
askt what they meant (as this Informant verily believeth) it
was replyed, The Two Brothers at <hi>Whitehal:</hi> The next was to the
pinning of <hi>Mackinny</hi>'s Head on the Monument for burning the City
in 66. And this Informant asking what was meant, they said it was
the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> And this Informant Dining at the <hi>Horse-shoe</hi>
Tavern on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> with <hi>Edward Norton</hi> Esquire, Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Ogle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and others forgot by this Informant, they
drank the fore-said Healths, and did explain them as the afore-said
Company did. And this Informant further saith, that <hi>Fran. Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>
sent a Letter to this Informant by one <hi>Cherry,</hi> to acquaint the
said Informant, That the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> would with some other
Gentlemen Dine at the End of the Town where this Informant dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
and that this Informant would speak to such men as he could
trust, to meet the afore-said persons at the <hi>Siracusa</hi> House; There
came with the afore-said <hi>Goodenough</hi> one <hi>Iohn Row</hi> late Sword-bearer
at <hi>Bristol,</hi> with a <hi>Dorsetshire</hi> Gentleman whose name this Informant
hath forgot; also at the same Meeting was Mr. <hi>Edmund Hunt, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
Barber, William Tomson, Iames Burton,</hi> as this Informant ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believes, with several others forgot; where it was agreed we
should discourse so that it might not be understood if we were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.
Then the question was if the Foot-ball was laid down, how
many we might reasonably expect would come in at first Laying of it
down from our end of the Town to play at it? To which it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
it was uncertain, but as many as were there would be concerned;
to which it was answered by <hi>Row</hi> and <hi>Goodenough,</hi> if we would not in a
little time kick the Ball effectually we should be made Slaves; for
saith <hi>Row</hi> the Lord Mayor hath imposed Sheriffs upon you, and the
King will take away your Charter, and then you'l be in a fine condit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Goodenough</hi> spake to the same purpose; upon which <hi>Hunt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
That he could do as much good as any body, for that Foot-ball
players often got broken shins, and he the said <hi>Hunt</hi> could Cure them.
And this Informant further saith, that this Discourse was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Foundation, What Men can be raised against the Church-Warden
at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> which was understood the King. And this Informant fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saith, that <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> and <hi>Richard Rumbal</hi> told this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,
that there was a Remonstrance or Declaration ready drawn up,

            <head>The Information of Thomas Shepard, taken by
the Right Honourable the Earl of Sunderland,
&amp;c. June the 27th. 1683.</head>
            <p>SOme time before my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> went for <hi>Holland,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi>
Colonel <hi>Romsey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> met at my House in <hi>Abchurch-lane,</hi>
where the subject of their Discourse was how to seize Your
Majesties Guards, and in Order thereunto, as I afterwards at their
next Meeting was informed, the Duke, Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas
Armstrong,</hi> walked about that end of the Town one night, and
gave an account that they found them very remiss in their places,
not like Souldiers, and that the thing, provided they could have a
sufficient strength, was feasibly enough; but finding that failed, the
Project was wholly laid aside, so far as I know: After that Mr.
<hi>Ferguson</hi> told me of a Project was on foot for Destroying Your
Majesty and his Royal Highness coming from <hi>Newmarket.</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Romsey,</hi> Mr. <hi>West,</hi> and as I remember Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> came to my
Counting-house one Evening, and began to Discourse of it; upon
which I told them, that supposing they should effect what they tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of, it could not be expected that if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> should
be Crowned, but in Honour and for his own Vindication, he must
search out the Assassins, and both Try and Execute them: So that
instead of expecting a Reward, they must lose their Lives; upon
which they ceased their Discourse, and went away soon after. Some
time after this, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> told me of a general Insurrection inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in order to it, that Sir <hi>Iohn
Cochran,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bayly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Monro,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> and Sir <hi>George Cambell,</hi>
were come up to Treat with some of our English Men about it;
and that the Lord of <hi>Argile</hi> had made a Proposition, That if they
would Raise him Thirty Thousand pounds he would begin it in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> but finding no hopes of Raising that Sum, the Scotch
were willing to accept of Ten Thousand pounds: And by means
of a Letter, which came as I was informed (for there was no
Name subscribed) from one Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> to some unknown Man,
which I have forgot; Concluding then that it was intended to
Mr. <hi>Bayly,</hi> or some other of those Gentlemen, having had some
small acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> formerly by means of his
Brother, who was then a Merchant in <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and one of my
Correspondents, I came acquainted with Mr. <hi>Bayly,</hi> who told
me from time to time what steps they made in't, how he Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the Duke, Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Major <hi>W.</hi> and as I remember,
Colonel <hi>Sidney;</hi> and that he had divers promises of the Money,
and desired it might be paid into my Hands; at length he told me that
Five Thousand pounds they had agreed to Raise amongst themselves,
and that they expected the other half should be Raised in the City;
but finding no Monies could be got in the City, that Project fell
likewise, and as Mr. <hi>Bayly</hi> told me, all his Country-men were going
beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99396:7"/>
A few days after came out the Discovery, and I never saw any
of them since. Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> told me that my Lord <hi>Essex</hi> was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this business, and that <hi>Iohn Trenchard</hi> was a Man to be
depended upon in the West: They had likewise good hopes of
Sir <hi>William Courtney,</hi> and that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had sent Captain
<hi>Walcot</hi> down to him, who returned with a very cool Answer
that he found them not what he expected, but believed if it came
to a Rising, they would prove right enough, I had almost forgot
to acquaint your Majesty that both Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bayly</hi>
told me; That Mr. <hi>Charleton</hi> had once promised to see the Ten
Thousand pound paid.</p>

Sir Reginald Forester Baronet, this 15th day
of June 1683. against Thomas Lea of Old-street
in the Parish aforesaid, in the County afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Dyer, for speaking of Dangerous and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Words.</head>
            <p>THis Informant Deposeth and sayeth, That the said <hi>Thomas
Lea,</hi> being at his House in <hi>White-Cross-street,</hi> on <hi>Thursday</hi>
last, between two and three of the Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
being the 14th of this instant <hi>Iune:</hi> The said <hi>Thomas Lea,</hi>
was discoursing with him, this Informant, about the loss of the City
Charter, and other things; upon which the said <hi>Thomas Lea</hi> fell into
a Passion, and told this Informant that he was one of the number
of Ten Thousand Men, which were designed to be ready at an
hours warning, and in Order thereunto, there was Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds in Bank to carry on the Undertaking; and many
more did every day subscribe mony or engage their personal assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
And the first enterprize they venture upon, is to go very
near <hi>Windsor,</hi> and for to seize the <hi>Black-Bird</hi> and the <hi>Gold-Finch;</hi>
and that Three Hundred Men were designed for that Enterprize:
And afterwards to seize the Militia, <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and the <hi>Tower:</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99396:7"/>
But this Informant answered that he judged it impossible, the <hi>Tower</hi>
being now so very Strong; but the said <hi>Thomas Lea</hi> told him that he
had been round the <hi>Tower</hi> in Company with a Captain of a Ship,
and had found out a place where a breach might be made, which is
to be done by placing some Ships on the <hi>Thames</hi> side, with Mortar
Pieces therein to dismount the Guns; and also to bring the Major part
of those Seamen which were in Arrears of Pay to perform the work,
they being angry and in want, therefore the fitter for that purpose:
And that for the better carrying of the Design, several Meetings are
held (as this day for one) at the <hi>Kings-head</hi> Tavern in <hi>Athist-Ally</hi> near
the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> at Two of the Clock in the Afternoon: Further

John Romsey.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant saith, That in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November</hi> last, there
was an Insurrection intended by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and
That the said Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> told this Examinant, that <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol</hi>
was to be his Post, and the Examinant being asked what
Persons of Quality or Capacity to Command as Officers, were named
as intended to take part in this Insurrection; He Answered, That
he heard my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> named and complained of, and Mr. <hi>Iohn
Trenchard</hi> named by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> and this Examinant
further saith, that <hi>Row</hi> the Sword-bearer of <hi>Bristol</hi> told him, That
Mr. <hi>West</hi> had acquainted him the said <hi>Row,</hi> that there was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to Assassinate the King at His coming from <hi>Newmarket</hi> in
<hi>October</hi> last: the Examinant doth not remember whether the Duke
was there or no, but that if he were he was likewise to have been
killed (as the said <hi>Row</hi> told this Examinant) and this Examinant fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saith, That about the latter end of <hi>November,</hi> or the beginning
of <hi>December</hi> last, this Examinant having Matters of Law depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
became acquainted with Mr. <hi>Robert West,</hi> and employed him
as his Refereé therein; That the said <hi>West</hi> acquainted this Examinant
with the Design to Murther the King at His coming from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market</hi> in <hi>October</hi> last; and told this Examinant, That though it mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
at that time, it was not to be given over so, and therefore
desired that he this Examinant, Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> and some
others which he cannot charge his Memory withal, should meet
at his the said <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber, where this Examinant and they did
meet within three or four days after, to the best of this Examinants
Remembrance, and there Discoursed about the same Design, and
let it fall at that time; and this Examinant further saith, That about
the Month of <hi>February</hi> last, the above-said Persons met with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant
at the said Mr. <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber, to consider how the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
should be brought to effect at the Kings return from <hi>Newmarket;</hi>
and Mr. <hi>West,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> undertook to find out Men
for that purpose. And this Examinant further saith, That about this
time the said <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Goodenough</hi> did desire that this Examinant
would be acquainted with <hi>Richard Rumball</hi> of the <hi>Rye</hi> near <hi>Hogsden</hi>
in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> who was the Man that would undertake to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Party that should take off the King and the Duke: and that
at their desire this Examinant did consent to a Meeting with the said
<hi>Rumball.</hi> When <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> brought this Examinant to meet
Mr. <hi>Rumball</hi> at the <hi>Angel</hi> Tavern near the <hi>Old Exchange,</hi> the said
<hi>Rumball</hi> acquainted this Examinant how the Ground lay, and would
have had him gone down to see it, but this Examinant refused it. And
this Examinant further saith, That after that they had several Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to try if they could make up the Number of Forty or Fifty Men
for that purpose, under which Number the said <hi>Rumball</hi> would not
undertake it. And this Examinant further saith, That at their next
Meeting two or three days before or after the Kings coming from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99396:8"/>
               <hi>New-market</hi> in <hi>March</hi> last, They did resolve that Arms should be
bought against the next Journey to <hi>New Market</hi> in <hi>Autumn</hi> or any
other opportunity, as at the Play-House or coming from <hi>Windsor</hi>
to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> or otherwise: And that Mr. <hi>West</hi> did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to provide so many Cases of Pistols, so many Carbines, and
so many Blunderbusses, and this Examinant thinks Ten Musquets:
And that it was resolved, That there should be Arms provided for
Fifty Men at least. And this Examinant further saith, That the
Men were to be divided, some to shoot the Postillion and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
some to Fire upon the King and Duke into the Coach and
the remainder to Charge the Guards. And that there was also a
Cart to be laid in the way, by which means the Coach should be
hindred from going on. That the said <hi>Rumbal</hi> said at their next
Meeting, after the Kings Passing by his House, that there were
but four of the Guards Attending the Coach, and that if he had
had but a small number of Men with him, he could have taken off
the King and the Duke with Ease: And this Examinant further
saith, that at this last Meeting Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> was there present.
And this Examinant further saith, that he did not meet again in
five or six Weeks after with the said Company though often press't
by Mr. <hi>West</hi> that it was not fit to give it over. And this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
further saith, That this Examinant, the said <hi>Goodenough, West,
Walcot, Norton, Wade</hi> and <hi>Holloway,</hi> did Meet at Mr. <hi>Wests</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
about three weeks or a Month since; and did then resolve to
try what Men could be Raised in <hi>London</hi> and the Liberties; and
that they might be more certain, <hi>London</hi> was Divided into Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Parts; and Mr. <hi>Holloway,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> and Mr. <hi>West,</hi> undertook
to make the Division; and Mr. <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Goodenough</hi> did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to find a Man for every Division that should bring in the
certain number that they could Raise respectively. And this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant
further saith, that in the first Fortnight or thereabouts they
did very little; but the next Meeting after Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> brought in
an account of seven Divisions, which amounted to Three Thousand
Nine Hundred Men or thereabouts; and that he the said <hi>Goodenough</hi>
did believe that the remaining Divisions would afford as many Men
more: And it was further resolved at that time, that the Design in
hand should be kept secret until such time as the return of the whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
should be brought in.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant being further asked, whether he did hear
any Commanders or Commission-Officers Named to Command
these Forces, he saith he heard of no particular Names, but in
General that there were a Hundred old Officers about the Town;
that after that they certainly knew how many Men all the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
would amount to they then resolved this Examinant should
carry the Proposal of Commanding these, Forces to the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth;</hi> but the Listings not being finished, he never said any
thing of it to his Grace. And this Examinant further saith,
that the pretence to make this Levy of Men was to assert Religion
and Liberties. And this Examinant further saith, that there was a
Declaration designed to be Published when these Forces should be
up; but that to the best of his memory he never saw it nor heard
it Read, but he believes some part of it was Discoursed of in this
Examinants presence; as that touching Liberty of Conscience, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99396:9"/>
something relating to the Law and the Judges. And this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
further saith, That to the best of his memory on Tuesday last
was Sennight, this Examinant, Captain <hi>Walcot, West, Nelthrop,
Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Wade,</hi> me at the <hi>Salutation</hi> Tavern in <hi>Lombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi>
to know what progress <hi>Goodenough</hi> had made in the other
Thirteen Divisions, who told this Examinant and the rest, that
he had done nothing since the last Meeting; but that he was to
meet with some persons that Afternoon, who were to give him a
further Account: And this Examinant further saith that after they
had Dined, one that was a Stranger to this Examinant came into the
Room to speak with Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>West</hi> asked him,
if he had seen the <hi>Gazette</hi> of that day, in which was a Relation of a
Commotion in <hi>Cologne</hi> by one <hi>Gulick,</hi> and told him he should be our
<hi>Gulick,</hi> for that in Dutch <hi>Gu—</hi> was <hi>Keil</hi> and <hi>ick</hi> was <hi>ing,</hi> telling this
in a jesting manner. And this Examinant further saith that on Saturday
last was Sennight, he this Examinant, Mr. <hi>West,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> met
at the <hi>George</hi> Tavern upon <hi>Ludgate-hill,</hi> and then this Examinant was
told that a Discovery was made of what they had been doing; and at
present this Examinant further saith not.</p>

            <head>Further Informations of Colonel Romzey.</head>
            <p>FUrther this Examinant saith, that Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> and the rest
did in several Meetings since the beginning of <hi>February</hi> press
for the having the Men got ready that were to Kill the King
and Dake, and it was told him by Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Rumbal</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> that a great many were poor and could
not furnish themselves with Horses or Arms; this was presently
after his coming out of <hi>Holland:</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> replyed, he would
provide the Money; and in two Meetings afterwards he told them
he had Six Hundred pounds ready in Gold, that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on him, when they had got the Forty or Fifty Men, under
which number <hi>Richard Rumbal</hi> would not undertake it; and then
<hi>Rumbal</hi> and the rest asked <hi>Ferguson</hi> at the first Meeting w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had,
if he thought the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would not revenge the
Kings Death, and Hang those that had been the Actors; Mr.
<hi>Ferguson</hi> very freely undertook to have it under the Dukes Hand
against the next Meeting, but when we met, he told them there
was no saying any such thing to the Duke; but he said that we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99396:9"/>
must all be ruined if it were not done: Then they asked if the Duke
would appear when it was done; to which he made answer, That
a Person would be there, but he must be excused for Naming any
Names, and desired not to be pressed: I told them always they
were not to trust to what Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> said, for he was so willing
to have the most Barbarous Murther done, that he would say any
thing to encourage them to do it; such Discourse as this hapned
several times at our meetings, some saying, When our Swords were
in our Hands, if he would not protect them, that then he should
be cut off too: Such Hellish Discourses as these we entertained our
selves with, until the News of the Firing of <hi>New-Market</hi> came to
Town: And then Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> sent for most of us, and was earnest
that <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Rumbald</hi> should get what Men they could, and
that he could help them with Six, and that <hi>Rumbald</hi> should attempt
it with as many as could be got, but it was given over for that time,
because neither Arms nor Horses were ready; then he promised
that he would immediately get the Six Hundred pounds into his
own hands to provide all things in a readiness against the first
opportunity, whether at the Play-House, between <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
or going to <hi>Winchester;</hi> and said that some persons were already out
to see a fit place to do it in, and if it could not be done before that,
then all things should be ready against the King and Dukes going
down to <hi>New-Market,</hi> as Horses bought and kept in a readiness,
and Arms which Mr. <hi>West</hi> undertook to do, he being acquainted
with a Gun-smith, and upon Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s Promise that he would
procure the Money, Mr. <hi>West</hi> bespoke the Arms, and they were
ready in a very little time: But when Mr. <hi>West</hi> came and told
Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> that the Arms were ready (for six Weeks now I did
not see <hi>Ferguson,</hi> but Mr. <hi>West</hi> acquainted me with all passed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,)
he told the said <hi>West</hi> that his Friend had not brought him
the Money as he promised; also Mr. <hi>West</hi> was forced to pay for the
Arms out of his own Money, which was not repaied him as he told
this Examinant not above twenty days since or thereabouts: The
said <hi>West</hi> told this Examinant that Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> told him he might
send for his Money when he would, by a Note to Major <hi>W.</hi> but
he must tell him the Name that he would make the Note payable
to, that he might tell the same to Major <hi>W.</hi> the Name I have forgot.
In some very few days after, as he the said <hi>West</hi> told this Examinant,
the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told him, that he must not send any Body or Note
to receive the said Hundred pounds, but <hi>Richard Rumbald,</hi> because
the said <hi>W.</hi> would not trust any body else; <hi>West</hi> sent the said
<hi>Rumbald</hi> very early one Morning, but the said Major <hi>W.</hi> was gone
out of Town before he came to the House, which he went and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> with: In a few days after the said <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson</hi>
paid the said <hi>West</hi> a Hundred pounds in Gold, and as the said
<hi>West</hi> then told this Examinant, that the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told him,
he did receive the said Hundred pounds of Mr. <hi>Charlton;</hi> and about
fourteen days since the said <hi>West</hi> and this Examinant going to
Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> he told us that there was Three Thousand pounds
Raised for to buy Horses, and to maintain them and the Men in a
Readiness, that if any opportunity offered all might be ready; but
did not tell us from whom he was to have this Money, neither did
either of us ask him any question about it. Further this Examinant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99396:10"/>
saith, That to the best of his Remembrance, in <hi>Ianuary</hi> last, Mr.
<hi>Nelthrop</hi> told this Examinant, that meeting Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> he told
him that now something would be done, for that it was resolved
to send some persons into <hi>Scotland</hi> to some Gentlemen there to come
to Town, that they might know what the Scots would do, but
they knew not of a Man fit to send; and the said <hi>Nelthrop</hi> told
this Examinant that he recommended one Mr. <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> as a
fit man. And further this Examinant saith, That the said <hi>Nelthrop</hi>
told this Examinant that the Colonel and others had sent him
<hi>(Aaron Smith)</hi> with a Letter to Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran</hi> to advise him and
his Friends to come to <hi>London</hi> about their <hi>Carolina</hi> affairs, and that
a good Gelding was bought for him, or Money given to him to
buy one; as also Money was given him by Colonel <hi>Owen</hi> to pay his
Expences on the Road and also that some Money was given to his
Wife for her Maintenance, she being in poverty. Upon this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> and some other Scotch
Gentlemen, whose Names this Examinant does not know, but as
the said <hi>Nelthrop</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> did acquaint this Examinant,
they were to Treat with some of this Nation what was to be done
for the Delivery of the Nations: The said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
That the Scotch Gentlemen did acquaint those they Treated
with (not Naming any of their Names) that their people were
in very great Poverty, but very willing to set themselves at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
but they had no Arms nor Ammunition nor Money to buy
any and without they could let them have Money to furnish
Arms and Ammunition, they could do nothing. During this last
Transaction of the Scots for Money, I did not see Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi>
but Mr. <hi>West</hi> who went constantly to him did tell me their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
as that sometimes the Scotch Gentlemen were departing
discontented, and then again in three or four days that they were
like to agree and that Money should be provided for them: Often
he told me of such changes as these in that Transaction and that
Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> did assure the said <hi>West,</hi> that the Money would be all
paid in one week; I answered the said <hi>West,</hi> who would have
had me gone to <hi>Ferguson,</hi> that I would not see him until I was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it was paid, for the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> undertook much and did
nothing but promise what he could not do. There was a Debate
what Declaration should be presently after the Murther of the
King and Duke and amongst other things a Free Parliament
was one Head, Liberty of Conscience was another: That those that
had their Lands taken from them at the Kings Restauration should
have them returned. A Reformation of the Expensive part of the
Law. Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> undertook that one should be ready. Mr.
<hi>West</hi> did further acquaint this Examinant, that my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>
had been at his Chamber to Pump him the said <hi>West</hi> what we
were doing, and that his Lordship did desire to have a Meeting with
the said <hi>West</hi> and this Examinant, which neither the said <hi>West</hi> nor
this Examinant were willing to; and the said <hi>West</hi> did further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
this Examinant that my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> did propose a Council
of Ten to meet; but we not consenting to meet, the said <hi>West</hi> did
civilly put off the Proposition, as he the said <hi>West</hi> did inform this
Examinant. And further this Examinant saith, That Discoursing
with Mr. <hi>West</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and others about the Scotch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99396:10"/>
they did tell me, That the last Spring there was a Treaty with the
Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and that then without Money the Scots declared they
could not begin, but that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> broke that Designe,
not consenting to pay the Money: This Examinant never heard any
thing of this Design, until the said <hi>West, Norton</hi> and <hi>Goodenough</hi> did tell
him thereof. And this Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> did always oppose the Murthering of the King and the
Duke, and so did Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> but at last the said <hi>Walcot</hi> consented.
And this Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Bourn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>'s
Brother were at some of the last Meetings about the raising of
the Men: This Examinant saith, That to the best of his Memory he
hath here set down every thing that was said or Transacted in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
when he was there, but he was absent from some.</p>

            <p>THis Examinant further saith, That being sent by the Earl of
<hi>Shaftsbury</hi> about the beginning of <hi>November</hi> last to Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>'s
a Merchant near <hi>Lombard-street,</hi> where was the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguson;</hi> this
Examinant told them my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had sent him to tell them it
was high time to come to some Resolution about the Rising; They
made him this Answer by Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> (and afterwards my Lord <hi>Grey</hi>
said words to the same effect) that Mr. <hi>Iohn Trenchard</hi> had promised
and assured them at his first coming to Town that Term, that he could
in four hours time have a Thousand Foot and Two or Three Hundred
Horse, but now they had sent to him to know the certainty, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to them this following answer; That Men would not be got
from home on two or three days warning, but that when such a thing
as a Rising should be, he must know it sooner, that he might acquaint
Men to make Provision of Settlements for their Families; so they could
not go on at this time any further. And for this reason, and that they
heard Sir <hi>William Courtney</hi> would not stir, my Lord must be contented.
This Message I returned to my Lord: On this my Lord resolved to
leave <hi>England.</hi> This Examinant further saith, That there was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Government drawn up by Mr. <hi>West</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> which they
delivered to this Examinant, and he gave it to Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> who told
them that he heard Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> had drawn one, that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them together and reduce them into one intire one. And this
Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> told him that my Lord of
<hi>Essex,</hi> my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> and young Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> were
the persons that did Treat with the Scotch Gentlemen, and so did Mr.
<hi>West,</hi> and I think Mr. <hi>Ferguson.</hi> Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> and Mr. <hi>West,</hi> during
the time I did not see Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> told me that now they were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to raise Ten Thousand pounds for the Scots, and that next week it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99396:11"/>
should all be paid in; that was about a Month since. But they had
been with Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> the Merchant, and he told them there was none
paid. This Money was to buy Arms in <hi>Holland.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> told
this Examinant the Rising must be in <hi>Scotland</hi> before Harvest, or else
their people would not be got together; and that in four days after
the Scots were up we should have the first Intelligence and that then
we must Rise in this Town and in <hi>Taunton.</hi> My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was at
first one with my Lord <hi>Essex</hi> and the rest, but he told Captain <hi>Walcot</hi>
and Mr. <hi>West</hi> what passed amongst them, for which reason he was l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of the meetings. Further this Examinant saith, that Mr. <hi>Wade</hi>
and <hi>Holloway</hi> told him how they had fixed the matter for <hi>Bristol;</hi> that
they were sure of Three Hundred Men, and that they would Post them
in all the cross Streets, so that none of the other party should get together
in a Body or out of their Houses. By this means they should be Masters
of the Town without spilling one drop of Blood. And this Examinant
further saith that <hi>Goodenough</hi> told <hi>Wade, West</hi> and this Examinant, that
about twenty five Hundred Arms would be wanting for the Men that
would Rise here; for without they were Armed that were on the first
to Rise here, we should be beat; therefore <hi>West</hi> and this Examinant did
acquaint Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> from the rest that did meet, of the necessity of
having so many Arms. He replied, Money should not be wanting;
but how so many Arms could be bought without a discovery? Mr.
<hi>West</hi> did undertake that if Money were given, the Arms might be had;
and some person of the Company did name a Gun-smith that was an
honest Man that might without suspition have two or three Hundred
Arms, and other Gun-smiths might, if enquired after, be found, that
might lodge proportionable quantities in their Shops, and the Men should
be led to these Shops and Armed. It was said by <hi>Goodenough</hi> that six
Hundred Arms were together in the Artillery Ground, which might be
easily seized on. Many debates we had about the <hi>Tower;</hi> some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the taking of it by day-time, by sending some Men onely with
Pocket Pistols, and when the Sign was given they were to fall on the
Guard; but this was left off as not agreeing with a Rising by night;
and then the other way was to clap two or three hundred Fagots to the
Gates and set them on Fire, which would make those within surrender
and that Ships should come and lie before the <hi>Tower</hi> and batter it at the
same time the Fagots were on fire.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Do not know whether I have already in any of my Papers
where I mention Mr. <hi>Roe,</hi> acquainted the King of one
passage he told me, (but I think I have) that <hi>Gibbons</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Monmouths</hi> Footman did tell him, that nothing but
taking off the Two Brothers would do the business, and if he
would go with him, he would shew him the place to do it;
he carried him to my Lord of <hi>Bedfords</hi> Garden, where I
think he told me is a Mount to look into <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> and
said no place can be like this to lodge Men in to do the feat and
shewed him the Garden-door where they might make a Sally on
the Coach if they mist with their Fire. Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> asked him,
but how will you bring the Men in? He told him my Lord
was long in the Country, and he was so well acquainted with
the Porter and Servants that he could have the Key at any
time. The said <hi>Gibbons</hi> told Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> as if
<hi>Roe</hi> had proposed it to <hi>Gibbons,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> came to
me in a great Passion and told me what I have related, and
bid we speak to <hi>Roe</hi> to warn him of talking of any such thing.
When I did speak to <hi>Roe</hi> he Confessed the thing, but that
<hi>Gibbons</hi> moved it to him, for he knew not any thing of my
Lord of <hi>Bedfords</hi> Garden or Servants.</p>
            <p>This was to be done as the King came from the Play. I
cannot recollect whether I was twice at Mr. <hi>Shepards</hi> with
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> &amp;c. or but once; but if I was but
once, then I heard Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> relate to my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
some part of their Debates at another time, as that they had
resolved of the 19th of <hi>November</hi> for the Rising and some
Heads of a Declaration: Whether I heard this Debate at
Mr. <hi>Shepards</hi> or at my Lord <hi>Shaftsburies</hi> Lodgings I cannot be
positive in, but Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> I believe may remember.</p>

two or three, which time he told me he went to his Wife. During
the time he was at my House, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> came to see him,
to the best of my remembrance twice; the first time I was with them,
and all the discourse that passed was about my Lord <hi>Shaftsburie</hi>'s death,
and relating the Affairs of <hi>Holland</hi> and the Confederates, the Duke not
staying a quarter of an hour. The next time I was not in the room
with them. Sir <hi>Thomas Armestrong</hi> came several times in a Morning to
see him, sometimes before I was stiring; the first time I shewed him the
room where he lay, and did not go in with him, but went to dress me,
I being in my shirt.</p>

            <head>Andrew Barbers Informations read in Council,
23 June, 1683.</head>
            <p>ON Saturday morning, about the latter end of <hi>March</hi> last past, Mr.
<hi>Keeling</hi> came to me, and told me that he and some other Friends
of mine would have me come to the <hi>Mitre</hi> Tavern within <hi>Aldgate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would drink a glass of Wine with me; and there I came to
them, and found Mr. <hi>Rumbal,</hi> a one Eyed man, Mr. <hi>Keeling, Burton,</hi> and
<hi>Thompson,</hi> I sate down with them and drank; soon after Mr. <hi>Rumbald</hi> fell
into Discourse concerning getting of Arms to his House; he was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he thought it would be a good way to send them in a Barge, but he
concluded 'twould not be safe; but said, he thought that those that
would be concerned should ride with Arms themselves betimes in the
Morning or in the Night and so come to his House, and there they
should be refreshed and their Horses, till he should order them what to
do. Some I understand were to continue on Horseback, and they that
were to kill the Horses, Coachman, and Postillion, and to shoot into the
Coach were to be on foot; and he would order Carts to be set cross
the Road for to hinder them. So then <hi>Rumbald</hi> asked if we could shoot
well, I told him I could not, I never shot at a mark in my life; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
said, let them alone for that; says <hi>Keeling,</hi> he is a good Souldier
and a lusty man, what do you think of him? he made no answer, so I
answered I was no Souldier fit for that work, and said that it would be
Murder to Kill, and he said it would be a means not to Kill, but to save
many thousand mens Lives. When I had done, he said he would order
some to bring word what Coach by the colour of the Horses, that they
may not be mistaken, for this was to be as I understood in <hi>Rumbalds</hi>
own ground, for his House joyns to the Road; and he said they must
come by his House to come to <hi>London,</hi> so he said he would ingage his
Life to do it, if he had but Thirty men, but he expected Forty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for
Horses Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> said, he would get as many as he could, but it was
not concluded on, by reason <hi>Rumbald</hi> did expect to have seen more at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99396:13"/>
that place, but Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> promised him they should be ready at the next
Meeting, which was to be the next Wednesday after, as I remember,
but then I resolved never to come into their company more, nor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
with them, because I did understand there would be Murther
committed, nor have been in their company since, nor I never saw that
<hi>Rumbald</hi> before nor since. Likewise I replied, if you should do so, how
will you escape? <hi>Rumbald</hi> answered, he would fight his way through,
and separate themselves into By-roads, and make what way they could
for <hi>London,</hi> and then they should do well enough. All this time I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard that this was intended against the King, for he was never
mentioned in any respect, that I did understand, but I did verily believe
that it was meant by his Royal Highness. So we paid our reckoning,
which was I think six pence apiece, and they went towards the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi>
but I directly home, and have not been in their company since,
nor no other tending to such evil work.</p>

            <head>In the Gate-house the 29th June, 83. Major
Holmes Confessed.</head>
            <p>THat in order to the late Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>'s going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
raising a Rebellion there, he had proposed that 30000 <hi>l. Sterling</hi>
should be sent to him from hence, by some great persons, with whom
a Treaty was held for that purpose by <hi>Ferguson;</hi> but that they refused
to advance so great a sum yet, condescended to send him 10000 <hi>l.</hi> which
<hi>Holmes</hi> knoweth not whether the late Earl hath accepted of, as suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for effectuating that design.</p>
            <p>Upon his being ask'd who were the great men by whose means the
Money was to be advanced, he protested that he had never conversed
with any of them, but that he had heard often the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>
and particularly the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> named; and as to the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> he
did not remember that his Lordship was mentioned unto him in the
matter of Money, but did confess that he had frequently been told of
his being ingaged in, and a promoter of the design in general.</p>
            <p>He confessed that the Letter marked <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. is from the Countess
of <hi>Argile</hi> to her Husband, and that he was to have sent it away by the
Post last Tuesday into <hi>Holland,</hi> had he not been taken into Custody.
That it was directed for <hi>Peter Harvie</hi> Linnen Weaver (which is not a
true name) in <hi>Bow Church-yard,</hi> and was left at one Mr. <hi>Browns</hi> House a
Sider-Seller there, where <hi>Holmes</hi> usually received her Letters under that
borrowed name, but saith that he cannot decypher this, nor any of her
Letters.</p>
            <p>As to the long Letter marked <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. he protests he cannot Decipher
it, nor can positively say for whom it was to have been directed, yet
thinks it was to have been carried by <hi>Castarres</hi> to <hi>Fergusn,</hi> and by him
to the chief men concerned in the Design.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99396:13"/>Upon inquiring what is become of the parcel of Books, which are
the Printed Case of the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and in what method they were
brought over from <hi>Holland,</hi> he confessed that they had been shipped on
board of a Vessel, called (to the best of his memory) the <hi>Success</hi> of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
bound for <hi>London,</hi> and that <hi>Spence</hi> was afterwards to come in the
Passage Boat designed to have come to <hi>Graves-end,</hi> but that the wind
having been very cross, he came on shoar at, or somewhat near <hi>Harwich,</hi>
from whence he came by Land to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon asking what was meant by the Figures 80 and 81, in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
marked <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. he said he did not well remember, but when I
told him that I knew by the Cypher, Money was meant by 50, and
Officers by 51. he confessed that it was so; whereupon I did observe to
him, that as the late Earl was to have had Money, so he was to have
been furnished with Officers for the carrying on the Rebellion in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which also he confessed, but said withal, that this Letter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for his Lady, which he knew by a mark on the back, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to me.</p>

about <hi>Christmas</hi> last, on Wednesday the 27th day of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
last, (as near as he can remember) by <hi>Iohn Row,</hi> late Sword-bearer
of the City of <hi>Bristol,</hi> to Dine with Collonel <hi>Iohn Rumzey,</hi> at his House
in <hi>Soho Square,</hi> where were present the said Colonel <hi>Romzey, Robert

               <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
               <hi>Christopher
Battiscomb</hi> Gent. and the said <hi>Iohn Row,</hi> and this Examinant; where
being together after dinner, and much Wine and other strong drink drank
in the said company, a Discourse was began, but by whom this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
cannot remember, about the times being very bad and dangerous
for Sober Men, and what Remedies were fit to redress Grievances, and
rid our selves of Arbitrary Power, or to that effect; and it was there
likewise discoursed and said, but by whom in particular this Examinant
cannot exactly remember it being so long since, that we should never
be well till we were rid of two people, by whom as this Examinant did
apprehend, were meant His Majesty and his Royal Highness the Duke
of <hi>York.</hi> And it was likewise said, That if the Great People did but
agree to Joyn and Rise, or words to that effect it might be done, for
the Countries were all willing and ready; then as this Examinant doth
remember by some one, it was in the said company proposed, and as he
verily believes by the said Mr. <hi>West,</hi> that either a Deed of Bargain and
Sale, or Lease and Release (one of them it was) should be executed to
bar both Him in Possession, and Him in Remainder; by which as this
Examinant did then apprehend, was meant the taking off His Majesty
and his Royal Highness, and so he believes the rest of the said company
did also. And a glass of Wine did pass round the said Table as a Health
to the Executing of the said Bargain and Sale, or Lease and Release,
(which he cannot tell, but one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them it was.) And this Examinant
further saith, that he never was present at any other Consultation with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99396:14"/>
the before-named persons, or any others about the Death of the King,
or his Royal Highness, or the raising of any Rebellion, that this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
can remember; except that being very frequently as a familiar
Acquaintance with the said Mr. <hi>West,</hi> he hath often asked him, and the
said Colonel <hi>Rumzey,</hi> whether the great Men would do any thing, and
whether any business would be done; or he used words to that effect,
but they did constantly as this Examinant remembers answer him No,
that nothing would be done; and the said Colonel, <hi>Rumzey</hi> seemed (as
this Examinant did apprehend) to be very shy of him this Examinant;
and much like Discourse this Examinant hath had with the said <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughs,</hi>
but never was as he remembers acquainted with the prosecution
or particulars of such a Design in the least. And one <hi>Nathaniel Wade</hi>
also this Examinant hath had some such Discourse with, about freeing
our selves from Arbitrary Power and Popery by a general Rising, but
any particular ways and methods for the same, or otherwise, this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
never knew of, or was privy to. And further at present this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent

death, in the House of one <hi>Bourne</hi> a Brewer, living in <hi>Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street</hi>
over against the Lord Keepers; that it was about a quarter of a

had concealed himself, he saw him at a Merchants House, whose

            <p>I Having been often in the Company of Mr. <hi>Iohn Atherton,</hi> he told me,
about <hi>May</hi> last, that Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> must speak with me, and Mr.
<hi>William Thomas.</hi> We went to the <hi>Salutation</hi> Tavern in <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> came to tell us and then drew out some Papers, (but I
saw not what was in them) and there told us that our Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
were Invaded and that some Gentlemen had taken into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
how to retrieve them or words to that effect; and did then
ask us whether we were willing to assist, and then told us that the City
and Suburbs were divided into Twenty parts, and did desire us to see
what men we could get and told us, that we must discourse with them
about a Forreign Invasion at first and if that took, then we might
know of them, whether they would be willing to assist in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or by Money; Some time after we met Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> at the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi>
Coffee-house in <hi>Bartholemew-lane;</hi> I told him that I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
Mr. <hi>Charles Bateman</hi> and he desired to speak with Mr. <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</hi>
That Mr. <hi>Bateman</hi> told me I must have a care, and speak at a
great distance that he was willing to assist, if he could see but a cloud
as big as a mans hand and after I called on Mr. <hi>Bateman,</hi> and went
with him to a Sea-Captains, and from thence to the Duke of <hi>Monmouths</hi>
House in <hi>Soho</hi> Square. As we went, Mr. <hi>Bateman</hi> told me that the
Duke had told him, that he was glad that ever he came acquainted with
those Protestant Lords; and did assure me that the Duke was very
right for the Protestant Interest and that we need not mistrust him and
then we called to see Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> but were too late. The same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
I went to see for Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> and found him at the <hi>Dolphin</hi>
Tavern in <hi>Bartholemew-lane</hi> and I appointed him to come to the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>
in <hi>Swithens-alley</hi> in <hi>Cornhil;</hi> where he came and told me, that
they were making ready and asked me what I had done in that matter?
I told him not much, because I doubted they were not prepared with
Money and Arms, he told me that they had both. I asked him what
store of Money they had? he told me, Twenty thousand pounds, and
then we went into company, and talked no more about that affair. Some
days after I met with him again, and he told me, that he had seen Mr.
<hi>Bateman,</hi> and that he hoped he would be very serviceable, and asked me
what that <hi>Southwark</hi> man was? I told him he was very honest and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and that I had spoken with him, and he desired that he might speak
with him. I called him, and they discoursed together alone, and after
that he asked me, who that ancient Gentleman was, I told him, that he
was an old Souldier and that his Name was <hi>Franks;</hi> he desired me to
call him, and I did, and discoursed the matter, and he not hearing of it
before, was a little surprized; but said, that he was willing to fight for
Priviledge, which he thought was Invaded, but not for Religion. The
next day I went to meet Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> at <hi>Richards</hi> Coffee-house at
<hi>Temple-bar;</hi> there I met with Mr. <hi>Hone,</hi> and he had me over to the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
Tavern,</hi> and there told me, it had been our great mischief, that there
had not been an understanding betwixt the Cavaliers and us; that there
were a great many brave men about the <hi>Temple,</hi> and that the job had been
done upon the Black-Bird and Gold-Finch some time before, if it had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99396:15"/>
not been for an accident that happened at <hi>Newmarket.</hi> Soon after came
in Mr. <hi>Francis Goodenough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hone</hi> told me that I might be free
with him. We discoursed about the matter, he said they were making
all things in a readiness against their coming from <hi>Windsor,</hi> and that he
thought they must get Three hundred Horse to seize them coming from
<hi>Windsor.</hi> Some time after I met with Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him what readiness things were in, he told me that in a few days
he thought he should have an account how many men they could raise.
I told him that I had spoken with Mr. <hi>Rous,</hi> and that he could help them
to Arms for a Hundred men; and that a way was proposed how to
raise a Thousand Seamen, if they would be at the charge of a Golden
Ball to be played upon <hi>Black-heath.</hi> He asked me what the Ball would
cost? I told him, I was informed about Twelve pounds. He said, if
it were Forty, they would be at the charge of it. Then he desired to
speak with Mr. <hi>Rous,</hi> and appointed to meet him at the <hi>Kings-head</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
in <hi>Swithings-alley,</hi> and they met and went into a room apart, and
afterwards we went to <hi>Iosephs</hi> Coffee-house in <hi>Exchange-alley,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Rous</hi> told me, that he would see and get Ten Sea-Captains to manage
that affair. The next day I met with Mr. <hi>Rous</hi> at the <hi>Amsterdam</hi> Coffee-house,
there he spoke with two Captains, as he told me, and from thence
he went with them to the <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> Tavern in <hi>Thredneedle-street,</hi>
but I did not go with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I saw him afterwards at the <hi>Kings-head,</hi>
and he told me, he must have Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> go with him to <hi>Wapping,</hi>
I acquainted Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> with it, and he told me, that that business
of the <hi>Tower</hi> was left to some men, that understood those affairs
better than himself, and that they must be in a readiness to do all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I asked him what that was, he told me they must Seize the <hi>Tower,</hi>
and take the City, and secure the <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and the King
and the Duke. Sometime after I met Mr. <hi>Francis Goodenough</hi> in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
hall,</hi> he had me behind <hi>Kidals</hi> Coffee-house, and told me, that the
Countrey-Gentry were ready, and said, he desired it might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
long. The next time I saw Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> was at the
<hi>Kings-head.</hi> I called at Mr. <hi>Ienkes,</hi> and understood that he had almost
dined, and I left word that I was gone thither, and he came to me, and I
told him I had spoke with one in <hi>Old-street,</hi> and that he was willing to
assist with Money, and another in <hi>White-cross-street,</hi> that told me, that
he would assist himself, and had Arms for Ten men, and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi>
told me, that they were about Summing up their Men, and that they
should be ready in a fortnight or less.</p>

            <head>The Examination of Robert West of the Middle-Temple
Barrister at Law, taken the 23 June
1683.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant saith, he having a general acquaintance with those
of the City of <hi>London,</hi> that are commonly called <hi>Whiggs;</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last a general discontent amongst them, by reason
(as he apprehends) of the Elections that had gone before of the Mayor
and Sheriffs, and of their apprehensions of the loss of their Charter:
whereon this Examinant fearing that their hearts might transport them
to commit some extravagancies, and to prevent his own Families being
ruined by them, was very inquisitive to know whether any Insurrection
might be designed. And this Examinant after some time, was inform'd
by some persons, who at present he cannot remember, that an Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was intended in <hi>November</hi> last in the City of <hi>London,</hi> but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of it this Examinant was never acquainted with; and he heard
soon after that the Design was wholly laid aside. And this Examinant
further saith, That about the time His Majesty came from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> in
or about <hi>October</hi> last, he heard that there was a Design to seize the King
&amp; the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> but this Examinant does not know the place where,
nor the persons who were to act therein. And this Examinant further
saith, that about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>November</hi>
last, this Examinant met with Mr. <hi>Robert Ferguson,</hi> whom he had
been long acquainted with, and the said Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> gave this Examinant
an account of the great miseries the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> lay under, and
did believe the people of <hi>England</hi> would suffer the like, and Popery
over run the Nation, unless the people themselves endeavoured to
prevent it. And told this Examinant, that two ways had been
thought on (but named not by whom) one by a general Insurrection
in several parts of the Kingdom, and the other a more Compendious
and safe way of taking away the King and Duke by some surprize in
some Journey. To which this Examinant answered to this effect, to
wit, That he looked upon the first method to be impracticable and
full of hazard, the Militia, Navy, Forts, and Ammunition being in
the hands of the Government, and the people as it were naked; and
such an attempt might intail a long and Bloody War upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and must end in the destruction of the King and Duke, or else it
would be vain. And therefore the second method of taking them off
by surprize was most rational, if there were a necessity of doing the one
thing or the other. And this Examinant further saith, that after this
discourse, the said Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> went into <hi>Holland,</hi> and after his return
from thence, had several Discourses with this Examinant to the same
effect, concerning the destroying the King and the Duke; and that there
would be an opportunity shortly of doing it, either upon the King and
Dukes going to, or coming from <hi>Newmarket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Examinant further saith, That soon after the said Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:99396:16"/>
Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Rumball,</hi> this Examinant, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Colonel <hi>Rumzey</hi> (so called) and Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> met, sometimes at
this Examinants Chamber, and sometimes at other places where they
used to debate and consider of the method of putting the Design of Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the King and the Duke in Execution.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That none of the persons above
mentioned, save <hi>Richard Rumball</hi> only, was to act in person, in the said at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
but the said <hi>Robert Ferguson, Richard Rumball,</hi> and <hi>Richard Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi>
undertook to provide the persons to make the said attempt, which
persons were to be 40 at least, and 50 if they could procure them.</p>
            <p>This Examinant further saith, That there was also a further debate
what sort of Arms should be made use of in the Attempt: And it was
agreed there should be Blunderbusses, Muskets or Carbines, and Pistols;
but how the said Arms should be carried down, whether before-hand, or
by the persons on Horseback, this Examinant does not remember they
came to any resolution.</p>
            <p>This Examinant further saith, that it was resolved some of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who were to make the Attempt should kill one or more of the
Horses in the Kings Coach, and then one party should set upon the
Coach and shoot into it, and another party fight the Guards; and if
there should be occasion, a Cart should be overturned in the Road on
purpose to stop the Coach.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, that after the said Resolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-taken,
this Examinant was much troubled in his mind, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to represent several difficulties and hazards in the thing,
and the ill consequences thereof whether it succeeded or not, with an
intention to have diverted the thing.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, that after the Fire at <hi>Newmarket,</hi>
and before the Kings return from thence sooner than was expected, this
Examinant and the other persons above-mentioned met at this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
Chamber, where because they had no certain intelligence how
long the King would stay there before his return to <hi>London,</hi> it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
to the best of this Examinants remembrance, that the Attempt
should be wholly laid aside.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, that some short time after the Kings
return from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> there being a Discourse at a Tavern in the City
between this Examinant and the said <hi>Rumball,</hi> and one <hi>Iohn Keeling,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the disappointment of their said attempt, in not having the Arms
ready; and the said <hi>Keeling</hi> openly mentioning Blunderbusses, Muskets,
and Pistols, this Examinant advised him to call the said Arms by the
names of Swan-Quills, Goose-Quills, and Crow-Quills, that the Drawers
might not take notice.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, that at the same Tavern, the said
<hi>Richard Rumball</hi> told this Examinant, and the said <hi>Keeling,</hi> that the King
came by his House with a slender Guard of Six Horse, much tyred and
that six men well provided might have made the attempt and succeeded
in it.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That some short time after, it
was agreed by this Examinant, the said <hi>Ferguson, Rumball</hi> and <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi>
that some Arms should be bought to be in a readiness for any
occasion: And because this Examinant was no otherwise capable to
serve in any such Design, it was proposed to him and he undertook to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99396:16"/>
buy some Arms; and accordingly this Examinant bespake of one <hi>Daft</hi>
a Gunsmith in <hi>Sheer-lane,</hi> 30 Case of Pistols, 30 Carbines with Belts
and Swivels, and 10 Blunderbusses, besides Bullets and Flints, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of sending the same into <hi>America,</hi> but the same were not entred
at the Custome-house till Tuesday last, although this Examinant did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to have done so six weeks before.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That being at a Tavern about
three weeks or a month since with <hi>Nathaniel Wade, Richard Nelthrop</hi>
and others, where the said Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> was reading a Gazette,
wherein there were Relations of Tumults at <hi>Cologne,</hi> abetted by one
<hi>Gulick,</hi> the said <hi>Keeling</hi> came into the Room to speak with one of the
Company; and Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> in a jeasting manner called the said <hi>Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Gulick;</hi> whereupon the said <hi>Keeling</hi> said to this Examinant, <hi>What
think you for all your jeasting, if I and some few more of my Friends should
save the City Charter and the Nation?</hi> or words to this effect. To
whom this Examinant replyed, he would do very well to do so: but
then asked him the manner how he would do it? To which he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That no body should know it till they had done; but hoped he
should not be hanged for't: Upon which words this Examinant suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the said <hi>Keeling</hi> meant some extravagant thing, bid him take care
not to do any foolish thing and ruine the Protestants.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That about <hi>Easter</hi> last some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
were had concerning the making some Attempt upon the King
and Duke, between <hi>Windsor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> but no resolution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was ever taken to this Examinants knowledge or remembrance.</p>
            <p>This Examinant further saith, That there was some Considerations
lately had how to make an Estimate of the strength of the Protestant
party, in case they should be put upon their own Defence; when it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
that the City and Subburbs should be divided into twenty parts, &amp;
that some person well acquainted in each Division, should enquire into
and make a return of the number he should find; which returns are not
yet made to the Examinants knowledge: And more this Examinant
for the present saith not.</p>

at Law of the Middle-Temple, the 24th
of June 1683.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant saith, That he was informed of the Insurrection
in his former Examination mentioned to have been designed in
<hi>November</hi> last by <hi>Thomas Walcot,</hi> who told this Examinant that the same
was projected by the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and was to have been put
in execution the 19 of <hi>November</hi> last, but that he looked upon it as a
mad thing, which he had no thoughts to engage in; and afterwards
told this Examinant that it was wholly laid aside.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99396:17"/>And this Examination further saith, That to the best of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<hi>Francis Shute</hi> lately deceased was the person who acquainted this
Examinant that an Assassination of the King and Duke in their return
from <hi>Newmarket</hi> in or about <hi>October</hi> last had been intended, and that
he heard the same from Mr. <hi>Ferguson;</hi> and this Examinant asking Mr.
<hi>Ferguson</hi> about it, the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told this Examinant, that it had not
been thought of time enough, and therefore could not be done or words
to that effect.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That he discoursing with the said
<hi>Ferguson</hi> concerning the late intended Attempt upon the King and
Duke in their return from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> asked the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> what care
was taken to justifie the same, if in case it took effect, for that the other
party might in revenge shed a great deal of Blood, and immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the Princess of <hi>Orange,</hi> which would overthrow the whole Design.
To which he answered me that care would be taken about it and that
the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs and most of the Lieutenancy should be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
But when this Examinant desired to know what persons were to
be concerned, he bad this Examinant ask no questions, for things would
be managed well, as he said; and that if <hi>London</hi> was secured, all <hi>England</hi>
would fall in.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, that when this Examinant asked
the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> whether any Declaration was prepared to be published
upon such occasion? he told this Examinant that it had been considered
of and was ready, and would be printed ready to be dispersed: but
when this Examinant asked him how it should be done, he answered it
was assuredly so, but this Examinant must ask no questions.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That before this Examinant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spake
the Arms mentioned in his former Examinations, the said <hi>Ferguson</hi>
told this Examinant that he would give this Examinant mony to pay for
them, for he had five or six hundred pounds at Command, but he paid
not the money to this Examinant till about three weeks or a month
since and then paid it this Examinant in ninety three Guineys, but would
not tell this Examinant of whom he had the said money. And this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
further saith, That the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told this Examinant that
the <hi>Scots</hi> intended to make some Insurrection in <hi>Scotland</hi> this Summer,
but were not well able to do so without the assistance of ten thousand
pounds or some other great sum to buy Arms for them, which he had
hopes of getting for them and that they expected, and he hoped they
would be seconded by a party in <hi>England</hi> both in <hi>London</hi> and in the
Northern and Western parts. And when this Examinant asked him
what persons of Note would engage in it and what method they would
use; He answered, <hi>First let us sound our strength and if there be encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from that, you will not want men of Quality to take their Post, but
you must excuse me from naming of them till there be occasion.</hi> And this
Examinant further saith, that though he frequently enquired whether
any money had been paid to the <hi>Scots,</hi> he could not certainly be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that any money had been paid.</p>
            <p>And further saith this Examinant, that the Arms in his former Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
particularly mentioned were directed by the Company then
present to be bespoken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99396:17"/>And further this Examinant saith, That he hath been often in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

a Note, That if this Examinant would send to Major <hi>Iohn Wildman</hi>

was proposed, whether some of the chief Ministers of State, particularly
the Lord Keeper, the Lord Marquess of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>

they should be killed; but no particular persons were appointed

before Mr. Secretary Jenkins the 26th of June
1683.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant further saith, That some time in the last Spring,
and to the best of this Examinants remembrance, whilst the King
was at <hi>Newmarket, Francis Shute,</hi> late deceas'd, came to this Examinant
with a Message from the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Escrick,</hi> as he told this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant,
to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had a Project for
raising a Body of Men to make an Insurrection and desired this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
concurrence and assistance in it; and shortly after, the Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> came to this Examinants Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi>
where the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> told this Examinant, That except some effort
were made by the People towards saving their Liberties and Religion,
all would be lost; or used words to that effect. And this Examinant
telling his Lordship that he saw no way of doing so, that did not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the People more in case of a miscarriage, his Lordship told this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,
he had thought of a method <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>easible in his opinion, and it was
this, to the best of this Examinants remembrance, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ten men of
Skill and Conduct in Martial Affairs should meet and each chuse to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
ten men whom he might use, that every of these ten should raise
20 men, so as to make up a Body of two thousand men: that empty
Houses should be taken for these men, as near the several Gates of the
City and other convenient Posts as could be: that the night before
the Execution intended, the Men should be got into those Houses, and
acquainted with the execution; such as refused should be clapt into the
Cellars, and the rest sally out at the most convenient hour, and seize and
shut up the Gates, and then demand the Inhabitants Arms: and he
doubted not but they would deliver them and People enough come
into assistance. His Lordship named Col. <hi>Rumzey,</hi> Col. <hi>Danvers,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Clare</hi> and three others whom this Examinant hath forgotten, for six of
the principal Ten, and desired this Examinant to speak to them to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Project and fill up the number of Ten; but this Examinant
having no mind to engage in it, onely told Col. <hi>Romzey</hi> of it and none
other of the Parties above-named, who told this Examinant he would
not meddle in it, and advised this Examinant to proceed no further; and
when the said Lord <hi>Howard</hi> came to this Examinant for an answer, this
Examinant told his Lordship, that he could meet with no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
whereupon his Lordship replied he could make as good a shift
as other men, and he would trouble himself no further and came not
since to this Examinant.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time told this Examinant at a Tavern in the City, That he thought
it no difficulty with 500 Horse to surprize the King, Duke and all the
Court at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> by beating up their Quarters about break of day;
but this Examinant told the said Lord <hi>Howard</hi> it was impossible to get

            <head>The further Examination of Robert West of the
Middle-Temple Barrister at Law.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant saith, That he was informed by Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi>
and to the best of his remembrance by Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
That the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> advised the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> when he went into <hi>Cheshire</hi> in <hi>September</hi> last, That if his
Grace were attended with a good appearance of Gentlemen and
Free-holders there, his Grace should set up and declare for a Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
And that when his Grace was taken into Custody by a
Messenger, the said Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> advised that the said Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
should be killed and his Grace return into <hi>Cheshire</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
as above or else Post into the West of <hi>England</hi> and set up there.
But his Grace and the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wark</hi> were of another opinion,
<hi>viz.</hi> That his Grace should Surrender himself which his Grace did
accordingly.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That since the Insurrection
intended in <hi>November</hi> last was laid aside, this Examinant was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> that one great reason of its being laid aside,
was, that one Mr. <hi>Iohn Trenchard,</hi> on whom there was a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
for a considerable body of Men in the West, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Taunton,</hi>
would not undertake to procure such a Body, for which he was much
reproached by the Lord <hi>Grey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That some time before Mr.
<hi>Ferguson</hi> went over into <hi>Holland,</hi> the said <hi>Ferguson,</hi> this Examinant
and one Mr. <hi>Iohn Roe</hi> late Sword-Bearer of <hi>Bristol</hi> were together
at the Young Devil Tavern in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> where some Discourse was
had concerning the killing the King and Duke of <hi>York</hi> and of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Insurrection; but this Examinant cannot remember any particular
passages of that Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:99396:19"/>And this Examinant further saith, That after the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> went
for <hi>Holland, viz.</hi> about <hi>Christmass</hi> last, Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> and the said <hi>Roe,</hi> several times met and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
concerning the said Design against the King and Duke; as
also of a general Insurrection, which they distinguished by the names
of the <hi>Lopping Point,</hi> and <hi>General Point:</hi> One of which Meetings, to
the best of this Examinants remembrance, was at this Examinants
Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi> where were present besides Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi>
this Examinant, the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Roe,</hi> Mr, <hi>Ioseph Tyley,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Edward Norton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Richard Nelthrop.</hi> And the said Mr. <hi>Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp</hi>
approved of an Insurrection, but always expressed a Detestation
of the Design to kill the King and Duke, as a base ungenerous thing:
But the said <hi>Roe</hi> declared, he would be one to execute it rather than it
should fail to be done.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant saith, That at some or all of those Meetings
it was discoursed in what place, and in what manner the said De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against the King and Duke should be put in execution; and
it was proposed to be done either in the Play-house, by planting Men
in the Pit about the King's Box, armed with Pistols and Pocket-Blunderbusses,
who between the Acts of the Play should make the
Assault, or in their return from the Play-house by night under <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
Garden Wall; because of the convenience for one part of the
Assailants walking unsuspected in the <hi>Piaza</hi> and another walking
so in the Square within the Rails, and another being about the
Church-Porch, who upon the first Assault might prevent Assistance
to the King out of <hi>Covent-Garden:</hi> Or else it might be done as the
King and Duke were passing down the River in a Barge, either by
over-running their Barge with a Hoy, or else Boarding their Barge, and
shooting a Plank or two out of the bottom with Blunderbusses, and
so to sink it; but both these ways were looked upon as very hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
and probable to miscarry, and therefore neither was agreed
on.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That in the last <hi>Christmass</hi>
Holy-days, Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> invited this Examinant, and several others
to Dinner at his House in <hi>Kings-Square</hi> in <hi>Sohoe Fields,</hi> where Dined
this Examinant, Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> Mr. <hi>Francis Goodenough,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Roe.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blaney,</hi> and to the best of this Examinants remembrance,
Mr. <hi>Ioseph Tyley,</hi> and some Discourse was then had of the said Design
against the King and Duke, and of a general Insurrection, which
this Examinant proposed to them being Lawyers to call and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
them in this manner; The Design of Killing the King and the
Duke, <hi>Executing a Bargain and Sale,</hi> which was a short manner of
Conveyance: And the general Insurrection, <hi>By the executing a
Lease and Release</hi> which is a longer Conveyance, which Distinction
was received, and often afterwards made use of; but the same <hi>Blaney</hi>
was never afterward, as this Examinant remembers, at any other
Meeting.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That some short time after
<hi>Christmas</hi> last, this Examinant, Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walcot,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Rumbold</hi> met at the Salutation Tavern in <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi> where it
was Discoursed, that some Preparations ought to be made against
the time, that either the said Design against the King and Duke, or
a general Insurrection should be put in Execution: And it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>greed,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99396:19"/>
That <hi>Ferguson</hi> should be sent for Home, and that <hi>Ludlow</hi> should
be sent for if it could be, and that Blank Commissions should be
drawn up for Officers both Civil and Military and a Model of
Government; but there was some doubt in whose Names those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
should run, and at last it was proposed (but this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
does not remember by whom) that they should run in the
Name of the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ederate Lords and Commons of <hi>England.</hi> After
which Meeting, this Examinant and Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> went the same
night, to the best of this Examinants remembrance or soon after to
a Coffee-House in <hi>Popes-head Alley,</hi> to enquire for one Mr. <hi>Thomas
Shepard</hi> a Merchant, for Directions how to send to Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi>
then in <hi>Holland,</hi> and there found Mr. <hi>Shepard.</hi> And this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
by the consent of the said Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> wrote a sort of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Letter to <hi>Ferguson,</hi> to invite him over for his Health, but there
was no particular business in the said Letter; and the said Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>
sent it: But Mr. <hi>Ludlow</hi> was never sent for, nor any Commissions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
nor any Frame of Government drawn up to this Examinants
knowledge, or as he ever heard of.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That about <hi>Christmass</hi> last he was
informed, to the best of this Examinants remembrance, by Colonel
<hi>Romzey,</hi> that a design for a general Insurrection was carrying on, and
was managed by a Cabal or Council, and that the said Cabal differed
amongst themselves, and the business was like to be at a stand; but
the persons of that Cabal, the said Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> did not then give
this Examinant any account of: But the said Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant
and <hi>Nathaniel Wade</hi> agreed to draw up some few Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
which they thought reasonable, and the said Colonel <hi>Rumsey</hi> to
present the same to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> for him to present to the Managers
or the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> which they did accordingly, but the same
were rejected, as the said Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> told this Examinant, and this
Examinant hath no Copy of them.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That about <hi>Hillary Term</hi> last,
this Examinant was informed by Mr. <hi>Ioseph Tyley,</hi> and since by
<hi>Iames Holloway</hi> of <hi>Bristol,</hi> that there was a considerable Party in
<hi>Bristol,</hi> well provided for, and almost impatient for Action, and
had laid a rational Design, if they could be seconded in other
places.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That he was informed by Mr.
<hi>Richard Nelthrop,</hi> that Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> had sent <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with Letters to Sir <hi>George Cambel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran,</hi> or one of
them, upon pretence of a Purchase of Land in <hi>Carolina,</hi> but in truth,
to get them up to <hi>London,</hi> in order to settle matters for a Rising, or used
words to that effect: and that the said Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> gave the said <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ron
Smith</hi> Fourscore Guineys, or some such Sum for his Charges: And Mr.
<hi>Ferguson</hi> hath since told this Examinant, that the said <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himself very indiscreetly in the said Journey, and run a hazard of
discovering the Design.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> often told
this Examinant, that it was agreed between several <hi>Scots</hi> and
several Persons of Quality here in <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> should
have 10000 <hi>l.</hi> from hence to buy Arms, and then should Rise in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and be seconded here by an Insurrection in <hi>England;</hi> or if
the <hi>English</hi> would help the <hi>Scots</hi> to 30000 <hi>l.</hi> they would attempt a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99396:20"/>
Rising in <hi>Scotland,</hi> without being seconded in, or further assisted
from <hi>England.</hi> And that the 10000 <hi>l.</hi> was to be paid this day and
that day, but at length the 10000 <hi>l.</hi> sunk to 5000 <hi>l.</hi> but the <hi>Scots</hi>
were resolved to Rise though they had nothing but their Claws to
fight with, rather then endure what they did. And about three
Weeks or a Month since, the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told this Examinant that
Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> and Major <hi>Wildman</hi> had used the <hi>Scots</hi> ill and broken
with them after making them attend two Months; and the reason
they broke upon was, That the <hi>Scots</hi> would not agree to declare for
a Commonwealth and the extirpation of the Monarchy, but that the
said <hi>Ferguson</hi> had hopes of raising the Money otherwise, but would
not tell this Examinant how; neither could this Examinant ever
be certainly informed whether any part of the said Money has been
paid to the <hi>Scots.</hi> And this Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Iohn
Roe</hi> hath told this Examinant, that he the said <hi>Roe</hi> was acquainted
with some Scotchmen here in <hi>London,</hi> who informed him that there
were 2000 or 3000 <hi>Scots</hi> (many of them <hi>Bothwel-Bridge</hi> Men)
who were Journey-men and Pedlers in and about <hi>England,</hi> and were
under the order and management of ten or twelve Scotchmen in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
who could in a Month or six weeks time draw in all up to <hi>London;</hi>
and that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had a great command of these men.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That about three Months since
or thereabouts, this Examinant being upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> met
with Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> who told this Examinant for News that the
Marquess of <hi>Huntly</hi> and Earl of <hi>Dowglas,</hi> two eminent Papists, were
reported to be made General of the Forces, and Governour of <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
Castle in <hi>Scotland</hi> and that a Resumption or Repurchase of the
Abby Lands was going to be made there. Whereupon this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
told the said Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> That he this Examinant had a
Plantation in <hi>America</hi> where the Churchmen never had Footing,
and would go thither if he was driven from hence. To which the
said Major <hi>Wildman</hi> replied, Keep here, and don't talk of being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out, drive them out hence. And this Examinant saying, He
did not see how that could be done: The said Major <hi>Wildman</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
it may be done, and must be done, and shall be done; or used
words to that effect.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Rumbald</hi> told this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant
not long since, that Major <hi>Wildman</hi> had shewed him a Paper
in the nature of a Declaration or Remonstrance, which he intended
to have Printed and Dispersed among the People at the time of the
intended Insurrection; and that he the said <hi>Wildman</hi> had formerly
encouraged the said <hi>Rumbald</hi> in the attempt upon the King and Duke
in their way to or from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> but afterward seemed to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That after the Fire happened at
<hi>Newmarket,</hi> and this Examinant, Colonel <hi>Romzey, Walcot, Ferguson,
Rumbald,</hi> and <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> had met twice, and resolved to
let making any Attempt upon the King and Duke alone. The said
<hi>Ferguson</hi> on Saturday or Sunday before the Kings return, borrowed
Forty Gunies of Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> as the said Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> and <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
have since told this Examinant, in order to set the same on work,
but did nothing in it; and hath since repaid Thirty Gunies, if not the
whole Forty Gunies to the said Colonel <hi>Romzey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:99396:20"/>And this Examinant further saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That after the Kings return
from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> the said Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> this Examinant, <hi>Ferguson,
Rumbald, Goodenough,</hi> and <hi>Walcot,</hi> as this Examinant believes, met at
the <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Vulture</hi> Tavern on <hi>Ludgate-hill,</hi> where the Arms in
this Examinants former Examinations mentioned and the Sorts and
Sizes thereof were agreed upon: And the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told the
Company that one was employed to see for some Convenience
between <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> and <hi>Windsor,</hi> to make the Attempt upon
the King and Duke, but he never made any Report of the Message,
though he was pressed to it by this Examinant and others, being
then wholly intent, as this Examinant perceived, upon Managing the
Scotch Insurrection.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That soon afterward there
were several Meetings between all or most of the Parties abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
at the <hi>Castle</hi> Tavern in <hi>Fleetstreet,</hi> and <hi>Green Dragon</hi> Tavern
on <hi>Snow-hill;</hi> but this Examinant doth not remember any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Discourse at any of the said Meetings, other than concerning the
Progress of the Scotch preparation towards an Insurrection.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That there was since proposed
making an Attempt upon the King and Duke in their return from
the Dukes Play-House in the narrow part of the Street, but the same
was wholly rejected and this Examinant never heard of any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
designed to be made upon the King and Duke at a Bull-Feast,
nor never heard that a Bull-Feast was to be had till about Ten or
Eleven days since.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told
this Examinant that the Insurrection in <hi>England</hi> intended to second
that in <hi>Scotland</hi> would be in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> That one Party should
be up in the West at <hi>Bristol, Taunton,</hi> and thereabout, another in
<hi>Yorkshire</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> another in <hi>Cheshire</hi> at <hi>Chester,</hi> and if it could be
done, another in <hi>Devonshire</hi> at <hi>Exeter;</hi> in every of which places
some Persons of Quality would appear, but named them not, and
that the main Push was designed at <hi>London,</hi> and was ordered thus,
<hi>viz.</hi> That several parties should at once Attack the <hi>Tower,</hi> the Guards
and the <hi>Exchange,</hi> the <hi>Mews,</hi> the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and one at
<hi>Westminster</hi> should fall upon the back of <hi>White-Hall,</hi> that a Party
of Horse should be laid at <hi>Staines</hi> Bridge to way-lay the King and
Duke, if they went towards <hi>Windsor,</hi> and another Party of Horse
to way-lay them in their Road to <hi>Portsmouth</hi> if they went thither;
that the Mayor and Sheriffs should be seized but the Design was
not to be Communicated till it was ripe for Action; and added, that
he hoped the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and Lord <hi>Russel</hi> might be prevailed
with to appear in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That after the <hi>Scots</hi> were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
of the Money promised to them the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> would
have had this Examinant to have met and discoursed with Sir <hi>Thomas
Armstrong,</hi> but this Examinant refused to do so; and he once asked
this Examinant to wait upon the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> but this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
refused that also.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That though the said <hi>Ferguson</hi>
was shie of Naming Persons of Quality to this Examinant yet he
always believed he meant the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Lord <hi>Russel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Lord
<hi>Grey;</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> Major <hi>Wildman</hi> and others, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99396:21"/>
this Examinant never Discoursed with any of them himself. And
Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> about two or three Months since to the best of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminants
remembrance told this Examinant that the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>
of <hi>Escrick,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> Junior, Major <hi>Wildman</hi> and
others whom this Examinant hath forgotten were Managers of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That <hi>Richard Rumbald</hi> was
commonly called <hi>Hanibal</hi> by reason of his having but one eye, and
that it was usual at the Meetings above-mentioned to Drink a Health
to <hi>Hanibal</hi> and his Boys and this Examinant believes the Ninety three
Guineys in this Examinants former Examination mentioned to be paid
to him by the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> for the Arms were given to him by Mr.
<hi>Charleton,</hi> for that the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> had before told this Examinant, that
he should have the said Money when Mr. <hi>Charleton</hi> came to Town, and
when the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> paid the said Guinies to this Examinant he told
him he had not them in his Custody above half an hour, and this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
met the said <hi>Charleton</hi> going from him when this Examinant
came to him.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That about five Weeks since
after the said Treaty with the <hi>Scots</hi> seemed to be broken off, this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant,
Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walcot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norton, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Goodenough,</hi> and <hi>Iames Holloway,</hi> met at the Young Devil Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
between the two <hi>Temple Gates,</hi> where it was agreed to divide
the City into several Parts and to give the several Parts to several
Persons to examine what Force might be Raised in every one of
them, and if 3000 Men could be Raised for the first Onset it was
thought sufficient encouragement to venture upon an Insurrection,
and it was not doubted but 20000 Men would fall in if the first
Onset had any success; and in order to this a large Map of the City
and Suburbs was bought and hung up in this Examinants Chamber,
where Mr. <hi>Wade, Holloway,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis Goodenough</hi> divided the City
and Suburbs into Twenty Divisions, which were to be Managed
thus: One principal Man in each Division should employ Fourteen
or Fifteen under him and give them their particular Walks, so that
they might not interfere one with another and be deceived in their
Numbers. These were to provide Ten men apiece at least, so that
150 Men in each Division would make 3000 out of the Twenty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and what was over might be kept for a Reserve, but there
was no particular Method as this Examinant remembers agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to use these Men, but was deferred till the Number was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
after which Division so made the said <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> by
reason of his general Acquaintance undertook to find out Men to
act accordingly, and some short time after the said Parties above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
met at the <hi>Green Dragon</hi> Tavern, where the said <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>
declared he had employed several Persons from whom he
hoped to have a good account in a little time, and the next Week
after the said Parties above-mentioned and one Mr. <hi>Zachary Bourn</hi> a
Brewer whom the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> had employed in it, met at the
Salutation Tavern in <hi>Lumbardstreet,</hi> but this Examinant came not
thither till the company just broke up, and did not hear what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
there: And about a Week after the same Parties except <hi>Holloway</hi>
(who was gone to <hi>Bristol)</hi> met again at the <hi>Green Dragon</hi> Tavern on
<hi>Snow-hill,</hi> where the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> reported that he had an account
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99396:21"/>
of 1300 Men out of Two of the Hamlets, and that <hi>Southwark</hi> would
yield more and <hi>Spittle-Fields</hi> a great Number but had no particular
account of other places.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That about Three Weeks since
<hi>Richard Rumbald</hi> told this Examinant that he suspected Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi>
had discovered all the Designs, as well that of the intended Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from <hi>Newmarket</hi> as the other Design then on foot and that
if he were sure of it he would take care to get him knock'd on the
Head, but was unwilling to do so till he were fully satisfied and about
a fortnight since the said <hi>Rumbold</hi> told this Examinant that he had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Reasons to convince him that the said <hi>Keeling</hi> had made a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and but that he made so many Protestations and Imprecations to
the contrary he would kill him. And this Examinant hath heard from
Mr. <hi>William Rumbald,</hi> that he lent the said <hi>Keeling</hi> an Hundred pounds
on Saturday was Sevenight last, least the said <hi>Keeling</hi> should be tempted
by want of Money, which he then pretended to labour under. And
on Monday was Sevenight last this Examinant was informed by the
said Mr. <hi>William Rumbald</hi> that the said <hi>Keeling</hi> was with Persons that
Afternoon, some of whom he believed would have killed the said <hi>Keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
if he had not deceived them by many imprecations that he had made
no Discovery. And this Examinant further saith, that this Examinant,
Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nelthrop, Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Norton</hi> had
notice on Sunday was Sevenight last, by means of the said <hi>Keeling</hi>'s
Brother that the said <hi>Keeling</hi> had made a Discovery, and thereupon
they resolved to meet early the next morning in order to their Escapes
and according to their appointment met in <hi>Goodmans-Fields,</hi> where they
endeavoured to hire a Boat for <hi>Holland,</hi> whither all except this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
were resolved to go, but by reason they could not get clear of
<hi>Gravesend</hi> before five or six a Clock on Tuesday Night, and so might
be taken, they laid aside that Design and every one shifted for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That when this Examinant was
much dejected, and refused to go for <hi>Holland,</hi> most of the Company and
particularly Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> looked wistfully in this Examinant's Face,
as if they suspected Treachery in this Examinant. Whereupon this
Examinant told the said Col. <hi>Romzey,</hi> this Examinant if he were taken,
would not save his Life unjustly, and instanced that he had never spoke
with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and could say nothing against him and
would not do Injustice to the Colonel but rather give his Right-hand to
serve him; which Complement the Colonel returned and so parted and
there was no agreement between all or any the Parties above-named to
favour one another and further this Examinant saith not.</p>

            <head>The further Examination of Robert West of the
Middle-Temple Barrister at Law before the
Lord Keeper the 27 June 1683.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Richard Rumbald</hi> and
a party of his Friends about Ten years since designed and
were prepared to have killed the King and Duke of <hi>York</hi> in
their Journey to or from <hi>Newmarket</hi> and lay in Ambush for that
end, but the King and Duke went an unusual Road through the
Forest that time, which they never went before or since, and
so escaped them; and the said <hi>Rumbald</hi> also told this Examinant that
he once had a mind to have taken one of the Cellars under the
Duke's Play-house, and by placing Barrels of Powder there have
Blown up the Play-house when the King and Duke were there;
but the consideration that a great number of other innocent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
must have perished in it diverted him from it, though a Friend
to whom he communicated the design endeavoured to over-rule that
objection by saying, <hi>What have the Iack-Daws to do amongst the
Rooks?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That at some Meeting before
or about <hi>Christmass</hi> last there was a discourse concerning Surprizing
some Garrisons in case of an Insurrection and it was proposed for
<hi>Portsmouth,</hi> that some Gentlemen should go into the Town and
Treat the Officers of the Garrison who in that bad Air were apt to
accept of an Invitation and drink plentifully, and that in the height of
their drinking a party of Men who might be brought into Town on
a Market-day in Country mens Habits should Surprize the Guards, who
likewise to that end should be Treated and it was thought the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who were uneasie under the Insolencies of the Garrison would be
apt to close in and assist in the Enterprize. <hi>Pendennis</hi> Castle was also
mentioned as a place naked and easily seized and that might be of great
use: And this Examinant doth not remember any thing said about
<hi>Hull,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> lately told this Examinant, that he had good as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances
of having <hi>Newcastle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That after the intended Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in <hi>November</hi> last was laid aside, <hi>Ferguson</hi> to the best of this
Examinants remembrance told this Examinant that the Lord <hi>Shafis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
had sent Mr. <hi>Walcot</hi> to Sir <hi>Wiliiam Courtney</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> to
engage him in an Insurrection and to joyn with some Person of
Quality if it should be thought fit to send one thither, but Mr.
<hi>Walcot</hi> returned without any incouragement from Sir <hi>William Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi>
And though this Examinant knew that the said Mr. <hi>Walcot</hi>
took a Journey into <hi>Devonshire,</hi> yet the said Mr. <hi>Walcot</hi> kept the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of it close from this Examinant and would own only making a
visit to a Friend.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That the Places usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
on for places of Rendezvous in case of an Insurrection in
<hi>London,</hi> were Saint <hi>Iames-Square, Covent-Garden, Lincolns-Inn-Fields,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99396:22"/>
Smithfield,</hi> the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> St. <hi>Georges Fields</hi> in <hi>Southwark,
Goodmans-Field, Spittle-Fields</hi> and <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> where the Arms in the
Artillery Ground were to be Seized.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> told this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant,
That he had Discoursed with one Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi> a Tobacconist,
an Anabaptist Preacher, a great Ringleader of the Anabaptists; and
that the said <hi>Hicks</hi> had told him, that the Anabaptists could, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
upon a good consideration would make up an Army of 20000
Men, and 1500 of the 20000 would be Horse; and though perhaps there
would be a necessity of making use of some great Men at the beginning
(and this Examinant thinks he mentioned the Duke of <hi>Monmouth)</hi> yet
when the Anabaptists were once up, they would not lay down their
Arms, till they had their own terms.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That to the best of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
he was informed by Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> that the Managers of
the general Insurrection had one or more Meetings at the House of
Mr. <hi>Thomas Shepard</hi> Merchant in <hi>Abchurch-Lane,</hi> or St. <hi>Clements-Lane</hi>
in <hi>Lumbard-steet, London;</hi> and that if the Money were paid to the
<hi>Scots,</hi> the said Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> was to return it into <hi>Holland:</hi> and this
Examinant, to the best of his remembrance, once to twice asked
Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> whether any Money were paid? who answered, it was
promised several times, but he had not any assurance of its being
paid. And this Examinant believes, the said Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> did know
of the intended Assassination of the King and Duke, but doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that this Examinant had any particular Discourse with the
said Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> about it, the said <hi>Shepard</hi> having failed to meet this
Examinant, Col. <hi>Romzey,</hi> and others, several times when he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to do so.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> to the best of
this Examinant's remembrance, told this Examinant since the King went
to <hi>Windsor,</hi> that there had been some thoughts of Surprizing <hi>Windsor</hi>
with 500 Horse, but upon consideration, it seemed impracticable, but
he named no Persons to this Examinant.</p>
            <p>And the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> desired this Examinant, to speak to Mr. <hi>Richard
Goodenough</hi> to meet Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> which this Examinant did;
and this Examinant believes, the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Armstrong,</hi>
have had several Meetings, and the said <hi>Goodenough</hi> hath Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> the design last carrying on for Raising 3000
Men out of the Twenty Divisions of the City and Suburbs, and the
Progress that was made in it.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That at one of the Meetings
concerning the last mentioned Design, Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
one Man (but would not name him) would undertake to bring
1000 Men out of the Hamlets, and if occasion were to give satisfaction,
he would shew them all a Footbal Match or other Pastime, but the
said <hi>Goodenough</hi> reported withal, that he found most Persons insist upon
terms, and required to know what ease and advantage they should
have in matters of Religion, their Liberties and Properties, and what
assurance they should have of their being performed before they would
actually engage in Arms, for they would not Fight to change Persons
only, but Things; But whether any thing was done in order to give
them such satisfaction, this Examinant knows not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:99396:23"/>And this Examinant further saith, That the fundamentals in this
Examinant's last Examination mentioned to be prepared by Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi>
Col. <hi>Romzey,</hi> and this Examinant, were only rough drawn up by the
said Mr. <hi>VVade</hi>'s own Hand; and this Examinant did not write them,
nor had any Copy of them, because if they had been approved of,
it was intended to have drawn them into form, and therefore this
Examinant cannot set them forth exactly, but to the best of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant's
remembrance, the substance of them was to the effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>1. That the People should annually meet at a certain time to
Choose Members of Parliament, without any Writ or particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to do so.</p>
            <p>2. That the Parliament should Meet at, and Sit for a stated time,
and not be Dissolved, Prorogued or Adjourned, but by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and that no Prorogation or Adjournment should hinder their
Meeting before the day, to which they were Prorogued or Adjourned,
if there were occasion.</p>
            <p>3. That the Parliament should consist of a House of Lords, and a
House of Commons, but the exact number of both or either of them,
this Examinant doth not remember.</p>
            <p>4. That only such Nobility should be Hereditary as were assisting
in this Design, the rest should be only for Life, and upon their Death
the House of Lords be supplied from time to time with new ones out
of the House of Commons, but whether by the Election of the Lords,
or of the Prince, this Examinant doth not remember.</p>
            <p>5. The Militia should be in the Parliament, and the Parliament
have the Nomination if not the Election of all Judges, Sheriffs,
Justices of the Peace, and other greater or lesser Officers Civil or
Military.</p>
            <p>6. That what Acts passed in both Houses should be a Law for one
Year without the Prince's Consent, and what Acts passed both Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ses
in two several Parliaments should be a Perpetual Law without his
Consent.</p>
            <p>7. That a Council to the Prince should be Elected out of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
a certain Number of the Lords to be Elected by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and a certain Number of the Commons to be Elected by the
Lords, but the Number of the Council, or of either Lords or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to be of it, this Examinant doth not remember.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That before the said <hi>Ferguson</hi>
went for <hi>Holland</hi> this Examinant pressing him to know, whether the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> were acquainted with the Design against the
King and Duke, and would not Hang all Persons concerned in it, if
it succeeded, the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> said, <hi>what if I get it under his Hand,
that he shall not?</hi> To which this Examinant answered, <hi>It would be
sufficient Satisfaction;</hi> but when the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> returned from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and this Examinant pressed him again to have Security fit to be
relied on, he asked this Examinant, <hi>Whether that were fit to be proposed
to the Duke?</hi> And this Examinant saying, <hi>If he durst not propose it,
he thought other Men ought not to venture upon it:</hi> Whereupon the
said <hi>Ferguson</hi> said, <hi>That he had mentione<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> something concerning the King
to the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>but not Assassinating him;</hi> to which the
Duke Answered somewhat sternly, <hi>You must look upon me in the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of a Son;</hi> Which answer for some time dampt the Design, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99396:23"/>
alwayes clog'd it: But at length it was resolved, that if the Duke
did prosecute the Actors in it, that the Duke himself should be killed
if it could be done. And this Examinant believes Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi>
was present at, or made acquainted by this Examinant with the said
Discourse.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That the said <hi>Ferguson,</hi> to the
best of his remembrance, told this Examinant, that some thoughts
had been formerly of making an Attempt upon the King and Duke
the last <hi>Lord Mayors</hi> Day, either going out of the Coach into <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi>
or in the Hall at Dinner (which might be done with Men
with Swords only) or in their return from thence at <hi>Ludgate,</hi> or
<hi>Pauls-Church-Yard,</hi> but for the great hazards in either of these wayes,
nothing was resolved on.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That this Examinant perceiving
that little or no preparations were made for the last Designed Attempt
in the <hi>Newmarket-</hi>Journey, told the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> of it, to which the
said <hi>Ferguson</hi> answered; That he should have a Sum of Money for
it when things were fixt, but not else, for a Sum had been Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a Mans hand (but named not whose) for the former designed
Attempt in the <hi>October</hi> Journey, and though it was not made use
of, it was not returned, and there was no asking for such Money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
And this Examinant further saith, That at one of the Meetings
concerning the Attempt upon the King and Duke, this Examinant
propos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to the said <hi>Ferguson,</hi> that some of the Duke of <hi>Monmouths</hi>
Servants or Dependants should be brought into the Action, which
might be some security to the Persons engaged, or at least make
the World think the Duke concerned in it, if he were not. But
Mr. <hi>Rumbald</hi> did not care to engage with any of them, however
this Examinant believes the said Proposal had been Communicated
to some of them, for that this Examinant was told (to the best of
his remembrance) either by Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> or Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> that Sir
<hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> offered to engage, if Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> would; but
the Colonel refused, and that in case of a general Insurrection, Sir
<hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> would the night before it attempt to kill the Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> by going to him with a pretence to discover some <hi>Plot</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant was informed by Mr. <hi>Iohn Roe,</hi> That one Mr.
<hi>Gibbons,</hi> who was or had been a Servant to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et the said <hi>Roe</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> or carried him thither, and there
told the said <hi>Roe,</hi> that was a Convenient place to do the Trick in
(by which this Examinant understood the Attempt upon the King
and Duke) and that he the said <hi>Gibbons</hi> would engage to be one
in it.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That about a fortnight before
the Kings return from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> when the Attempt was resolved
on to be made, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> told this Examinant, That the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and several Lords should be invited into the City to
a Dinner the same day that the King was to return, so as they
might be ready to appear in the City upon the Arrival of the News,
and the said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told this Examinant, that some preferment
was designed for this Examinant, and desired this Examinant to
consider and give a Note of such Lawyers as this Examinant
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99396:24"/>
thought fit to be, and would accept of being Judges; but this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
only smiled at his vanity, and never gave the said <hi>Ferguson</hi>
any such account.</p>

            <head>The further Examination of Robert West of the
Middle-Temple, Barrister at Law.</head>
            <p>AND this Examinant further saith, That at one of the Meetings
held for managing the business of the Assassination of
the King and Duke in their <hi>Newmarket</hi>-Journy, there was
some Discourse about getting the Arms down to Mr. <hi>Rumbald's</hi>
House, and the said <hi>Rumbald</hi> first proposed to put them up in long
Chests, and send them down by some Empty Carts from <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
and afterwards he thought to make use of two trusty Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of his acquaintance, who should lay them in the Boat, and
carry Oysters over them (as sometimes they used to carry Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters)
up <hi>Ware</hi>-River, and land them at, or near his own
House; or else every Man was to carry his own Arms under long
Coats: But no particular way was resolved on, but such was to be
used, as should appear most safe: and at the same or some other
Meeting for the same purpose, it was discoursed how the Men
should get down unobserved, and it was thought best that they
should go from <hi>London</hi> in the Evening, in small numbers, so as to
arrive at the place about Midnight, and go into an empty House near
<hi>Rumbald</hi>'s own House, where their Horses should be put into a Barn,
and be refreshed; and <hi>Rumbald</hi> was to send away his Servants early
to Market, and his Wife and Daughter he resolved to Lock up above
Stairs: But the greatest difficulty was, how these Men should get off
after the Business was done; the Road might be full, and the party
Cut off by some force that might come from <hi>London,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Rumbald</hi> proposed, that if he surviv'd the Action, or were not
disabled in it, to bring them a back way over the Meadows, and
over <hi>Hackney-Marsh</hi> (to the best of this Examinant's remembrance)
which he said was a very good way, and all of it to be Gallopped,
and by that meas they might get to <hi>London</hi> as soon as the news could.
Or else the said <hi>Rumbald</hi> offered that the party should retire into his
own Yard, which was Walled in with a high Wall, and Moated
round, which he would undertake to defend against any Force that
could assault them, and before night he thought all would be disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and shifting for themselves, and the Road be clear to <hi>London,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:99396:24"/>
but which Course he would take, was left to his Discretion, as the
Circumstances of the Case should require.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That the several wayes proposed
to surprize and take the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> were these, to the best of
this Examinant's remembrance; One was so send ten or twelve Men
Armed with Pistols, Pocket-Daggers, and Pocket-Blunderbusses into
the <hi>Tower,</hi> under pretence of seeing the Armory; another number
should go to see the <hi>Lyons,</hi> who by reason of their not going into
the inner Gate, were not to have their Swords taken from them; that
the persons who went to see the Armory, should return into the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
or Sutlers House just within the Gate, and there Eat and Drink
till the time for the Attempt was come; that some persons should
come in a Mourning Coach, or some Gentlemans Coach, to be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
for this occasion, under pretence of making a visit to some of
the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and just within the Gate some of the persons
issuing out of the Tavern should kill one of the Horses, and overturn
the Coach so as the Gate could not be shut; and the rest of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
within, and those who went to see the <hi>Lyons,</hi> should set upon the
Guards, that upon a Signal of the Coach driving down, a party
of Men (two or three Hundred or more if they could be got, and
were to be lodged in empty Houses to be hired for that purpose, as
near the <hi>Tower</hi> as could be had) should be ready to rush out, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the noise of the first shot, immediately run down to the Gate,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> break in. This way if at all put in Execution, was to be in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> time about two a Clock, because after dinner the Officers are
usually dispersed or engaged in drinking, and the Souldiers loytering
from their Arms.</p>
            <p>Another way proposed was, that several Men should enter Actions
against one another in St. <hi>Katherine's</hi> Court held for the <hi>Tower</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
within the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that at the Court-day, at which time great
Liberty is allowed to all Persons to come in, a party of Men should
go as Plaintiffs and Defendants, and Witnesses, who joyned with
some others, who should come in under pretence of Curiosity as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned,
should attempt the surprize, and be seconded by
the Party from the hired Horses; and to the best of this Examinant's
remembrance, a Coach was likewise to be made use of in this Case.
And at one of the late Meetings for carrying on the last Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> reported, that an <hi>Engineer</hi> told the said <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi>
that he would recommend some honest stout Fellows to be
Labourers and Workmen in the <hi>Tower,</hi> who should be acquainted
with the Design, and ready to assist in it.</p>
            <p>Another way proposed was, to surprize it by night, but that was
full of difficulty; and all that this Examinant remembers to have
been proposed was, that a parcel of Faggots should be carried down
to the Gate and fired, and to some other Part (this Examinant
thinks the Water-Gate) if it were practicable, and a great quantity
of Faggots should be prepared to throw into the Ditch, and to make
up Works. That which most perplexed the business was, that to
surprize the <hi>Tower</hi> by night, was very difficult, and to begin an
Insurrection in the day time, was as difficult, and would lose many
advantages that the night or break of day would afford; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no resolution was taken: These were only the Debates of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99396:25"/>
meetings of this Examinant, and the other Persons in this former Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
named, but this Examinant never heard what the Principal
Managers considered of or resolved on in the Case.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> used to go by
the name of <hi>Roberts;</hi> and told this Examinant, he was to go for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with or soon after the Bill for the Money to be paid to the <hi>Scots,</hi>
and that the intention was to Land the Arms at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Frith, to
the best of this Examinant's remembrance.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, Mr. <hi>William Rumbald</hi> told this
Examinant, that after it was violently suspected that Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> had
made a Discovery, but had denyed it, it was proposed to Mr. <hi>Keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
for the satisfaction of his Friends, that he should go into the
Country for sometime (where it was easie to Kill him and Bury him
privately.)</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That after it was certainly known
that a Discovery was made, it was said by Mr. <hi>VVade</hi> to the best of
this Examinant's remembrance, that if a Thousand Men could be got
together, it were better to venture a push here or in the <hi>West,</hi> and
die like Men, than be hanged like Dogs: To which it was answered by
Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> as this Examinant believes, It is in vain to think of
it, the Hearts of the People are down, and our Great Men are good for
nothing, or used expressions to that effect.</p>

            <head>The further Examination of Robert West of the
Middle-Temple, Barrister at Law.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant further saith, That at some meetings concerning a
General Insurrection; it was discoursed that a Body of Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horse would be necessary to scour the Streets, to prevent the
Kings Party from embodying, and for Fighting the Horse Guards, or
for a pursuit, and to that end it was proposed, that some endeavours
should be used to bring up a Party of Horse from the Adjacent
Counties, and that some means should be thought on to seize the
Life-Guard Mens Horses in their Quarters, and the Citizens and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens
Horses in the Livery Stables, and if there were success, and a
great Body of Horse should be necessary, the great number of Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
Coach-Horses in Town would make a good force. It was further
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99396:25"/>
proposed, that Baricadoes should be made in several great Streets, and
several Churches be used for lodging the men.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That at some of the said meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
it was reported, that the Kings Regiments of Foot had not their
full Compleatment of men, but wanted a great number, and that the
Officers used to lend one another men when they went upon the
Guard, and therefore the Foot were not so terrible as might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That it was intended in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That some time before <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass</hi>
last, he was informed by Mr. <hi>Roe,</hi> to the best of this Examinant's
remembrance, that the Country expected the City would have been
in Arms on <hi>Michaelmas-Eve,</hi> when the present Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and
<hi>Middlesex</hi> were Sworn, and that he was Credibly Informed, that
there were Five hundred Horse in the Adjacent Counties ready to be
marched to their Assistance upon the first notice, and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in a readiness for two days, expecting notice; but this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
doth not remember that he named any person from whom he
had this Information.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> told this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant,
that some Nonconforming Ministers had told him, they sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
he was driving on a Design to Assassinate the King and Duke,
and beg'd of him to desist; for that it would bring a Reproach upon
the Protestant Religion, whatsoever the event might be, and that
he was forced to assure them, there was no such thing intended: but
alas, said he, they are weak silly men, and not fit for these thing,
who cannot distinguish between Destroying a Prince meerly for his
Opinion in Religion, and Destroying Tyrants who Design to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Laws, Religion and all Civil Rights, and hate the Nation.
It is a pious glorious Action, and such as will teach all Princes to
use their Subjects kindly, or to that effect.</p>

            <p>THis Examinant upon further Recollection saith, That after
Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> had acquainted this Examinant of the Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
intended to have been made in <hi>November</hi> last, the said <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi>
came the second time to this Examinant, and told this Examinant,
that the Lord <hi>Sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tsbury</hi> had prevailed with him to engage in it; and
that if it proceeded he would engage in it, and desired this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to buy for him, the said <hi>Walcot,</hi> a long stiff Tuck of some Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
this Examinant knew, which this Examinant undertook and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoke,
but was so long before he could procure it, that the said <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi>
had otherwise provibed himself, and the Design was laid aside
first, and this Examinant was forced to keep the said Tuck, the Cutler
refusing to take it again.</p>
            <p>And the said Mr. <hi>Walcot</hi> told this Examinant, to the best of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
that the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had formerly sent for Sir <hi>George
Cambel</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Cockran,</hi> about settling a <hi>Scotch</hi> Colony or Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Carolina,</hi> but he believed that was only a pretence, and that
the real truth was to Concert Matters in order to some Design in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
for the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had sent for him, upon pretence of some
Command in <hi>Carolina,</hi> but when he came, the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was
very cool in it. And this Examinant further saith, That the said Mr.
<hi>Walcot</hi> refused a long time to act in any wise, in the Attempt upon
the King and Duke in the <hi>Newmarket</hi> Journey; but at length, by the
perswasion of <hi>Ferguson,</hi> as this Examinant believes, he undertook to
Command the Party who were to Fight the Guards, or to be one of
them, but refused to act in the Assassination it self.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, The said <hi>Ferguson</hi> told this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant,
that when the Earl of <hi>Arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le</hi> was in <hi>England</hi> last Year, he
had offered to make a sturdy Commotion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if he might
have had but 6000 <hi>l.</hi> (for so low he came down from his first demand
of 30000 or 40000 <hi>l..</hi>) but our Great Men were jealous of him then,
and would not trust him, though he offered that they should employ
whom they would themselves to lay out the Money in Arms, which
he said was a great Oversight and Opportunity lost. And this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant
believes, the Assassination of the King and Duke designed
in <hi>October</hi> last, was Projected and Abetted by the late Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and that the Money in one of this Examinant's former Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
mentioned to be advanced for that Design, was advanced by the
said Earl, because this Examinant had heard (but cannot say posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
from whom) that the said Earl complained of having been ill
used in that Matter, in the Money not being returned, though it was
not laid out.</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>West</hi> some time in <hi>Easter-Term</hi> last, in the Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
told me, That some desperate Fellows had designed
to have killed the King, or would have killed the King as
he came last from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> if they had not been afraid
that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would have Hanged them. Upon which
I told him, That it had been a villanous Action, and that all Mankind
would have detested the Action, and the Murderers; and that if it
ever had been in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Power, he would certainly
have Hanged them for it, if they had done it. He told me afterwards,
That there was a Design of raising a considerable Sum of Money to
buy Arms, as I remember, in <hi>Holland;</hi> and that Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> Col.
<hi>Algernoon Sidney,</hi> and <hi>Ferguson,</hi> managed the Business; and that my
Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was very active in it, or Words to that effect: And that
Writings were drawn, or drawing, or to be drawn, for the taking up
of the Money; as I remember, he said <hi>Ferguson</hi> was to manage on the
behalf of the <hi>Scots.</hi> This he told me at his House one Day, when I
Dined with him; but upon my not Examining him to Particulars, he
said nothing to me but thus generally: Only at his House he said,
That some of them were for a Commonwealth, and others for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
            <p>At Mr. <hi>Shute</hi>'s Funeral, in the publick Room, <hi>Nelthorp</hi> came to me,
and asked me for something for poor <hi>Ferguson,</hi> as he called him;
and told me, He was doing a good Work for all Honest Men. I told
him, I would give nothing to any Man, for doing a Work I did not
know of.</p>

rail'd so much at those he called <hi>Protestant Lords,</hi> that I asked
him, if he would have them be Rebels? and told him, That such
Men as he, and nothing else, could ruine the Kingdom. This was
in the <hi>Temple,</hi> before the Hall. The last and only other time that I
ever spoke with him in private, that is, alone (for we walked in the

(I am not certain, whether he named <hi>Newmarket)</hi> but he said, It was
over. I went from him hastily, and only said, These things will Hang
you, and undo a great many other People: As I remember, when he
said, There had been such a Design; I told him, I did not believe it: and
then he said, It was to have been done as the King came from <hi>Newmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket;</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>RIchard Goodenough</hi> bringing Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> alias <hi>Roberts,</hi> (for that
Name he used to go by) to my House, it was a great while
'ere I understood any thing at all of the Design; but so many
coming to him daily as did, made me jealous; I did imagine
something of it. Upon which he took an occasion one Day to ask,
What I thought about the Gentlemen that came so often to him? and
then says; Admit there should be a Design on foot, for the Good of
the People of <hi>England,</hi> Would you be against it? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
If I can do it with a safe Conscience, I could not tell well what
I should be perswaded to. As to that, says he, I shall easily satisfie
you: And then went on to prove a mutual Covenant between the
King, and the People; that his Majesty had broke it on his side; so
the People were again at Liberty. But to the Matter, says he, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I will be plain with you; If you love your self, you must come
in; for there is a Design on foot so laid, and so far gone, that it is
impossible it should fail. Then I desired him, if he thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
to let me know some Particulars; which he said, He would,
provided I would promise him Secrecy: but especially, I should say
nothing to my Father or Wife; for he thought, I would not speak to
any Body else: Upon which I said, I would. And then he was plain,
as he said, and told me as follows:</p>
            <p>That there was not a County in <hi>England,</hi> but had prepared for the
Business, less or more, but especially in the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>West;</hi> and that
they were sure of most Places of Strength throughout the Kingdom;
but especially, <hi>Bristol</hi> and <hi>Newcastle:</hi> And that they were then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
how to secure <hi>Portsmouth;</hi> but were afraid they should not,
the Garrison was so strong.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Scots</hi> were to stir at the same time we were; and that
we were to lend them 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to be remitted into <hi>Holland,</hi> to buy
Arms for them; and that he was to go over with the Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change:
That he found out a Person could deposite the Money upon
good Security, which the Lords had promised should be given: That
there was a <hi>Dutch</hi>-Merchant or two, that he had got to provide the
Arms, for the <hi>English</hi> could not do it without Suspicion.</p>
            <p>Then I asked him, Who the Lords were? He told me, There was
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> and Major <hi>Wildman,</hi>
and Col. <hi>Sidney.</hi> I told him, I wondred the Duke would be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to take up Arms against his Father; for my part, I should be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99396:27"/>
unwilling to trust him. He answer'd me, That he had the greatest
Assurance in the World of him; and that I need no more be afraid of
the Duke, than of him.</p>
            <p>He told me, The Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> who was to command the <hi>Scots,</hi> was
of my Opinion too; for he had a few days before, sent a Letter to him,
to be well satisfied in the Point; and that he had sent him such an
Answer, as he did not doubt would satisfie him.</p>
            <p>He told me, The Duke of <hi>York</hi> had Fourteen thousand Men in half
pay about the Town: And for his part, he thought we ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our selves; for we could not tell, but our Throats might be cut
every Night. I asked him, How he could tell all this? He told me,
That they had a great deal of Intelligence from the <hi>Tory</hi> Party; for
there were some, that were willing to play a sure Game, and so keep
in with both Sides. Some little time after this, there came one Mr.
<hi>Iohn Row,</hi> that was Sword-bearer of <hi>Bristol,</hi> with one <hi>Iames Holloway,</hi>
of the same Place, a Merchant, to enquire for <hi>Ferguson;</hi> but he was
unwilling to see them. Then <hi>Row</hi> asked me, to go and give him a Dish
of <hi>Coffee;</hi> which I did: And <hi>Iames Holloway</hi> gave me an account of
the Posture of Affairs at <hi>Bristol;</hi> which I wondred at, being the first
time that ever I saw him, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they had been ready this two or three Months; that there
was but Eight in <hi>Bristol,</hi> that knew of it; that he had had some Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
he had taken out of some Ships he was concerned in, had lain
there so long, he was afraid they would mistrust something: That he
had great plenty of Powder and Bullet in his own House; and that
they had a couple of Ships there, that would carry forty Guns a piece;
which they intended to seize the first Rising, and fit out to Sea. And
then their manner of getting together was thus: Some of those Eight
had Houses out of Town, where they would get all of the Town they
thought were for their Purpose: The Dissenters, under pretence of a
Meeting; and the Others, under some Colour or other: And then
tell them the Design; and if they would not go with them, they
would secure or force them; and that they would seize all the Head
Men of the Contrary Party, which were not above Thirty in all:
And that they would post Men at the Corner of every Street; so that
there should not a Man stir, without they pleased.</p>
            <p>And that to their Assistance, they should have some Colliers out of
<hi>King-Road,</hi> and some <hi>Scotch</hi> Pedlers that were about the Country;
many of whom were of <hi>Bothwel-Bridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He said further, That the King would have by the Time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
a great many Thousand Pounds, that they should seize; and that
there was a great many of the <hi>Tory</hi> Party, that had a great Summ of
Money by them, which they must borrow: And that there was not
a good Horse within Five Miles about them, but they knew where to
have him: That they wanted but two hundred Musque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; for they
thought, they should have more Men than Arms, which he was come
up about; which he hoped, the Lords would help them to: But if they
could not, Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> would lend them the Money to buy them; and
that he should pack them up in Parcels of Goods, and send them by
the Carrier to his House. Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> told me himself, He would do
it; that is, lend the Money; but it was some time after this. Mr. <hi>Row</hi>
sate by, and approved what <hi>Holloway</hi> said to be true. After this I went
down to the Wells, and staid about a Fortnight. When I came
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99396:28"/>
Home again, Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> came to me, and told me, I must promise Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and then he had something to say me; which was, That Affairs
were settled every where very well, but in <hi>London:</hi> And though the
Lords had a Design to let <hi>London</hi> alone; yet they saw there was a
necessity, that the Business must be done effectually in <hi>London;</hi> for if
they let that alone, it was enough to maintain a War against the
whole Kingdom, and that their Friends here would be all ruined:
and that in order to the securing of it, they had taken this Method, by
which they might know their Strength. They had divided the <hi>Town</hi>
into so many Divisions, and had got honest Fellows to consult what
Men they might expect out of every Division; and that they had no
Body about me, that they thought could serve them: and therefore
desired me to think, if it was not possible to get about an hundred and
sixty Men out of <hi>Bloomsbury,</hi> St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s, St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, and <hi>Soho;</hi> and
that I might, by way of Discourse, ask some of my Acquaintance,
If there should be occasion to defend our selves, whether they could
not find out Ten, or Fifteen, or Twenty Men, that would assist: That
they should have a Meeting again in Two or Three Days; and then
he would give me an Account of it, and I should go to them. And
accordingly, on <hi>Friday</hi> following, being the Eighth of <hi>Iune,</hi> towards
Evening, he came and fetcht me out, and carried me to the <hi>Dragon</hi>-Tavern
on <hi>Snow-Hill;</hi> where I met Collonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert West,</hi>
Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade, Richard</hi> and <hi>Francis Goodenough.</hi>
Then I was asked, If I could not do what Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> had spoke
to me about? and was desired, not to say any thing about the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to any Body in direct terms, but especially to any of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
for <hi>West</hi> said, They were a parcel of Rogues, that had ruined the
People ever since <hi>Constantine.</hi> I told them, I thought Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> might be trusted; and that they were, if they would, capable
of serving them very much. But they would not hear it then; but
the next Meeting, which was on <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>11th. Ditto,</hi> at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation</hi>
in <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi> they did think it was necessary Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi>
should be spoke to, but not directly; which I did: For the next
Day I went to him, and talking of the badness of the Times, I said,
There was but one way to help our selves, and that was by Arms;
and if we should have occasion to do so, I asked him, where he could
find a good Parcel amongst his People, that he thought would stir?
He told me, That the Spirits of the People were low; but he did
believe, there was a pretty many of them, that would make use of
an Opportunity, if it was put into their Hands: But he could see no
Hopes of such an Opportunity as yet; we were too great Cowards.
But I bid him not be out of hopes: And so our Discourse ended; for
his Wife came in.</p>
            <p>The next Meeting, which was on <hi>Thursday</hi> the <hi>14th. Ditto,</hi> at the
<hi>Dragon</hi> on <hi>Snow-Hill, Richard Goodenough</hi> brought in an Account of
the Divisions he was concerned in; which was all the Town al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
but where I was; and at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Grange,</hi> a
Brewer, was concerned, but he ne're met with us; but <hi>Goodenough</hi>
said, He promised Two hundred Men, and would be free of his
Purse. At this Meeting, they resolved on This, which had been
Consulted before, (for now they began to be sure of the Design;
for they had a Probability of Eight or Nine Thousand Men, from the
Account <hi>Goodenough</hi> gave in and others) That <hi>Whitehall</hi> should be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99396:28"/>
secured, and the manner thus: That the Men in <hi>Westminster</hi> should
be ready to make an Attaque on that side, that they would get about
100 Sea-men that should come up in Long-Boats with Hand-Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
and should Attaque that part next the Water and that a Party
of about 500 should come down by <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> part of which should
secure the <hi>Mews,</hi> and the rest march down and surprize the Guards
in their sleep, for it was to have been about one or two in the
Morning, and that all the Chief Ministers of State were to be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs and some of the Aldermen,
another party to secure the <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Sommerset-House,</hi> and that in
<hi>Covent-Garden</hi> and <hi>Lincolns-Inne-Fields</hi> were to be Bodies of Men
to be ready to give assistance if need were, and that all the expedition
imaginable was to be made, for now it was put into the hands of a
great many, and there was danger of a Discovery. Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi>
told us that day that he had met with an Engineer that would do strange
things about taking the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that he had six or seven Mortar Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that belonged to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that he would take care to keep
them this Month or six Weeks; at that time Mr. <hi>West</hi> said he thought
I must secure my Neighbour, meaning the Lord Keeper, but I told
him I would do no such thing as to fall on a Neighbour; truly he said
he should be very willing to come to an account with him, and if he did
he should put him in mind of <hi>Colledge.</hi> At this time <hi>Goodenough</hi> said
the People that he had spoke of the Matters to, desired they might
know what they must trust to, for if the Design was onely to change
Persons they had as good have the Father as the Son, and therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some Heads might be thought on and carried to the Duke to be
signed by him the night before the Design began, and these Five things
were resolved on:
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Militia should be in the hands of the People.</item>
                  <item>2. That they should choose their own Sheriffs in every Country.</item>
                  <item>3. That we should have a Parliament once a year, and that they
should Sit as long as they had any thing to do.</item>
                  <item>4. That they should have Liberty of Conscience.</item>
                  <item>5. That all the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> that had acted contrary to the
Interest of the People should be Degraded.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> was to put these in Writing, and to carry them the next
Morning to Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> who was to go to the Duke with them,
which he did, and on Saturday the <hi>16th. Ditto</hi> at the <hi>George</hi> and
<hi>Vulture</hi> on <hi>Ludgate-Hill</hi> he brought us this Account, That he was to
wait on the Duke twice before he could speak with him, but at last
did; that the Dukes answer was, That all of them were things of
moment, and that they could not be done without a Parliament but
must be left to them, that he would do what lay in his power to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the obtaining them, but there being word brought to one <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
a Dyer in St. <hi>Giles Cripple-Gate</hi> Parish, that there was High Treason
sworn against him and <hi>Richard Goodenough, Goodenough</hi> would not
come to us that night, so this onely was concluded on, that we should
meet on Munday at the <hi>Castle-</hi>Tavern in <hi>Fleetstreet,</hi> and that some
time on Monday Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> should go to Mr. <hi>West</hi>'s
Chamber to survey the Map of the Town to find fit places to meet
in and give us an account at our Meeting, but on Sunday they had
an account all was Discovered by one <hi>Keeling</hi> whom they had some
suspicion of some days before; upon Monday Morning they met at
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99396:29"/>
Captain <hi>Tracy</hi>'s where Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> Lodged, Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> came
to my House and gave Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> and me an account of it, and
took me with him to Captain <hi>Tracy</hi>'s where they consulted how to
retrieve the Business: Most were for pushing for it, and so to die
with their Swords in their Hands; and another way was proposed
I think by Mr. <hi>West,</hi> to kill <hi>Keeling</hi> and one Doctour <hi>Butler</hi> which I
think Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> named, who was said to be the person brought
<hi>Keeling</hi> in to Discover, and that this would give them such a Blow
would make them afraid: The manner of taking Doctor <hi>Butler</hi> was
to be thus: Some men to go to him (as it was to be after the killing
of <hi>Keeling)</hi> and undertake to give him an exact Account of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and the rest of the Plot, and so to meet at a Tavern where was a
convenient Room for the purpose, and there to have Assassinated him,
but I left them in the dispute and went not again till Morning, when I
came there they were all gone but <hi>West,</hi> who told me that one <hi>Rumbald</hi>
and others had been in company with <hi>Keeling</hi> all the day before and he
had perswaded them into a belief he had sworn nothing against any Man
and so escaped from them, though this Morning they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>At one time talking to <hi>Ferguson</hi> about this Matter, he said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was to be expected from the Rich old Citizens, and therefore
half a dozen of them must be taken out of their Houses and Hanged
on their Sign-Posts and their Houses given as Plunder to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile
and that would scare the rest. Another time meeting <hi>Roe</hi> after
the Fire at <hi>Newmarket</hi> a great while, he began to talk of the Design
at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> which he declined when he found I was ignorant of
it, but by him and others I understood afterwards that there was a
Consult several times at <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber against the Life of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and that in order thereunto <hi>West</hi> had bought as many Arms
as cost about 100 <hi>l.</hi> of a Gunsmith in <hi>Shere-Lane,</hi> but the Fire happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prevented the Design. Another time talking with <hi>Roe,</hi> he said
there was no way like Lopping, that was his Majesty and his Royal
Highness; to which I answered, I never approved of such ways,
and that he might do it himself for me if he would have it done,
upon which he replied he would be one with all his heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
it might be done through or over my Lord of <hi>Bedford</hi>'s Wall as his
Majesty went to the Play-House, or as he went to <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>
from <hi>Windsor.</hi> At another time I met <hi>West</hi> on the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and
he told me the Lords were all a parcel of Rogues, and <hi>Ferguson</hi> a credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Fool, for that they would Trick upon the <hi>Scots</hi> and us too, that
he had laid out a parcel of Money for Arms, and that he could not
get it again, which I told <hi>Ferguson</hi> when I saw him but he said he
should have it. Some time after I met him in <hi>Lineol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s-Inne-Fields</hi>
and he told me that he had a Note to one Major <hi>Wildman</hi> for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and that he'd go for it next Morning, which he did, but the
Major was gone out of Town. Some time after I went to Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s
in <hi>Bloomsbury,</hi> where <hi>Ferguson</hi> then Lodged and there I asked him
about <hi>West</hi>'s Money, he told me he had given it himself, for that
it was sent to him just before Mr. <hi>West</hi> came in and he had given
it him. On Monday they met at Captain <hi>Tracy</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>West</hi> gave
a Note to one <hi>Tottle</hi> to go to the Gunsmith to fetch the Arms he
had bought, lest they should be found there and carry them with him
to one of the Plantations, I think <hi>New York,</hi> which <hi>Tottle</hi> did then
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99396:29"/>
profer, if they would push for it he would not go his Voyage, though
I think he said his Ship was at <hi>Gravesend,</hi> nor would he come
alone, but undertake for a Hundred Sea-men and others present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>The persons that used to come to <hi>Ferguson</hi> were Sir <hi>Thomas Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong</hi>

Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norton, Richard Goodenough, Richard

a great many more of his Country-men) and several from <hi>Wapping,</hi> all
whom I know when I see, also Mr. <hi>Iohn Ayloff</hi> used to come when he
was in Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferguson</hi> told me of a certain person of Quality in that part of <hi>Ireland</hi>
next <hi>Scotland</hi> that could raise Twenty thousand Men, and that he had
promised it, I asked his Name but he would not tell me; he told me it
was <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was sent to <hi>Scotland</hi> about this business, and that he
had like to have spoiled all, but that the person to whom he carried the
Letter went to the Council and shewed them a Letter he had about some
business of <hi>Carolina,</hi> and asked leave to come to <hi>London</hi> about it, and
so got off this suspition.</p>

            <head>The further Examination of Robert West of the
Middle-Temple, Barrister at Law.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant upon further Recollection saith, That at the
Meetings for carrying on the Assassination of the King and Duke,
it was resolved, that Sir <hi>Iohn Moor</hi> the late Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi>
should be killed, as well as the present Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and
that if the people did not pull him in pieces, his Skin should be stead off
and stuft and hung up in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> as one who betrayed the Rights
and Priviledges of the City.</p>
            <p>And it was further resolved that Mr. <hi>Papillion</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> should be
declared Sheriffs, and <hi>Sir Thomas Gold</hi> or Alderman <hi>Cornish</hi> (but this
Examinant thinks Alderman <hi>Cornish</hi> was pitch'd on as the brisker Man)
to be Lord Mayor, and that they should be forced to take those Offices
upon them, and if they refused should be knocked on the head. And
Sin <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> and Sir <hi>Patience Ward</hi> who had behaved themselves
like Trimmers in their Mayoralty, and neglected to repeal several By-Laws
whereby they might have prevented Sir <hi>Iohn Moor</hi> from being
Lord Mayor, should be forced to appear publickly and own the fact, or
else be knockt on the Head.</p>
            <p>And it was further proposed that most of the Judges should be killed
or brought to Tryal for their Arbitrary Judgments, and their Skins stuft
and hung up in <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was further said by Colonel <hi>Rumzey,</hi> to the best of this Examinants
remembrance, that though he was not for shedding much blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there
would be a necessity of taking off some of the chief Abhorrers and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressers
in most Counties, otherwise they would be making head, but
this Examinant was of opinion that a publick Declaration of safety to
their persons and Estates if they would submit, was a better expedient
and would win more upon the People: And it was further resolved that
some of the principal reputed Pentioners in the late long Parliament
should be brought to Tryal and Death, and that there Skins should be
stuft and hung up in the Parliament House, as Betrayers of the People,
and of the Trust. It was proposed that Bishops Deans and Chapters
should be wholly laid aside, but no resolution was taken concerning
their Lands, because the present Tenants might be induced to submit in
hopes of preserving them, and would be sure to struggle if they saw
they must lose them, and those who had those Lands in the late times
would be sure to engage in Arms for us or submit in hopes of having
those Lands again. Some discourse was had of applying those Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and of one half or two thirds of the Colleges in both Universities
to publick uses in ease of the People from Taxes. It was further proposed
that it should be publickly declared to the people that they should be
eased of the Chimney Mony, and have Toleration in matters of Religion,
which was thought would engage all the meaner people: That <hi>England</hi>
should be a free Port, and all Strangers who would should be Naturalized,
which was looked upon as a means to engage Foreigners on our side,
that there should be no Taxes for the future bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:99396:31"/>
Taxes which should be appropriated to particular uses, and all forfeited
Estates should be applyed so too.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that this Examinant enquiring of
<hi>Ferguson</hi> what Fond of Money was provided, it was answered by
him and Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> that if the business were done and backt
with success there could be no want of Money, there would be half a
years Revenue of the Chimney Money then due besides what the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise-Office
and Custom-house will afford, and that there was Money and
Plate enough among the Bankers and Goldsmiths which must be taken
up upon Publick Faith if there were occasion, and be punctually repaid
again for the reputation of the Cause.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that when <hi>Walcot</hi> agreed to engage
in the said Action he desired his Name might be concealed whatsoever
the effect of it proved; whereupon <hi>Ferguson</hi> replyed no Man ought to
be ashamed of it, for 'tis a glorious Action and such as I hope to see re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by a Parliament, and that the Actors in it shall have Statues
erected to them with Inscriptions of <hi>Liberatores Patriae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that he acquainted Mr. <hi>Thomas
Shepard</hi> Merchant that this Examinant had provided Arms in his former
Examination mentioned, and that <hi>Ferguson</hi> promised to see for a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of committing the Assassination between <hi>Hampton-court</hi> and
<hi>Windsor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that Mr. <hi>Bourn</hi> a Brewer between
great <hi>Queen-street</hi> and <hi>Parker-lane</hi> was acquainted with the intended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections,
and hath talked with this Examinant about them, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himself ready to engage in an Insurrection, but not in the Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and the said <hi>Bourn</hi> was knowing of the Arms bought by this
Examinant, but was not at the Meeting when they were agreed to be
bespoken; and this Examinant believes he acquainted Mr. <hi>Carleton Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Edmund Waller</hi> both of the <hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Holford</hi>
of <hi>Chancery-lane</hi> of the intended Assassination and Insurrection in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
but he did not do so till after the time for Execution was past:
And further saith, that in the beginning of <hi>October</hi> last this Examinant
met with Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> where the said Colonel told this
Examinant that many tricks had been plaid in the Scrutiny of the Poll
for the Lord Mayor, and that Sir <hi>William Prichard</hi> was declared though
not duly chosen, but said he, all that I can say to it is what a Justice of
Peace of <hi>Essex</hi> said lately to a Country Fellow brought before him for
Killing a High-way-man that would have Rob'd him; Friend says the
Justice you have done well, but you might have been Rob'd if you
would; and so we may be inslaved if we will, or else need not, or he
used words to that purpose, but this Examinant to the best of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
never spake to the said Colonel since.</p>

            <p>THis Examinant upon further Recollection saith that <hi>Richard Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>
and <hi>Francis Goodenough</hi> formerly offered to act in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Assassination of the King and Duke if a sufficient number of Men
could not be got to do it; but afterwards believing there were Men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
besides, they both declined it.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, that at some of the Meetings
concerning the said Assassination, Colonel <hi>Rumzey</hi> said it would
be very convenient to take off Colonel <hi>Legg</hi> the now Lord <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
for he was a stout Man and of desperate Courage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
if he could get into the <hi>Tower,</hi> would in Revenge fire all the
Gunpowder in the White <hi>Tower,</hi> which would endanger the whole
City. And it was said concerning the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> Daughter to the
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> that it would be best to Marry her to some small
Country Gentleman and have a Breed only to keep out any Forrain
pretenders to the Crown; and at one of the said Meetings, when
it was discoursed whether the King or Duke should be killed singly,
it was agreed, that <hi>Rumbold</hi> should send out a Spye before, who
by some signs should give an account at a distance whether the King
and Duke were both together or not, and at one of the said Meetings
when it was designed that it would be convenient to take off some of
the Chief Ministers of State, as the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> Lord <hi>Halifax,</hi> Lord
<hi>Hyde; Richard Goodenough</hi> said, take the Keeper Prisoner, and Try him
at <hi>Oxford</hi> for the Death of <hi>Colledge,</hi> and hang him upon the same Post
on which <hi>Colledge</hi> was hanged.</p>
            <p>And at one of the said Meetings this Examinant saying he was well
enough Armed for one, for he had a good Musket Blunderbuss and
Case of Pistols; the said <hi>Rumbold</hi> desired to see 'em, and finding 'em
very good said he believed he must use the Blunderbuss in the Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sination,
and told <hi>Ferguson</hi> he must Consecrate it if he should use
it.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant saith that at one of the said Meetings, this
Examinant was appointed to speak to one Captain <hi>Bon</hi> a Seaman
at <hi>Ratcliff</hi> to undertake the Raising a body of Seamen to surprize the
<hi>Tower</hi> in case the Assassination had been committed, and this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
accordingly proposed to the said <hi>Bon</hi> whether he would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to do so; but the said <hi>Bon</hi> replyed he was going to settle in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi>
where he was born, and did not care to be concerned, and
feared he had not interest enough amongst the Seamen if he would,
which this Examinant reported to the next Meeting, and the said

<hi>New-Iersey.</hi>

            <p>And this Examinant further saith that <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> told

Insurrection intended in <hi>November</hi> last was resolved on and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi>
agreed to engage in it, the said <hi>Walcot</hi> desired this Examinant to
lend him some of this Examinant's Suit of Silk Armour, <hi>viz.</hi> a Back,
Breast and Head piece, and afterward asked this Examinant to take some
Command of Horse under him and to engage some young Men of the
Temple, telling this Examinant he could make this Examinant a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Officer in two or three days time, but this Examinant refused to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himself or his Friends either, though he offered the said <hi>Walcot</hi> the
use of his Armour.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That when the Arms in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Examinations mentioned were ordered to be bespoke; it was also
proposed that <hi>Ferguson</hi> should provide the 600 <hi>l.</hi> he pretended to have
ready for that purpose to buy Horses, which should be kept at Livery-Stables
in the names of private Gentlemen, and be always in a readiness
to be made use of as an opportunity for any Assassination or other Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
should offer, and the night or two before they were to be used
should seemingly be brought out of the Livery-Stables by men to be
employed for that purpose, but <hi>Ferguson</hi> not bringing the Money no
Horses were bought.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That after the Treaty with the
<hi>Sctos</hi> seemed to be at an end, and the 10000 <hi>l.</hi> not like to be had,
<hi>Ferguson</hi> told this Examinant that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to speak with this Examinant and <hi>Goodenough</hi> to consider what
ought to be done in the City and Suburbs, and to leave the Lords and
other people (by which this Examinant supposes he meant the Lords
<hi>Grey</hi> and <hi>Russel, Sidney</hi> and <hi>Wildman)</hi> but this Examinant refused
to go to the Duke or to Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> and knows not
whether <hi>Goodenough</hi> went to the Duke, though he did go to <hi>Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Ferguson</hi> likewise told told this Examinant, That if the <hi>English</hi>
would not agree to stir, it was his opinion and the opinion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Duke's Friends, and of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen that were
here, that the Duke should go to <hi>Scotland</hi> and head the <hi>Scots</hi> there;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99396:32"/>
whereupon Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> who was then present said, If the Duke did go
thither he would wait upon him in the Expedition as a Voluntier.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, That at some Meeting for the
carrying on the intended Assassination, <hi>Ferguson</hi> said the King went
frequently in the night cross St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Park in a Chair without any
Attendance, and that it would be easie for Two Men with Swords
barely to dispatch him and make their Escape; whereupon Colonel
<hi>Romzey</hi> said it was a strange thing to him, that the great Men who
were so desirous to have the business done, should not make a Purse
and buy some good Office at Court for some Man whom they could
trust, who should roar loud of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the Wiggs,
and by that means get into reputation and trust and should observe
and give an account of the King's and Duke's Walks and Hours and
any Journeys they designed; and the said Colonel said he had told <hi>Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong</hi>
so and bad him tell his Lords.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that about the time the Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
intended in <hi>November</hi> last was carrying on this Examinant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Escrick</hi> and <hi>Walcot</hi> to be very intimate and
often together, and the said <hi>Walcot</hi> told this Examinant that the
Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was as right as any Man for the business and as forward
to engage, but this Examinant doth not remember that he ever spoke
with the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> himself about that Insurrection. And further
saith Mr <hi>Roe</hi> told this Examinant that <hi>Gibbons</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s
Servant offered to be one to commit the Assassination of the King and
Duke. And further saith not.</p>

            <head>The further Examination of Robert West of the
Middle-Temple Barrister at Law.</head>
            <p>THis Examinant further saith, That after <hi>Ferguson</hi> had told
this Examinant that a Sum of Money for carrying on the
Assassination of the King and Duke in <hi>October</hi> last was paid to
a certain Person who never returned it, of which the Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
complained: The said <hi>Ferguson</hi> at another time a little before
the Discovery told this Examinant that <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> was the
person to whom that Money was paid, and that he called <hi>Ferguson</hi>
Fool for returning some Money he had received for the same purpose
and Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> told this Examinant that Mr. <hi>Charleton</hi> paid that
Money.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that when Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi>
told this Examinant that he would speak to <hi>Hone</hi> the Joyner
to be one of the Assassinates, he said he would first try him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would undertake an Attempt upon the Duke of <hi>York</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he would break the whole Business to him; and as he found
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99396:33"/>
him willing to that he would proceed. And this Examinant believes
Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> did accordingly, for that the said <hi>Hone</hi> coming to
this Examinants Chamber soon after, and being asked by this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
whether he had lately seen Mr. <hi>Goodenough?</hi> The said <hi>Hone</hi>
answered he had, and talked with him about a Jobb upon the Duke
of <hi>York:</hi> And this Examinant asking him whether they were agreed?
<hi>Hone</hi> replyed yes, but this Examinant doth not remember that
<hi>Hone</hi> then mentioned the King or any Name or description imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King. And about five or six weeks since the said <hi>Hone</hi>
came to this Examinants chamber about a small alteration this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
designing to make in his Chamber; and then the said <hi>Hone</hi>
asked this Examinant, Master will nothing be done? To which
this Examinant answering he believed not, the said <hi>Hone</hi> replyed,
if this Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would be true and appear openly, I
could bring fifty or sixty honest Fellows from our side of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(meaning <hi>Southwark)</hi> who would be ready for business as well as
my self, and this Examinant asking him what business? <hi>Hone</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
any business, either a brisk push (by which this Examinant
supposed he meant a General Insurrection) or the other Trick or Jobb
of taking off the two Brothers, the Captain and Lieutenant which were
two Names used for the King and Duke.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that when the Discourse was
had concerning the Killing the Ministers of State, Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi>
said, the Lord <hi>Halifax</hi> was one of the Greatest Rogues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it more than any Man, for he professing himself formerly of
our Party knows our weakness and Divisions and hath exposed us
and made the Court venture upon things which they would never
have done otherwise. And when <hi>Goodenough</hi> proposed that the
Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> should be Hanged where <hi>Colledge</hi> was Hanged this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant
having an Opinion that the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> was an Enemy to
this Examinant and had used him very hardly in a Cause this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant
lately had in <hi>Chancery,</hi> this Examinant desired that he might
have the Custody of the said Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> a little while to make
him sensible of his unkindness to this Examinant, but this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
never designed or desired to Kill the said Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> or
any other person, nor would have had his Hands in any Mans
Blood.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that <hi>Ferguson</hi> lately told this
Examinant that Mr. <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Son of <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi> who usually
goes by the Name of Mr. <hi>Cranbourn</hi> was so vain as to endeavour to
make a Party for himself or his Father in the City: and <hi>Goodenough</hi>
formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>Christmass</hi> last told this Examinant that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the said Mr. <hi>Cromwel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ireton,</hi> the Son of Lieutenant
General <hi>Ireton</hi> would assist in the intended Assassination of the King and
Duke in Person.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith, that Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> told this
Examinant that he had spoken to one <hi>Partridge</hi> a Shoemaker and
<hi>Almanack-Maker</hi> in <hi>Covent-garden</hi> to Act in this Assassination, and
that the said <hi>Partridge</hi> offered to joyn in it if it were to be done in
Town but was not able to Ride and therefore would not joyn in
the Attempt out of <hi>London:</hi> And further said that the said <hi>Partridge</hi>
had erected several Schemes and thereby found the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
would scarce out-live <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> and that the King was under
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99396:33"/>
an ill Direction too, and the People would be Victorious. And Mr.
<hi>Ryley</hi> told this Examinant the same thing as to the Schemes erected
by <hi>Partridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> told this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant
that when Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> refused to go into the West and
raise a Force for the intended Insurrection in <hi>November</hi> last, the said
Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> was sent for to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s House about it,
and there were present the said Duke, the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Colonel <hi>Romzey.</hi>
And further told this Examinant that the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> had prepared to
go the then next morning to his Post which was somewhere in the West,
but this Examinant doth not remember the place.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that after the Discovery, <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi>
told this Examinant, Colonel <hi>Romzey, Wade, Norton, Nelthrop,
Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Ferguson,</hi> that notwithstanding the said Discovery
he was perswaded God would yet deliver this Nation, but he did not
approve of the present Instruments who had undertaken it, or used
words to that purpose.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that he having a Son lately Born
desired Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> to be Godfather, who said he would not, except
he might name him <hi>Brutus,</hi> but was afterwards prevailed with to do
that Office, and give the Name of <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Child being the said Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels
own Christian name.</p>

            <p>THis Examinant upon further recollection saith, that <hi>Ferguson</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
<hi>viz.</hi> soon after his return from <hi>Holland</hi> told this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> either and Anabaptist or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Preacher were the most sensible Ministers about the Town,
and were both of Opinion that the intended Assassination and Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

<hi>Owens</hi> Brother was Privy to them and joyned with Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> and
Major <hi>Wildman</hi> in the management of the Treaty with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and
that one Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> a Nonconformist Minister was zealous in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of an Insurrection but was not for beginning it in <hi>London,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Nelthrop</hi> told this Examinant the same thing of <hi>Mead,</hi> and that he
was able to Raise a thousand Men or more.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> told this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
that in case of an Insurrection which he much desired, he would
go along with the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> wheresoever he took his Post and would
furnish out himself and a man with able Horses and Arms, and a good
sum of Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:99396:34"/>And this Examinant further saith, that upon a discourse with Colonel
<hi>Rumzey</hi> concerning a general Insurrection, the said Colonel told this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant
that if he could have a thousand resolute Fellows to follow
him and an other thousand Men to secure him at his back he would
undertake to drive the King, all the Court and the Guards out of Town
so as they should not dare to look back till they were fled to <hi>Windsor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that the Money which this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
received from <hi>Ferguson</hi> amounting to something more than the
Arms bought by this Examinant cost, this Examinant by the direction
of Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> paid Five pounds to Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> to give to one <hi>Manning</hi>
who was to have been one of the Assassinates, and also in the last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
Insurrection to pay some Debts which <hi>Manning</hi> owed, and the
said Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> gave <hi>Manning</hi> a Guinny
or 20 <hi>s.</hi> apiece more. And the said <hi>Wade</hi> asking this Examinant whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would personally engage in the last intended Insurrection, and
this Examinant saying his infirm Constitution was not able to bear the
toyl of a Souldiers life, Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> told this Examinant, then he must
sit out some Men that would, and that this Examinant should give his
Blunderbuss to <hi>Manning</hi> who was a strong stout Fellow able to carry it,
which this Examinant agreed to, and to fit out two Foot Souldiers, or
do any thing else was fit for him to do.</p>
            <p>And this Examinant further saith that at one of the last Meetings
for Raising the three thousand Men out of the City and Suburbs, Mr.
<hi>Bourn</hi> reported he had communicated the business to Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> a Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist
Parson who had a Congregation of poor zealous Men, and
that Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> embraced it readily, and promised to employ two trusty
Men of his Congregation to go amongst the rest and engage as many
as they could. And this Examinant further saith, that <hi>Ferguson</hi> had four
several Lodgings during this Examinants Correspondence with him, at
three of which this Examinant visited him, <hi>viz.</hi> at Mr. <hi>Bourns</hi> the Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

clucht his Fist and struck it towards his Mouth twice or thrice

would be 20 <hi>l.</hi> apiece to buy Horse and Arms. This Examinant
then told him he was well settled in his Trade and did not care to

and from thence they two went to one <hi>Sergeants</hi> a Cooks-shop at the

let us make what we can and go, Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> answered no, and

the Plot, was one day I met him by the <hi>Exchange;</hi> He told me he
had something to say to me; and to the best of my remembrance he
asked me presently after, if I did know of any Seamen that were
fitting to make Captains in <hi>Wapping:</hi> I told him No, but I would
see what I could do; and he promised, he and Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> to come to the
<hi>Blew Anchor</hi> by <hi>Wapping</hi> Dock next morning about Ten a Clock but
came not: Another day, he and Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> came down and discoursed
with some of Mr. <hi>Rowse's</hi> Friends that he met, but they did not
like his way and so parted.</p>
            <p>And the first time that ever I heard of tossing up of a Ball was by
Captain <hi>Blagg,</hi> but I do declare I knew not the meaning of it till
Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rowse</hi> asked me about taking the <hi>Tower;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he or Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rowse,</hi> or both, asked me about tossing up
of a Ball, as I take it on <hi>Black Heath:</hi> I asked what they would do
there? They told me there was some Hundreds of Horse ready in the
Country; and as for Captain <hi>Blagg,</hi> I heard him say that Mortar-pieces
over <hi>Southwark</hi> side would be the best way for the taking of
the <hi>Tower;</hi> and I have heard him say, as near as I can remember, he
could raise some Seamen, but the number I have forgot; and all that
Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> spoke before the King and Council in my hearing was true.
All this I am willing to attest; and for knowing of any others besides
Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rowse</hi> and Captain <hi>Blagg</hi> to be concerned in this
Plot, I know not, neither can I call to mind any words spoken by
any but those three.</p>

            <p>SInce I sent in my Paper, I have sent something more which came
in my mind since, That is about getting some Seamen that might
be fitting to go Commanders or Captains of Ships; and as he asked
if I could not get two or three; sometime afterwards I did enquire
what he would do with them, he told me to make Masters of Ships.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99396:36"/>
I asked for what end? He told me to put in Ships at <hi>Deptsord</hi> or
<hi>Woolwich,</hi> that is Men of War to make Guard Ships to stop all going
and coming: I did ask him what he would do with them when there
was no Guns nor Powder nor Shot on board; but I told him if he
had the <hi>Tower</hi> then he might do something: but his Answer was, if
not then, some time after that, says he, Mr. <hi>Rous</hi> by Name we
must secure the <hi>Tower</hi> and <hi>Whitehall</hi> both together, or else there
could be nothing done: For, says he, we must take the King and
then our work is done, to the best of my remembrance: I asked
what was then his <hi>Oath of Allegiance?</hi> He told me if they had the

            <head>Information of the Lord Howard to the King
the 11th. of July 1682.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The First Part of my Narrative being a Summary
Account of all that Occurred to my Knowledg from
September 29th 1682. to the time of the Earl
of Shaftsbury's Death.</head>
               <p>ABout the middle of <hi>September</hi> 1682. I had occasion to go to a
small Estate at <hi>Tolibury</hi> in the County of <hi>Essex,</hi> where I
continued about a Fortnight waiting to hear of the ultimate
issue and result of the long contested Election of the Sheriffs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
which was shortly to receive a final Determination by the
Swearing of the new Sheriffs into their Office.</p>
               <p>During which time of my continuance in the Country I received
two or three Letters from Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> importing in a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Stile, well enough understood by me, that the matters of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
betwixt me and the Merchant my Correspondent were
brought to a good Conclusion, and that my presence was speedily
desired for the better perfecting the same.</p>
               <p>Upon the 29th. of <hi>September</hi> (being the day which put an end to
the long Dispute about the Sheriffs) I returned to my House at
<hi>Knightsbridge,</hi> where I had not been above two or three days before
I received a Visit from Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> who acquainted me that the
Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had withdrawn himself from his own House into
a Retirement in the City, where (though he was secreted from
most of his Friends yet) he desired to see me, for which purpose his
Lordship had sent him to me to shew me the way to his Lodging.</p>
               <p>I presently closed with the Invitation, and went along with him
to one Mr. <hi>Watsons</hi> House about the further end of <hi>Woodstreet</hi> (rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
from <hi>Cheapside)</hi> where I found his Lordship alone, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
begun to advise me in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That finding the due Election of the City frustrated by the Pseudo-Sheriffs
forcibly obtruded upon them, he could no longer think himself
safe (though Innocent) in the future administration of Justice which
must hereafter be expected to be wrested by such Ministers to the
Humour of the Court, but this Danger threatned not him only, but
me also, and all honest Men in <hi>England,</hi> in the sense whereof he
had thought it necessary for him (and believed it no less necessary
for me) to withdraw himself into the City, where he had made
such preparations (meeting with a disposed matter) that he did not
doubt but in a short time he should be able to reduce things to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
posture: That in order hereunto there were several Thousands
(I think he mentioned 10000) who were ready upon Notice given

but the Backwardness of the Duke of <hi>Monmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the rest to joyn with him, with whom (if he could be gained)
he intended to Couple me for the raising of <hi>Essex,</hi> and that the

Conduct of the City Affairs, together with very many Eminent Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
who desired to have their Names spared till the time of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with many other particulars too long to be enumerated in this
short Summary.</p>
               <p>To all this I answered, That I was glad to hear and was willing
to take it upon his Credit, that the City was in as great a readiness
for Action as he had exprest; and that there would be so considerable a
Body of Horse brought out of the Country for their Aid as he had
intimated, nor did I doubt but he had prudently provided for all the
requisites to so great an undertaking. But withal that I could not
but be much surprized to hear that there should be so great a misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
betwixt him and those Noble Lords whose Concurrence
I thought absolutely necessary for so great a Work, that if they had
failed him (as he had related) after an appointment made, they
had acted very unsuitably to the Character they bore, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
forfeit the opinion was had of them, that I must be allowed
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iberty to discourse with them about it and till then to suspend
as well my Censure of them as the Resignation of my self to him
in the matters propounded by him; upon these terms I parted from
him promising to see him again within a day or two.</p>
               <p>The next day I went to <hi>Moor-Park,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>
then was and in short acquainted him with what I had heard, as
well concerning himself as the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> &amp;c. He absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
that he, or (as he believed) my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> had ever made
any such appointment with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> that they were
altogether Ignorant of what was doing by the said Earl, who for
some time (upon what <hi>Capricio</hi> he knew not) had withdrawn himself
from them and acted upon separate Councils of his own grounded
(as he feared) upon the hasty Conceptions of some Hot-headed
Men, who might lead him into some untimely undertaking, which
in all probability would prove fatal to himself and all the Party:
For prevention of which he said he would be glad (if he knew
where) to give him a Meeting, and to resettle a better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him.</p>
               <p>Having had this Account from the Duke I made a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

present misapprehensions they had of each other, as also for the
Consolidating them into such an Union and Concert of Councils as
might render them all joyntly helpful to the Common Interest by
an harmonious and uniform Acting to the same end in which they
did all agree however they might differ in the means. This I urged
upon him with all the vehemency that the nature and importance
of the thing required, but he still persisted in a refusal of a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
saying with some more than ordinary warmth, That he had
long discovered in the Duke a backwardness to Action, by which
they had lost great opportunities, that he had cause to suspect that

People (so he termed that Imaginary Army in the City) were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient

could not safely retreat: The intention of an Insurrection being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnnicated
to so many that it was morally impossible to keep it from
taking Air if it was not speedily brought into Act, that one of his
Friends (whom I afterwards understood to be <hi>Rombald)</hi> had drawn
almost an Hundred Horse into <hi>London</hi> by small and unobservable
Parties a little before <hi>Michael<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

here a good while at their Expence) were again retired to their
respective places of Abode; That such frequent Disappointments
would weary the Party and flat their Spirits and make them at last
resolve to sit down in a total Despondency; But it was much to be
feared the Duke acted with a Prospect very different from theirs,
he designing nothing more than the Advancing himself whilst they
could not hope that ever their Liberties should be well secured for
the future, but under the Government of a Commonwealth: That
for these Reasons he was fully determined to be no longer expectant
upon the Duke's Motions, but would pursue his former intentions
of Attempting the deliverance of his Country by the help of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Brisk party in the City, with whom if the rest of the Lords
would be co-operating they might share with him in the glory
of so honourable an Undertaking, but if they would not he hoped
he should be able to effect the Work without them.</p>

               <p>AFter the Death of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> it was considered, That
as there had appeared both in City and Country, a very prompt
and forward disposition to Action; so it might justly be feared that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the minds of Men might (in time) stagnate into a dull Inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
unless proper Acts were used to keep up the fermentation, or
(which was equally dangerous) that the unadvised Passions of a
Multitude might precipitate them into some rash and ill-guided un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
unless they were under the steering and direction of
some steady and skilful hand. For prevention of both these Evils,
it was thought necessary that some few persons should be united into
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99396:38"/>
a Cabal or Council, which should be as a concealed Spring both to
give and to guide the motion of the Machine.</p>
               <p>The persons designed to this general Care were the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> Mr. <hi>Algernoon Sidney,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Hambden</hi> Junior, and another whose Abilities and Qualifications did
in no degree fit him for such a Province.</p>
               <p>The first Meeting of these Six was about the middle of <hi>Ianuary</hi> at
Mr. <hi>Hambdens</hi> House, at which Consultation there was only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
some General Heads, which were afterwards (upon more
mature thoughts) to be Debated, <hi>viz.</hi> Where the Insurrection
should be first made, whether in the City or in the more remote
parts of the Country, or in both at the same instant; what Counties
were thought to be best disposed to, and best fitted for this enterprize;
what Persons in the respective Counties were the most useful and
most ready to be engaged; what Towns easiest to be gained, and
the most proper for a general Rendezvous: what Arms were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be provided, how to be got, where to be disposed, what
sum of Money was of absolute necessity to answer publick occasions;
how and by what Methods such a sum of Money was to be raised
so as not to draw into observation, nor to administer occasion of
jealousie: And lastly, which was the principal and thought to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the chiefest Care, how <hi>Scotland</hi> might be drawn into a Concert
with <hi>England</hi> and which Persons there fittest to be Consulted withal
about this Matter.</p>
               <p>This was the sum of that days Conference.</p>
               <p>The second Meeting was about 10 days after, at the Lord <hi>Russels</hi>
House, where were present every one of the foresaid Six.</p>
               <p>At this Meeting it was propounded that a speedy understanding
should be settled with the Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> and that in order thereunto
some fit Person or Persons should be thought of to be sent to him,
and to be a constant <hi>medium</hi> of Correspondence betwixt him and them
that care should be taken to be rightly informed of a true state of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> of the general Bent and Inclination of the People, of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
or Incapacities they were under, and that some trusty Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
should be forthwith dispatched thither to invite two or three
of the most valuable Gentlemen of that County into <hi>England</hi> to the
end they might be advised with about the general Design.</p>
               <p>The Persons nominated to be called into <hi>England,</hi> were the Lord
<hi>Melvin,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Cockran,</hi> and I remember another Gentleman of the
Family and Alliance of the Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> who (if I mistake not) was
of the same Name also, and a Knight, but of this I retein but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct
remembrance.</p>
               <p>Some other things were considered of, but of no great moment.</p>
               <p>At the Conclusion of this Meeting it was agreed, that there should
not be any other Meeting of this Cabal (unless in case of some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Emergency) until the return of the Messenger sent from
hence, and the arrival of the foresaid Gentlemen out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               <head>A Supplement of some things which (upon recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
have occurr'd to my memory since my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Information.</head>
               <p>I Remember that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> complaining of divers persons
who had deserted him and fell short of their Engagements to him,
amongst the rest named his Cousin <hi>Charleton</hi> (meaning Mr. <hi>Charleton</hi>
of <hi>Totteridg)</hi> who (he said) had promis'd and was able to bring in
great assistance to him, upon which he did much rely, but was quite
fallen from him, and had so wholly attacht himself to the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> and my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> that he would act only by their
measure.</p>
               <p>Speaking also of Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> He said that he was very forward
in the Work, and very active in it; And being told by me, that amongst
other things which were wanting in such Enterprize, the want of some
Great Guns seemed to me not to be the least. He told me that they
should be furnished with two Drakes by a Friend (whom he did not
name) which two Drakes I have since thought may be those two
small Pieces found with Major <hi>Wildman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Person mentioned in my former Narrative who (as my Lord
<hi>Shaftsbury</hi> said) had offered to kill the Duke with his own hands, I
do now distinctly remember to be Mr. <hi>Iohn Ayloffe,</hi> to whom he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>[No</hi> Jack <hi>thou shalt not kill him till we have an Arm'd Force to
Iustifie it.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the 10th or 12th of <hi>October</hi> after a stop put to the then
intended Insurrection, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> told me that he had
seriously thought of it (meaning the Insurrection) and that after
divers ways proposed and seriously considered of he was clearly of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that there was nothing so easie to be accomplished, nor so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
to do the Work effectually as to fall in upon the King at <hi>Newmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
with a smart party of Horse of about Forty or Fifty, which he said
he could soon have in a readiness. To which I answered, That I was
of the same opinion, but whether or not it would be decent for him
to appear in person in an Attack to be made when the King was
in Person deserved his consideration. Two days after I spoke to
him of it again, and ask'd him what thought he had of it; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
me that it could not be brought about soon enough. After
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99396:39"/>
which I never Discoursed more with him about it; but upon refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I am apt to think that from this time and not before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Way-laying the King in his return to <hi>London</hi> was first me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated,
and I am the more confirmed in this Opinion from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the behaviour of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and Lord <hi>Grey</hi>
who seemed to be very big of Expectation of some great thing to be
attempted upon the day of the King's coming from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which day (as I have before observed) Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi>
was not to be found till the King's Coaches were come into
Town, and I do verily believe he was to have headed the Party. To
this also may be added, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> within few days
after told me that he had that day given order to have his Horses car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into <hi>London</hi> to have been in a readiness to have Mounted upon any
Emergency.</p>
               <p>I do further call to mind, That there is a considerable Person
living in <hi>Spittle-Fields</hi> whom I very well know, and have often been
in his Company (but cannot remember his name distinctly) this
Man I have been told did undertake to bring in two or three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Men upon the strength of his own Interest when occasion should
require; He is well known to Mr. <hi>West.</hi>

            <p>SIR <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> was at the Meeting at Mr. <hi>Shephards</hi> when

it would be to surprize them.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> did tell that <hi>Gibbons</hi> came to him and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him that Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> and he had been to see the Earl of <hi>Bedfords</hi>
Garden and told him that was a fit place to take off the King and
Duke at, but in other Terms which now I have forgot.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> did come to me the Sunday night after the
Fire at <hi>Newmarket</hi> and told me that he just came from <hi>Ferguson,</hi>
and that notwithstanding they returned so soon <hi>Ferguson</hi> did not
doubt to have Men ready by that time to do the business and desired
me to go with him to <hi>Fergusons</hi> Lodging in his Coach which I did,
when I came there <hi>Ferguson</hi> told me the same but that they wanted
Mony, Mr. <hi>Charleton</hi> not being to be found, upon which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>
desired me to lend some and he would see me repaid and said if he had
been in stock he would have done it himself; upon their perswasion

            <p>After the Discovery Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> came one night and told me he
wondred I was not gone and did importune me to be gone with

               </gap>ed, and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Subject do here most faithfully, according to the best of my
Remembrance, give you an Account of what I knew concerning
the late discovered Conspiracy, how I came to be concerned, how
far I was concerned; how it was to have been carried on in <hi>Bristol:</hi>
why I did not come in at the first Discovery, and cast my self at Your
Majesties Feet for Mercy; how I made my escape, and where I was
till taken. If I shall through forgetfulness omit any thing that it may
be thought I am privy to, I shall be ready and willing truly to answer
any question that shall be asked by Your Majesty, or any Your most
Honorable Privy-Council, no way despairing of Your Majesties Mercy,
but remain in hopes that that Fountain of Mercy which hath so
abundantly flowed from Your Sacred Breast ever since Your happy
Restauration is not yet Dry, and that there is some drops left for me,
who doubt not but to Serve Your Majesty both at home and abroad,
much more Living than my Death will.</p>
            <p>That which I have cause to impute the occasion of my being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
was my too Publick Spirit, preferring Your Majesties and
my Countries Interest much before my own, but especially in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the two last Parliaments, promoting an Act for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Linnen Manufacture,</hi> and the preventing of Frauds in Your
Majesties Customs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which would have brought in, and saved
to Your Majesty near 200000 <hi>l. per An.</hi> and employed many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is well known to many Worthy Persons about
your Court, and indeed proved my Ruine, otherwise than in this
Concern, by bringing me into too great Acquaintance for one of my
Capacity, and by that to be concerned as I was. My Attendance on
those two Parliaments I doubt have been mis-represented.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>How far I was Concerned:</head>
               <p>After the Dissolution of the two last Parliaments, I observed a great
dissatisfaction in People in most parts where I travelled, but heard
nothing of any Design till <hi>Iuly</hi> 1682. when one Mr. <hi>Ioseph Tyly</hi> of
<hi>Bristol</hi> came from <hi>London;</hi> I meeting with him; asked What News,
he answered to this effect, All bad, and if some speedy course be not
taken we shall be all undone, for by their Arbitrary, Illegal ways and
by force of Arms they have got Sheriffs to their Minds, Witnesses they
had before, but wanted Jurors to believe them, now they have got
Sheriffs, naming Mr. <hi>North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> who will find Jurors to
believe any Evidence against a Protestant, and so hang up all the
Kings Friends by degrees; I then told him that I thought it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99396:41"/>
such things could be done, but the King must hear of it; no said
he, there's none suffered to come near the King, but those who have
been declared Enemies to the King and Kingdom by Parliament, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some that were mentioned in the Printed Votes, who to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do indeavour to keep all such things from the Kings knowledge,
and perswade him against Parliaments, with much more such-like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
by which I found the same was discoursed throughout <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> as a means to engage People. At length
he told me that the Protestant Gentry, naming the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi>
Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Estrick</hi> and others were come to a Resolution, seeing
fair means would not do, but all things on the Protestants side are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented
to the King by such great Criminals, and none more in
favor than those, to take the King from his Evil Council, and that by
an Insurrection in several parts of <hi>England</hi> at once, <hi>viz. London,
Bristol, Taunton, Exeter, Chester, New-Castle, York,</hi> and some other
places in the <hi>North,</hi> and that there would be a considerable party rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and another in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Therefore, said he, we must
consider how to manage affairs in Bristol, for if they proceed at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi>
in choosing Lord Mayor as they did Sheriffs, and to swearing
of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> it must begin in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November,</hi> otherwise
there will be some Sham-Plot contrived to take off most of the Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Men in the last Parliaments; with much other Discourse to the
same effect, adding, that Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> would come down very suddenly,
by whom we might expect a full Account of all. About the end of
<hi>August</hi> as near as I can remember, Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> came down, who confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what Mr. <hi>Tyly</hi> had said, but could say little as to any farther
Resolution they were come to above, either of any Time or Method
agreed upon, but that the Design went on, and men were imployed in
all parts to try how people were inclined, who found enough ready
and that there would be no want of Men, if it was once begun. Then
we considered how it might be managed in <hi>Bristol,</hi> and what Number
of men might be needful for the first Onset; towards which he said,
We might depend on 150 Men from <hi>Taunton</hi> or thereabouts, and
concluded that 350 might be sufficient to secure it without the
Bloodshed of one man, it being our Design to shed no Blood if possible,
but this we resolved not to acquaint any of our Friends with, till
the Day and Method was resolved, of which he said we should have
ten or fourteen days notice; and having soon considered of a Method,
waited in expectation of further Advice, but none came till <hi>November;</hi>
then we heard that some dis-appointment happening they were forced
to delay it, though there was more and more cause for it. The end of
<hi>December</hi> or beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> had advice that it was deferred to
the beginning of <hi>March.</hi> The third of <hi>March</hi> I came to <hi>London,</hi> and
meeting with Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> asked him how things went, who answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he could not tell what to make of it, for he could find nothing
done more than was nine Months before. The Great Persons who
were the Managers having done nothing but talkt of things,
but now there was some others appointed to manage it, who
were Men of Business naming them to me, <hi>viz.</hi> The Earl of
<hi>Essex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Estrick,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Russel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and Mr. <hi>Charlton,</hi> who he did suppose would make some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, and not do as the others had done, make a years talk to

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are many thousands of people to no purpose; for these had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
sent Messengers into <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to know their minds,
naming one <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and at the return of
the Messengers would come to a resolution as to time and method, but
he was confident they could not be ready before <hi>Midsummer</hi> by reason
they had done so little in order to it. Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> was then design'd
into the <hi>West</hi> upon the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi>'s Business, and said if he
could understand any thing more before he left <hi>London</hi> he would take
<hi>Bristol</hi> in his way and acquaint us with it. This Journey he brought
me to Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> with whom we had little discourse, he being
going forth with his Lady. The sixth of <hi>March</hi> I left <hi>London,</hi> and
went directly for <hi>Bristol;</hi> about the twelfth of <hi>March</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade</hi>
came to <hi>Bristol,</hi> but then could say no more than as above, the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
being not come back from <hi>Scotland</hi> nor <hi>Ireland</hi> and was of
his former opinion, that if any thing were done, it could not be before
<hi>Midsummer,</hi> he then expected to be about two Months in the West,
and said that if any thing was agreed upon sooner, one Mr. <hi>West</hi> a
Councellor had promised to write to him in the name of <hi>Inglestone,</hi>
and direct his Letter to be left at his Brothers in <hi>Bristol,</hi> who <hi>Wade</hi>
ordered that if any such Letter came, to open it, and if any thing
material in it, to send it by a Messenger to him into the West. About
the 17th of <hi>March</hi> came a Letter for him from <hi>West</hi> in the name
of <hi>Inglestone,</hi> which his Brother opened, and not understanding the
Stile, brought it to me, but I knew not the meaning thereof. The
Contents was to desire Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> to get his Clients together
the next <hi>Saturday</hi> come Fortnight, for that was the day appointed
to Seal the Writings, and neither of us understanding it, his Brother
sent it by a Messenger after him, who found him at <hi>Taunton,</hi> and
his Answer by the Messenger was, that he knew not the meaning
of it, but should be within ten Miles of <hi>Bristol</hi> the next <hi>Saturday,</hi>
desiring that if any other Letter came, to send it to him. About
three days after came another Letter as above, desiring him not to
call his Clients together, for the time of Sealing was put off, which
Letter was also sent to him, but he understood it not, saying, it was
some rash business or other and so went back again.</p>
               <p>The fifth of <hi>April</hi> I came to <hi>London,</hi> and that evening went to
Mr. <hi>Wests</hi> Chamber in the <hi>Temple</hi> where I found him, who then did
not know me, but when I told him my Name, from whence I came,
and mentioned the two Letters Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> received from him, he
began to be somewhat free in Discourse with me. I then told him
that Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> and his Friends were surprised at the Letters, not
knowing what he meant by them, and did desire to know, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which he seemed a little shie, but after a little Discourse, began
to tell me, saying, There was a Design to take off the King and Duke
coming from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> which they expected would have been
that <hi>Saturday</hi> mentioned in his Letter, had not the Fire happened,
which caused them to come sooner; Nay, said he, had we known
they would have stayed so long as they did; their business should
have been done: I then asked him what he meant by desiring Mr.
<hi>Wade</hi> to get his Clients together by that day, and what he could
propose they should have done, to which he could say little, only
that they might be ready. I then told him, that I thought it a
very rash thing, and that few in <hi>England</hi> would approve of it, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99396:42"/>
I was sure none about us would, being a most Cowardly dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
action, besides the basest sin of Murther; Then, said he, what
is designed by the General Design but to take them both off, and if
it had been done that way, it would have prevented a great deal of
Bloodshed in the Nation; No, said I, no such thing is designed as I
know of, the General Design being only to get the King off from his
evil Counsels, who had advised him to put a stop to Proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Popish Plotters by Dissolving of Parliaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to
bring all Popish Offenders to Justice, and such who had betrayed
the Liberty of the Subject; and this I think was all the Discourse
we had at that time, being the first of my acquaintance with him:
that night I went with him to a Tavern in <hi>Fleetstreet,</hi> where was
Captain <hi>Norton, Richard Goodenough,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Aylif,</hi> who,
to my knowledge, I never saw before nor since; whilst I was with
them there was no Discourse of any Business, but I soon left them
together. The next day Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> of <hi>Bristol,</hi> brought me to Mr.
<hi>Ferguson,</hi> at the House of one Mr. <hi>Bourne</hi> a Brewer, but was not
admitted to see him himself; <hi>Ferguson</hi> then went by the Name of
<hi>Roberts,</hi> who when I had told my Name and from whence I came,
was pretty free in Discourse with me, and told me the Design went
on very well, that there were some <hi>Scotish</hi> Gentlemen come up,
who were treating with the Managers, and did hope they would
agree in fews days, and come to a Resolution both as to time and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
of which we should have timely notice, but by all his Discourse
at that time I could not perceive that he knew any thing of the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market</hi>
Design.</p>
               <p>That day I had some discourse with Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> at his house
who I found was privy to the <hi>Newmarket</hi> Business, and his Opinion
was that the General Design would come to nothing, for he did not
approve of the Managers actings, and said there was nothing like the
other Design, for that would put an end to all in a little time; when I
told him that I thought none in our parts would be for it which I
think was all the Discourse we then had, only he promised that if
any thing was agreed before Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> came up, I should hear of
it, so I took leave and went for <hi>Bristol</hi> the next morning. About ten

to advise) I wrote to Mr. <hi>West</hi> desiring to know how they
went on, who wrote me that they still met with delays, and were
come to no Conclusion, after that I heard no more till <hi>May.</hi> About
the beginning of <hi>May</hi> I came up to <hi>London</hi> again, in Company with
Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> and some other <hi>Bristol</hi> men, but when we came up, my
Business being in the City, and theirs about the <hi>Temple,</hi> we parted;
after two or three days I met with Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> and asked how he found
things, who told me, he doubted all would prove a Sham, for he
thought there was nothing intended, finding nothing materially
done in order to what had been so long discoursed. Then we went
to Mr. <hi>West,</hi> and discoursed him fully about the Contents of his
Letters, who told us, they were resolved to kill the King and Duke
as they came from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> in order to which, he had provided
Arms for fifty Men, Pistols, Carbines and Blunderbusses, and that
they were promised the House of one <hi>Rumbald</hi> a Malster, which lay
in the Road, and the King must come by his Door, there the men
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99396:42"/>
should have been Lodged. Then we asked who was to have acted
it, to which he could give but a slender Answer, and could or w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

name but two Men, who were <hi>Rombald</hi> and his Brother, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if they could have raised six or eight hundred pounds to have bought
Horses, and something to encourage men, they should have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
men enough; so that we found they had few men, if more than
two, and no Horses, only a parcel of Arms, which afterwards he
shewed us at a Gun-smiths House in a little Lane near <hi>Temple-Bar.</hi>
Then we asked him what they designed if it had taken effect, to
which he answered, that the men should have come up with all
speed to <hi>London</hi> and dispersed themselves immediatly, declaring
for the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and that the King and Duke being dead,
no opposition could be made; then we asked who were for this
Design, he named Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> and <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> and,
as far as I can remember, no more; so we found it was carried on
by them contrary to the knowledge or approbation of those who
managed the General Design: then we declared our great dislike of
it, telling him, it was a base Dishonourable and Cowardly Action,
and would seem odious to all the World, that any pretending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Protestants, should be concerned in such a Bloody Action,
and that we thought it was his Cowardize put him upon it; to
which he said, that he could not Fight, but would be as forward
with his Money as any of his Capacity. Then we went to Colonel
<hi>Romzey,</hi> who we found to be wholly of <hi>Wests</hi> Opinion, saying, that
except something be done that way, I know nothing will be done at
all, for he knew the other Managers would do nothing; so we
had little Discourse at that time. After this we went to <hi>Ferguson,</hi>
who told us how things stood; we then found that he knew of both
Designs, but was only for the Insurrection, and told us, that the
Managers had been Treating with some <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen; that
they were almost agreed, and the Money they were to be supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, would be ready in three or four days, being ten thousand
pounds which was to be returned to <hi>Holland</hi> to buy Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for
<hi>Scotland.</hi> He also told us that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen had made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proposal to the Managers, thus, If they would supply them
with thirty thousand pounds, they would begin it in <hi>Scotland</hi> first,
which they could soon have, and then would Invade <hi>England,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
the Managers only to get a Party in the North of <hi>England,</hi>
ready to oppose any Force from coming out of <hi>England</hi> against
them, before they had setled <hi>Scotland:</hi> but this was not approved
of, the Managers chusing rather to supply them with 10000 l. and
to begin it in <hi>England</hi> the same time. Then we daily expected
to hear when the Mony would be paid, but still found nothing but
delays, the Managers not agreeing how to raise the Mony, and that
if the Mony had been ready, they were come to no Conclusion as to
any method more than they were nine months before, having done
nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t talked to ensnare people, reporting about in all parts
how the Liberties of the people were daily more and more infringed,
and that Arbitrary Government and Popery was coming in apace;
which incensed people very much, and made such a grumbling in all
parts, that we fear'd lenger delays would make the common people
in many parts mutiny, it being as we thought so gen'rally known;
except something was suddainly done, it was impossible it should
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99396:43"/>
remain undiscovered; so the next time we met with <hi>Romzey</hi> and
<hi>Ferguson</hi> (tho never together) we declared our dissatisfaction by
Reason of such long delaies, and spoke it so as that it might come to
the managers Ears, as we suppose it did, being to this effect: That
we thought they had only a design to betray people, drawing many
thousands into a snare, for their actions shewed little otherwise,
being so long discoursing a thing of that nature, and done so little
towards it: few days after meeting with <hi>Romzey</hi> again, he told us
they were of different opinions concerning a method, some for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
the Insurrection only in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> some for it
in all places at once as at first proposed, others for several places in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not in <hi>London,</hi> saying, that if it was not
begun in <hi>London,</hi> but in other places, there would be forces raised in
<hi>London</hi> to send out against them, which would take out most of their
strength, and that then <hi>London</hi> might be easily secured; somtimes
they were for beginning it only in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to
have people come up to <hi>London</hi> from all parts of <hi>England:</hi> to which
we answered, that we though no way better than what was first
proposed, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the beginning of it in many places at once, as
before mentioned, for although we had engaged none in or about
<hi>Bristol,</hi> nor should not endeavour it till all things were concluded,
yet with the assistance we were promised from <hi>Taunton,</hi> did not
doubt but to get men enough to secure it, and that we knew not
where to get ten men that would come for <hi>London,</hi> and supposed it
might be so in other places, men might be willing to secure their
own Country, who would not be willing to leave all and come for
<hi>London. Romzey</hi> then said, if he knew where to get at the head of
1000 men, he would begin it presently, and desired that we might
meet the next night with some others and consider of things; so
the next afternoon we met at <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-House near <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi>
and from thence to a Tavern near, I think called the little or
young Devil Tavern, where met eight persons, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Colonel
<hi>Romzey, Robert West,</hi> Captain <hi>Norton,</hi> Captain <hi>Walcot, Richard
Goodenough, Francis Goodenough, Nathaniel Wade</hi> and my self (this
was the first time I knew <hi>Walcot.)</hi> When we were all fit, <hi>Colonel
Romzey</hi> spoke to this effect, as near as I can remember the same words:
Gentlemen, If we can raise three thousand men in and about <hi>London,</hi>
there is a person of Honour will appear at the head of them and begin
the business; which we supposed to be the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and do
not well remember whether he mentioned his name or not. Which
proposal much surprized Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> and I, that he should then question
the raising of 3000 men, whereas when it was first mentioned to us, we
thought they had been sure of many thousands in <hi>London</hi> at an hours
warning. Then it was considered how 3000 men might be raised, and
how they might do something to the purpose: Then we declared
what method we had concluded on for the management of Affairs
in <hi>Bristol,</hi> which was as followeth, and they could think of no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way: so it was concluded that <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs should
be divided into Twenty parts, and one man made choice of in each
divisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, who should chuse out ten in his division that he could trust,
and each of those ten to find out fifteen, which would make 161 in
each division; so that twenty divisions would produce 3220. In
order to which, a Map of <hi>London</hi> was to be bought the next day,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99396:43"/>
and each division drawn out in a particular Paper, mentioning every
Street and Lane of note in it, with the North, East, South and
West bounds thereof, and to be brought the next Meeting two or
three nights after; at the first Meeting it was agreed, that none should
know of this Design, <hi>viz.</hi> (of the chief Managers) till all the Men
were secured, and that those seven (I being not to stay long in
<hi>London</hi>) should meet every two or three nights till all was compleated.
At this meeting <hi>Romzey</hi> and <hi>West</hi> would be often saying, there was
nothing like the lopping business, meaning the taking off the King
and Duke, and that it might be easily done as they went to or from
<hi>Windsor,</hi> or to or from the <hi>Play-House,</hi> but I never heard any agree
with them in it. Next Day a Map was bought and brought to <hi>West</hi>'s
Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi> where some met to divide it and draw out the
divisions against the next meeting. The next place we met at I think was
the Castle-Tavern in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> where some of the divisions were
brought, all being not done, and then it was consider'd how they
should be distributed, being we were most strangers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and agreed,
that <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> who had been Under-Sheriff, and so had a
general Acquaintance, should do it, who was willing to undertake it,
the rest of the divisions to be ready against the next meeting, which
was two or three Nights after at the Green-Dragon Tavern upon
<hi>Snow-Hill,</hi> where when Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> came he told us, That he
had disposed of some of them, and did hope it would take effect, and
that in a week or ten Days he should have fixed the twenty Men;
the consideratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> how things should be manag'd, was deferred till
they were sure of the Men, only some mention'd their Opinions how
the <hi>Tower, Whitehal,</hi> and other places might be best surprised. The
<hi>Tower</hi> was thought might be best gained in the Day time, <hi>Whitehal</hi>
and other places in the night, with many such things in way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
<hi>Romzey</hi> was still upon the old strain of killing the King and
the Duke, saying at this the last meeting I was at, (going for <hi>Bristol</hi>
next Morning) that it might be done in <hi>Windsor-Park,</hi> and that he
would undertake it, but not except every one there present would go
with him, to which not one con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nted, I replying, that I was for no
such thing; but seeing the other business had gone so far, and was
known to so many, if they could bring it to bear in <hi>London</hi> and other
places, I rashly said, rather than fail of <hi>Bristol</hi> we will undertake it
at Noon-Day with an Hundred Men: to which <hi>Romzey</hi> said I was
a bold fellow; they then promised (when they were sure of the
Men) to advise and take care for some Arms for us at <hi>Bristol,</hi> and
that we should have some Great Person come down to Head us; but
I heard no more till the news of the Discovery came in publick
Letters. I remember one time when <hi>VVade</hi> and I was with <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson,</hi>
he told us that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was brought to a low
Condition, all his Places being taken from him, and his Tenants in
<hi>Scotland</hi> (being so severely dealt with upon account of their Religion)
were not able to pay Rent; so that his Estate there, which was
accounted worth Ten or Twelve Thousand Pound <hi>per An.</hi> did
not yield him the last Year Two Thousand Pound, that he was
not well pleased with the management of Affairs, and desired
Mr. <hi>VVade</hi> to Appoint a place where he would meet the Lord <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> to discourse them; to which
Mr. <hi>VVade</hi> replyed, he would meet none of them, for such Great
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99396:44"/>
Men had betrayed the Nation already, and ensnar'd too many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands

            <div type="part">
               <head>How it was to have been acted in Bristol.</head>
               <p>We concluded that the only way to secure <hi>Bristol</hi> would be by a
surprize, which with about 350 Men (150 of which we depended
on from <hi>Taunton,</hi> the other 200 to be raised in and about the City)
might easily be done about 4 of the Clock in the Morning, as soon
as the watch were gone off, without the Bloodshed of one Man, thus,
dividing the City into fourteen parts, so making thirteen Posts besides
the main Guard, which should at first have been at the <hi>Toulsey</hi> (which
is in <hi>Bristol</hi> as the Exchange here) we supposed 20 Men might be
sufficient for each Post, and the remainder for the main Guard, out
of which might be spared 4 or 6 Files to be constantly marching
about, and to assist where there might be occasion. The method we
designed for the raising 200 Men in and about the City was thus, first
to find out 30 Men, 2 for each Post, and 4 for the main Guard, who
might be able each of them to procure 6 and to command them, which
would have made 14 for each Post, and 28 for the main Guard, to
whom the <hi>Taunton</hi> Men should be added, (<hi>viz.</hi>) 6 to each Post, and
the remainder to the main Guard, who should have come in the Day
before, some at every entrance of the City, and lodge themselves at
Inns and Ale-Houses as near the Posts they were appointed for as they
could: Each Man being to know his Post and Commanders before they
came; the <hi>Bristol</hi> Men to Lodge themselves and Arms, with Arms
for the <hi>Taunton</hi> Men, in an House as near as possible to their Posts, and
to send one out from each Post, between Three and Four of the Clock
in the Morning to observe the motion of the Watch, and to advise as
soon as they were gone off, that they might all immediately repair to
their respective Posts, calling the <hi>Taunton</hi> Men; and as soon as they
had gained their Posts, to send out a File of musquetiers to fetch in such
and such men in each of their Divisions as they should have had an
account of before, and convey them to the main Guard, which in
the fourteen Divisions would have been about Sixty Persons, Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion-Officers
and others; then to fetch in all the Arms and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they could find, which two things being done (as we supposed
might be in a little time, and without any opposition, the Posts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so near each other, that it would have been impossible for any
Number to get together) we resolved next to declare the reasons for
our taking up Arms, and to encourage all to come in to us that we
could trust, not doubting but we should soon have had many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
in the City, and out of the adjacent Counties, <hi>Glocester, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi>
and <hi>Wilts.</hi>

               <head>The Reason why I did not come in, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>When the News of the Discovery first came to <hi>Bristol,</hi> and some
time before, I was in some trouble by my Creditors, and forc'd to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scond
tho' thought I had sufficient to pay them, only desired time
to get in my effects, their Mercy I feared more than your Majesties,
and thought if I should come in and find mercy with your Majesty, I
could at first expect no better than a Prison, and if from it discharged
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99396:44"/>
by your Majesty, to be kept in by them upon account of my Debts.
Secondly, hearing there was very many (in and about <hi>Bristol</hi>) sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be concerned, and I (tho' knowing so much) being able to
prove so little against any Man, but such against whom there was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

it having been our resolution not to discover the Design to any of our
Friends till the Managers had agreed both upon time and method,
therefore considered how to make my escape, there being then a strict
search in all Ports, thought best to continue in <hi>England</hi> for some time,
till the heat might be over, and so got an ordinary habit and a little
Horse about 40 Shillings Price, and travell'd the Country as a Man
dealing in Wool, in <hi>Gloucester-shire, Oxford-shire</hi> and <hi>Summerset-shire,</hi>
till about the middle of <hi>August,</hi> then repaired towards <hi>Bristol,</hi> and by
Letter with my Wifes Assistance (all other Friends thereabout
fearing to act for me) prevailed with a Poor Man who had a small
Boat about Ten Tuns, for Twenty Pounds reward and the like <hi>per</hi>
Month, for six Months, to go with me for <hi>France,</hi> and from thence
to the <hi>West-Indies</hi> or where I would, my Name being then in no
Proclamation or Declaration, if it had I should not have prevailed
with the Man to go with me. So the Twenty third of <hi>August</hi> Sailed
from <hi>Kings-Road</hi> for <hi>Rochell,</hi> the 25th. proving bad whether, crackt
our Mast, and so put into St. <hi>Ives</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where we stayed till
the fourth of <hi>September,</hi> then put out again for <hi>Rochell,</hi> but meeting
with contrary Winds was forced into several places in <hi>France,</hi> and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not our Port till the Seventeenth. In <hi>Rochell</hi> I loaded her with
Brandy and other Goods, and the fourth of <hi>October</hi> Sailed from thence
for the <hi>West-Indies</hi> (being willing to know how my Concerns lay
there, that my Creditors might have their own, tho' I knew I might
be much safer in <hi>France)</hi> and arrived at <hi>Barbadoes</hi> the eleventh of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
there I heard of my Name being in the Gazette, therefore
stayed but two Days landing part of my Cargo, from thence I went
to <hi>Antigua,</hi> where I landed and disposed of the remaining part, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there about ten Days; but it being too soon for the Crop, and
my charge being the same lying still or going farther, also thinking
it not safe to lie long there, resolved to see the rest of the <hi>Caribby-Islands,</hi>
and so went down to <hi>Mounserat, Nevis,</hi> S. <hi>Christophers,</hi> S. <hi>Estatia</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilla,</hi>
and so back again to S. <hi>Christophers,</hi> supposing that to be the safest
place, I being known to none there, where I stayed about three Weeks.
About the fourteenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> I wrote to my Factor in <hi>Nevis</hi> about
what was due to me, who on receit of my Letter discover'd me, so
that Sir <hi>William Stapleton</hi> presently sent his Warrant to St. <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
to Apprehend me, but before it came I was gone down to St.
<hi>Estatia,</hi> expecting to meet my Vessel there, which I had sent up to
<hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and it being known where I was gone, the Deputy-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of St. <hi>Christophers</hi> sent five Men with his Warrant after me, to
whom on sight thereof I submitted, tho' had an Opportunity and
might have escaped, but was rather willing to cast my self at His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Feet for Mercy, than live such a Life any longer, not daring to
appear where there was need of me (among my Factors) who I doubt
will take too much Advantage by my Troubles for my Creditors In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
In <hi>Nevis</hi> I was kept a Prisoner 13 Days, where I promised Sir
<hi>William Stapleton</hi> that I would make what Discovery I could, giving
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99396:45"/>
him the Names of some who I had acquainted with it in <hi>Bristol,</hi>
which I suppose he hath given an Account of desiring him that it
might be kept private, for if it was known they would have Advice
of it; but it was not kept so private as I expected, for the Night
I came off I was told of it, therefore suppose they were advis'd by a
<hi>Bristol</hi> Ship that came away before us, by which I wrote not a word,
I suppose she might be at home long before us, we being nine
Weeks and five Days. All that I can say against any of them,
except <hi>William Wade</hi> who is before-mention'd, is That I Acquainted
them with the business, as I believe many Thousands in <hi>England</hi> were,
and do suppose they would have been concern'd. Hereunder is an

the Design for an Insurrection, which is all that I can call to mind of

            </opener>
            <p>I Being in the Country, and to my great trouble seeing my self in his
Majesties Proclamation, I came last Night to Town, resolving to
lay my self at his Majesties Feet, let him do with me what he pleaseth;
This is the first Crime I have been Guilty of, since His Majestie's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration,
and too soon by much now: If his Majesty thinks my Death
will do him more good than my Life, God's Will and His be done. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
I sent your Honour this Letter, my Life was in my own Power but
now it is the Kings; to whom I do most humbly propose, That if his
Majesty desires it, I will Discover to him all that I know re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ting to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland;</hi> which I suppose may be something more
than the Original Discoverer was able to acquaint His Majesty with; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as to <hi>Ireland:</hi> There is not any thing his Majesty shall think fit to
ask me, but I will answer him the Truth, as pertinently and as fully as
I can. My inti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acy with a <hi>Scotch</hi> Minister, through whose Hands much
of the Business went, I judge occasioned my knowing very much: And I do
further humbly propose, That if His Majesty thinks it advisable, I
will follow those Lords and Gentlemen that are fled into <hi>Holland,</hi> as if
I fled thither, and had made my Escape also, and will acquaint the King,
if I can find it out, what Measures they resolve of taking next: I do
assure his Majesty, the business is laid very broad, or I am misinformed.
And I am sure as to that particular, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of them. There's scarce any thing done at Court, but is immediately
talk'd all the Town over; therefore if his Majesty thinks what I have
presumed to propose Advisable, I do then further most humbly Propose,
That my waiting upon his Majesty may be some time within Night, that
your Honour will acquaint me the Time and Place where I may wait upon
you, in order to it; and that it may be within Night also, and that no
body may be by, but his Majesty, and your Honour; And if his Majesty
pleaseth to Pardon my Offences for the time past, he shall find I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
my self very Loyal for the future; if not, I resolve to give his
Majesty no further troubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THe first Business was spoken of in a place and at a time he

            <p>Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> told him that the City was divided into twenty
parts, and that there was to be a Chief to every part and he was
to choose fifteen Men to assist him within his Division.</p>

<hi>20th.</hi> 1683.</p>
            <p>As to the Secrecy to be taken of the Man that was to stand in
<hi>Nisbets</hi> place. That it was an ingagement of Secrecy and some Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to try if they agreed in Principles.</p>

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:99396:49"/>Being interrogat of the account of Matters written to him by <hi>Io.</hi>
at the desire of <hi>Io. N.</hi> Declares that it was a Letter under the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
of Marriage, and that by the Marriage he understood a Rising
designed there.</p>
            <p>Being interrogat what the <hi>Merchants</hi> being low and breaking did
mean. <hi>Answers,</hi> That he thinks it means that their people, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Dissenters were breaking in their Stocks by Excommunications and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Courses, and therefore they were resolving upon desperate courses;
which was Rising in Arms.</p>
            <p>Being interrogat what is meant by the said <hi>Merchants. Answers,</hi>
Some that lived at their ease and quiet would not venture to Rise when
they saw much danger.</p>
            <p>Being interrogat what is meant by the <hi>Model of Affairs</hi> that
would make them venture. <hi>Answers,</hi> That they had shewn to <hi>Io. N.</hi>
a Model how they would go about their affairs in order to their
Rising.</p>
            <p>Being interrogat anent their Resolution to insist on Negatives, and
what were the Goods that proved prejudicial to them formerly. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,</hi>
That the meaning was, they resolved to agree in what they
would put down, which he thinks was the whole Government,
Civil and Ecclesiastick, but that they would not determine positively
what they would set up.</p>
            <p>Being interrogat what was it that <hi>Io. N.</hi> proposed to them that
they assented to. <hi>Answers,</hi> He thinks he had stated the grounds of
the quarrel Relative to the present Government, and that they had
assented to it. But declares that when <hi>Io. N.</hi> was speaking to him of
these things, he thought them of that nature that he shun'd discourse
upon them to receive Information concerning them, because he had
no mind to meddle with them.</p>
            <p>That by <hi>Criticks of the Trade,</hi> is understood the Scotch Fanaticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are nice in associating themselves.</p>
            <p>That by the <hi>dispatching of the old rotten Stuff,</hi> he thinks it the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching
of the Sectaries or the present Government, but rather thinks
it was the last.</p>
            <p>That by the Broken ones which he was to set up, is meant the
Scotch Fanaticks to be helped by Contributions, and that by their
trying their way and we ours, was meant the English was for Rising
in Arms, but the Scotch Fanaticks were for delaying some time.</p>
            <p>That by these called Treacherous Dealers, he thinks is meant both
the Secretaries and the present Government, who had formerly broke
their Government, but never heard these persons named.</p>
            <p>That they being at a point to set forward, is meant their being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for Rendevous.</p>
            <p>That by Emissaries is meant persons sent out both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>England</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to try the Peoples inclination to a Rising and to
incite them to it, and that these Merchants who advised <hi>Io. N.</hi> to send
for the Declarant to come that way were the Meetings of the Fanaticks
in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by <hi>Advancing of the Trade</hi> he thinks is meant the Carrying on
of the Rising.</p>
            <p>By that part of the Letter which tells that when the Factors
would return that matters would <hi>in instanti</hi> be off or on, That the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99396:50"/>
meaning was that when these Factors came in they expected Money
for buying of Arms and then they would instantly have Risen, but that
the Money was not come in at that time when he did meet with <hi>Io. N.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by the strange thing that might have fallen out in a week or two,
he understands no other thing than the Insurrection intended.</p>
            <p>Declares that this <hi>Io. N.</hi> was a person that past under the name of
<hi>Iohn Nisbet,</hi> an Englishman, and stayed at one Mr. <hi>Mead</hi>'s in <hi>Stepney,</hi>
which <hi>Nisbet</hi> was an Usher of a School at <hi>Bednal-green</hi> before.</p>
            <p>That the close of the Letter bearing that things were fully as high

            <p>ABout the time of the Election of <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> I heard that
there were some designs of Rising in Arms of some people in
<hi>England,</hi> and in order thereto there was some Treating with my Lord
<hi>Argile,</hi> but not agreeing to the terms my Lord left them, and I
heard it ceased for some time and went over to <hi>Holland;</hi> and when
he was there, I was informed of the renewing of the Treaty, and
agreed upon the following terms, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> should raise Seven Thousand Men, and
the Treators (who as I was informed were English-men) were to
advance the said Earl Ten Thousand pound Sterling; and this was
agreed to in <hi>April</hi> last.</p>
            <p>The persons in <hi>England</hi> were by Information the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> but after the said Earls decease I did
not hear so much of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> I was also informed of
<hi>Ford</hi> Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark</hi> his being in the Design.</p>
            <p>I was also informed that those concerned in <hi>Scotland</hi> most in the
said Design, were Sir <hi>Iohn Cockram, Ierviswood, Sessnock</hi> Elder and
Younger, and that Sir <hi>Iohn Cockram</hi> the one day kist His Majesties
Hands, the other day went to the Cabal anent the above-written
Design.</p>
            <p>I was also informed, That no small number of the Gentlemen in
the West and other places in <hi>Scotland</hi> upon their resentment of the
present Government, particularly as to the Test and other Papers
put to them, were not resolved to stand to them although they should
take them, but rise upon the first occasion.</p>
            <p>This Information I heard from <hi>Murray</hi> alias <hi>Iohnstoune,</hi> who as I
heard was a West Country-man in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who offered to take me
along to their Cabals, but upon my refusal to meddle in the designs
kept himself and told no more than those generals.</p>

of <hi>Kyle</hi> in the Fields about two years ago; and
there were about Fourscore persons or thereby;
and that he was brought there from his own House by
one <hi>Io. Nisbet,</hi> whom the Declarant knows not further than
that he is a West-Country-man about <hi>Glasgow;</hi> and that <hi>Io. Nis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi>
is another <hi>Io. Nisbet</hi> that wrote a Letter to him to <hi>Holland</hi>
under the notion of Trade, relating to the Rising and Rebellion in
<hi>England.</hi> And farther, That about a year and half ago he met
with another Convention consisting of fourscore persons or thereby
in the Fields within five miles of the former place near <hi>Inner-Kirk,</hi>
and that very few of them had Swords; to which Meeting he was
advertised to come by a Letter sent to his House subscribed by Mr.
<hi>Iames Kennick</hi> who is Clerk to the Convention and heard of no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
being amongst them at either of these times and says there
were people there from all the Districts in the several Shires of the
Kingdom: which Districts he was informed were fourscore; and
that he knew none of the persons in either of these Meetings except
Mr. <hi>Iames Kennick</hi> the Clerk, the said <hi>Io. Nisbet</hi> who came from a
District besides <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Iames Stewarts</hi> who came
out of <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Robert Speir</hi> who came from the <hi>Lothians,</hi> and
one <hi>Forrest</hi> who came from the Upperward of <hi>Cluyd</hi> and that
at these general meetings they produced their Commissions from the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99396:54"/>
several Districts to the Clerk that it might appear that they were
commissionate to get relief for the distrest in their bounds, that the
business of the Convention was to provide for those amongst them
were in want and for their own security against the dangers they
were in, being denounced Fugitives from the Laws, and in hazard
to be catcht by the Governours; and that he heard nothing treated or
spoke amongst them as to rising in Arms, nor knows of any Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
these of the Convention had with any in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and as
to <hi>England</hi> he supposes there was a Correspondence there, but knows
not these that managed it, except the said <hi>Io. Nisbet,</hi> he having shewn
the Declarant a Letter he had from <hi>Michael Sheills</hi> one of the Clerks of
the Convention, which he saw in the end of <hi>March</hi> or beginning of <hi>April</hi>
last.</p>
            <p>To the second Interrogator, the reason why he accepted of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
produced, declares, He accepted it upon the account to see if
there could be a way found for the distrest Brethren to go abroad, or to
have something from abroad to maintain them there.</p>
            <p>To the third Interrogator declares, He remembers no more persons
were present but these condescended upon in the first Interrogator, which
he says was occasioned by his being so long abroad; and although upon
seeing their faces he might know several of them, yet knows not their
Names, nor the places of their Residence.</p>
            <p>To the fourth declares, The said general Conventions were composed
of persons sent from the several Districts, of which there were as he
heard about fourscore in number, in which fourscore Districts he was
told there would have been six or seven thousand men, but knows not
of any Gentlemen or leading Men amongst them. As to the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
it was sent him to <hi>Newcastle</hi> by a common Receiver whom he knows
not, directed to him at his Lodging at the Sign of the Vine in the <hi>Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi>
in <hi>Newcastle,</hi> his Landlords Name being <hi>George Marshal</hi> a publick Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,
and addrest to him under the Name of <hi>La Graveil,</hi> being the
Name he went by, and that the same was under a Cover of <hi>Iames Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
their Clerk who subscribed it.</p>
            <p>To the last Interrogator repeats his answer made to the first Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator,
and knows no further.</p>
            <p>Being further interrogate upon the Interrogators given in anent
the Conspiracy in <hi>England,</hi> declares, The the first time he heard of
any design of rising in Arms was at the time when the Competition
was anent the Sheriffs at <hi>Midsummer</hi> was a year, and then he heard
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was to Head the Rebels; and this he had from
<hi>Io. Nisbet</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> a Scotch-man then at <hi>London;</hi> and
declares, That in <hi>Ianuary</hi> last the Declarant being in <hi>Holland</hi> he heard
by general report that the late Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> was to raise some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Highlanders to assist the Rebels in <hi>England</hi> by making a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and was to get a Sum of Money for that effect; and that in
<hi>March</hi> last he having received a Letter from <hi>Io. Nisbet</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> he

               </gap>ticularly at
<hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>London</hi> and that they computed several Thousands
in <hi>York-shire</hi> who were to joyn with them. That <hi>Murray</hi> desired
the Declarant to go along with him to meet with the late Lord
<hi>Russel</hi> and <hi>Gray</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> (but of <hi>Wharton</hi> they say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they were not very sure of him being a feared Man) and with
Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> and spoke of several old Officers of <hi>Cromwels</hi> that were
to be there but the Declarant not being for the present Rising
shunn'd to meet with these persons or any of them, and both <hi>Nisbet</hi>
and <hi>Murray</hi> told the Declarant that Sir <hi>Iohn Cokram</hi> was with them
and heard from these Two Persons that both the <hi>Cessnocks</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

the old rotten Stuff) is meant either the excluding the Sectaries
from joyning with them or destroying the Government both Civil
and Ecclesiastick which last the Declarant supposes rather to be the

               </gap>eek as the next the Declarant thinks is meant the suddain Muster
of the Rebels. In the close of the Letter which says things are full
as high as I tell you, is meant that the Rebellion was instantly to
break out, and having met with <hi>Io. Nisbet</hi> after his coming from
<hi>Holland</hi> the said <hi>Nisbet</hi> explained to him that the sense of the said
Letter was as is abovesaid.</p>
            <p>As to a Letter direct to the Declarant under the name of <hi>Pringle</hi>
of the 2 <hi>May</hi> 1683, declares, That the Name of the Subscriber which
is blotted out was so blotted before it came to his Hand, but by the
Contents of it he knows its from one <hi>Rob. Iohnston</hi> a Tenant or Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
to the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> on the Border and that the Traders and Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there spoke of is the designed Rebellion and that the said <hi>Robert
Iohnston</hi> offered to come to <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Declarant to have seen
some of our disaffected people here and to have met with them.
And that <hi>A. T.</hi> mentioned in the said Letter which the Letter says
laboured to undervalue the disaffected party in <hi>Scotland</hi> which he
calls your Goods, is the Name of <hi>Andrew Young</hi> who stays about
<hi>Newcastle</hi> whom he supposes to be a suspect Person because he was
feared that Colonel <hi>Struthers</hi> would apprehend him. And that he
supposes the way that that Letter came to his Hand was from some
Persons that were at a Meeting at Midsummer about that time, where
was present several of those People that had Commission from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Districts, but that he himself was not at that Meeting.</p>

               <p>ON <hi>Saturday</hi> last I had the occasion of seeing a Letter from you, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
for Mrs. <hi>Gaunt,</hi> in whose absence Mrs. <hi>Ward</hi> had received it,
at the reading of which I was not a little troubled, considering my full reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
signified to you in my last; for effectuating of which I had spoke for
Passage, and taken my farewel of Mother <hi>Gaunt,</hi> she going into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
And that very Week I was set upon by that Gentleman with whom I
stay, and <hi>Jo. Johnstoun</hi> with some others to stay but a Month, and if that
did not accomplish somewhat in hand to help <hi>Trading,</hi> then I should be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
detained. After I was prevailed to retract so far. I ordered <hi>Jo.</hi> who
had time at command, to give you an ample account of matters; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<hi>Jo.</hi> was desired by our Friends from <hi>Scotland</hi> to stand here in my place the
like engagements of Secrecy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being taken, and thereupon I ordered him
to shew you the grounds of my staying, and to desire if you inclined to cross the
Water to come this way, but since many are the confused, yea troubled thoughts
that have possessed me for yielding, concerning which, as also my yielding to it,
take the subsequent account.</p>
               <p>In my last, or it precedent to it, I shewed you that <hi>Trading</hi> was very low
here, and many breaking, which has made the Merchants (such as they are)
to think that <hi>desparate Diseases must have desparate Cures:</hi> and while
they have some Stock, it will be better to venture out, than to keep shop and
sit still till all be gone, and then they shall not be able to act, but let all go:
Which resolution I thought a thing not to confide in, seeing the most of them
are <hi>Fire-side Merchants,</hi> and love not to venture where storms are any thing
apparent. But about my departing they shewed the Model of Affairs in such
order, that I see venture they must, and venture they will; whereupon
they first demanded how our Trade would be carried on. Answer, they knew
well what Goods had proven most prejudicial to the Trade, and therefore
they thought to insist upon Negatives, in which whatever I proposed is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99396:56"/>
to, as I find; and thus they thought best to still some Criticks in the
Trade: And by this means first to endeavour <hi>the dispatching the old rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Stuff</hi> before they order what to bring home next. This lookt somewhat
strange to me, but when I consider all circumstances, I think they for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do best in it: For our Merchants I made account onely to have had
some stock for to set the broken ones up again, and so bid them here farewel,
<hi>and they to try their way, and we ours;</hi> Since they think fit that some of
these whom we have found (as you will say when you hear them named) treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
dealers in our Trade, consulted, and accordingly have done: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I fear, or rather hope that our Merchants, though broke, will rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to live a while longer as they are, than joyn with such, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to advance
the Trade; unless surer grounds of their fidelity be gotten, then is, or can
be expected, and this is the bottom of all my sorrow. But to proceed, I
find (if all hold that is intended) that they think it is almost at a point to set
forward, if they had their <hi>Factors</hi> home, who are gone to try how the
Country will like such Goods, as they are for, or against the making sale
off. Friends, I mean Merchants, wrote to me, that after I had spoken to
you, possibly you might come this way, the better thereby to advise them
what to do in this case, for I have signified somewhat of it to them, but not
so far as this; because I thought to have seen you long ere this time. But I
hope you will not misconstruct of my staying, seeing in it I de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but advancement of <hi>our Trade;</hi> but once this Week these Factors sent for
will be here, and then matters will <hi>in instanti,</hi> either off or on, break, or
go thorow. Wherefore in reference to Friends, I desire you will advise
me what to do, if you cannot, or think it not convenient to come here; if
you do, let a Letter precede, and if any <hi>strange thing</hi> fall out this<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>I Know not the grounds our Friends have gone upon, which hath

               <hi>Red,</hi> or any other you
send, shall say; onely in the mean time I resolve to let you know
as much of the Grounds I go on, as is possible at this distance,
and in this way. I did truly in my Proposition mention the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
least Sum I thought could do our Business effectually, not half
of what I would have thought requisite in an other Juncture of
Affairs; and what I proposed I thought altogether so far within the
power of those concerned, that if a little less could possibly do the
Business, it would not be stood upon: I reckoned the assistance of
the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rse absolutely necessary for the first Brush, and I do so still:
I shall not be peremptory to urge the precise number named, but I do
think there needs very near that number effectually; and I think a
1000 as easie had as 8 or 600, and it were hard that it stuck at the
odds; I leave it to you to consider if all should be hazarded, upon so
small a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>er. As to the Money, I confess what was proposed is more by
half than is absolutely necessary at the first weeks work, but soon after all
the Sum was proposed, and more will be necessary, if it please God to
give success, and then Arms cannot be sent like Money by Bills: There
are now above 1200 Horse and Dragoons, and 2000 Foot at least of
standing Forces in<note n="†" place="margin">Scotland.</note> 
               <hi>Brand</hi> very well appointed and tollerably well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
it is right hard to expect that Countrey people on Foot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Horse, should beat them the triple their number; and if multitudes
can be got together, yet they will need more Arms, more Provision,
and have more trouble with them: But the Case is, if something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
be not suddenly done at the very first appearing, and
that there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e onely a multitude gathered without action, though that
may frighten a little, it will do no good, the standing Forces will t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have the Militia of Twenty thousand Foot, and Two thousand
Horse, but all the Heretors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the number it may be of Fifty
thousand; and though many will be unwilling to fight for the standing
Forces, yet the most part will once joyn, and many will be as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

the greatest success imaginable, yet it is impossible but some will keep

bestowed upon many things usual, and necessary for such an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,

for Provisions of Meat or Drink, Intelligence, or incident
Charges; some very Honest well-meaning, and very good Men, may
undertake on little, because they can do little, and know little what
is to be done. All I shall add is, I made the Reckoning as low as if
I had been to pay it out of my own Purse; and whether I meddle or
meddle not, I resolve never to touch the Money, but to order the
payment of Necessaries, as they shall be received; and I shall freely
submit my self to any knowing Souldier for the Lists, and any
knowing Merchant for the Prices I have calculated, when there is an
occasion to confer about it, it will be a great encouragment to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

Solemnly sworn, Depones, That in the Paper subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by him; the Letter dated 21. <hi>Iune,</hi> and the other without date,
marked <hi>A,</hi> are written plain, and in the true Sense, so far as his
knowledge reaches, and that he had no Key to open the Letters with,
but the Alphabetical Cypher: That by the 128 <hi>Gilders, 8 Stivers,</hi>
mentioned in the end of the long Letter, he understands that it is the
Key thereof; and by the payment of the same, he understands the
way of using it. That he does truly believe there was an Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
intended, within these two Years; and as for what is to come, he
cannot tell what the People abroad may be doing: That he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
heard of Designs and Associations; but that they were directly
intended to hinder the <hi>Duke</hi> his Succession to the Crown, he cannot
say: For all that he understood was pretended for the Ground of
any designs of Arms, was the defence of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> the
Liberties of the Kingdom; and if against the <hi>Duke</hi> his Succession
only, in so far as that might be prejudicial to these; and that he
thinks upon the <hi>King's</hi> death Troubles may probably arise: That Mr.
<hi>West,</hi> to whom the Letters were directed, was not one of that name;
but Major <hi>Holms,</hi> to the best of his knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is the
Truth as he shall answer to God. <hi>Sic subscribitur.</hi>

            <p>AT all the Conventicles for near two years before the Rebellion
in the year 1679. There were great Contributions of Money
(which were chearfully given) under the pretence of a Subsistance
for their Ministers, and the Poor of their Perswasion (the only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
that was known to the meaner sort of People) but the greatest
part of the Money was employ'd for Arms and Ammunition for a
General Rising: In order whereunto the Phanaticks in the Months
of <hi>April, May</hi> and <hi>Iune,</hi> 1679. were preparing themselves, by
keeping several great Field-Conventicles (both in the West and South)
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99396:60"/>
in which were considerable Numbers of Armed Men. And although
they were generally very fond and forward to put their design in
Execution; yet it was hastned a Month sooner then was intended,
by the Skirmish that happened about the middle of <hi>Iune</hi> within two
Miles of <hi>Lowdon-hill,</hi> between a Party of his Majesties Forces under
the Command of Captain (now Colonel) <hi>Graham</hi> of <hi>Claverhouse,</hi>
and a strong Field-Conventicle, in which I was my self with a Party
of a Troop of Horse (levyed in <hi>Nith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dale</hi> in the end of <hi>May,</hi> and
beginning of <hi>Iune)</hi> whereof I was Cornet, under Mr. <hi>William Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson</hi>
of <hi>Caitlock,</hi> Captain, and <hi>Iohn Gibson</hi> of <hi>Auchinchein</hi> Lieutenant.
The same Night after that Skirmish, I was at the Earl of <hi>Lowdon</hi>'s
House with <hi>Robert Hamilton, Iohn Balfour,</hi> and <hi>David Haxton</hi> (both
Murderers of the late Arch-Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews) Iohn Ker</hi> in
<hi>Minebole,</hi> and several others, in number about Twenty Seven Horse.
The Earl himself was in the House, and I saw him pass into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
but I did not perceive that he came into our Company, though
I have reason to believe that <hi>Robert Hamiliton</hi> was with his Lordship
and his Lady in some of the Chambers, because I saw him leaving us
all of his Company in the great Hall, and going into the private Rooms,
where I am sure was my Lady, as I do not doubt but my Lord
was also, for it was from thence that I saw him pass into the Garden:
But my Lady did publickly that Night entertain and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge all the
Company. The next morning at four of the Clock we came from
that Earls House, and made all the haste we could to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> in
order to joyn the Body that we had parted with the day before; and
the next day we all Marched to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where (the morning after)
we were beaten by some Troops and Companies of the King's Forces,
and thereupon returned to <hi>Hamilton.</hi> From thence I went in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Mr. <hi>David Williamson</hi> (who was a Preacher and a Captain)
with Sixscore Horse to the Shire of <hi>Galloway,</hi> where we met and joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Six Troops of Horse and about as many Companies of Foot that
were Levyed in that Country and <hi>Nithsdale</hi> for our Assistance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
we went into <hi>Dumfreis</hi> where we stay'd a night, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Kings Forces coming to the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Shot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> whereupon
we march'd with all possible Diligence to joyn the rest of the Rebels
at <hi>Hamilton;</hi> seizing all the Arms and Horses that we could find
by the way, especially at <hi>Drumlanriq, Thorn-hill, Sanebar,
Cumnock, Cesnock, Newmills</hi> and <hi>Strevin;</hi> but at <hi>Ces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ock</hi> we
received four hundred Lances, which we were told were the
free and voluntary Gift of Sir <hi>Hugh Campbell,</hi> the Father, and
Sir <hi>George,</hi> the Son. There was one passage in this ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch, which I
cannot forbare to relate, <hi>viz.</hi> That as we were passing by the old
Castle of <hi>Treve</hi> (where his late Majesty of blessed Memory had a
Garrison, in the beginning of the unhappy Troubles of his Reign)
Old <hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Earlstown</hi> (who in few days after was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at <hi>Bothwell-Bridge)</hi> in my hearing spoke to the Officers that were
about him as followeth, <hi>Gentlemen, I was the Man that commanded
the Party which took this Castle from the late King, who had in it about
200 of the Name of</hi> Maxwell, <hi>of whom the greatest part being Papists
we put them all to the Sword, and demollish'd the Castle, as you see it:
And now (though an Old Man) I take up Arms against the Son, whom
I hope to see go the same way that his Father went: For we can never put
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99396:61"/>
trust in a Covenant Breaker; So Gentlemen, your Cause is good, ye need not fear
to fight against a forsworn King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>21st.</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1679. the main Body of the Rebels
came to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and lay encamped betwixt that place, and <hi>Bothwell-Bridge</hi>
until <hi>Sunday</hi> the <hi>29th.</hi> when we were defeated by the King's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
During which time there came to our Camp great store of Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Arms from <hi>Glasgow, Hamilton, Lanrick, Lesmahago, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills,</hi>
and several other places in <hi>Clisdale,</hi> and the parts adjacent;
but I do not know the particular Persons from whom they were sent,
save only what I have said concerning our receiving the 400 Lances
at <hi>Cesnock:</hi> But about a week before our coming to that Place, as
we were passing by the Earl of <hi>Galloway</hi>'s House of <hi>Garlis,</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Laird of <hi>Rymstone</hi> came to see some of the Gentlemen that
were of our number, and accompani'd us Ten or Twelve Miles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
aftewards to his House; but before his going he gave Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that both his Brother, the Earl of <hi>Galloway</hi> the Lord <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
and himself were our Friends: And I did hear him giving great
Incouragement to the meaner sort of People that were in Arms with
us, by bidding them to be Chearful and Couragious; for he did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
them that they had very good Friends in the Country; and we
did believe that within few days thereafter, as well the Earl of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi>
and Lord <hi>Kenmore,</hi> as the said Laird of <hi>Rymstone</hi> would come
and joyn with us, and had we been able to continue some time longer
together in a considerable Body, and had given the least fail to the
King's Forces, we expected that many Persons of great Quality and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
would have joyn'd with us: Whereof a perfect Account can
be given by <hi>Earlstown</hi> (now a Prisoner in <hi>Edinburg)</hi> if he will but
ingenuously declare what he knows.</p>
            <p>The Night before the Fight, the Rebels (one <hi>Hamilton Moor)</hi>
held a Council of War, consisting of <hi>Robert Hamilton, David Hax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
of <hi>Rathillett, Iohn Balfour, Major Ledmont, Mackcrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
of <hi>Barscob, Gordon</hi> of <hi>Home,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Ferguson</hi> of
Caitloch, (my Captain aforesaid,) <hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Craig,
Gorton</hi> of <hi>Newtoun, Gordon</hi> of <hi>Earlstone</hi> Elder,
<hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Earlstone</hi> Younger, <hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Craichlaw,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Mackculloch, Macdougall</hi> of <hi>Freugh,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> Captain <hi>Home,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Clelaud</hi> a
Captain of Horse, Mr. <hi>Iames Fowler</hi> a Captain of Foot, <hi>Andrew
Story</hi> a Captain of Foot, and several other Gentlemen and Officers,
whose Names I do not at the present remember, but do well know
the Places of their abode. There were also several of the Ministers
in this Council of War, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Welch,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Alexander Hasty,</hi> Mr. <hi>David Williamson</hi> (who also as I
have said before was Captain of a Troop of Horse) Mr. <hi>David Home,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Iohn Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Kid,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn King,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Dick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Forrester,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Iohn Dickson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Sandilauds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patrick Vernatt,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Iohn Harraway</hi> with some others: But at this time Mr. <hi>Richard Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
and his Brother Mr. <hi>Michael,</hi> with some few other Ministers were
gone to <hi>Holland</hi> with Moneys to pay for Arms that were formerly
brought by <hi>Kersland</hi>'s Son (as I was since inform'd) and some other
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99396:61"/>
Phanaticks living there. In this Council there were very hot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
betwixt <hi>Welch</hi>'s Party (the most considerable of the two)
who were content to lay down Arms upon their getting an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and <hi>Robert Hamilton</hi>'s Party who would rest satisfied with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less than the Extirpation of Episcopacy, and setting up a pure
Presbyterian Government, as they call'd it. And the Differences
were so great betwixt them, that the choice of their chief Officers
(which was design'd to have been that Night) was put off till the
next day, (being <hi>Sunday)</hi> at Ten in the Forenoon; but were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the King's Army coming before Sun-rising, to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end
of <hi>Bothwel-Bridge:</hi> However, they did that Night appoint two
Commissioners, <hi>(viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>David Home</hi> and Captain <hi>Mackculloch)</hi>
to treat for them with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth:</hi> On whom they
waited accordingly about half an Hour before the Fight, but return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without any Success. The general Discourse amongst the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
on <hi>Friday</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi> was, That the Lord <hi>Burgany</hi> would
certainly come in to them the <hi>Monday</hi> following (had not the Fight
on <hi>Sunday</hi> prevented him) to command their Forces in chief, and
to appoint such Field Officers, both for the Horse and Foot as he
should think fit, unless they had been appointed by the Council of
War before his coming; but in either of the Cases they were to have
had their Commissions from him: For it was most certain, that they
would not allow <hi>Robert Hamilton</hi> to be their Commander in chief
The Rebels did frequently and openly express the great Confidence
they had in some of their Friends about the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and
particularly the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> the Lord <hi>Newark,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Preston</hi> (the Elder Brother of
<hi>Robert Hamilton)</hi> besides some others whom I do not now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but could know them, if I should hear their Names.</p>
            <p>When the King's standing Forces begun to pass the <hi>Bridge,</hi> the
chief Officers of the Rebels were consulting what was fit for them
to do, and it was resolved that they should all March away in good
Order towards <hi>Carrick,</hi> and the Ruins of <hi>Galloway,</hi> until they should
be furnished with Arms and Ammunition, which were Landed at <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowstenness</hi>
(besides what was expected from <hi>Holland)</hi> but could
not then be brought to them, by Reason of the King's Army having
been interposed between them and that Place. And moreover they
were in Expectation of considerable Reinforcements both of Horse
and Foot, which were on their March from several parts of the
Country. But their chief Encouragement to prosecute this Design,
was the Confidence they had, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would not
put any hardship upon them; which I have good Reason to believe
was true; for when I was in Company with all the Rebels Horse
(about 1600. in number) less than a mile from the Field of Battle,
marching up on a rising Ground (in our Retreat) I look'd over
my Shoulder, and saw the King's Horse at a stand, after they had
pursued us a little way, which we look'd upon as having been done
to favor our escape: For if they had follow'd us, they had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kill'd or taken us all, a few only excepted, who were very well
mounted; and we were often afterwards told, that they were stopt
by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s positive Command, when they were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
pursuing us, after they had quite broke our Foot (consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99396:62"/>
upwards of 4000.) and were within less than half a mile
of the Body of our Horse (running away) which then was in great
Consternation and Confusion: However, we march'd that forenoon
in as good Order as we could (twelve miles over a Moor) to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills,</hi>
without any of his Majesties Forces giving us the least Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
where we separated, some going towards <hi>Air,</hi> others to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi>
and the rest to <hi>Nithsdale;</hi> amongst which last, were the most
resolute of the Officers, to the number of betwixt 45 and 50; who
continued together in Arms, going up and down the Country in
<hi>Galloway, Nithsdale</hi> and other places thereabouts (after all the rest
were scattered) until a Party of the King's Forces, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Claverhouse</hi> came into <hi>Galloway,</hi> and then we (for I was
my self all along with that small remainder of the Rebels) went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>West,</hi> where we were most kindly entertain'd in many places,
though I do not remember the Names of the Persons by whom: But
I do well know their Habitations; and I was afterwards told by <hi>Mr.
Richard Camron,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Mr. Michael,</hi> that they and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were sheltered and entertained by Sir <hi>Hugh,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi>
at their House of <hi>Cesnock.</hi> After some stay in the West, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to my own House <hi>(Kilroy)</hi> within four miles of <hi>Dum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reis,</hi>
where having staid about five or six weeks, the said <hi>Mr. Richard Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
and his Brother <hi>Mr. Michael</hi> (who were some short time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
returned from <hi>Holland)</hi> came to see me, and stay'd with me
two Nights: They told me, that they had bought four small Brass
Guns with a considerable quantity of Ammunition and Fire-Arms,
which they had in a Readiness, to have been Shipp'd at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> in
Order to their having been landed at <hi>Greenock)</hi> when they receiv'd
the News of the Defeat at <hi>Bothwell-Bridge:</hi> Whereupon they put up
the said Guns, Arms and Ammunition in a secure place in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
until there should be Occasion for them. The <hi>Sunday</hi> after their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to my House, Mr. <hi>Richard Camron</hi> kept a Field-Conventicle
within a mile of Sir <hi>Robert Dalyell</hi>'s House, where were about three
thousand in number. The Occasion of this Meeting (where I was
present) was to see how the Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y stood inclin'd, and who would
joyn with him. From thence the said Mr. <hi>Richard</hi> carry'd with him
twenty Men (whereof I was one) to the Laird of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Kirk</hi>
(a Cousin of the Lord <hi>Carmichael</hi>'s, and I suppose his Name is also
<hi>Carmichael,)</hi> whose House is about two miles from <hi>Biggar,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thirty from <hi>Edinburg,</hi> where we stay'd four days: During
which, there was several Conventicles kept in the House, at which,
the Laird and his Lady were constantly present. And the <hi>Sunday</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we kept a Field-Conventicle on <hi>Tinto-Hill,</hi> to which, there was
People gather'd from all Parts of the Country thereabout, to the
number of between three or four Thousand, whereof many were
well Arm'd. From this Hill I went with Mr. <hi>Richard Camron</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
and upwards of twenty more to the Lady <hi>Gilkerscleughs</hi>'s House
(a Widow Lady) in <hi>Clidsdale,</hi> where we stay'd a Week, and kept
several Conventicles with her. About this time the Duke was come
to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and whilst we were in this House, it was one Night at
Supper propos'd by <hi>Haxtoun</hi> to kill his Royal Highness, the said
Lady being present together with the two <hi>Camrons,</hi> four Gentlemen
of the <hi>North,</hi> whom I knew not, and two of my Neighbors whose
Names are <hi>Iohn Harper,</hi> and <hi>Robert Nalson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:99396:62"/>This <hi>Haxtoun</hi> said he would do it himself if he could come at
him; and thought, that it might best be done when the Duke was at
Dinner; wherefore he asked, If there were any there that would
go and observe all the manner of his Royal Highness's Dining?
Whether People might get into the Room to see him at Dinner?
And if there were any Number, or Crowds of People got in? Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That he was too well known to go upon this Errand himself.
So Mr. <hi>Michael Camron</hi> undertook it, and took me along with him,
who were particularly instructed to observe, whether people could
go in with large Coats or Cloaks upon them, and Women with
Plads; and whether they could pass the Sentinels with their Swords:
And according as he should find matters, he would afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
the best way to effect the Business. Accordingly we two
went, and saw the Duke at Dinner; but as we returned to our
Lodging, at one <hi>Danald Mackay</hi>'s House, at the Head of the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
near the <hi>Grass-market, Camron</hi> (by chance) met there a man
which knew him; whereupon we both betook our selves immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to our Horses, and were pursued by Twelve of the King's
Dragoons, who followed us so close, that we were forced to part
Company; and I went to my own House, where being again in
danger by a Party of <hi>Claverhouse</hi> his Troop, and not thinking my
self safe, I came into <hi>England,</hi> where I continued three years, and
was at many Presbyterian House-Conventicles in <hi>Shrewsbury, Brum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migham</hi>
and <hi>Bristol;</hi> but never see a Field-Conventicle in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
save one at <hi>Clee-hill</hi> (some few miles distant from <hi>Ludlow)</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> 1681, where were met to the number of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of 1000; and some of Note were amongst them; but I do
only remember the Names of Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> (a Lawyer whose Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Residence is in <hi>Shropshire)</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wardin,</hi> a Merchant in <hi>Brum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migham,</hi>
besides the two Ministers who preached there, whose Names
are Mr. <hi>Thomas Eaglesall,</hi> who lived in a little Market Town (called
<hi>Kinver)</hi> in <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> near Justice <hi>Foley</hi>'s House, and Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Case,</hi> who lived near <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> and their Sermons were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tending to raise Faction and Sedition, in the same manner as I
have too frequently heard in the Field-Convent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cles in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
About a year and half ago I went over into <hi>Holland,</hi> when I saw
the (since deceased) Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi>
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> but did not speak with either of them; and saw

                  </gap>tterdam,</hi> with whom I spoke; but nothing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Government. Then Mr. <hi>Iohn Hog,</hi> and the other <hi>Scotch</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
belonging to <hi>Rotterdam</hi> (knowing that I was in the Rebellion,
and could not safely live at Home) advised me to enter my self a
Souldier in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Army; which I did accordingly
in Colonel <hi>Iames Douglas</hi>'s Regiment, in his own Company, where I
served a Year; and then became known to Mr. <hi>Thomas Maxwell,</hi> a
Captain in that Regiment, whose Countrey-man I am; and he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
that I was fled from home upon the Account of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to that Rebellion, told me how fair an Opportunity I had to
serve the King, by making a full Discovery of all Persons that I
knew to be guilty of it, or any ways aiding and assisting towards
the promoting the same. Adding, that if I would follow his Advice
in that matter, he doubted not of his putting me in a way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99396:63"/>
and obtain the King's Remission, whereby I might be enabled
to live peaceably at home hereafter. To which I did very readily
consent: And he having thereupon (the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> last) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
my Discharge from my Colonel, I have since discovered what
I could. And particularly that at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> (since my said
Discharge) I had seen several of the Whiggish Ministers,
some whereof I remember were at <hi>Bothwel-Bridge,</hi> who came from
<hi>Scotland</hi> about the beginning of <hi>September</hi> last, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Mr. <hi>Patrick Vernatt</hi> (formerly mentioned in the Council
of War) who preach frequently in the <hi>Scots</hi> Church at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi>
As do Mr. <hi>Gordon</hi> (who is Brother to <hi>Iames Gordon,</hi> a Merchant
there lately deceased) Mr. <hi>Iohn Harvey,</hi> Mr. <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn.
Sinclair,</hi>
all Phanatick Preachers. The most part of whom (as the
above-mentioned Mr. <hi>Forrester</hi> told me) went over from <hi>Holland</hi>
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the month of <hi>August</hi> last; but that they found
themselves in such daily Hazards of being apprehended, that they
returned back again to <hi>Holland;</hi> and that this bad News which
they brought over with them, is the reason why <hi>Robert Hamilton</hi>'s
late intended Journey to <hi>Scotland</hi> was put off, whither I was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
before informed he did intend to go, and to carry Arms along
with him to some of his Friends there. The said <hi>Forrester</hi> told me
further, That they resolve to keep no more Field-Conventicles, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that those Meetings have served only to weaken their Party,
through the seizing of some, and dispersing the rest (which made
their Friends publickly known) and that now the <hi>English</hi> and they joyn
Councils, and resolve to go on more warily. I did likewise
discover, that the manner of the said Ministers, their passing
to and fro betwixt <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> undiscovered, was by their
being clad in Sea-mans Cloaths, and working in the Ships as Sea-men.
As also, that I was perswaded, before they shall attempt any thing
towards a new Rebellion, or making use of the Arms, that the two
<hi>Camrons</hi> left in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> (which are now in the Custody of the
late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> as I was told about nine Weeks ago in <hi>Vtrecht,</hi>
by Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran</hi>'s second Son, and <hi>Mr. William Cleland,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Council of War) they will first endeavor to dispatch the
King; and that being done, they doubted not but they could soon
overcome the Duke, and all others that would oppose them: Which
I heard my self discoursed in a <hi>Meeting</hi> about two months ago, at
Mr. <hi>Thomas Hog,</hi> a Phanatick Preacher his House in <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> where
were present (besides <hi>Mr. Hog,</hi> and my self) Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran</hi>'s Son,
and Mr. <hi>Cleland,</hi> already mentioned, <hi>Mr. Iames Steward,</hi> the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
his Lady, the Lady <hi>Kersland,</hi> and her Son, with several others,
whose Names I do not remember: But this Language they speak on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amongst their confident Friends: For they make the common
sort of People believe, that there was no such thing as a Phanatick-Plot;
but that the raising of that Report was a Contrivance of the
Papists, to make use of false Witnesses, for taking away the Lives of
True Protestants; which I have often heard, not only discoursed
in Houses where some of the ordinary sort of People were in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
but also preached in the Churches, where the Sermons (for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99396:63"/>
Oath) to bring up their Children in the true Protestant Faith, and
in the Discipline and Doctrine of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> according as
they are obliged by the Solemn League and Covenant; and at their
Communions, debarring always from their Sacrament all such as have
not taken the Covenant, and do not adhere to it. But of all the
Fugitive Preachers lately gone over from <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> none
is more perversely violent against the Government, than <hi>Mr. Iohn
Sinclair</hi> (who for many years was <hi>Minister,</hi> and kept a Boarding
School at <hi>Ormiestoun)</hi> whom about twelve Weeks ago I heard preach
in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Church at <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> and a great part of his Sermon
was railing against the Duke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Privy Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
saying, That he (meaning his Royal Highness) was a Rebellious
Enemy of God; and had got such a Hand over those perjur'd Rogues
(meaning the Lords of the Privy Council) as they all intended to
overturn the Protestant Religion, and to introduce Popery; which
(he further said) could very easily be done, considering the small
Difference that is betwixt them since Episcopacy was re-established;
and in his Prayer after Sermon, I heard him pray earnestly, That
God might open the King's Eyes, to let him see the Evil of his
Ways, and turn from it; otherwise, That God might take him out
of this World, from being a Curse, and a Scourge to his Holy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And further prayed, That God would turn the Counsels of
his Councellors, as he did that of <hi>Achitophel</hi> into nothing.</p>
            <p>The late Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> lives now in the Province of <hi>Frisland,</hi>
where he has a small Estate, purchased partly by his Father, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

whom I did often see there, but could not learn their Names.
I did also see and speak with Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran,</hi> but he and 7. or 8.
<hi>Scotchmen</hi> more (whose names I know not) went two days after my
Arrival there, to <hi>Gilderland,</hi> where a great many of the Rebels and
Fugitives live (as they think) most safe and at ease amongst the Bores;
for they were afraid of Staying at <hi>Vtrecht</hi> (as some of themselves told
me) by reason of the Spies that they were informed were sent thither
from <hi>England</hi> to make enquiry after such of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Subjects as
lived there. And <hi>Mr. Cochran</hi> and Captain <hi>Cleland</hi> told me as their
Friend, that the report amongst our Countrymen was that I likewise
was sent thither as a Spie; which although they did not believe, yet
they advised me to be gone away privately, assuring me withal that
I was every hour I stayed there in hazard of losing my Life. Upon
this I returned to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where my Credit with that Party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
about a week, untill I was suspected by my old Captain and
three of the Ministers, <hi>Viz. Harraway, Forrester</hi> and <hi>Sinclair,</hi> who
about 7 or 8 Weeks ago carried me with them to Church, and there
proposed (as a Test of my Sincerity to the interest of the good Cause
as it was commonly called) that I should take the Covenant and the
Sacrament with a Solemn Protestation that I am still (as I have been
in former times) an Enemy to the King and the present Government:
All which I refused to do; and then they debarred me for ever from
their Meetings and Company: Nevertheless I did often thereafter
insinuate my self into both, though without any Success; for I could
not recover their good opinion, but on the contrary was daily threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the severest effects of their revenge.</p>

<hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> Brother to the Laird of <hi>Cultness,</hi> wrote a Letter to him
from <hi>Holland,</hi> importing, that if any considerable sum of Money
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99396:65"/>
could be procur'd from <hi>England,</hi> that something of Importance might
be done in <hi>Scotland:</hi> The which Letter, the Deponent had an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to inform <hi>Shepard</hi> in <hi>Abb-Church-lane,</hi> Merchant in <hi>London</hi>
of; but before he could do it, he wrote to Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> above-nam'd,
to know from him if he might do it; and Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> having consented, he
Communicat the said Letter to Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> who told the Deponent
that he would Communicat the Contents of it to some persons in
<hi>England;</hi> but did at that time name no body, as the Deponent, thinks:
Some time thereafter, Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> told the Deponent, that he had
Communicat the Contents of the Letter above-named to Colonel
<hi>Sidney,</hi> and that Colonel <hi>Danvers</hi> was present, and told the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
that Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> was averse from imploying the late Earl of
<hi>Argile,</hi> or medling with him, judging him a man too much affected
to the Royal Family, and inclined to the present Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> being put upon it by the Deponent, still
urg'd, that one might be sent to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> but as Mr. <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi>
told him, he was suspected upon the account of his urging so
much; yet afterwards he press'd, without the Deponents knowledge,
that the Deponent being to go to <hi>Holland</hi> however, might have some
Commission to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> which he having inform'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
of, the Deponent told him, that he himself would not be
concern'd, but if they would send another he would introduce
him; but nothing of this was done: upon which the Deponent
went over, without Commission from any body, to <hi>Holland,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meeting with <hi>Iames Stuart</hi> above-named: He was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> with whom he had never before convers'd
and did there discourse what had past betwixt Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> and
him; and particularly, about remitting of Money to the said Earl
from <hi>England;</hi> of which, the said Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> had written to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,
namely of 30000 pounds <hi>Sterling;</hi> and of the raising of 1000
Horse and Dragoons; and the securing the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as a
matter of the greatest importance: The method of doing this was
propos'd by the Deponent, to be one hour, or thereby, after the
relieving of the Guards: But the Earl did not relish this propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as dangerous; and that the Castles would fall of consequence,
after the work abroad was done. <hi>Iames Stuart</hi> was of the Deponents
Opinion, for seizing the Castle; because it would secure <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
the Magazines and Arms. As to the 1000 Horse and Dragoons, my
Lord <hi>Argile</hi> was of Opinion, that without them nothing was to be
done; and that if that number was raiss'd in <hi>England</hi> to the said Earl,
he would come into <hi>Scotland</hi> with them; and that there being so
few Horse and Dragoons to meet them, he judg'd he might get the
Country without trouble, having such a standing Body for their
Friends to Rendezvouz to; and the said Earl said he could shew the
Deponent the convenient places for Landing, if he understood, and
as the Deponent remembers, where the Ships could attend. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
remembers not the Names of the Places. The Deponent
spoke to the Lord <hi>Stairs,</hi> but cannot be positive that he nam'd the
Affair to him, but found him shie: but the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> told him,
he thought <hi>Stairs</hi> might be gain'd to them: And that the Earl of <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doun</hi>
being a man of good Reason and disoblig'd, would have great
influence upon the Country, and recommended the Deponent to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99396:65"/>
Major <hi>Holms,</hi> with whom the Deponent had some acquaintance
before, and had brought over a Letter from him to the Earl of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but the Deponent had not then communicate any thing to the
said <hi>Holms. Iames Stuart</hi> laid down a way of correspondence by
Cyphers and false Names, and sent them over to <hi>Holms,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,
for their use (which Cyphers and Names are now in the
hands of His Majesty's Officers, as the Deponent supposes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) and did
desire the Deponent earnestly to propose the 30000 pound <hi>Sterling</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-named
to the Party in <hi>England,</hi> and did not propose any less; for
as the Earl told the Deponent, he had particularly calculate the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for Arms, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Iames Stuart</hi> said, that if
some less could be had, the Earl would content himself, if better
might not be, but the Earl always said that there was nothing to be
done without the body of Horse and Dragoons above-mentioned;
During the time of the Deponent his abode in <hi>Holland</hi> tho he had
several Letters from <hi>Shepard,</hi> yet there was no satisfactory account,

for our wild People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> my Conscience does not serve me
for such things; after which the Deponent had never any particular
discourse with <hi>Ferguson</hi> as to that matter; but as to the other Affair,
<hi>Ferguson</hi> told the Deponent that he was doing what he could to get
it effectuate; as particularly that he spoke to one Major <hi>Wildman</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:99396:66"/>
who is not of the Deponent his acquaintance. <hi>Ferg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Monro,</hi> the two <hi>Cessnocks, Montgomery</hi> of <hi>Langshaw,</hi> and one
Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi> where they discoursed of Money to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ent to <hi>Argile,</hi> in
order to the carrying on the Affair; and tho he cannot be positive
the Affair was named, yet it was understood by himself, and as he
conceives by all present, to be for rising in Arms, for rectifying the
Government. Commissar <hi>Monro,</hi> Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and the two <hi>Cessnocks</hi>
were against medling with the <hi>English,</hi> because they judged them
men that would talk, and would not do, but were more inclined to
do something by themselves, if it could be done. The Lord <hi>Melvil</hi>
thought every thing hazardous, and therefore the Deponent cannot
say he was positive in any thing, but was most inclined to have the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to head them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which no particular
method was laid down. <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> the Deponent, and Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi>
were for taking the Money; at one of these Meetings it was resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> late Clerk of the Justice Court, should be sent
to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to desire their Friends to hinder the Country from Rising
or taking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ash Resolutions upon the account of the Council, till
they should see how matters went in <hi>England.</hi> The said <hi>Martin</hi> did
go at the Charges of the Gentlemen of the Meeting, and was
directed to the Laird of <hi>Polwart</hi> and <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> who sent back word,
that it would not be found so easie a matter to get the Gentry of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to concur: But afterwards in a Letter to Commissar <hi>Monro,
Polwart</hi> wrote that the Country was readier to concur then they had
imagined, or something to that purpose. The Deponent, as above-said,
having brought over a Key from <hi>Holland,</hi> to serve himself and
Major <hi>Holms,</hi> he remembers not that ever he had an exact Copy of
it, but that sometimes the one, sometimes the other keeped it, and
so it chanced to be in his Custody when a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile</hi>
came to Major <hi>Holms,</hi> intimating, that the would joyn with the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and follow his Measures, or obey his Directions:
this Mr. <hi>Veatch</hi> thought fit to communicate to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
and for the Understanding of it was brought to the Deponent, and
he gave the Key to Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi> who as the Deponent was inform'd,
was to give it and the Letter to Mr, <hi>Ferguson,</hi> and he to shew it to
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> but what was done in it the Deponent
knows not. The Deponent heard the Design of killing the King and
Duke, from Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> who told the Deponent some were full up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. The Deponent heard that <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was sent by those in
<hi>England</hi> to call Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran,</hi> on the account of <hi>Carolina,</hi> but that
he does not know <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> nor any more of that Matter, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concern'd in it. <hi>Shepard</hi> nam'd young <hi>Hambden</hi> frequently as
concern'd in these Matters.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>William Carstares</hi> being again examin'd, adheres to his former
Deposition, in all the parts of it, and Depones he knows of
no Correspondence betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> except by <hi>Martin</hi>
before-nam'd: For those Gentlemen to whom he was sent, were left
to follow their own Methods. <hi>Veatch,</hi> as the Deponent remembers,
stayed sometimes at <hi>Nicholson,</hi> Stabler's House at <hi>London-Wall;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with one Widow <hi>Hardcastle</hi> in <hi>Morefields.</hi> The Deponent did
Communicate the Design on Foot to Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Griffil,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Meed</hi> at <hi>Stepney,</hi> who all concurred in the promoting of it, and
were desirous it should take effect; and to one Mr. <hi>Freth</hi> in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Councellor at Law, who said he would see what he could do
in reference to the Money, but there having gone a Report, that
there was no Money to be rais'd, he did nothing in it, nor does the
Deponent think him any more concern'd in the Affair, <hi>Nel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hrop</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
spoke to the Deponent of the Money to be sent to <hi>Argile,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was got or not, but the Deponent used no freedom with him in
the Affair. <hi>Goodenough</hi> did insinuate once, that the Lords were not
inclin'd to the thing, and that before they would see what they could
do in the City. The Deponent saw Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rumsay,</hi>
lurking after the Plot broke out, before the Proclamation, having
gone to <hi>Ferguson,</hi> in the back of <hi>Bishop-gate-street,</hi> at some new Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether he was directed by <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> who was desirous to know
how things went, <hi>Rumsay</hi> was not of the Deponent his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
before, but they knew as little of the matter as the Deponent.
This is what the Deponent remembers, and if any thing come to his
Memory, he is to deliver it in betwixt, and the first of <hi>October:</hi> And
this is the truth, as he shall Answer to God.</p>

he knows all those of Note that were at those Clubs were thoroughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Design. These Clubs were divided into three Factions,
by reason of which division the Informant saith the Design went on so
flow as it did, and at last it fell between the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and a
Common-wealth; and the greater number carried it for the Duke of

the Race of the <hi>Stuart's;</hi> but they pitcht upon <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi> whom

should be at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> chosing Sheriffs.</p>
            <p>Five hundred Horse were promised to be sent in from the Country,
who were to seize the Guards.</p>
            <p>The pretence of the Conspirators was to secure His Majesty from being

at <hi>Oxford,</hi> then to set up the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> That this was long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd

            <head>A particular Account of the Situation of the
Rye-House.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THe Rye-House</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> about eighteen Miles from
<hi>London,</hi> is so called from the <hi>Rye</hi> a Meadow near it. Just
under it there is a By-road from <hi>Bishops-Strafford</hi> to <hi>Hod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desden,</hi>
which was constantly used by the King when he went to
or from <hi>Newmarket;</hi> the great Road winding much about on the
Right-hand by <hi>Stansted.</hi> The House is an Old Strong Building and
stands alone, encompass'd with a Mote, and towards the Garden
has high Walls, so that Twenty Men might easily defend it for
some time against Five hundred. From a high Tower in the House
all that go or come may be seen both ways for near a Mile di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
As you come from <hi>Newmarket</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> when you
are near the House, you pass the Meadow over a narrow Caus-way,
at the end of which is a Toll-gate, which having Entred you go
through a Yard, and a little Field, and at the end of that through
another Gate, you pass into a narrow Lane, where two Coaches at
that time could not go a-breast. This narrow Passage had on the
Left hand a thick Hedge and a Ditch, on the Right a long Range of
Building used for Corn-Chambers and Stables with several Doors
and Windows looking into the Road, and before it a Pale, which
then made the Passage so narrow, but is since removed. When
you are past this long Building, you go by the Mote, and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Wall, that is very Strong, and has divers Holes in it, through
which a great many Men might shoot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Along by the Mote and
Wall the Road continues to the <hi>Ware-River</hi> which runs about
Twenty or Thirty yards from the Mote, and is to be past by a
Bridge. A small distance from thence another Bridge is to be past
over the <hi>New-River.</hi> In both which Passes a few Men may oppose
great Numbers. In the outer Court-yard, which is behind the long

himself to Mr. Secretary <hi>Ienkins,</hi> and desired
to Speak alone with the <hi>KING</hi> and <hi>DUKE,</hi> which
was Granted him. He first Threw himself at His <hi>MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IESTIES</hi>
Feet, acknowledging his Guilt, and the Share
he had in the Conspiracy, and asked His Pardon, then
Confest himself Faulty to the <hi>DUKE,</hi> asked his Pardon
also, assured him if he should survive His <hi>MAIESTY,</hi>
that he would Pay him all the Duty that became a Loyal
Subject, and be the First should Draw his Sword for him,
should there be Occasion. He then Desired His <hi>MAIESTY</hi>
would not Oblige him to be a Witness, and then gave an
Account of the Whole Conspiracy, naming all Those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it, which were more than Those had already
been Mentioned by the several Witnesses. He denyed any
Knowledge of the Assassination. When he had made an
end of his Confession, His <hi>MAIESTY</hi> Ordered him to be
put into the Custody of a Serjeant at Arms. This day Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to His Presence, and Ordered a Stop to be put to the
Outlawry, and Promis'd him his Pardon. He further added,
That Dr. <hi>Owen, Mead, Griffin,</hi> and all the Considerable Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists

               <p>IF I could have Writ to Your <hi>MAIESTY</hi> sooner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with any Safety to my Self, I would have done it, to

                  </gap>hat there is nothing under Heaven has Struck
Me so to the Heart, as to be Put into a Proclamation for an
Intention of Murdring of You, <hi>SIR,</hi> and the <hi>DUKE.</hi>
I do Call God Almighty to Witness, and I Wish I may
Die this Moment I am Writing if ever it Entred into my
Head, or ever said the least Thing to any Body that could
make them think I could wish such a Thing; I am sure there
cannot be such Villains upon Earth to say I ever did. But
I am so Innocent to this Point, that I will say no more
of it, for I know God Almighty is Just, and I do not
doubt but he will put it into Your Heart that I am Clear
of this Most Horrid and Base Accusation. But, <hi>SIR,</hi> the
Chief Intent of this Letter is to Beg Pardon both of You,
<hi>SIR,</hi> and the <hi>DUKE,</hi> for the many Things I have done
that have made You both Angry with Me: But more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the <hi>DUKE,</hi> though I might have some Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
for my Self that many People made Me believe he
Intended to Destroy Me; for to you, <hi>SIR,</hi> I do Protest
before God Almighty, and I Wish I may never Prosper
more, that all I have done was only to Save You, as I shall
Convince Your <hi>MAIESTY,</hi> if ever I am so Happy as
to Speak to You, and I Hope You will let Me do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be long, for I have that to say to You, <hi>SIR,</hi> that
will for ever I Hope Settle You Quiet in Your Kingdom,
and the <hi>DUKE</hi> after You, whom I Intend to Serve to the
Uttermost of my Power, and, <hi>SIR,</hi> to Convince him that
I will do so, if Your <hi>MAIESTY</hi> will Give Me Your
Pardon, I will Deliver my Self up into his Hands, that
the <hi>DUKE</hi> may bring Me to You; besides, <hi>SIR,</hi> I
should be Glad to have him by when I Speak to You, but
no Body else, and by this Kindness of the <hi>DUKES,</hi> if
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99396:72"/>
ever I should do any Thing afterwards against Him, I must
be thought the Ungratefullest Man Living. What Good
can it do You, <hi>SIR,</hi> to take Your Own Childs Life away
that only Erred and Ventured his Life to Save Yours? And
besides, <hi>SIR,</hi> I am Sure I can be Serviceable to You, and
if I may Say so, make the Rest of Your Life Happy, or at
least Contribute a great Deal towards it. You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Me, <hi>SIR,</hi> for I do not tell You this out of Fear, but
because I do Think my Self sure of it. I do Beg of You,
<hi>SIR,</hi> if You have any Thoughts of Mercy of Me, that You
will let Me know it soon, for the sooner I speak to You the
better. And now, <hi>SIR,</hi> I do Swear to You, that from this
Time, I never will Displease You in any Thing, but the
whole Study of my Life shall be to shew how truly Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
I am for having done it, and how Well I will De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Life You give Me. And for the <hi>DUKE</hi> that he
may have a more Firm Confidence of the Service I intend
to do Him, I do here Declare to Your <hi>MAIESTY,</hi> that I
will never ask to see Your Face more, if ever I do any Thing
against Him, which is the greatest Curse I can lay upon my
Self,</p>

               <p>YOU must allow Me, <hi>SIR,</hi> still to Importune You
not without Hopes of Prevailing at last upon Your
Generosity, so as it may get the better of Your Anger to
Me. I am half Distracted, <hi>SIR,</hi> with the Thoughts of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Offended You; and the Torment it gives Me is perhaps
greater than Your forgiving Nature would know how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
upon the most Criminal Offenders: The Character I lie
under is too heavy for Me to bear; even Death it self would
be a Relief to Me, could I have it without the Aggravation
of leaving the World under Your Displeasure: I must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
throw my self upon Your Compassion, which being a
Virtue so agreeable to Your Nature, I hope Your Child,
<hi>SIR,</hi> will not be an unfortunate Instance of Your denying
it, when 'tis Implored<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I confess, <hi>SIR,</hi> I have been in Fault,
Mislead, and Insensibly Engaged in Things of which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
was not enough Understood by Me: Yet I can say
I never had a Criminal Thought towards Your <hi>MAIESTY,</hi>
not pretending by that to Insist upon an Absolute Justification
of my Self. Your <hi>MAIESTY</hi> will Consider, that whilst I
was Under the Apprehensions of great Anger and Violence
against Me, it might easily Corrupt my Judgment, and by
seeing Things in a wrong Light, Betray Me into very Fatal
Mistakes: But now that I have had Time to Recollect my
Self, every thing like a Fault towards Your <hi>MAIESTY</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
to Me in such a Reproaching Terrifying Shape, that
I have a Remorse for it, which could it be seen, I assure my
Self it would Move Your Compassion to Me. I Humbly
beg, <hi>SIR,</hi> to be Admitted to Your Feet, and to be Disposed
of as You Direct, not only now, but for the Remainder of my
Life: And though my Resignation is too full to admit any
Reserve, Your <hi>MAIESTY</hi> will permit me to offer to You,
Whether You will let pass any thing as a Penalty upon Me,
which may lay a Stain upon my Innocent Children? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

You will make Me Undergo the Ignominy of a Tryal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
You give Me Your Pardon? And of what Use or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
can it be to You to Forgive Me, and yet give Me the
Cruel Punishment of hearing my Self Arraigned for Treason
against such a KING, and such a FATHER? And whether

of One, who God knoweth is already enough Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
and some kind of Blemish too, to my Family, as well
as an useless Limitation of Your <hi>MAJESTIES</hi> Mercy?
<hi>SIR,</hi> I lay these Things before You in the most Submitting
Manner that is Possible, with an Entire Resignation to what
You shall Determine. Neither do I Imagine to Receive Your
Pardon any otherwise than by the Intercession of the
<hi>DUKE,</hi> whom I Acknowledge to have Offended, and am
Prepared to Submit my Self in the Humblest Manner; and
therefore beg Your <hi>MAIESTY</hi> would Direct how I am
to Apply my Self to Him; and I shall do it, not as an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Form, but with all the Sincerity in the World. If
what I have said can Move You to Forget my past Faults, it
will be a Grace I shall Endeavour to Deserve by all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of my Life: And I am so sensible how Ill a Guide my
Own Will hath been to Me, that I am Resolved for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to put it Entirely into Your <hi>MAJESTIES</hi> Hands,
that I may by that Means never Commit a Fault but for want
