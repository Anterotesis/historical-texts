            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Everlaſting Goſpel of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and the Bleſſed effects thereof, Teſtified to from Experience.</head>
            <div type="gospel">
               <p>THe bleſſed meſſage, which the Apoſtles (who were ſent by Chriſt to preach the Goſpel,) heard of Chriſt, and were to declare to others, was; <hi>That God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 5.</p>
               <p>The end of Chriſts ſending them with this Meſſage, was, that thereby (preaching it in the evidence and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Spirit) they might <hi>Open mens eyes, and turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they might receive Forgiveneſs of Sins, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance among them that are Sanctified by Faith that is in him,</hi> Act. 26. 18.</p>
               <p>Now the eye of the Mind being opened, and the Mind turned from the Darkneſs within, to the Light within; and from Satans power to the power of God, which is revealed in the Light: The Soul in the Light comes to ſee (over the Darkneſs and Satan who darkned it) the things of God and his Kingdom, as they are revealed in the Light, which makes them manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As Firſt,</hi> It ſees him who is the Rock, the Holy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God, the Holy Foundation of Life in the Soul; the living Stone, by which all the other living Stones are made alive, and they are taught of God to come to him as to a living Stone, and ſo are Built upon him, and become Gods Building and new Creation in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. And here, in this Light none can miſs of the true coming, hearing the voice of the Father, and being drawn, and taught by him to the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44, 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Here the true Jews ſtate the ſtate of the inward Jew, and the inward Circumciſion, and the true Worſhip

(even the Worſhip of the Father in Spirit and Truth) is known. For the Jew Inward is a Child of Light, begotten in the Light, redeemed out of Darkneſs, and Dwells and Walks in the Light, as God is in the Light, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. And the Circumciſion is not a Fleſhly Act; but the cutting off of that which is Fleſhly from the mind, by the Spirit and Power of Chriſt. And the Goſpel-worſhip, or the Worſhip of the Jew Inward, is the Worſhipping of God in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Life of his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Here is the true Repentance from the dead Nature and Dead Works, which no man can attain to of himſelf, but is Gods Gift through his Son, whom God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a Prince and a Saviour to give Repentance and Forgiveneſs of Sins, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. I ſay, here that Repentance is known, waited for and received. For not to men in the Darkneſs, and loving the Darkneſs, is the true Repentance given; but to them that are turned towards the Light, to them is Repentance given unto Life, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 18. compared with chap. 26. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> Here the true Faith, the precious Gift of Faith is received, whereby men believe in him who gives Life, and receive Life from him. And this is the Faith which gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to God, and gives victory over the World; and that which is contrary to God: The Faith which is given in the Light, doth ſo; but the Faith which men have in the Darkneſs, doth not ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly.</hi> Here the Croſs of Chriſt is known, which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward living Spiritual thing, effectually Crucifying that man, that takes it up and dayly bears it, to all that is earthly and ſinful; and then the pure Seed and Life of Chriſt ſprings up in his Earth, over the World and every Worldly thing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> Here the pure love ſprings in the Heart, both to him that begets, and to him that is begotten. In the Light there is nothing but Love; but in the Darkneſs there is no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45700:3"/>
true Love to be found, but the very Love that is found there is of the nature of Enmity. It is the Light or Truth that purifieth the Heart to the Love unfeigned, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7thly.</hi> Here the Lambs patience and meekneſs is experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, and the Soul adorned with it. The Lamb is the Light of the World; and they that are made Lambs by him, partake of his ſweet and meek Nature, learning of him to be meek and lowly in heart; and ſo have that patience and meekneſs from him, <hi>which no other can attain to,</hi> Mat. 11. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>8thly.</hi> In the Light the precious Promiſes are fulfilled and partook of, which make them who partake of them, and in whom they are fulfilled partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For the Divine Nature is not partook of in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in him who is Light: Man, (who is Darkneſs) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not partake of the Promiſes which belong to the Children of Light: But, when by the operation of Gods power, his State and Nature is changed, and he is now no more Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but light in the Lord; then the Promiſes which were made to the Children of Light, he cometh to have a ſhare in, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In the Light the Holy anointing is received, the voice of Chriſt heard, and the new everlaſting Covenant, even the ſure Mercies of <hi>David</hi> made with the Soul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. The Law of the new Covenant (even the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus) writ in the Mind, and the holy fear of the New Covenant, which cleanſeth and keepeth clean, put in the heart; and the bleſſed Spirit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given and received, which gives to thoſe that receive it, power to become Sons of God, cauſing them to walk in his wayes and to keep his Statutes and Judgments, and do them. O bleſſed Diſpenſation of Life and holy Power, which the Lord hath cauſed to break forth, among a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed people in theſe latter dayes!

of the Lord, and put their truſt under the ſhadow of his wings, and know what it is to be ſatisfied with the fatneſs of his Spiritual-Goſpel-houſe, and to drink of the River of his pleaſures, and in his Light to ſee Light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36, 7, 8. 9.</p>
               <p>This opened in me this Morning, in Love and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> My Bowels have often rowled over them, and been pained concerning them, to ſee how they are cloſed and ſhut up, as to the true ſenſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of things of this Nature. O that they would prize the day of their Viſitation; that they might hear the ſound of Life, both from others, and alſo in their own hearts, and the ſaving Arm of the Lord might be inwardly Revealed to them, and they effectually Redeemed thereby!</p>
               <p>I am no diſdainer of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or any ſort of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> nay not of <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> but a Mourner becauſe of their ſeveral Miſtakes, and a breather to God of my Life for ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercy towards them all.</p>

            <p>THe pure power of the Lord is upon me, and the Springs of Life open in me; And among many other Things, I am melted in Love and Deſires after your welfare: and this is in my Heart to ſay to you. If I now teſtifie to you in Truth, of a Pearl, a heavenly Pearl, an everlaſting Pearl; will ye not hear me? If I tell you, your Heart is the Field, or Earth, wherein it is hid; will ye not conſider of it? If the everlaſting Goſpel be preached again, which contains true Tidings of Redemption from ſin, will ye not liſten after it? If the Kingdom of God, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, be to be revealed within; would ye not willingly learn to wait for it there? and beg of God that the Eye may be opened in you, which alone can ſee it, when it doth appear? Indeed God's Viſitation is upon this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in an eſpecial manner; his Light and Power is break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth in it againſt the Darkneſs and Power of the Spirit of Satan, which hath captivated, and ſtill captivateth many. Ye deſire outward liberty, and the enjoyment of your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rights; would ye not be free inwardly? Free from the baſe earthly, ſelfiſh nature and ſpirit, which man fallen from God, and the Glory wherein he created him, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into? Oh, is not the Power of God, and the Life of Chriſtable to reſtore man to this? He that created man at firſt ſo glorious, in his own Image; is he not able to create him anew? Oh hear, my dear Countrymen; the Power is revealed, which createth anew; and they that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45700:6"/>
receive it, and are as Clay in the Hands of the great Potter, given up to be formed by it, are dayly created (by the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it) anew, into an Holy, Heavenly, Innocent Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Tender, Righteous Frame Day by Day; and are made willing, daily more and more to be the Lord's, in this Day of his Power; and do receive Power to become Sons, and ſtrength againſt their Souls Enemies: And the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work of Redemption, which God hath begun in them, the Arm of his ſtrength mightily carrieth on in them, to their Comfort, and his everlaſting Praiſe. There is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> as well as there was an outward; and there is a ſpiritual Wilderneſs, and <hi>Canaan</hi> alſo. And the Arm of God's Power Inwardly and Spiritually hath been revealed in this Spiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> Wilderneſs and <hi>Canaan,</hi> as really as ever it was in the outward. Do ye not read of a <hi>Jew-inward,</hi> and a Circumciſion inward, and the Leaven-inward, and keeping the Feaſt of Unleavened Bread, even of Bread that is not leavened with ſin? And he that eats of this unleavened Bread, it unleavens him of ſin, and leavens him with Life and Holineſs: For it is an Holy Bread, and a Living Bread. This is the Bread which comes down from Heaven, which they that feed upon, Live, and they that Live feed upon it. And though they be many, yet feeding upon this Bread, they become one Bread one living Body. Conſiſting of a living Head, and living Members; for the ſame Life, and pure Heavenly nature, which is in the head, is communicated by him to the members.</p>

               <p>I will tell you how We found it, and how none can miſs of it, that ſweep the Houſe and make a diligent and faithful ſearch after it. That in the heart of man, which turns againſt ſin, diſcovers ſin, draws from ſin, wherein Gods Miniſtry help againſt ſin, That is It. That is the

Pearl hid, that is the Kingdom hid, in that is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God revealed from Faith to Faith, in all that receive and give up to this Holy Leaven. This is of the Nature of God and Chriſt, this is a meaſure of his Light, of his pure Life, this is the Law and Commandment ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, which God writes in the Hearts of the Spiritual <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For the inward <hi>Jew</hi> hath inward Tables, where the inward Law is writ, for the inward Eye to read. O how nigh is God inwardly, to the inward people, in this our day! O the pure Glory is broke forth! But, alas, men are in their ſeveral ſorts of Dreams, and take no notice of it. What ſhall the Lord do to awaken this Nation? In what way ſhall his Power appear, to bring down Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to bring up Righteouſneſs in the Spirits of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Do ye not think the Lord hath been at work, and is ſtill at work? How could deceit be ſo waſted Inwardly, and Truth ſo grown Inwardly, and overſpread more and more, and gain ground in the Nation, if the hand of the Power of the Lord were not with it, bleſſing it. O take notice of the handy-work of the Lord, ye Children of men, and wait to feel Truth near, and to partake of the living Virtue and power of it; that you may feel your hearts creating anew, and the old Heavens and Earth may inwardly paſs away, wherein dwells Unrighteouſneſs; and the new Heavens and the new Earth may be inwardly witneſſed, wherein dwells Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. O that this Nation might become a Paradiſe of God! O that every one might be ſenſible of his Preſence, and Power, and Kingdom, and Righteous Government inwardly in the Heart, from the King that ſits on the Throne, to the Begger on the Dunghil. Surely man was not made for himſelf! ſurely he was not made ſuch a Creature as now he is! but in the Holy Image of God, with love in his heart to God above all, and to his Neighbour as to himſelf. O what are Religions and Profeſſions of ſeveral ſorts, where this Love is not found! The Lord is reſtoring his Image,

and bringing forth <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> true, pure Religion again. The Pearl, the Truth contains and comprends it. O buy the Pearl, O buy the precious Truth, ſell all that is contrary to it for it; take up the Croſs to all that is evil in thee, as the Light in thee, as the Light in thee maketh it manifeſt, and thou ſhalt have the free Poſſeſſion of it in thy heart, and feel it a root of Life, a Treaſure of Life, a Well of Life, out of which the Living Water will be daily ſpringing up in thee, unto Life everlaſting, <hi>Amen.</hi>
