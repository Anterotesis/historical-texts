            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:113329:3"/>conceiving that the good which I received by it, ſhould engage me to communicate it to others, I was therefore willing to put it forth in print. But I deſire you (Chriſtian Reader) that you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it is but the heads of what hee delivered, as I tooke it from him in ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and therefore if there be any broken expreſſions in it, attribute it not to him, but to me, who am not ſo well skild (as in underſtanding, ſo) in writing Syllogiſmes, which (I underſtand) he was enjoyned ſo to ſpeak, had he ſpoke in publike, and he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be willing to ſpeake in private, as he ſhould have done there. There was two Miniſters more who exerciſed alſo, whoſe arguments were worthy the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, could I have taken them ſo as to bring them out but not taking of them ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
<pb facs="tcp:113329:3"/>I was loath to diſhonour that truth that I believe was in them.</p>
            <p>My deſire is, that neither I nor you, may ſo look upon this, under the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that diviſion that ſeems to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men of Presbyterians and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and Separatiſts, but that theſe names of diſtinction may bee laid down, and that we may all as ſonnes of Truth, try every thing by the rules of Truth, and love each other in truth, which I know is that which would put an end to that great confuſion and trouble that I ſee abroad. And I hope when you have read this, you will ſee (as well as I) that we have for a long time been led in blindneſſe, taking that upon truſt, which now I ſee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Scripture,</hi> even <hi>Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</hi>

            <p>SEeing a providence hath brought us together at this time, I ſhall therefore endevour, according to the intent of our meeting to declare my ſelfe, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my ſelfe, that I may not only anſwer your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, but directly our intentions, in ſpeaking to the point in hand, which this day ſhould have been diſcuſſed in publike: But ſeeing a providence hath prevented us; and wee who thought to have been in publike, are now prevented by the Civill Magiſtrate, whom wee much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and with all willing Subjection, are willing to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in all things that croſſe not the <hi>LORD JESUS CHRIST:</hi> And truly here is that which ſtayes our ſpirits, though wee were willing to declare our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in publike, to the view of Many; Yet if GOD will have it other wayes, herein is our joy That the Truth knowes how beſt to make out it ſelfe; And it God by our Silence, will cauſe Truth to ſpeake, Wee rejoyce: Or if the time is not yet come to have things brought to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113329:5"/>View, Wee deſire to wayte upon God, knowing that his time is beſt to make out Truth to the Sons of men.</p>
            <p>But before I addreſſe my ſelfe to what I intend to ſpeake, I deſire that you would give mee leave to ſpeake to two or three things:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, To deſire you not to thinke it ſtrange that not onely one, but two, or three ſhould ſpeak to one, and the ſame thing.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, That you would not think it ſtrange for us to trade ſo much in the ſhadow, in breaking up the ſhell, and not a little to trade in the kernell; My meaning is, that wee ſhould ſpeake ſo much of the outward Ordinance; and not enter into the unfolding of the ſweet, and glorious myſtery of God in Chriſt, wrapt up in the Ordinance, which is the Life as of the Ordinance, ſo of Saints while they are obſerving it.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, I deſire that you would not thinke it ſtrange for mee to ſpeake to you, contrary to my wonted practice, which I ſhall at this time doe, onely ſpeaking in a Syllogiſticall way; for the truth is, I ſhall here endeavour to declare my ſelfe in private, as I did intend, to declare my ſelfe in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; and the ſame grounds I intended to lay downe in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, I ſhall lay downe here <hi>Againſt the Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And the reaſon of my ſpeaking Syllogiſtically, is becauſe it was an Injunction laid upon us ſo, to ſpeake, had we met in publike.</p>
            <p>But before I come to lay downe my Reaſons, I ſhall take a portion of Scripture, and draw a Concluſion, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſhall be as a Ground, from whence I purpoſe to build all my following Diſcourſe, the Scripture is.</p>

            <p>I might be large in ſpeaking of this;</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe I ſee men are apt rather to obſerve the commands of men then the commands of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and ſo do exceedingly ſlight and undervalue the commands of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

Now in ſuch a caſe, Suppoſition of one ſide, is as ſtrong as of the other: And if it be a duty to obſerve a thing under ſuch a ſuppoſed conſequence, then if there be a ſuppoſed conſequence for the contrary, it is

If it be a ſuppoſed light, it is but a ſuppoſed duty; if a civil light preſents to a civil man any truth of God,   in his obſervation of it, it is but civil in reference to him; if a legal light preſents an Evangelical truth, to a legal perſon, in his obſervation of it, it is legal in reference to him in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving; if a ſelf light preſent a real duty to an hypocrite, he obſerves it for ſelf-ends. This you may ſee, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5, 6. where he ſaith, <hi>When ye faſted, did ye as all faſt unto me, even to me?</hi> So then if a man obſerves a thing onely from Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and not a command, at the beſt, it is but a ſuppoſed duty.</p>

But if we obſerve any thing barely from Suppoſition, and not from a command, it is obſerved in darkneſſe, and not in light: Therefore not as a duty to be obſerved.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>7</label> In the ſeventh place,   I might give you one reaſon more, and that thus, That which anſwers the Love of Chriſt, and our friendly relation with Chriſt, that's duty and nothing elſe; But to obſerve any thing not from Suppoſition, but to anſwer a Law or Command of Chriſt; that's that which anſwers to the Love of Chriſt, and our friendly relation with Chriſt, and therefore Duty, <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>and</hi> 15.14.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons (deareſt Friends) I have given to you to confirm what before I ſpake, which was, That we are to obſerve nothing as a duty to Chriſt, but that which anſwers a Law given forth by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I might here draw divers Uſes,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> which might be uſeful for us; But at this time I ſhall onely ſpeak of a Uſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; To reprove thoſe that will obſerve things, and in their obſerving, plead for it as a duty to Chriſt, and yet have no command for it from Chriſt: Amongſt the reſt, this is that which I ſhall here reprove, <hi>The Baprizing of Infants;</hi> which is the very point in controverſie: And becauſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſpeak directly to the <hi>Queſtion</hi> as it was ſtated; I ſhall here rehearſe to you what the <hi>Queſtion</hi> was, and what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113329:8"/>they were to prove and what we were to prove. The <hi>Queſtion</hi> was <hi>Whether Infants of beleeving parents were to be Baptized, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not at all go about to meddle with the juſtifying of our practice concerning the <hi>Baptizing of Beleevers;</hi> for that is not the point in hand. Though I muſt tell you, It had been but a reaſonable thing for them by Scripture to endeavour to juſtifie their practice; and we by Scripture to juſtifie ours; and then neither of us would have been put upon the proof of a Negative, which every rational man knows is the worſt and of the ſtaff. But ſeeing it was ſo, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore direct my ſpeech to give forth my judgement concerning that thing.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons that I ſhall at this time lay down (according to time and ſtrength) Why children ought not to be Baptized, are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>1</label> The firſt is this:   That which doth (not onely accidentally, but) directly deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, That ought not to be done:</p>
            <p>But the Baptizing of Infants doth directly deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh;</p>
            <p>Therefore ought it not to be done.</p>
            <p>I know that no man can deny the Major, which is ſo clearly confirmed, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3. with divers other places.</p>
            <p>But at this time I will prove the Minor, That Baptizing of Infants doth directly deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh; And that I prove thus:</p>
            <p>That which doth keep on foot that which was before Chriſt, and ended by Chriſt, conſidered come in the fleſh; that denies Chriſt to be come in the fleſh:</p>
            <p>But the Baptizing of Infants doth keep on foot that which was before Chriſt, and ended by Chriſt, as come in the fleſh;</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:113329:8"/>
            <p>And therefore it denies Chriſt to be come in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>For the proof of this,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall unfold to you what I mean by that which was before Chriſt, and ended by Chriſt come in the fleſh. That which was before Chriſt, was, That God made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which Covenant ran in the fleſh, and was intail'd to generation; and not upon condition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. And this you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 12. And this was that Covenant that Circumciſion of Children had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to; And whoſoever was a childe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a ſon of the fleſh, had a right to it, and might, and did plead for priviledges by it. But when Chriſt came, the natural Branches were cut off <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20, 21. and no man is now conſidered a ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but as he beleeveth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7, 9, 14, 22, 28, 29. And now there is no promiſe that runs forth to any conſidered in referened to a carnal generation; but a ſpiritual Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>John</hi> 3, 5. Therefore when they came to <hi>John</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9.) to be Baptized. He takes them off from pleading their priviledge conſidered in the fleſh, and tells them, <hi>Say not in your heart, You have Abraham to your Father,</hi> and ſo plead for Baptiſm. But he exhorts them to <hi>Believe and Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by this you ſee what I mean by that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, which was, The Promiſes and Covenant run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a natural line; but it is now ended, and runs in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual But now to Baptize Children becauſe their Parents Beleeve, and upon this ground, Becauſe it was the ſame (as they ſay) with Circumciſion; in ſo doing they go about to make the promiſes to run in a natural line, which was ended by Chriſt; And therefore in the obſerving of it, deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly,</p>
            <p>That which doth directly take from Chriſt that which the Holy Ghoſt gives to Chriſt, conſidered come in the fleſh; That denies Chriſt come in the fleſh.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:113329:9"/>
            <p>But the Baptizing of Infants doth directly take from Chriſt that which the Holy Ghoſt gives to Chriſt conſidered come in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Therefore it denies Chriſt come in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>And for the proof of this, I ſhall declare to you what I mean by that which the Holy Ghoſt gives to Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered come in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt gives to Chriſt a pre-eminence above all others that were before him in his Prophetical and Kingly Office.<note place="margin">Col. 1.18. Phil. 2.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In his Prophetical Office,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.68. Matth. 11.9. Luke 24.19.</note> that neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were to be compared with him, but far inferiour to to him, and his Office; So inferiour, that he was not to be expounded by them; but in giving out his minde conſidered come in the fleſh, he was to expound and unfold them. But now men in their going about to plead for the Baptizing of Infants, do exceedingly undervalue Chriſt's Prophetical Office in this, that they make the old Teſtament expound the new;<note place="margin">Matth. 5.21, 22, 27, 28.</note> whereas the new ſhould expound the old; Chriſt ſhould, and doth expound <hi>Moſes;</hi> But there is no warrant for us to bring Chriſt under the Expoſition of <hi>Moſes;</hi> And men do undervalue the Lord Chriſt, in making <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak that which Chriſt ſpeaks not, or bringing <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt, as a greater light to unfold the leſſer; They do (I ſay) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly undervalue Chriſt, and that thus.</p>
            <p>The Light unfolding or the Wiſdom unfolding, muſt be greater then the matter unfolded: And therefore he that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to make <hi>Moſes</hi> mouth to ſpeak out Chriſt's minde, in things that concern Chriſt as come in the fleſh, ſets up <hi>Moſes</hi> above Chriſt; and denies Chriſt to be come in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Iſai. 9.6, 7. Revel. 15.3.</note> They exceedingly take from Chriſt's Kingly Office; whereas the Holy Ghoſt ſets up Chriſt a King in his Church, and a Law-giver, as equal to, ſo tranſcending all others that were before him: But that men in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants do undervalue the Kingly Office of Chriſt,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113329:9"/>in giving Laws to his people. That's clear in theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt in this, That they ſay it is a duty to Baptize Infants, and Anſwers the minde of Chriſt, and yet cannot ſhew a command from Chriſt; whereas the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt was as faithful in his houſe, as Moſes.</hi> And you know the faithfulneſſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> did conſiſt in this, That he gave Laws and Commands to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to declare their duty: and layes nothing upon them as a duty, but what they had a command for. And it he gave them Laws for every thing they were to obſerve, and Chriſt was as faithful in his houſe as he; I will leave this to the judgement of you, whether or no that this doth not undervalue the Kingly Office of Chriſt, to ſay, that Baptizing of Infants is a duty that they owe to Chriſt; and yet can ſhew no command for it from Chriſt.</item>
               <item>Secondly, They undervalue the Kingly Office of Chriſt, in giving Laws to his Church in this; That they go about to perform (as they ſay) a duty to Chriſt, but can ſhew no command for it from Chriſt; but muſt uſe there own Art and Reaſon to make Chriſts Law ſtrong enough to hold it out to be a duty. And whether the joyning of mans Art, Policy, and Reaſon to the Laws of Chriſt, doth not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly undervalue Chriſt, as though his Laws were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enough for his people, I leave you to judge. And in ſo doing they do exceedingly take (as before I ſaid from the Prophetical, ſo here in the Kingly Office of Chriſt) that Honour and Preheminence from him, which the Holy Ghoſt gives to him, conſidered as come in the fleſh: And therefore ſo to do, denies Chriſt as come in the fleſh.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Secondly,</p>
            <p>That which is no part of Righteouſneſſe, that as a duty to Chriſt, ought not to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>But, the Baptizing of Infants is no part of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:113329:10"/>
            <p>And therefore it ought not to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>The Major Propoſition none can deny, I will prove the Minor, and that thus.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever is conſidered as a part of Righteouſneſſe, was ſeen either in the Perſon or Practice of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But neither in the Perſon nor Practice of Jeſus Chriſt, is the Baptizing of Infants ſeen or held forth.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is not part of Righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>And that whatſoever is a part of Righteouſneſſe, was ſeen in the Perſon or Practice of Jeſus Chriſt, is clear from this Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid, Suffer it to be ſo: For thus is becometh us to fulfil all Righteouſneſſe.</hi> If all Righteouſneſſe, then there was no Righteouſneſſe but was confidered either in the Perſon or Practice of Chriſt. And that the <hi>Baptizing of Infants</hi> is not-held out in the Perſon or Practice of Chriſt, I leave to you to judge. He himſelf was not Baptized when he was an Infant, though he might plead the ſame priviledge as they do who ſay they are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Beleevers: Had it been a part of Righteouſneſſe, Chriſt would; nay, Chriſt ſhould have done it.</p>

            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Dy. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That which is not the Baptiſm of Chriſt, That ought not to be done.</p>
            <p>But the Baptizing of Infants is not the Baptiſm of Chriſt;</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:113329:10"/>
            <p>And therefore ought not to be done (We are now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Baptiſm of Chriſt, conſidered in an external way.)</p>
            <p>And that the Baptiſm of Infants, is not the <hi>Baptiſm of Chriſt</hi> ſo conſidered; I prove thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That which doth not Anſwer the Commiſſion of Chriſt, That is not the Baptiſm of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But, the Baptiſm of Infants doth not anſwer the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Chriſt;</p>
            <p>Therefore it is not the Baptiſm of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That it doth not anſwer the Commiſſion of Chriſt, it is clear from the Commiſſion it ſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. Where you ſhall ſee theſe things in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Go teach, Diſcipling,</hi> and <hi>Baptizing.</hi> And they that were to be Baptized, were ſuch as muſt firſt be Taught, and Diſcipled, and being Beleevers, muſt be Baptized, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.</p>
            <p>And that an Infant in the firſt place, is capable to be Taught the myſtery of the Goſpel, and ſo to be taught as to be made a Diſciple of Chriſt, and a Beleever in Chriſt. It is clear that it cannot be; and therefore the Baptizing of them, doth not anſwer the Commiſſion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Every man that profeſſes to act by a Commiſſion, moſt not onely do things becauſe there is not an expreſſ command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: But if they obſerve any thing as a duty; they muſt have a command for it, in, and by it; or elſe it will come under the reproof of him that gives the Commiſſion; as thoſe come under the reproof of Chriſt (<hi>Colloſ</hi>

               </gap>) who by the wiſdom of men, went to preſent a Will-worſhip to God. And ſo you ſee the Baptizing of Infants doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Commiſſion of Chriſt; And therefore it is none of Chriſts Baptiſm, and ought not to be done.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſts Baptiſm is a Baptiſm of Faith,<note place="margin">Acts 8.37. Mark 16.16. Acts 8.12. Acts 2.38. Acts 28.8.</note> and a Baptiſm of Repentance.</p>
            <p>But, the Baptiſm of Infants cannot be a Baptiſm of Faith and a Baptiſm of Repentance.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:113329:11"/>
            <p>Therefore it is not the Baptiſm of Chriſt; and ought not to be done.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>4</label> Fourthly,  </p>
            <p>That which cauſeth inconveniences in the Church, That ought not to be done.</p>
            <p>But, the Baptizing of Infants doth cauſe inconveniences in the Church;</p>
            <p>Therefore it ought not to be done.</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you (dear Friends) for this Argument, I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed it from them that oppoſe the thing, who laid down this as an Argument for Baptizing of Infants; and that thus:</p>
            <p>That which cauſeth inconveniences in the Church, That ought not to be done:</p>
            <p>But, (ſay they) the denying of Childrens Baptiſm, cauſeth inconveniences in the Church; And therefore it ought not to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And to prove this, they go to prove a Suppoſition by a Suppoſition; and that thus:</p>
            <p>It will make the Children of Beleevers (ſay they) to be no other wayes then the Children of Heathens; and ſo they go about to prove a Conſequence by a Conſequence; which is but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> upon.</p>
            <p>But that the Baptizing of Infants doth cauſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Church, I will prove from Scripture: and that thus;</p>
            <p>That which doth not onely, preſent one, but make one a Member of a Church; before being called of God, That is inconvenient:</p>
            <p>But, the Baptizing of Infants makes them Members of their Church, before they are called of God; And therefore it is inconvenient, and contrary to theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1.</p>
            <p>Secondly,</p>
            <p>That which intails mercies and priviledges to generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113329:11"/>which alone is to be intail'd upon men in reference to regeneration, That is inconvenient.</p>
            <p>But the Baptizing of Infants, doth intail mercies and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to them in reference to generation, and not regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And therefore it is inconvenient, and contrary to this Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. with many other places, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. where he doth declare that all thoſe that were in the Church of Chriſt, and impriviledged with the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, they were fanctified by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That which cauſeth a Separation, and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſts conjunction; Thats inconvenient.</p>
            <p>But, the Baptizing of Infants, doth make a Separation, and diſtraction in Chriſts conjunction; And therefore it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient.</p>
            <p>By Chriſts conjunction, I mean the oneneſſe that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ground that Chriſt layes down for men to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and the ground he layes down for men to break Bread; which is one and the ſame thing: He that Beleeves, and knows, and diſcerns Chriſt, he is to be Baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. And he that doth ſo, is to break Bread, in remembrance of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Now, thoſe that plead ſo much for the Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, by the ſame ground they would Baptize Infants upon, they will not admit them nor others to break Bread; And therefore as Chriſts ground is one, theirs is two: And under that conſideration, they make a Separation in that which Chriſt makes a oneneſſe; and that is inconvenient in the Church of Chriſt, and ought not to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>5</label> Fifthly, That which doth directly croſſe the proceedings in the time of the Law, and in the time of the Goſpel. That ought not to be done.</p>
            <p>But, the Baptizing of Infants, doth directly croſſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the time of the Law, and in the time of the Goſpel; And therefore it ought not to be done.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:113329:12"/>
            <p>By that, I mean, That no man in the time of the Law, and in the time of the Goſpel was to do any thing by the vertue of a Right,<note place="margin">Iſai. 8.20.</note> without a Rule; But whatſoever they did as a Duty, it was to anſwer a Rule. Had <hi>Abraham</hi> been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by the vertue of a Right, as he was a Beleever, and not by the vertue of a Rule; then <hi>Lot</hi> might have pleaded for the ſame priviledge, for he was a Beleever as well as <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet God did not make choice of <hi>Lot,</hi> but of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> And then, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſhould not have been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, but onely <hi>Iſaa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> But though <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was a ſon of the fleſh, and caſt out by God, and not a Beleever in God; yet he muſt be circumciſed: And therefore this was not by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Right, but by the vertue of a Rule.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing alſo was in the time of the Goſpel, where it is clearly diſcovered that Chriſt owns nothing as a Duty, but as it anſwers a Law; and they were to do nothing plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Right, without a Rule; but to do all things by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Rule: Therefore under that conſideration, Will-worſhip was condemned.</p>
            <p>Now if there be any rule, or any command in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for Infants to be Baptized, I deſire they would ſhew it: Here is the Word of Truth, which juſtifies all things ſutable to it ſelf; and owns nothing elſe to be a Truth. And I do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly wonder that any men ſhould go about to plead for a thing by the vertue of a Right, without a Rule.</p>
            <p>I have much more to ſay to you in this thing, had I time and ſtrength: But, I hope theſe five grounds that I have here laid down, will clearly diſcover to you, That Infants ought not to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>I am not here now to prove to you the Baptizing of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; That's not the controverſie in hand, though a thing clear by Scripture; and that which I ſhould be glad if I had an occaſion to ſpeak of. Not onely to ſpeak of Baptiſm in the Letter, but Baptiſm in the Spirit, which was the myſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel, and the glorious excellency of Chriſt in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113329:12"/>the Spirit, held out in the Adminiſtrations of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the fleſh; which Adminiſtrations in the fleſh, are as ſo many ſignes to declare the Myſtery of the Spirit; though I know none can underſtand it, but they that do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it; for none can unletter the Letter, but the Spirit: But I ceaſe from that, and ceaſe giving you any further Reaſons (at this time) to prove that which we were to have proved in Publike, had we had liberty; which was, <hi>That Infants ought not to be Baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I leave them and you ſo to the Truth; deſiring that we may all be taught by the Truth; and ſweetly made one in the Truth; and carried out from thence, to walk up in an acknowledgement of the Truth, ſutable to the Rules of it Self.</p>
