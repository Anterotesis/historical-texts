            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Underſtand that the <hi>French</hi> King hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Society of Ingenious Men, whoſe main Buſineſs it is to keep Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence in ſeveral Parts of the World, and receive Informations of the Novelties that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33363:3"/>
in the Cures of Diſeaſes, by ſpecifick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies: Divers of which have been found upon tryal very uſeful in <hi>England</hi> and other Parts of the World: And we are greatly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>'s at <hi>Greſham-Colledge,</hi> for their Kind Communications, in the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Tranſactions which come forth every Month.</p>
            <p>I now recommend to you from my own Experience and Succeſs the <hi>Bezoar</hi> Nutt or <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duck,</hi> as an Excellent Specifick againſt all ſorts of Diſtempers that proceed from Wind in any part of the Bodies of Men, Women or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. It prevents and removes flatulent Belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which ariſe from the Stomack and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and by its Specifick Quality diſpels thoſe windy Blaſts which raiſe Storms and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts in the Body, ſometimes producing Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and other times windy Ruptures, which prove very painfull and Dangerous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parkinſon</hi> in his Herbal tells us, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> call it their <hi>Childrens Guardian</hi>; and not only give it Inwardly, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33363:3"/>
hang it about their Necks, to preſerve them from all Evils.</p>
            <p>I have known many Children moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably afflicted with Griping in the Guts with Wind, who have found great Relief by this ſimple Medicine given for one Month.</p>
            <p>An old Gentleman extreamly Tormented with Chollick pains in his Bowels, and alſo with a <hi>Hermia Ventoſa</hi> or Windy Rupture: He had uſed many Clyſters, and taken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Internal Medicines to expell Wind, and all to no purpoſe: Yet upon the uſe of the Tincture, Spirit and Extract drawn out of theſe Nuts, was wonderfully eaſed.</p>
            <p>A Man about Forty years of Age, who was ſeldom free from Collick Pains and Ruptures, although he tryed many ſorts of Truſſes and Plaſters to keep the Wind from falling down, yet all failed, untill he uſed theſe Medicines, and then he found great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And I don't doubt but others may find the ſame advantage with God Almighty's bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:33363:4"/>I knew a young Gentlewoman who was at ſome certain times ſo threatned with acute Pains from Wind, that there was great Reaſon for Phyſicians to ſuſpect a Gangrene or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of her Stomack and Bowels: She had taken many Phyſicians advice, and at laſt I adviſed her to the uſe of this Remedy, and ſhe found preſent Eaſe.</p>
            <p>A Countrey Farmer far remote from all Phyſicians, who is very ſubject to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Diſtempers, yet ſpeedily helps him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the uſe of this Remedy, without Oyntments, Plaſters or Fomentations: He finds it ſenſibly expells the Wind, and keeps his Rupture from falling down, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think I ought to tell the World this Excellent Medicine, and not keep it to my ſelf for Private Advantage, as is now become the common Cuſtom of the World.</p>
            <p>The great miſeries that ſome People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure by Wind in their Bodies, makes their Lives bitter, and they are afraid of every<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33363:4"/>
they eat and drink, leſt it ſhould cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Diſturbance to them. In ſuch caſes there's nothing better for ſuch Perſons, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate theſe Drops with all their Meat and Drink: And by this Means they prevent that miſerable Diſtemper the Twiſting of the Guts, which ſends ſo many to their long Homes.</p>
            <p>I have greatly admired to ſee what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Eaſe many have received by theſe Nuts, when the Tincture, Spirit and Extract have been given in plentiful Draughts of Chicken Broath.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why I conceal my Name, is, left the Country People knowing what I uſe, ſhould deſpiſe it, or left Phyſicians ſhould think I recommend it for private advantage.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why I direct this Letter to you, is, beeauſe in your <hi>Chymical Galeniſt,</hi> you wiſely make <hi>Experience</hi> a ſurer Tryal of the Goodneſs of a Medicine, than either <hi>Taſte</hi> or <hi>Smell.</hi>
