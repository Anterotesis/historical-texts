            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">The People of <hi>England</hi> about 7 Millions and 400 Thousand.</note>
about 7 Millions, 369
Thousand Souls; with
which Account that of
the <hi>Poll-money, Hearth-money,</hi> and
the Bishops late Numbring of the
<hi>Communicants,</hi> do pretty well agree;
wherefore although the said Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 7 Millions, 369 Thousand, be
not (as it cannot be) a <hi>demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Truth,</hi> yet it will serve for a good
<hi>Supposition,</hi> which is as much as we
want at present.</p>
            <p>As for the time in which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
double, it is yet more hard to
be found: For we have good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
(in the said 94 <hi>pag.</hi> of the
afore-mentioned Observations) That
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60186:7"/>
in the Countrey, but one of fifty
dye <hi>per Annum;</hi> and by other late
Accounts, that there have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
but 24 <hi>Births</hi> for 23 <hi>Burials,</hi>
The which two points, if they were
universally, and constantly true, there
would be colour enough to say, that
the People doubled but in about
1200 Years. As for Example: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there be 600 people, of which
let a fiftieth part dye <hi>per Annum,</hi> then
there shall dye 12 <hi>per Annum;</hi> and if
the Births be as 24 to 23, then the
Increase of the People shall be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
above half a Man <hi>per Annum,</hi>
and consequently the supposed Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 600, cannot be doubled but
in 1126 Years, which to reckon in
round Numbers, and for that the
afore-mentioned Fractions were not
exact, we had rather call 1200.</p>
            <p>There are also other good <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi>
That even in the Countrey,
one in about 30, or 32 <hi>per Annum</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60186:7"/>
hath dyed, and that there have been
five <hi>Births</hi> for four <hi>Burials.</hi> Now,
according to this Doctrine, 20 will
dye <hi>per Annum</hi> out of the above 600,
and 25 will be Born, so as the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi>
will be 5, which is a hundred
and twentieth part of the said 600.
So as we have two fair <hi>Computations,</hi>
differing from each other as one to
ten; and there are also several other
good <hi>Observations</hi> for other <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might here Insert, That although
the Births in this last Computation
be 25 of 600, or a Twenty fourth
part of the People; yet that in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
possibility, they may be near
thrice as many, and near 75. For
that by some late <hi>Observations,</hi> the
<hi>Teeming</hi> Females between 15 and 44,
are about 180 of the said 600, and
the <hi>Males</hi> of between 18 and 59,
are about 180 also, and that every
Teeming <hi>Woman</hi> can bear a <hi>Child</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60186:8"/>
once in two Years; from all which
it is plain, that the <hi>Births</hi> may be
90. (and abating 15 for <hi>Sickness,</hi>
Young <hi>Abortions,</hi> and <hi>Natural Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness)</hi>
there may remain 75 Births,
which is an Eighth of the People;
which by some Observations we
have found to be but a <hi>two and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
part,</hi> or but a <hi>quarter</hi> of what
is thus shewn to be Naturally pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
Now, according to this Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
if the <hi>Births</hi> may be 75 of
600, and the <hi>Burials</hi> but 15, then
the <hi>Annual Increase</hi> of the People will
be 60; and so the said 600 People
may double in 10 Years, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
yet more from 1200, above-mentioned.
Now, to get out of
this Difficulty, and to temper those
vast disagreements, I took the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
of 50 and 30 dying <hi>per Annum,</hi>
and pitch'd upon 40; and I also took
the <hi>Medium</hi> between 24 <hi>Births</hi> and
23 <hi>Burials,</hi> and 5 <hi>Births</hi> for 4 <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60186:8"/>
viz.</hi> allowing about 10 <hi>Births</hi>
for 9 <hi>Burials;</hi> upon which Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
there must dye 15 <hi>per Annum</hi>
out of the above-mentioned 600,
and the <hi>Births</hi> must be 16 <hi>and two
Thirds,</hi> and the Increase 1, and two
Thirds, or five Thirds of a Man,
which Number compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with 1800 <hi>Thirds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">That the time of doubling is here and now 360 Years.</note>
or 600 Men, gives 360
Years for the time of

for <hi>Wars, Plagues,</hi> and <hi>Famine,</hi>
the Effects whereof, though they be
<hi>Terrible</hi> at the Times and Places
where they happen, yet in a period
of 360 Years, is no great Matter in

first 100 Years after the <hi>Flood</hi> from
8 to 8000, and that in 350 Years
after the <hi>Flood</hi> (when abouts <hi>Noah</hi>
dyed) to one Million, and by this
time 1682, to 320 Millions (which
by rational conjecture, are thought
to be now in the World) it will not
be hard to compute, how in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate
Years, the <hi>Growths</hi> may
be made, according to what is set
down in the following <hi>Table,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
making the doubling to be 10
Years at first, and within 1200 Years
at last, we take a discretionary liberty,
but justifiable by Observations and
the Scriptures for the rest, which
Table we leave to be Corrected by
<hi>Historians,</hi> who know the bigness of
<hi>Ancient Cities, Armies,</hi> and <hi>Colonies</hi>
in the respective <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi>
in the mean time affirming that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such difference in the <hi>Measures</hi>
and Periods for doubling (the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
whereof we have demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60186:11"/>
to be real and true) it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to solve what is written in the
Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> and other <hi>Authentick
Books.</hi> For if we pitch upon any
one Number throughout for this
purpose, 150 Years is the fittest of
all round Numbers; according to
which, there would have been but
512 Souls in the whole World in
<hi>Moses's</hi> time (being 800 Years after
the Flood) when 603 Thousand
<hi>IsraÃ¨lites</hi> of above 20 Years Old (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those of other Ages, Tribes,
and Nations) were found upon an
exact Survey appointed by God,
Whereas our Table makes 12 Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And there would have been
but 8000 in <hi>David's</hi> Time, when
were found 1100 Thousand of above
20 Years Old (besides others, as
aforesaid) in <hi>Israel,</hi> upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
instigated by Satan, whereas our
Table makes 32 Millions. And there
would have been but a quarter of a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60186:12"/>
Million about the Birth of Christ, or
<hi>Augustus</hi> his Time, when <hi>Rome</hi> and
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire were so great,
whereas our Table makes 100 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.
Where Note, That the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
in about 500 Years between
their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>David</hi>'s
Reign, increased from 603 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
to 1100 Thousand.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if we pitch
upon a less Number, as 100 Years,
the World would have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled
700 Years since. Wherefore,
no one Number will solve the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
and therefore we have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
several in Order to make the
following Table, which we again
desire Historians to Correct, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what they find in Antiquity
concerning the Number of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in each Age and Countrey of the
World.</p>
            <p>We did (not long since) assist a
worthy Divine, writing against some
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60186:12"/>
               <hi>Scepticks,</hi> who would have baffled
our belief of the Resurrection, by
saying, that the whole Globe of the
Earth could not furnish Matter
enough for all the Bodies that must
Rise at the last Day, much less would
the surface of the Earth furnish
footing for so vast a Number; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we did (by the Method afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned)
assert the Number of
Men now living, and also of those
that had dyed since the beginning of
the World, and did withal shew,
that half the Island of <hi>Ireland</hi> would
afford them all, not only Footing
to stand upon, but Graves to lye
down in, for that whole Number;
and that two Mountains in that
Countrey were as weighty as all the
Bodies that had ever been from the
beginning of the World to the Year
1680, when this Dispute happened.

inexpensive Living; from 1660 to
1670, The <hi>Kings Friends</hi> and <hi>Party</hi>
came to receive his <hi>Favours</hi> after his
<hi>Happy Restauration;</hi> from 1670 to
1680, The frequency of <hi>Plots</hi> and
Parliaments, might bring extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Numbers to the City; But
what Reasons to assign for the like
<hi>Increase</hi> from 1604 to 1642, I know
not, unless I should pick out some
<hi>Remarkable Accident</hi> happening in
each part of the said <hi>Period,</hi> and
make that to be the Cause of this
<hi>Increase</hi> (as Vulgar People make the
Cause of every Mans Sickness, to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60186:14"/>
what he did last eat) wherefore, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than so to say <hi>quidlibet de quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet;</hi>
I had rather quit even what I
have above-said to be the Cause of
<hi>London</hi>'s <hi>Increase</hi> from 1642 to 1682,
and put the whole upon some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and Spontaneous <hi>Benefits</hi> and
Advantages that Men find by Living
in great more than in small <hi>Societies;</hi>
and shall therefore seek for the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Causes</hi> of this <hi>Growth,</hi> in the
<hi>Consequences</hi> of the like, considered
in greater <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, whereas in Arithmetick, out
of two false <hi>Positions</hi> the Truth is
extracted, so I hope out of two <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant</hi>
contrary Suppositions, to
draw forth some solid and consistent
<hi>Conclusion, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of the said two Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
is, That the City of <hi>London</hi>
is seven times bigger than now, and
that the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of it are four
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60186:15"/>
Millions 690 Thousand People, and
that in all the other <hi>Cities, Ports,
Towns,</hi> and <hi>Villages,</hi> there are but
two Millions 710 Thousand more.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Supposition</hi> is, That the
City of <hi>London</hi> is but a seventh part
of its present bigness, and that the
<hi>Inhabitants</hi> of it are but 96 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and that the rest of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
(being 7 Millions 304 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand)
do Co-habit thus, 104 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of them in small <hi>Cities</hi> and
<hi>Towns,</hi> and that the rest, being seven
Millions 200 Thousand, do Inhabit
in <hi>Houses</hi> not contiguous to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>viz.</hi> In 1200 Thousand Houses,
having about 24 Acres of Ground
belonging to each of them, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about 28 Millions of Acres to be
in the whole <hi>Territory</hi> of <hi>England,
Wales,</hi> and the adjacent <hi>Islands;</hi>
which any Man that pleases may Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
upon a good Map.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60186:15"/>Now, the Question is, In which
of these two Imaginary states, would
be the most convenient, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and comfortable Livings?</p>
            <p>But this general Question divides
it self into the several Questions,
relating to the following Particulars,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. For the <hi>Defence</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
against Foraign Powers.</p>
            <p>2. For preventing the <hi>Intestine
Commotions</hi> of <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Factions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. For <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vniformity</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. For the <hi>Administration</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. For the proportionably <hi>Taxing</hi>
of the People, and easie <hi>Levying</hi> the
same.</p>
            <p>6. For <hi>Gain</hi> by Foraign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p>7. For <hi>Husbandry, Manufacture,</hi>
and for <hi>Arts</hi> of Delight and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60186:16"/>8. For lessening the Fatigue of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages</hi>
and <hi>Travelling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. For preventing <hi>Beggars</hi> and
<hi>Thieves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. For the Advancement and
Propagation of <hi>Vseful Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. For <hi>Increasing</hi> the People by
<hi>Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. For preventing the Mischiefs
of <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Contagions.</hi> And
withal, which of the said two states
is most Practicable and Natural;
for in these and the like particulars,
do lye the <hi>Tests</hi> and <hi>Touch-stones</hi> of
all <hi>Proposals,</hi> that can be made for
the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>First, as to <hi>Practicable,</hi> we say,
That although our said Extravagant
Proposals are both in Nature possible,
yet it is not Obvious to every Man to
conceive, how <hi>London,</hi> now seven
times bigger than in the beginning
of <hi>Queen Elizabeths Reign,</hi> should
be seven times bigger than now it is,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60186:16"/>
and 49 times bigger than <hi>Anno</hi> 1560.
To which I say, 1. That the present
City of <hi>London</hi> stands upon less than
1500 Acres of Ground, wherefore a
City seven times as large may stand
upon 10500 Acres, which is about
equivalent to a Circle of four Miles
and a half in Diameter, and less than
15 Miles in Circumference. 2. That
a Circle of Ground of 35 Miles Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter
will bear <hi>Corn, Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuff,
Fruits, Hay,</hi> and <hi>Timber</hi> for the
four Millions 690 Thousand Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the said City and Circle,
so as nothing of that kind need be
brought from above 35 Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the said City; for the
Number of Acres within the said
Circle, reckoning one Acre suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to furnish <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Drink-Corn</hi>
for every Head, and two Acres will
furnish Hay for every Necessary
Horse; And that the Trees which
may grow in the Hedge-rows of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60186:17"/>
Fields within the said Circle, may
furnish <hi>Timber</hi> for 600 Thousand
Houses. 3. That all live Cattel and
great Animals can bring themselves
to the said City; and that Fish can
be brought from the <hi>Lands-end</hi> and
<hi>Berwick</hi> as easily as now. 4. Of
<hi>Coals</hi> there is no doubt: And for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
20 <hi>s. per</hi> Family (or 600 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> in the whole)
will serve this <hi>City,</hi> especially with
the help of the <hi>New River.</hi> But if
by Practicable be understood, that
the present state may be suddenly
changed into either of the two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned
Proposals, I think
it is not <hi>Practicable.</hi> Wherefore the
true Question is, unto or towards
which of the said two Extravagant
states it is best to bend the present
state by degrees, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it be
best to lessen or enlarge the present
City? In Order whereunto, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
(as to the first Question) which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60186:17"/>
state is most <hi>Defensible</hi> against <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Powers,</hi> saying, that if the
above-mentioned Housing, and a
border of Ground, of 3 quarters of a
Mile broad, were encompassed with
a Wall and Ditch of 20 Miles about
(as strong as any in <hi>Europe,</hi> which
would cost but a Million, or about
a Penny in the shilling of the House-Rent
for one Year) what <hi>Foraign
Prince</hi> could bring an Army from
beyond Seas, able to beat, 1. Our
Sea-Forces, and next with Horse
harrass'd at Sea, to resist all the fresh
Horse that <hi>England</hi> could make, and
then Conquer above a Million of
Men, well United, Disciplin'd, and
Guarded within such a <hi>Wall,</hi> distant
every where 3 quarters of a Mile from
the Housing, to elude the <hi>Granadoes</hi>
and great Shot of the <hi>Enemy?</hi> 2. As
to <hi>Intestine Parties</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> I
suppose that 4 Millions 690 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
People United within this great
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60186:18"/>
City, could easily Govern half the
said Number scattered without it,
and that a few Men in Arms within
the said City, and Wall, could also
easily Govern the rest unarmed, or
Armed in such manner as the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi>
shall think fit. 3. As to <hi>Vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
in <hi>Religion,</hi> I conceive, That if St.
<hi>Martins</hi> Parish may (as it doth) consist
of about 40 Thousand Souls, That
this great City also may as well be
made but as one Parish, with 7 times
130 Chappels, in which might not
only be an Uniformity of Common
Prayer, but in Preaching also; for
that a thousand Copies of one Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and Authentically Composed
<hi>Sermon,</hi> might be every Week read
in each of the said <hi>Chappels</hi> without
any subsequent Repetition of the
same, as in the Case of Homilies.
Whereas in <hi>England</hi> (wherein are
near 10 Thousand Parishes, in each
of which upon Sundays, Holy-days,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60186:18"/>
and other Extraordinary Occasions,
there should be about 100 Sermons
<hi>per Annum,</hi> making about a Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sermon <hi>per Annum</hi> in the
whole:) It were a Miracle, if a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of Sermons Composed by so
many Men, and of so many Minds
and Methods, should produce <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
upon the discomposed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
of about 8 Millions of
Hearers.</p>
            <p>4. As to the <hi>Administration</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
If in this great City shall dwell
the Owners of all the Lands, and
other Valuable things in <hi>England;</hi> If
within it shall be all the <hi>Traders,</hi> &amp; all
the <hi>Courts, Offices, Records, Iuries,</hi> and
<hi>Witnesses;</hi> Then it follows, that <hi>Iustice</hi>
may be made with speed and ease.</p>
            <p>5. As to the <hi>Equality</hi> and
easie <hi>Levying</hi> of Taxes, It is too
certain, That <hi>London</hi> hath at some
times paid near half the Excise of
<hi>England;</hi> and that the People pay
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60186:19"/>
thrice as much for the Hearths in
<hi>London</hi> as those in the Countrey, in
proportion to the People of each,
and that the Charge of Collecting
these Duties, have been about a sixth
part of the Duty it self. Now, in
this great City, the Excise alone ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the present Laws, would
not only be double to the whole
Kingdom, but also more equal. And
the Duty of Hearths of the said
City, would exceed the present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
of the whole Kingdom. And
as for the <hi>Customs,</hi> we mention them
not at present.</p>
            <p>6. Whether more would be <hi>gain'd</hi>
by <hi>Foraign Commerce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gain which <hi>England</hi> makes
by <hi>Lead, Coals,</hi> the Freight of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be the same, for ought
I see, in both Cases. But the Gain
which is made by <hi>Manufactures,</hi> will
be greater, as the Manufacture it self
is greater and better. For in so vast
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60186:19"/>
a City <hi>Manufactures</hi> will beget one
another, and each <hi>Manufacture</hi> will
be divided into as many parts as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
whereby the Work of each
<hi>Artisan</hi> will be simple and easie; As
for Example. In the making of a
<hi>Watch,</hi> If one Man shall make the
<hi>Wheels,</hi> another the <hi>Spring,</hi> another
shall Engrave the <hi>Dial-plate,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall make the <hi>Cases,</hi> then the
<hi>Watch</hi> will be better and cheaper,
than if the whole Work be put upon
any one Man. And we also see that
in <hi>Towns,</hi> and in the <hi>Streets</hi> of a
great <hi>Town,</hi> where all the <hi>Inhabitants</hi>
are almost of one Trade, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
peculiar to those places is
made better and cheaper than else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
Moreover, when all sorts of
Manufactures are made in one place,
there every Ship that goeth forth,
can suddenly have its Loading of so
many several Particulars and Species,
as the Port whereunto she is bound
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60186:20"/>
can take off. Again, when the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Manufactures</hi> are made in one
place, and Shipped off in another,
the <hi>Carriage, Postage,</hi> and <hi>Travelling-charges</hi>
will Inhance the Price of such
<hi>Manufacture,</hi> and lessen the Gain
upon <hi>Foraign Commerce.</hi> And lastly,
when the Imported Goods are spent
in the Port it self, where they are
Landed, the Carriage of the same
into other places, will create no sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
upon such Commodity; all
which particulars tends to the greater
Gain by <hi>Foraign Commerce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. As for <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are best promoted by the
greatest Number of <hi>Emulators.</hi> And
it is more likely that one <hi>Ingenious
Curious Man</hi> may rather be found
out amongst 4 Millions than 400
Persons. But as for <hi>Husbandry,</hi> viz.
<hi>Tillage</hi> and <hi>Pasturage,</hi> I see no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but the second state (when
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60186:20"/>
each Family is charged with the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of about 24 Acres) will best
promote the same.</p>
            <p>8. As for lessening the Fatigue of
<hi>Carriage</hi> and <hi>Travelling,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things speaks it self, for if all
the Men of Business, and all <hi>Artisans</hi>
do Live within five Miles of each
other; And if those who Live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the great City, do spend only
such Commodities as grow where
they Live, when the charge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and Travelling could be little.</p>
            <p>9. As to the preventing of <hi>Beggars</hi>
and <hi>Thieves,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not find how the differences
of the said two states should make
much difference in this particular;
for Impotents (which are but one
in about 600) ought to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the rest. 2. Those who
are unable to Work, through the
evil Education of their <hi>Parents,</hi> ought
(for ought I know) to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60186:21"/>
by their nearest Kindred, as
a just Punishment upon them. 3. And
those who cannot find Work (though
able and willing to perform it) by
reason of the unequal application
of Hands to Lands, ought to be
provided for by the <hi>Magistrate</hi> and
<hi>Land-Lord</hi> till that can be done;
for there needs be no <hi>Beggars</hi> in
Countries, where there are many
Acres of unimproved improvable
Land to every Head, as there are in
<hi>England.</hi> As for <hi>Thieves,</hi> they are
for the most part begotten from the
same Cause; For it is against Nature,
that any Man should venture his
Life, Limb, or Liberty, for a wretched
Livelyhood, whereas moderate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
will produce a better. But of
this see Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> in the first
part of his <hi>Vtopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. As to the <hi>Propagation</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi>
of <hi>Vseful Learning,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60186:21"/>The same may be said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it as was above-said concerning
<hi>Manufactures,</hi> and the <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
and <hi>Ornaments;</hi> for in the great
vast City, there can be no so odd a
Conceit or Design, whereunto some
Assistance may not be found, which
in the thin, scattered way of Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
may not be.</p>
            <p>11. As for the <hi>Increase</hi> of <hi>People</hi>
by <hi>Generation,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I see no great difference from either
of the two states, for the same may
be hindred or promoted in either,
from the same Causes.</p>
            <p>12. As to the <hi>Plague,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be remembred, that one
time with another, a <hi>Plague</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
in <hi>London</hi> once in 20 Years, or
thereabouts; for in the last hundred
Years, between the Years 1582 and
1682, there have been five great
<hi>Plagues, viz. Anno</hi> 1592, 1603, 1625,
1636, and 1665. And it is also to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60186:22"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ1 page duplicateã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60186:22"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ1 page duplicateã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60186:23"/>
be remembred, that the <hi>Plagues</hi> of
<hi>London</hi> do commonly kill one fifth
part of the <hi>Inhabitants.</hi> Now, if
the whole People of <hi>England</hi> do
double but in 360 Years, then the
Annual Increase of the same is but
20000, and in 20 Years 400000.
But if in the City of <hi>London</hi> there
should be two Millions of People,
(as there will be about 60 Years
hence) then the <hi>Plague</hi> (killing
one fifth of them, namely, 400000,
once in 20 Years) will destroy as
many in one Year, as the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can re-furnish in 20: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the People of the Nation
shall never Increase. But if the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>London</hi> shall be above 4 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
(as in the first of our two <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant</hi>
Suppositions is premised)
then the People of the whole Nation
shall lessen above 20000 <hi>per Annum.</hi>
So as if People be worth 70 <hi>l. per</hi>
Head (as hath elsewhere been shewn)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60186:23"/>
then the said greatness of the City
will be a damage to it self and the
whole Nation of 14 hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and so <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rata,</hi>
for a greater or lesser Number;
wherefore to determine, which of
the two <hi>states</hi> is best, (that is to say,
towards which of the said two <hi>states
Authority</hi> should bend the present
<hi>state)</hi> a just Balance ought to be
made between the disadvantages
from the <hi>Plague,</hi> with the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
accruing from the other Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
above-mentioned; unto which
<hi>Balance</hi> a more exact Account of the
People, and a better Rule for the
Measure of its Growth is Necessary,
than what we have here given, or are
yet able to lay down.</p>

            <p>IT was not very pertinent to a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
concerning the <hi>Growth</hi> of

the Number of the Quick and

Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nevertheless, since some
Friends liking the said Digressions
and Impertinencies (perhaps as sauce
to a dry Discourse) have desired that
the same might be explain'd and
made out. I therefore say as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>1. If the Number of Acres in the
Habitable part of the Earth, be under
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60186:24"/>
50. Thousand Millions; if Twenty
Thousand Millions of People, are
more than the said Number of Acres
will feed; (few or no Countries
being so fully Peopled;) and for
that in six doublings (which will be
in 2000 Years) the present 320 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
will exceed the said 20 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Millions.</p>
            <p>2. That the Number of all those
who have dyed since the <hi>Flood,</hi> is the
sum of all the Products made by Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying
the Number of the doubling
Periods mentioned in the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
of the last Table, by the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

by 40 (one dying out of 40
<hi>per Annum,</hi> out of the whole Mass
of Mankind) which Quotient is
12570 Millions; Whereunto may

mentioned Number 20 Thousand
Millions, as the full Number of all
that dyed, from the beginning of
the World, to the Year 1682; unto
which, if 320 Millions, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those who are now alive, be
added, the Total of the Quick and
the Dead, will amount but unto one
fifth part of the Graves, which the
surface of <hi>Ireland</hi> will afford, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever putting two Bodies into
any one Grave; for there be in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
28 Thousand square <hi>English</hi>
Miles, each whereof will afford about
4 Millions of Graves, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
above 114 Thousand Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Graves, <hi>viz.</hi> about 5 times
the Number of the Quick and the
Dead, which should arise at the last
Day, in case the same had been in
the Year 1682.</p>
            <p>3. Now, if there may be place
for five times as many Graves in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as are sufficient for all that ever
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60186:25"/>
dyed; And if the Earth of one
Grave weigh five times as much as
the Body Interr'd therein, then a
Turf, less than a Foot thick, pared
off from a fifth part of the surface
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> will be equivalent in
bulk and weight to all the Bodies that
ever were Buried; And may serve as
well for that purpose, as the two
Mountains afore-mentioned in the
body of this Discourse. From all
which it is plain, how madly they
were mistaken, who did so petulant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vilisie what the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>
have delivered.</p>
