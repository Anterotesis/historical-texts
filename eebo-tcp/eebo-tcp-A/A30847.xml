            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Most High, and Most Illustrious
PRINCESS
The LADY
ANN,
Daughter to His
Royal Highness.</head>

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Humbly lay before your Highness Feet
an Unhappy Favourite, but 'tis in Your
Power to make him no longer so; Not his
Queens Repentance, nor her Tears cou'd
Rescue him from the Malice of his Enemies,
nor from the violence of a most unfortunate
Death; but your Highness with this unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Favour, and so Divine a Condescention in
Protecting this once pitty'd Hero, will make him
live Eternally; and those who cou'd scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
him on the Stage without weeping, when
they shall see him thus exalted, will all turn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb facs="tcp:50769:3"/>
of his Fortune, which they can never think
deplorable while he is grac'd by your Highness.
For my own part, I tremble to express my
Thanks in so mean Language, but much more
when I wou'd pay my Tribute of just Praises to
your Highness; 'tis not to be attempted by any
Pen, Heaven has done it to a Miracle in Your
own Person, where are Written so many admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Characters, such Illustrious Beauties on a
Body so Divinely fram'd, that there is none so
dull and ignorant, that cannot read 'em plainly;
And when You vouchsafe to cast your Eyes on
those beneath You, they speak their own Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
with greater Art and Eloquence, and
attract more Admiration than ever <hi>Virgil</hi> did in
his Divinest Flight of Fancy, then <hi>Ovid</hi> in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Princess, or <hi>Appelles</hi> in drawing of his
<hi>Venus;</hi> Nor are Your Virtues, or Your Royal
Blood less admirable, sprung from the Inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Fountain of so many Illustrious Plantagenets,
that I stand amaz'd at the Mightyness of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
which I have chosen; besides the awful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of your Highness bids me beware how I
come too near, lest I Prophane so many Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Perfections in so Sacred a Shrine as your
Highness Person, where You ought to be ador'd,
<pb facs="tcp:50769:3"/>
and not seen: For, like the Antient Jews in their
Religious Worship, 'tis a Favour for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
on the outward steps, and not approach
nigh the Vail where the Crowd never come: This,
Most Illustrious Princess, ought to check my
Hand, least in attempting your Highness Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
my Apprehension of the Excellence of
the Subject, and the Danger of miscarrying, should
make my Fancy sink beneath so Glorious a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;
Therefore I will forbear troubling your
Highness any further with the Rashness of my
Zeal; nor dare I be dictated any longer by it,
but will Conclude, in hopes that, when hereafter
I may chance to Record the Memory of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
whose Beauty, Fortune and Merits are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than <hi>Homer</hi> ever feign'd, or <hi>Tasso</hi> Copy'd, I
may have leave to draw her Pattern from your
Highness, and when that is done, the rest of my
Life shall be employ'd in Prayers for your Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Happiness, which be pleas'd to Interpret as
the Duty of,</p>

Spoken by Major Mohun, the First Four Dayes.</head>
            <l>THE Merchant, joyful with the Hopes of Gain,</l>
            <l>Ventures his Life and Fortunes on the Main;</l>
            <l>But the poor Poet oft'ner does Expose</l>
            <l>More than his Life, his Credit, for Applause.</l>
            <l>The Play's his Vessel, and his Venture, Wit:</l>
            <l>Hopes are his <hi>Indies,</hi> Rocks and Seas, the <hi>Pit.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yet our good-natur'd Author bids me Swear</l>
            <l>He'll Court you still, the more his Fate draws near;</l>
            <l>And cannot chuse but blame their Feeble Rage</l>
            <l>That Crow at you, upon their Dunghill Stage;</l>
            <l>A certain sign they merit to be Curst,</l>
            <l>When, to excuse their faults, they cry Whore first.</l>
            <l>So oft in their dull Prologues, 'tis exprest,</l>
            <l>That Critick now's become no more a Ieast;</l>
            <l>Methinks self-intrest in 'em more should Rule;</l>
            <l>There's none so impudent to ask a Dole,</l>

Spoken to the King and Queen at their coming

By Mr. DRYDEN.</head>
            <l>WHEN first the Ark was Landed on the Shore,</l>
            <l>And Heaven had vow'd to curse the Ground no more,</l>
            <l>When Tops of Hills the Longing Patriark saw,</l>
            <l>And the new Scene of Earth began to draw;</l>
            <l>The Dove was sent to View the Waves Decrease,</l>
            <l>And first brought back to Man the Pledge of Peace:</l>
            <l>'Tis needless to apply when those appear</l>
            <l>Who bring the Olive, and who Plant it here.</l>
            <l>We have before our eyes the Royal Dove,</l>
            <l>Still Innnocence is Harbinger to Love,</l>
            <l>The Ark is open'd to dismiss the Train,</l>
            <l>And People with a better Race the Plain.</l>
            <l>Tell me you Powers, why should vain Man pursue,</l>
            <l>With endless Toyl, each object that is new,</l>
            <l>And for the seeming substance leave the true—</l>
            <l>Why should be quit for hopes his certain good,</l>
            <l>And loath the Manna of his dayly food?</l>
            <l>Must <hi>England</hi> still the Scene of Changes be,</l>
            <l>Tost and Tempestuous like our Ambient Sea?</l>

            <l>Without our Blood our Liberties we have,</l>

            <l>All that our Monarch would for us Ordain,</l>

            <head>PROLOGUE,
Intended to be spoken, Written by the Author.</head>
            <l>TIS said, when the Renown'd <hi>Augustus</hi> Reign'd,</l>
            <l>That all the World in Peace and Wealth Remain'd,</l>
            <l>And though the School of Action, War was o're,</l>
            <l>Arms, Arts, and Letter's then increas'd the more.</l>
            <l>All these sprung from our Royal Virgins Bays,</l>
            <l>And flourish'd better than in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Dayes;</l>
            <l>And only in her time at once was seen</l>
            <l>So brave a Soldier, States-man, and a Queen.</l>
            <stage>Essex <hi>and</hi> Burleigh.</stage>
            <l>Her Reign may be compar'd to that above,</l>
            <l>As the best Poet, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s did to <hi>Jove:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For as great <hi>Julius</hi> built the mighty'st Throne,</l>
            <l>And left <hi>Rome</hi>'s first large Empire to his Son,</l>
            <l>Vnder whose weight, till her, we all did groan;</l>
            <l>So her great Father was the first that struck</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Rome</hi>'s Triple Crown; but she threw off the Yoak:</l>
            <l>Straight at her Birth new Light the Heav'ns adorn'd,</l>
            <l>Which more than Fifteen hundred years had mourn'd.—</l>
            <l>But hold, I 'm bid to let you understand,</l>
            <l>That when our Poet took this work in Hand,</l>
            <l>He trembl'd straight like Prophets in a Dream,</l>
            <l>Her awful Genius stood, and threaten'd him;</l>
            <l>Her modest Beauties only he has shown,</l>
            <l>And has her Character so nicely drawn,</l>
            <l>That if her self in purest Robes of Light,</l>
            <l>Shou'd come from Heav'n, and bless us with her sight,</l>
            <l>She wou'd not blush to hear what he has Writ.</l>
            <l>Therefore—</l>
            <l>To all the shining Sex this Play's addrest,</l>
            <l>But more the <hi>Court,</hi> the Plannets of the rest;</l>
            <l>You who on Earth are Man's best, softest Fate,</l>

            </l>
            <l>It sends him you to would, and new Create.</l>
            <l>Strange wayes to Virtue, some may think to prove,</l>
            <l>But yet the best, and surest Path is Love;</l>
            <l>Love like the Ermine, is so nice a Guest,</l>
