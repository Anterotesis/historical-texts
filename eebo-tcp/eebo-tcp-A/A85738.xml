         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the firſt, there was no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, or difference of men; one man was as good as another: But afterwards, ſome excelling others in deſert, were preferred before others in place.
<note place="margin">Greg. lib. 21. Moral. c. 11.</note> Nature, ſaith <hi>Gregorie,</hi> did produce all men alike: but the order of their ments varying, occult diſpenſation did prefer ſome before others. But this diſtinction, which happened from Sin, is rightly ordered by the juſt judgement of God, that, becauſe all men doe not goe the ſame courſe of Life, one man ſhould be governed by another.
<note place="margin">Aug. l. 19. de Civ. Dei c. 15.</note> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, that God would not that man, a rationall creature, made after his owne Image, ſhould domineere over any but Irrationall Creatures; not man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man, but man over beaſts. Hence it was that thoſe firſt juſt men, were conſtituted rather Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114316:3"/>
of Sheepe, than governours of men: that even ſo, God might inſinuate both what the order of the Creatures did require, and what the merit of Sinne had deſerved. If men had continued in their firſt integrity and ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, there had beene no uſe of Emperours, or Commanders: every man would have ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a King unto himſelfe; nor would he have had any other Law-giver, than God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But when this could not be obtained, and the perverſeneſſe of degenerous man-kind grew ſuch, as that breaking the bonds of all Lawes, they left nothing unattempted, which did not tend to the height of impiety, there was a great neceſſity of Magiſtrates; without whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<note place="margin">Cic. de leg. 3.</note> and diligence, a City could not then conſiſt; and by whoſe deſcription and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men into order, the government of each Common-wealth is ſtill continued, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Hence came the command of man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men:
<note place="margin">Cic. ibid.</note> without which, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe, nor City, nor Nation, nor Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor the nature of things, nor the World it ſelfe can ſubſiſt. For to governe, and be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
<note place="margin">Ariſt. l. 1. Pol. c. 3.</note> is not onely (according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) amongſt thoſe things that are neceſſary, but thoſe things that are profitable.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114316:3"/>
a Governour, a City cannot be well ordered; and without a King, a Kingdome muſt needs come to ruine. If you take a King from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or Authority from a King, we ſhall live a more beaſtly life, than irrationall creatures: ſome biting and devouring others; he that is Rich, him that is Poore; he that is ſtrong, him that is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; he that is fierce, him that is milder; ſo farre, and to this purpoſe, the golden-mouthed <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</hi> With whom, is agreeable that of the Scriptures, <hi>In thoſe dayes there was no King in Jſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell:</hi> and what follows? <hi>every one did that which was right in his own eies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tacit. l. 1. hut.</note> Iud. 17.6. So that, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath it, it is better to be under an evil Prince, than under none.
<note place="margin">Soph.</note> The <hi>Tragoedian</hi> tels us, that there is no greater evill than <hi>Anarchie:</hi> it brings all things to confuſion; it ruines Cities; layes waſte Houſes; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows Armies: but the ſubmiſſive and due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of true Subjects, doth preſerve both life and fortunes. An Empire now being conſtituted amongſt men, it muſt needs be that one, or more, muſt have the preheminence: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is called a <hi>Monarchie,</hi> or a Kingdome; the latter an <hi>Optimacie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ariſt 3. Pol. c. 5.</note> or State of the People. A Kingdome then, which is moſt proper to us, is the Command, or Soverainty of one man, for the good of all. I will not dwell long in deſcribing the cauſes of it: I would they were as well obſerved, as they are knowne; or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne, that they might be the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. All power over the Creature, is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in God the Creator: but out of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114316:4"/>
to Mankind, communicated to Man above all others. So that God is the onely Author, and efficient Cauſe, as of Things, ſo of Kings: For however there are divers wayes to attaine to the Princely Scepter; as ſome have mounted the Imperiall Throne by force and armes; others by the command of God, have been deſigned Kings, as <hi>David, Hazael, Jehu,</hi> and others, of which you may reade in the holy Scriptures; others have been elected Princes by the Suffrages of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and others borne in purple, by hereditary right, to a Kingdome: Yet it is moſt certaine, that whether by theſe, or any other wayes, men doe aſcend the Chaire of State, they have their power, whatſoever it is, ſolely from God; and ought to uſe it to the glory of God, and the good of their Subjects.
<note place="margin">Sen. lib. 1. de clem. c. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at firſt did invent a King: which is to be ſeen both in Animals, and in Inanimates: For the Bees, Cranes, and other living creatures, have their Kings or Commanders: So among foure-footed beaſts, the Lyon; and amongſt Birds, the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles doe excell.

            <p>Theſe are ſome of the <hi>Royall Prerogatives,</hi> which have been premiſed in generall and promiſcuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but the Politicians are more exact in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing theſe rights of <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Royaltie,</hi> and they make them of two ſorts: <hi>Greater</hi> and <hi>Leſſer.</hi> The <hi>Greater prerogatives</hi> belonging unto Majeſty are thoſe which doe primarily and more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally appertaine to the chiefe authority of the King of Emperour. And they are, Firſt, <hi>The power of making and abrogating Laws</hi> at pleaſure, as the neceſſity of the Common wealth ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
<note place="margin">Bodin. l. 1. c. 10.</note> For this is, as <hi>Bodinus</hi> hath it, the prime and principall head of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and without this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114316:15"/>
the <hi>Folitique Power</hi> cannot long ſtand.
<note place="margin">L. 7. F. de legib.</note> For it is, as the <hi>Juris-conſults</hi> have determined, the <hi>propriety of Law to command.</hi> But an Emperour, or King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a command, what other thing is he, than as a dreame without ſleepe? But this muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>Nomothetique</hi> or <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power, which doth inſtitute Laws by its own authority, and not by the command of another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is more than manifeſt that the <hi>Decemuiri</hi> amongſt the Romans, who were enforced to ſeek to the people for the confirmation of thoſe Laws which they had made, as <hi>Livie</hi> relates, could not be ſaid to make them by the right of <hi>Majeſtie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, a ſecond <hi>Right of Majeſty</hi> is <hi>extreame provocation;</hi> that is, that Subjects cannot appeale from the Laws that are made by <hi>Imperiall Majeſty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bodin. l. 1. de Rep. c. 8.</note> For it is a moſt certain ſigne of a <hi>limited power,</hi> if an appeale may be made from the Law giver to a Superiour. And hereupon <hi>Bodinus</hi> infers, that the <hi>Dictators</hi> did not ſhine with <hi>Royall Majeſty,</hi> and that they were not the chiefe Magiſtrates, but <hi>Curatours</hi> onely, or Commiſaries, as we call them.

               <note place="margin">Bodin l. 1. c. 10. &amp; Arniſae.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114316:16"/>
untill it comes to the higheſt power, in which it muſt neceſſarily acquieſce and reſt. As for example: In the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire the chiefe tribunall is the <hi>Imperiall Chamber:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Keck. in Syſt. Polit. l. 1. c. 17. p. 303.</note> In <hi>France</hi> and with us in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>High Court of Parliament:</hi> and in other inferiour Principalities, the <hi>Princes chiefe Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third right of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> is the <hi>Creation</hi> of Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Barrons, and other Noble men.
<note place="margin">L. 3. F. de nat. reſti.</note> For it is without doubt, that the King or Emperour is the Fountaine of all Nobility and Dignity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, another <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <hi>Majeſty</hi> is the founding of <hi>Academies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vult. de feud. l. 1. c. 5. n. 7.</note> For this is referred to the eminence &amp; preheminence of Kings &amp; Emperours, &amp; which,

<note place="margin">Bodin. l. 1. de.

That which is more evident, by the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Lawyers: Thoſe rights can neither be paſſed away, nor divided, nor any wayes abaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the chiefe Prince, nor can they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by any diuturnity of time. For which cauſe <hi>Baldus</hi> doth call them <hi>Sacra Sacrorum;</hi> and <hi>Cynus</hi> the <hi>Individualls</hi> of <hi>Majeſty:</hi> But if the chief Prince ſhal once Communicate theſe unto the ſubject, inſtead of a <hi>Servant,</hi> he is like to have a <hi>conſort</hi> of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:

and in the meane while, he loſeth the <hi>Regality</hi> of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> in that he cannot be ſaid to be the chief Prince: becauſe he is chiefe who neither hath a Superiour nor yet Co-partner of his Empire.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Princes when they are publikely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurated,
<note place="margin">Ob.</note> doe religiouſly promiſe that they wil maintain the <hi>rights</hi> of their Anceſtors, &amp; the former <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the Empire, and other things of that nature; therefore may ſome thinke they are tyed by their oath to obſerve them, nor can they with a ſafe conſcience any way relinquiſh them.</p>
            <p>To this it is anſwered,
<note place="margin">Reſol.</note> that Princes do no wayes prejudice themſelves by ſwearing, but that they may as freely adminiſter to the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as if they had not ſworn at al: for they ſweare nothing, but that, to which if they had not ſworne they are obliged.

Now what is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, than that a Prince ſhould be bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and keepe thoſe Laws, which it is neceſſary that they muſt be either Antiquated, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth come to ruine? Although <hi>all change whatſoever</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Proverb</hi>) <hi>is very dangerous,</hi> yer that of <hi>Laws, is moſt pernicious:</hi> And yet it is as certaine on the other ſide, that the change of manners doth efflagitate a change of Laws, and that there is no <hi>Law</hi> ſo honeſt and inviolable, or ſo deare, even by the ſhew of antiquity it ſelfe,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114316:18"/>
but that, neceſſity ſo requiring, it may &amp; ought to receive a change. <hi>Salus Populi, ſuprema lex eſto:</hi> The peoples ſafety is the chiefeſt Law. To conclude, If that Kings and Princes, breaking all bonds of Laws (which yet God forbid they ſhould) doe falſifie their promiſes, and diſreſpect their vowes, making no account of what they have engaged themſelves to by their <hi>Proteſtations;</hi> yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt not riſe up in rebellion againſt them, or ſhake off the yoake of obedience from them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are to have no other than God himſelfe to be their Judge and their avenger.</p>

            </head>
            <p>HAving in the former Chapter ſet forth unto you the <hi>Royalty</hi> of Kings over their Subjects: where I have declared their Originall from God, and their end, next to God, their Subjects good; and that though they ſhould come ſhort of that end for which they were conſtituted and ordeined, yet they ought not to be cut ſhort by the people under them, but are to be reſerved to the judgement of God, next to whom they are ſecond here upon earth, and under whom they have no Superiour, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Laws of men, and themſelves a Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114316:18"/>
their Subjects: I now come to deſcribe unto you the <hi>Loyaltie</hi> of Subjects towards their Kings, and the peoples duty. For, a King and Subjects being relatives; and the formall cauſe of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome conſiſting in that order which is betweene the King and his Subjects; by which he rules, and they ſubmit; he governe, and they be governed; he commands; and they obey; It is very requiſite in theſe miſerably diſtracted times, where moſt men would ſhake off the yoke of obedience from their ſhoulders, and live as they liſt without all order: That, having ſpoken of Kings and their power over their Subjects, I ſhould now ſay ſomwhat of Subjects, and their duty to their Kings.</p>
            <p>And here, that we may the better ſetforth their duty, it will not be amiſſe to expreſſe their nature: for, ſo knowing what they be, we ſhall the ſooner come to know what they muſt doe. Now if wee conſult <hi>Bodinus</hi> about them,
<note place="margin">Bodin de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. pag. 170.</note> he will tell us, that <hi>Subjects are thoſe, who are bound to maintain, and fight for the dignity &amp; ſafety of their Prince as for themſelves: and to have the ſame friends and enemies with their Prince.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Colleg. Polit. Dithmar. diſp. 8.

But then, if any ſhould aske me who are Subjects as well as what are Subjects; I muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain have recourſe to the Politicians; who do give us to underſtand, that by the name of Subjects, we are to take notice of the multitude of men, which

And in this name, we muſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all, and every one, of what ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever they be, that are in that City, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, &amp; Countrey, where a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is the head: For, ſo many as do belong to a Common-wealth, doe appertaine to the one part of it: <hi>viz.</hi> They are referred to be either <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> or <hi>Subjects:</hi> whence it follows, that the name of <hi>Subject</hi> is more general than that of <hi>Citizen,</hi> ſpecifically and properly ſo called; although in writers we finde them to bee promiſcuouſly uſed. For, he that is a partaker with others of publike honour and dignity is properly a <hi>Citizen:</hi> but hee that partakes onely of burthens and taxes, &amp; not as wel of honours and dignity in the Common-wealth, where he reſides &amp; lives, is not a <hi>Citizen,</hi> but a <hi>Subject.</hi> They are termes contrariant, not reciprocall. Every <hi>Citizen,</hi> is a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi> but every <hi>Subject,</hi> is not a <hi>Citizen.</hi> There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo another diſagreeing reſpect, for a <hi>Citizen</hi> is ſo called, in reſpect of his native Countrey or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, where he is borne, or to which he is aſcribed: But he is a <hi>Subject</hi> in reſpect of that Magiſtrate which he obeyes, whereſoever he is.</p>

But what ſpace of time is required to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a houſe or dwelling, the Interpreters of Law doe varie: Becauſe, in this thing the Laws and manners of every particular Common-wealth is to be reſpected. Agreeable to this, is that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Juriſperites, who diſcriminate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by a <hi>naturall,</hi> and a <hi>voluntarie</hi> obligation. He is a Subject, ſay they, by a <hi>naturall obligation,</hi> who is borne under the juriſdiction, and in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of that Magiſtrate, to whom he is ſubject: And he is a Subject by a <hi>voluntary obligation,</hi> who willingly and ſpontaneouſly offers himſelfe to any Magiſtrate, and acknowledgeth him for his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame head, although he be not born within his territories and dominions. To which two ſorts of ſubjects, we may, not without good reaſon, adde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>ſpecies, viz.</hi> ſuch a one, as being vanquiſhed in warre, is made ſubject to him that did ſubdue him. For, when a Prince or Magiſtrate overcomes any in a lawfull War, they are then made ſubject to his juriſdiction and power. But be they ſubjects theſe, or any other wayes, they are bound, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be that are ſubjects, to yeeld obedience to him who is their Prince and Governour. If any ſhould doubt of the truth of this aſſertion, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the contrary doctrine is now broached and publiſhed by our Novel Divines) let him but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114316:20"/>
the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> (unleſſe perchance for the ſame tenet he be held a Malignant) and he will ſatisfie him: <hi>Let every ſoule</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſubmit himſelf unto the higher powers.</hi> They are his expreſſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

As if hee ſhould have ſaid: All, whatſoever they be, that do live in a Common-wealth, muſt ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſupreme Magiſtrate, that is the head of that Common-wealth. So that, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles precept, we have not onely implyed the qualities of their perſons that are ſubjects; but we have alſo expreſſed the nature of their duties: <hi>viz. Subjection</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> We ſhall not need to goe farre then to ſearch after the duty of Subjects to their Prince: the Apoſtle he hath done it to our hands:
<note place="margin">Auguſtan: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ. art. 16.</note> it is <hi>Obedience.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Auguſtane Confeſsion</hi> in the 16. Article doth acknowledge it. The firſt Commandement of the ſecond Table, which (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) is <hi>the firſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement with promiſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 6.2.</note> doth ſet forth this duty by the name of <hi>Honour.</hi> For So we read it in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.12. Deut. 5.16.</note> 
               <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy dayes may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. Exod.</hi> 20.12. Where, by <hi>father,</hi> according to the unanimous conſent of all Divines, we are to underſtand, not onely our <hi>naturall</hi> father, that did beget us; but our <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Father alſo, that doth teach us; and our <hi>Civill</hi> father likewiſe, the King, who is <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> the Father of our Country, that doth protect us. And then, by <hi>honour</hi> which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114316:20"/>
we are commanded to yeeld to this Father, we are to conceive all thoſe duties which are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it. Now the Politicians doe tell us, that this name of <hi>Honour,</hi> doth conſiſt of ſixe ſeverall members, which doe imply as many ſeverall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which every Subject is bound to performe to the Prince his head, <hi>viz. Agnition, Reverence, Love, Obedience, Gratitude,</hi> and <hi>Equity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt member, wherein this honour doth conſiſt, and the firſt duty, which every Subject is to performe unto his Prince, is <hi>Agnition:</hi> that is, an acknowledgement of Gods Ordinance in the office of the Prince. For God will have his owne Ordinance to be acknowledged in the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; and that we doe conceive of him, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God: ſeeing that as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>there is no power but of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ro. 13.1.</note> 
               <hi>and the powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> After which manner, did the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Tekoah</hi> conceive of King <hi>David,</hi> when as ſhe being ſent by <hi>Joab</hi> to intercede for <hi>Abſolom,</hi> that he might returne from his baniſhment into the Kings favour:
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 14.17.</note> 
               <hi>For as an Angel of God,</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>ſo is my Lord the King, to diſcern good and bad.</hi> And a little after,
<note place="margin">ver. 20.</note> 
               <hi>My Lord is wiſe according to the wiſdome of an Angel of God.</hi> And ſo did <hi>Mephiboſbeth</hi> eſteem of him, when as he did compellate him with the ſame title:
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.27.</note> 
               <hi>But my Lord the King, is as an Angel of God.</hi> Which agnition and acknowledgement of Gods ordinance in him, is a notable meanes to ſtir up our obedience to him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond member wherein this honour doth conſiſt, is <hi>Reverence:</hi> when as, Subjects look upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114316:21"/>
their Prince not onely as a man, but as a man of God; and reverence, not ſo much his perſon, as his office.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> For the King is Gods legat, and his Vicar, preſenting his perſon. And therefore Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when he exhorts to the feare of God, he doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex the honour of the King: as if there can be no true feare of God, without due reverence to the King, who preſents Gods perſon. For which cauſe, <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of men,
<note place="margin">Pro. 24.22.</note> &amp; richeſt of Kings, doth joyne the feare of God and the King together: the King, for preſenting Gods perion is called <hi>God,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The third member; wherein this honour doth conſiſt, is <hi>Love.</hi> And it is another duty of Subjects to love their Princes: Not onely for their office,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114316:21"/>
which they, in the name and place of God, do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe; but for the manifold benefits and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which they receive from them, by their happy government:
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.5.</note> Thus was <hi>King David accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the eyes of all the people, whither ſoever he was ſent.</hi> Kings, as you heard, are <hi>Patres patriae,</hi> Fathers of their Country; and therefore Subjects ought to reſpect them with a filiall love, even as children do love their fathers.</p>
            <p>A fourth member, wherein this honour doth conſiſt, is <hi>Obedience:</hi> Subjects muſt willingly, and readily yeeld obedience, to all the juſt and honeſt commandes of their Princes, which do no wayes repugne the lawes of God. They muſt not onely acknowledge, <hi>Reverentiam Subjectionis,</hi> a reverence of Subjection; but they muſt alſo give them <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientians juſsionis,</hi> an obedience to their juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> For, as Saint <hi>Chryſoſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </hi> obſerveth: a people that obeyeth not their Prince; is like to them that have no Prince at all: yea, and in a worſe eſtate: for you cannot call that a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where the King is neglected, and his Laws not obſerved. He ſeemeth to mee to have loſt his Kingdome,
<note place="margin">Ariſt. Polit.</note> ſaith the Philoſopher, who hath loſt his due obedience from his Subjects. And therefore <hi>Subjects muſt obey their Prince, not onely for feare of wrath,</hi> that is, to eſcape puniſhment, if they neglect their duty;
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> 
               <hi>but alſo for conſcience ſake,</hi> as the Apoſtle teacheth, becauſe God commands them.</p>
            <p>The fift member, wherein this Honour doth conſiſt, is <hi>Gratitude.</hi> Subjects are bound, by way of thankfulneſſe, to honour their Princes, if it were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114316:22"/>
for no other reaſon, but becauſe they do dayly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefits of peace, proſperity, and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by them. Which gratitude muſt expreſſe it ſelf by two other virtues, as neceſſary as it ſelf; and without which, it cannot ſubſiſt: and they are theſe:
<note place="margin">Colleg. Polit. Dithmar. diſp.</note> 
               <hi>Verity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice: Verity,</hi> in acknowledging what great bleſſings, favours, and emoluments they receive by them; and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make ſatisfaction, and compenſation for them. And for this cauſe it is, that they pay them Tenths, Subſidies, Cuſtomes, and Tributes: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, not the King onely, but the Kingdome alſo, would be debilitated and go to ruine. In theſe Tributes and Contributions,

<note place="margin">Cic. pro Manl</note> They are, ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of peace, and the ſupporters of war. It is impoſſible,

                  </gap>. 2. p. 78.</note> For, as if food and nouriſhment be denyed to the belly, the whole body muſt of neceſſity languiſh and waſte away by a Conſumption: So, if you with-hold Subſidies and Tributes from the chiefe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, the Common-wealth muſt of neceſſity come to ruine. And therefore wel ſaid <hi>Tacitus,</hi> you ſoone teach the diſſolution of an Empire,
<note place="margin">Tacit. 14. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> if you diminiſh the revenue, by which it ſhould be ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:

            <p>Laſtly, the ſixt member wherein the honour of Subjects towards their Prince conſiſts, is <hi>Equity.</hi> Which is a vertue, whereby every Subject is bound with candour, either to cover the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and errors of his Prince, and to interpret them in the beſt ſenſe; or, by a prudent diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to paſſe them by, and take no notice of them: or, if the reaſon of his place doth ſo require it, by moderate counſels and admonitions to endeavour to reforme them. For, that which is ſpoken unto children by the ſon of <hi>Sirach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 3.10, 11</note> every true ſubject ought to apply it to himſelfe: <hi>Glory not in the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of thy father: for thy fathers diſhonour is no glory unto thee: for the glory of a man is from the honour of his father.</hi> And we cannot but be knowing of <hi>Chams</hi> curſe,
<note place="margin">Gen. 9.25.</note> for laying open, or not covering his fathers nakedneſſe. It is the office and duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of every Subject, according to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive places, not to diſcover, but rather to cover and conceale the naeves, infirmities, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their Princes; and, as opportunity ſhal ſerve, in an humble way, ſeek by wholſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, and moderate counſels, to reclaime them. This was <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine, that great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Reformation, which at this day is ſo much pretended. The office of Subjects, ſaith he, doth require, that they doe declare unto Princes what they know not. For, as Princes may ſinne by not knowing thoſe things which they doe to,
<note place="margin">Luth. Com. in Gen. c. 23. p. 270.</note> be ſins; ſo, Subjects may ſin more in not ſhewing to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114316:23"/>Princes thoſe things which they doe to be ſins. The one ſinnes by ignorance, the other by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. And to this end he alledgeth that paſſage of <hi>Abimelock</hi> King of <hi>Gerar:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 20.</note> who having taken to himſelfe <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had told him ſhe was his ſiſter; and being warned by God in a dreame to reſtore her to him; did lay all the fault upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he had no ſooner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the villanie and wickedneſſe of his Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto him. And thus you ſee wherein the duty of Subjects conſiſts: either in one word of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it: or in one word of <hi>Honour,</hi> which comprehends Acknowledgment, Reverence, Love, Obedience, Gratitude and Equity, as the fift Commandement doth deſire it. So then, to bring all to a head: All, and every Subject, are bound to ſubmit themſelves unto their Princes, in thoſe things which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not being contrary to the laws of God, and the laws of nature.</p>
            <p>It is true, that in the Apoſtles times, there were ſome, who abſurdly interpreting the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as too many now, fanatically given, by an unknown ſpirit; and extending their Chriſtian liberty further then the ſimplicity of the Goſpel would permit them, did maintaine, that it was a moſt unworthy thing, that they, who were freed by the Sonne of God, and governed by the Spirit of God, ſhould be under the power of man.

            <p>Laſtly, the Pontiſicians, though not in the ſame manner, did oppoſe the power of Princes, cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Civill Authority, and maintaining that their Clergie can by no means be puniſhed by a Civill Judge: or compelled to appeare before the Tribunall of a Secular Magiſtrate; but that all their goods, as well Eccleſiaſticall as Civill, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <hi>there is no power</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but of God:</hi> that is, all power is from God onely. For that negative Apoſtolicall Axiome is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent on all ſides to an univerſall affirmative. So <hi>Daniel</hi> telleth <hi>Nebuchadnezzer,</hi>

now his armed hand was ready to ſeize upon his adverſaries throat: But the remembrance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitutions did altogether withſtand theſe intentions: He contradicts not onely his ſervants, but opportunity, egging him on to victory.

            <p>See, how the Fathers doe, with one conſent Vote that we muſt give obedience to Kings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be wicked, in all things that are not unlawfull; That honour, tribute, obedience, and the like, muſt be given to lawfull Princes; and that there is no other remedy againſt their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and injuſtice, but prayers and teares to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. What, doe we think that they were deſtitute of ſtrength, that they could not oppoſe one power with another, or repell one injury with another?

Thus far <hi>Tertullian,</hi> with whom S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is not diſcrepant: you may find his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be regiſtred among the Canons in theſe words: <hi>Julian</hi> was an Infidel and unbeleeving Emperour; was he not likewiſe an Apoſtate, an enemie,
<note place="margin">Aug. in Pſal. 1 2 4. &amp; habetur 11. quaeſt. Can. Imperatores.</note> an Idolater? yet the Chriſtian ſoldiers ſerved under this unbeleeving Emperour. When they came to the cauſe of Chriſt, they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge none but him that is in heaven; when he would have them to worſhip Idols, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, then they did prefer God before him: but when he ſaid unto them, Lead forth the Armie, &amp; go againſt ſuch a Nation, they did preſently obey him. They did diſtinguiſh the Lord eternall from a Temporall Lord; and yet they were ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Temporall Lord, for their eternall Lords ſake.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Jovianus</hi> after the death of the fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Julian</hi> was elected by his armie to be their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114316:28"/>

               <hi>I cannot, ſeeing I am a Chriſtian, command ſuch men, nor take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon me, of</hi> Julians <hi>Armie, which he hath imbued with ſuch venemous precepts, and pernicious diſcipline.</hi> Which, and words of the like nature, when the Souldiers had heard, they began to ſhout with one acclamation, and ſay: <hi>O Emperour, let not your minde be troubled with ſuch doubtings, nor yet wave the command of us, as if we were prophane and wicked, for you ſhall finde both Chriſtians of us, and men diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd in piety to doe you ſervice.</hi> From which reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places, it may appeare that it was no ſuch difficult matter for the Chriſtians in the Primitve times to have coërced their Emperours, by whom they were miſerably afflicted, and moſt cruelly uſed, if it had beene lawfull for Subjects to riſe up againſt their Princes. But if thoſe forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fathers, endued with no leſſe ſcience then conſcience, and furniſhed with as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as zeale, had thought it lawfull, either for the <hi>Pope,</hi> or the <hi>People,</hi> or any other men to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Princes, as they thought fit; without all queſtion, they would never have ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the whole Church of God, to bee ſo cruelly oppreſſed by thoſe wicked Emperours. But as they did moſt freely reprehend their vices, ſo they would at leaſt have admoniſhed them of their office, if they had beene wanting to it. But when they knew that Kings (as have beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, not onely touched, but oftentimes urged) have onely God to be their judge and their aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114316:29"/>
hence it is, that they did only flee to him, and piouſly and happily implore his aid.</p>
            <p>Theſe things (ſaith <hi>Nazianzen</hi>) did <hi>Julian</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate and deliberate,

The like may be ſaid of divers other wicked Princes, who have either beene taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the ſingular providence of God, or at length reduced to a better minde: for God who is the Father and Judge of all alike, doth oftentimes moſt juſtly ſend ungodly Princes unto a people for the puniſhment of their ſins: although, they min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nothing leſſe, than the juſtice or purpoſe of Gods wil doe moſt unjuſtly. <hi>Shall there be any evill in the City</hi> (ſaith God by the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi>)
<note place="margin">Amos 3.6.</note> which the Lord hath not done? But no ſooner doe Subjects repent them of their ſins, and depart from their evil courſes,

               <hi>Vengeance is mine</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I wil repay it.</hi> This is the onely fort and ſure defence againſt all injuries of wicked Kings: they are the weapons that are to be taken up againſt ungodly Princes:

               <note place="margin">Ambroſ. l. 2.

            <p>In the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> we reade, that the <hi>Man that would doe preſumptuouſly, and would not hearken to the Prieſt (that ſtood to Miniſter before the Lord, or unto the Judge,</hi> even that man was to be put to death.

            <p>And as for thoſe that doe calumniate and derogate from the Power, &amp;c. of Princes here, by their ſeditious words, and ſcandalous writings, although perhaps they may eſcape the hands of men; yet they ſhall never avoid the judgements of God, from whoſe all-ſeeing eye of Providence nothing can bee hid, againſt whoſe omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Power nothing can reſiſt, and by whoſe moſt juſt judgements no wickedneſſe can goe unpuniſhed. No leſſe wittily then pithily St. <hi>Ang.</hi> For whereas the doctrine of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114316:31"/>
the Apoſtle doth make mention of theſe earthly powers,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. de Jmper. ſee.</note> he doth inſinuate into our apprehenſions even the parts of the heavenly judgement.

               <note place="margin">Ro. 13.3.</note> which is as much to ſay. If thou wilt not fear the judgement to come, then eſchew evill and doe good whileſt thou art here. Therfore we ought to take heed, &amp; performe the firſt forme of this Conſtitution, which wants the lawes of this life, that we may exclude &amp; keep from us that fore-judgement of eternall death in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life; becauſe thoſe whom this temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not take hold of here; there that eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment wil follow with inſufferable torment hereafter.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other examples of the judgements of God upon rebellious, gainſaying and diſobedient Perſons, we have that dreadfull and horrible example of <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> in the holy Scriptures, which the Spirit of God ſets downe as a warning to us, that we fall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like contradiction,
