         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But the considerable reason is, as I conceive it, from the use he was constrained to make of the twigges of Broome when he came to be scourged at Jerusalem, the place necessitating the use of them to that purpose, being (as <hi>Strabo</hi> relates) a stony, sandy, and barren soyle, only<note place="margin">Strabo, Lib. 16.</note> naturall and gratefull to the <hi>genest,</hi> as the watry and moist to the Birch, Willow and Withy, of which there could be none there, for that reason.

            <p>For the continuance of the Name, some (who pretend to see further and better in the darke then others as cleare sighted) would have it taken of late time, and not used by the Kings and Princes of England, of the Angeume race.

            <p>And come to the other matters of his private story. And first for his Birth and native place, which was the Castle of Fotheringay, or as some write, the Castle of Birkhamsteed, both Castles and Honours of the Duke his Father, about the yeare of our Lord 1450, which I discover by the calculation of the Birth, Raigne, and death of King <hi>Edward</hi> his brother, who was borne about 1441, or 1442. and raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two and twenty yeares, dyed at the age of one and forty, <hi>Anno</hi> 1483. The Dutchesse of Yorke their Mother had five children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, so that <hi>Richard</hi> could not be lesse then seven or eight yeares younger then King <hi>Edward,</hi> and he survived him not fully three yeares.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Richard Plantagenet,</hi> and the other children of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of Yorke, were brought up in York-shire, and Northampton-shire, but lived for the most part in the Castle of Midelham in York-shire, untill the Duke their Father, and his Sonne <hi>Edmund Plantagenet</hi> Earle of Rutland were slaine in the battell of Wakefield, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40371:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1641, upon which the Dutchesse of Yorke their Mother (having cause to feare the faction of Lancaster, which was now growne very exulting and strong, and of a mortall enmity to the House af Yorke) secretly conveyed her two younger sonnes, <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Richard Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenet</hi> (who was then about some ten yeares old) into the Low-Countries, to their Aunt the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Dutchesse of Burgundy, Wife of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundy and Brabant, and Earle of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They continued at Utrich, the chiefe City then in Holland, where they had Princely and liberall education, untill <hi>Edward</hi> Earle of March their eldest Brother had revenged his Fathers death, and taken the Kingdome and Crowne (as his right) from <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, when he called home his two Brothers, and enters them into the practise of Armes, to season their forwardnesse and honour of Knighthood which he had bestowed upon them; and soone after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vests <hi>George</hi> into the Dutchy of Clarence, and Earledome of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, which Earledome he the rather bestowed upon him, to darken the young Earle of Richmond, <hi>Henry Teudor.

            <p>And after the great Earle of Warwicke and Salisbury, <hi>Richard de Neville,</hi> was reconciled to the Kings favour, <hi>George</hi> Duke of Clarence was married to the Lady <hi>Isabell,</hi> or <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the elder Daughter of that Earle, and <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of Glocester to the Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> which Ladies by their Mother the Lady <hi>Anne de Beauchamp,</hi> Daughter and heire of Sir <hi>Richard de Beauchamp,</hi> Earle of Warwicke, were heires of that Earledome. But <hi>Anne,</hi> although the younger sister, was the better woman, having been a little before married to <hi>Edward Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genet,</hi> Prince of Wales, and Duke of Cornwall, only Sonne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, and was now his Princesse and Dowager, by whom Duke <hi>Richard</hi> had a sonne called <hi>Edward,</hi> created Prince of Wales when his Father came to the Crowne.</p>

and the subtill Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> who was extreamly his Enemy, and the Chiefe Instrument that secretly mov'd against him.

The Protector having also certaine intelligence of some particular Designes, disposed himselfe in his actions more closely, and knew what Friends and Confederates had engaged themselves to <hi>Richmond,</hi> who yet kept a face of love and fidelitie towards him, as did the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Countesse of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who appeared at this instant an earnest Sutor to reconcile her Sonne into favour; and that the King would bee pleased, to bestow on him any of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth his Daughters. But this took not the vigilancy of his eye from him and his partie, the cause being of greater danger and apprehension now, then in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time; for the Earle had drawne unto him many of the English Nobilitie and Gentry; and some Forraigne Princes had in favour to him promised their aydes. But in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> his Title and he, was so little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by his blood of Lancaster, that the better judging-sort of the English Nobilitie and Gentry, King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh of France, <hi>Francis</hi> the second Duke of Brittaine, and other Forraigne Princes looked very slightly upon it. And yet, as <hi>Iohn Harding</hi> observed, the King might be jealous of him, being given out for an Heire of the House of Lancaster, and Nephew to <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt: With this he considered, that some Forraigne Princes stood not well-affected to him; or that some at home, envying his House and Posteritie, would catch at any sparke to trouble his peace, and kindle a Sedition; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had good reason to thinke, that as his libertie might make these beginnings more popular, so their ends more dangerous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull

            <p>The two Earles being informed of his approaches and strength, distrusting their owne, fled by night, and posted to the Port of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, where they kept close untill a fit opportunitie, offered them transportation for France, intending to see the Court there, where<note place="margin">This slight of theirs was in <hi>Anno</hi> 11. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>Iohn Stow.</hi>

            <p>Nor was this Author much mistaken, for the King would have accorded to any reasonable thing to purchase the Earle into his hands, and it was no little perplexity to him when he heard of their flight, but was the better calmed when he understood where they were, the Duke of Brittaine being his friend and Allie, in whom he supposed so neare an interest (set off by some other conditions) that he saw a faire encouragement to demand and gaine them both; whereas had they falne into France, he must have expected the greatest disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage<note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> treateth for the delivery of Richmond.</note> could have been contrived out of such an occasion.

But that the King might beleeve he was forward to come as near his desires, as in honour could be, he engaged himselfe to keep so carefull and vigilant a watch upon them, that they should have no more power to endanger him, then if they were in strict Prison. This being returned, though not agreable to the Kings hope and wishes, yet bearing such a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Honour and Wisdome, he remained satisfied; and so it paused for the space of eight yeares, (as I conjecture) for the King made this demand in the twelfth yeare of his Raigne 1472, all which time he was very intent to preserve the League with good Summes of Mony, and costly Presents. In the twentieth of his Raigne 1480, he received intelligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Earle of Richmond had stird up fresh Embers, and new friends in the French Court to blow them, and that the French King had dealt by solicitation of the Earle of Pembrook, and others privately, to get the Earl of Richmond, and offered great Sums<note place="margin">Hist: de Brit.</note> to the Duke of Brittaine.

The Bishop (after he had prepared him by the earnest of a very rich present) tenders the Summe of his Employment, not forgetting what he was now to Act, and what to promise on the Kings part.

The Duke well mollified and perswades, delivered the Earle by a strong Guard to the Bishop at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40371:13"/>
St. Maloes Port: a change of much passion and amazement to him, whose sufferings tooke hold upon the affable disposition of the Noble <hi>Peir de Landois</hi> Treasurer to the Duke, who had the Earle in Charge and Conduct, to St. Malo. He urges the cause from him of his so altered and present condition, with Protestation of all the aide he could: The Earle thus fairely and happily provoked (and perceiving the sparkles of his sorrow had hapt into a tender bosome) freely expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe, and with such an overcomming Countenance, of teares and sighes, framed his own Story, and prest <hi>Landois,</hi> that it so wrought upon his temper, he perswaded the Earle to put on clearer hopes, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures him there should some meanes be found to shift the Tempest; thereupon writes a sad Relation to the Duke, to move his compassion and favour, and knowing the Baron <hi>Chandais,</hi> (a great man in credit with him) well affected to the Earle by a long and reciprocall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he repaired to his house neare Saint Malo, and prevailed with him to use his power with the Duke, for returning the Earle; who posted to <hi>Vanes,</hi> where the Court was then, and tooke the Duke at such an advantage, by suggesting his credulity abused, and cunningly drawne into this contract by the King, that there was a Post dispatcht to stay the Earle. In that interim, <hi>Landois</hi> had not been Idle, to find a way to let the Earle escape into the Abbey Church of St. Malo, where he claimed the benefit of the holy Asyle, which was easily contrived, by corrupting his Keepers. But the Duke to stand cleare of the Kings suspition, sent over <hi>Maurice Brumell</hi> to satisfie him, that the Earle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promise was sent to Saint Malo, there delivered to his servants deputed, whose negligence let him escape; and that he had demanded him of the Covent, who denyed to render him without security &amp; caution; &amp; that he should be continued a prisonerin <hi>Vanes,</hi> with as much courtesie as formerly. Now being it was falne into those strict and peremptory termes, and within the contumacie of such lawlesse persons, where he could not use power, he yet faithfully protested no suite from the French King, or any other, should draw him from his former promise: All which, he religiously performed, whilst King <hi>Edward</hi> lived, the space of twelve yeares (after <hi>Phillip de Comines</hi>) in which circle of time, it may with admiration be observed, through what changes and interchanges of hazards, dangers, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, he was preserved.

leave in the behalfe of all, to desire your Grace will be pleased, in your noble and gracious zeale to the good of this Realme, to cast your eyes upon the growing distresses and decay of our Estate, and to set your happy hand to the redresse thereof; for which, we can conceive no abler remedy, then by your undertaking the Crowne and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we doubt not shall accrew to the laud of God,, the profit of this Land, and your Graces happinesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This speech of the Duke is recorded by Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> and other Chronicles and Historians, to which the Protector gave this reply:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY most noble Lords, and my most loving friends, and deare<note place="margin">The Answer of the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector to the 3 Estates.</note> Country-men, Albeit I must confesse, your request most respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and favourable, and the points and necessities alledged and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, true and certaine; yet for the entire love and reverend respect I owe to my Brother deceased, and to his Children, my Princely Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, you must give me leave, more to regard mine honour and fame in other Realmes; for where the truth and certaine proceedings herein are not knowne, it may be thought an ambition in me to seeke what you voluntarily proffer, which would charge so deep a reproach and staine upon my honour and sincerity, that I would not beare for the worlds Diademe, Besides, you must not thinke me ignorant (for I have well observed it) there is more difficulty in the Government of a Kingdome, then pleasure; especially to that Prince, who would use his Authority and Office as he ought. I must therefore desire, that this (and my unfained Protestations) may assure you, the Crowne was never my ayme, nor suits my desire with yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this; yet I shall thinke my selfe much beholding unto you all, in this Election of me, and that hearty love I find you beare me, and here protest, that for your sakes it shall be all one, whether I be your King or no; for I will serve my Nephew faithfully and carefully, with my best counsels and endeavours, to defend and preserve him and this Kingdome; nor shall there want readinesse in me, to attempt the recovery of that hereditary right in France, which belongs to the Kings of England, though of late negligently and unhappily lost. There the Protector became silent, and thought it not safe in his discretion, or policy, to open all the disgusts he had of the Soveraignty, for that would have been matter of Exprobation of the Barons, and toucht too neare the quicke, though he had well observed, by sundry experiences of the leading times, and moderne too, the inconstant ebbing and flowing of their dispositions, how variable and apt they were, to take up any occasion of change pursuing their Kings (if once stirr'd) so impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably, that many times they never left without death or deposing. Examples he had in the Raignes of King <hi>Edward</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth; not long before that in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and his Grandfather <hi>Edward</hi> the second; more anciently the extreame
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40371:15"/>
troubles and distresse of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, all by the Barons, being dreadfull warnings and insolent monuments of their haughtinesse and Levitie; and this was <hi>Altamente repostum</hi> with the wise Prince.</p>
            <p>But the Duke of Buckingham, thinking the Protector set too slight a consideration upon so great a Concernment, and the affection tender'd by himselfe and the Nobilitie (and over hearing something, he privately spake to the Lord Maior and Recorder, tending to his mislike) for an Epilogue or close to his former Oration, he thus freely addes.</p>
            <p>SIR, I must now, by the Priviledge of this Imployment, and in<note place="margin">The bold and round conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the D. of Buck.</note> the behalfe of those and my Countrey, adde so much freedome unto my dutie, as to tell your Grace, It is immoveably resolved by the Barons and people, that the Children of King <hi>Edward</hi> shall not Reigne over them. Your Grace hath heard some causes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor need I intimate, how these Estates have entred and proceeded so offensively to other men, and so dangerously to themselves, as is now too late to recall or retire. And therefore, they have fixt this Election upon you, whom they thinke mostable and carefull for their safetie. But, if neither the generall good, the earnest Petitions of the Nobility and Commonalty, can move you, wee most humbly desire your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and leave to Elect some other that may be worthy of the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Charge; in which, (wee hope) wee shall not incurre your displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, considering the desperate necessitie of our welfare and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, urges it. And this is our last Suit and Petition to your Grace.</p>
            <p>The Protector toucht by this round and braving farewell, which made him very sensible: For (as Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> disertly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth) the Protector was so much moved with these words, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of likelyhood he would never have inclined to their Suit: And saith, That when he saw there was no remedy, but he must either at that instant take the Crowne, or both he and his heires irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly let it passe to another; paradventure, one that might prove an Enemy to him and his, especially if <hi>Richmont</hi> stept in; betwixt whom, and this Prince, the hatred was equally extreame: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it behoved the Protector to Collect himselfe; and fixing his Consideration upon the effect of that necessitie they last urged, gave this Reply:</p>
            <p>MY most Noble good Lords, and most loving and faithfull friends,<note place="margin">The Protectors Reply to the Dukes last Suit.</note> the better sense of your loves and most eminent inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies insinuated by your Noble Speaker, hath made me more serious to apprehend the benefit of your proffer and Election. And I must confesse, in the meditation thereof, I find an alteration in my selfe, not without some distraction, when I consider all the Realme, so bent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40371:15"/>
against the Sonnes of King <hi>Edward.</hi> And therefore being certaine, there is no man to whom the Crowne by just Title can be so due as to our selfe, the rightfull Sonne and Heire of our most deare and Princely Father, <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of Yorke; to which Title of blood and nature, your favours have joyned this of Election, wherein wee hold our selfe to be most strong and safe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And having the lawfull power of both, why should I endure my professed Enemy to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In which interim, came the Duke of Norfolke, Marshall of England, mounted upon a brave Horse, trapped with Cloth of Gold downe to the ground, to submove the presse of people and void the Hall.

            <p>Behind the Barons of the Kingdome sate the Barons of the Ports; there were other Tables for persons of qualitie.

Lastly came the Maior of London with the Sheriffs, with a Voyder, serving the King and Queene with sweet Wines, who had each of them a covered Cup of Gold for reward: By which time, the day began to give way to the night, the King and Queene departing to their Lodgings.</p>

            <p>All things thus in a happy presage and good order, the King with the Queene departed from London, and makes Windsor the first gift in his Progresse for some few dayes: From thence to his Mannor of Woodstock, then to the Universitie of Oxford, where the Muses Crown'd their browes with fragrant Wreathes for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. Next he visited the circular Citie of Glocester, and gave the Citizens, (for the love and loyaltie they exprest, in holding the Castle and Towne so constantly against Queene <hi>Margaret</hi> and the forces of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, for him and his Brother the King) large Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Immunities.</p>
            <p>And here the Duke of Buckingham takes his leave for Brecknock, constantly disposed and affected in all outward appearance.

But the Duke of Buckingham pretended Title to that Earledome by his said Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Anne,</hi> who was one of the Daughters and Heires of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Lady <hi>Elianor</hi> (Wife of <hi>Thomas de Woodstock</hi> Duke of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester) and the Wife of <hi>Edmond Stafford</hi> Earle of Stafford, and Grand-father to this <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Buckingham, who the rather presumed to make this Claime, because the Issue of the other Sister <hi>Mary,</hi> being extinct, he tooke himselfe also to be her Heire.</p>
            <p>But King <hi>Richard</hi> relishing something in this, neare the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inclination of Bullingbrooke, answered, That the Earledome of Hereford was of the inheritance of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so King of England (though by tort and usurpation) and will you my Lord of Buckingham Claime to be Heire of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth? You may then also happily Assume his spirits, and lay Claime to the Crowne by the same Titles.</p>
            <p>This was as bitter as short, and doubly ill taken: First, because it came with a Repulse: Next, because it seemed to proceed from a suspition, and as a tax of his Loyaltie, and begets another pretence of exception in the Dukes bosome, which he called a breach of promise in the King, for not joyning the Prince his Sonne in Marriage with the Lady <hi>Anne Stafford</hi> his Daughter; but all those Colours were but to give complexion to the face of his defection, the true cause was well devined and found out by the King, his Ambition and aime to be Soveraigne, rays'd by an overweening of that Royall Blood he supposed to be in his descent from the said <hi>Thomas de Woodstock,</hi> &amp;c. Sonne of a King; and yet he was not resolutely determined to make his Claime to the Crowne this way, nor to attempt the Kingdome by Armes, untill those embers which (as it were) lay but luke-warme in his thoughts, were quickned and revived by the animation of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Morton</hi> Bishop of Ely then a Privie Counsellour though he stood in some umbrage and disgrace in the Court with the King, for his practises against him, and was at this time in the custody of the Duke of Buckingham as a Prisoner; more expressely, for that being a Privie Counsellour, he had given secret advertisement to the Earle of Richmond of what passed in the secret Councells of the King; To this advantage, he applyes that which he had wittily drawne from the Dukes discontent and passionate discourses at times passed. By which, perceiving the glance of his Ambition, and that deriv'd from the great opinion of his Royall Blood, he pregnantly tickles and feeds that humour, untill he had soothed him past his owne strength or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrement; for his secret drift was, to apt and prepare the Duke to a Rebellion at any hand, though not to set his owne Title on foot, yet layes open the advantage of the present times to it, proposing flat usurpation and tyranny against the King Regnant, and the strong like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood of his Deposing. This lifts the Duke something higher in his

But comming to a pause, (and perceiving <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was the man they had aimed at for this great blow (who had conditioned by Oath to marry the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (for the Countesse of Richmond, had by the meanes of Doctor <hi>Lewis,</hi> conciliated the<note place="margin">

To come to it therefore more certainly, we must take notice of the first preparation by the Earle of Richmond, who was resolved to advance his claime that way, and unbosomes himselfe to the Duke of Brittaine, his possibility and advantage by friends, if he could raise but sufficient strength to set him safely in England. The Duke gives him all good wishes to his undertaking, but opposes (against all Arguments of drawing him in) first, his Amity and League with England, which in honour and justice he was not to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: Then his wants by the long Civill and cruell Warres, with his Barons, that had so exhausted his Coffers, as durst he dispense with

            <p>But, by the favour of this Brittish Writer, the Earle staid many daies at Saint Malo, to receive and send intelligence, and made it the beginning of October 1484, before he came to Saint Poole in Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, where he lay some time at Anchor, to send his Boates a shore as Explorers or Spies, for discovery of the Coasts, where the Kings Armie, or his friends lay, who returned without any particular satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but that there was many Armed men about the Country. The Earle (who in all things was circumspect, and cautiously rime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) resolved immediately to loose from thence; but the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, a terrible tempest constrained them with all hast to weigh Anchor, and make into the Maine, the Storme and darkenesse of the night severing and dispersing their Ships, some to the Coasts of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40371:25"/>
but the Earle himselfe to the Coasts of Normandy. And this was the successe of his first invasion, which, though it bore an inauspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate face, it proved of a friendly event: For had he landed about Poole, or but stayed till the Kings Ships had come in, that lay waiting not far off, he had been a lost man every way, the King being not only active to meet their contrivements, but had some advantage upon them, by the close intelligence of a friend, and knew that the Forces of the Duke of Buckingham, with the Earle of Devon, and others, were to meet neare Gloucester, and march in their full and united strength, towards the sea-Coasts of Dorset, there to receive the Earle: But the King encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with the Duke of Buckinghams Army, beate him, and cut off his head, before any of the rest could come at him daily putting the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bands of these West Countries in a ready posture for guard of their Coasts; and that if the Earle of Richmond, or any of his French Forces came a shore, they were to be entertained courteously by them pretending themselves of the Duke of Buckinghams Army, who had routed the Kings Party, and were sent thither to receive and conduct the Earle with his men to London. This was the projected end: But it is of remarkeable note, to look into the various paths of this Earles fortune, and how they brought him to his journies end, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared most doubtfull and threatning, not only gave him advantage by the good successe of his Enterprises, but made the most adverse accidents serve as prosperous unto them; for was it not happy the storme at Poole drove him from the Coasts of England, and no lesse fortunate, that the Duke of Buckingham was defeated, whereas, had the Duke atcheived that day, the Earle of Richmond not being there, (who was to be present in person, and Generall of the field) we may with reason conjecture his Emulation and Policy, would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated the honour and fortune of the Conquest to his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Title: such Spirits like the Sea, where they intrude or win, making their advantage their right, and not easily surrender, so much is the engagements of Ambition, too strong for all ties of faith and right.</p>
            <p>The example is observable in the Earle of Richmond himselfe; who although he knew the Children of the Duke of Clarence and others, had better right to the Crowne, yet once possest, would not resigne, no not to his owne Sonne, whilst he could hold it; nor did he want his Presidents, as all men know, who know any thing. And to take all Relations in our way, that may be levell with our Story; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this and his second Invasion, some other passages offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as an interim, and not impertinent to supply the Readers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Yet the King, being a man of an equall moderation to his courage, puts it into the Scale of his other worldly encounters, and as it was said of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that he soone passed the death of his only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Iulia</hi> (most pretious in his affection) <hi>Et tam facile dolorem hunc,</hi>

            <p>And as the Bastards of the Kings of England had other names, so they tooke differenced Armes; or elsewere permitted to beare their mothers (if of any Family.)

            <p>But the Armes of the ancient Earles of Aniow were a Scarboucle,<note place="margin">Scarboucle, falsly called Carbuncle.</note> (that is, a Golden Bucle of a military Scarffe or Belt, set with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones) not a Carbuncle or more precious Ruby, for the terme is erroneous and absurd, if considered: The Princes of Aniow bare this Scarboucle in a shield party <hi>per</hi> Chiefe, Argent and Gueules; and the Heires of this <hi>Hamelin</hi> (who tooke the Sir-name of <hi>Warren</hi>) bare also the Armes of the house of <hi>Warren</hi> in their Shields and Caparisons, but bare the Scarboucle of Aniow for their Crest, as they were descended out of that House, as I have seene upon a Seal of <hi>Ioannes de Warrena</hi> Earl of Surrey, at a Charter, dated 20. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>An.

As the Doctors of Sorbone, and some of the best Canonists hold, who peremprorily affirme, That the Pope cannot make Bastards capable to inherit the Hereditary Lands of their Father; neither can give them power to Constitute Successours or Heires, or hold Offices, Dignities, or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,

And that the King for the more authority therof, crav'd the allowance and favourable assent of the Barons in Parliament, which was granted: The Charter runnes thus.

            <p>And thus the King received of the Pope the two Titles, <hi>De Domo Lancastriae,</hi> and <hi>De Iure Belli,</hi> without any seeking or solicitation (as wee are led to credit) for there appeareth not any expresse suit or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the King to that purpose, though by circumstances and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie it was preferred under hand, for the other things were but of slight request and no necessitie, nor obnoxious to any danger; when those two Titles were the present markes, his aime was strongly and mainly directed to. Though I must confesse, after a while, he was a lightly satisfied in these (notwithstanding the Popes thunder and lightning, added to them,) as in the Titles of Yorke and Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, which he discovered, and not obscurely, when he moved the Estates in his first Parliament, to grant an Estate Hereditary and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd of the Crowne and Kingdome, with all the Appurtenances, to the Heires of his body: beyond this he could not require much, nor they give, which was unanimously condiscended unto, as a gift of a new Title confirmed by their Act; the Copy whereof I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed (where I come to rehearse the Titles of our Soveraigne Lord the King that now is.) Nor is the Devination of this peece so darke, but that the cause may be guessed at, why he held himselfe not safe in the Titles of Yorke and Lanacster, of Beaufort and Somerset alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy toucht at, but may fall more seasonably elsewhere into our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, without confounding it with Historologies, and presenting matters out of their time and place; my purpose onely being, to take so much light from the Story of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh as shall but properly conduce to the true shadowing and proportioning of King <hi>Richards,</hi> being necessarily inforced to inculcate such matters as may seeme of no present conclusion; yet loosing their observation, wee shall want the knowledge of many things much pertinent to the credit and honour of King <hi>Richard</hi> and his Actions: To which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order and Affaires of time, I am now to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>And here, upon our accompt, wee shall find it neare upon tenne months since the Duke of Buckingham was suppressed, and the Earl<note place="margin">The second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of the E. of Rich.</note> of Richmond driven from Poole with the storme, who was now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine very busie raysing fresh preparations in France, and King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> upon the intelligence, as stickling to Levy Souldiers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce all his Havens and Frontier places.

himself and company: From thence he intended to Roan, which being so neare Paris, ingaged him thither to the King, being (as <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> saith, followed in a very honourable Port by 500 English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) In his stay there (to shew us how much interest a provident and active spirit hath in fortune) he so heightned and sweetned his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to the Court, as conciliated the favour and respect of the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and Noblest Persons to him. But most happily, the faire opinion and esteeme of the Princely Lady <hi>Anne de France,</hi> eldest Sister to King <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, who had such an influence upon him in his minoritie, that she out-pitched <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of Orleance, chiefe Prince of the Blood.

For <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> saith, they were <hi>trois mille</hi>

               <hi>hommes les plus meschants que lux peut trouver,</hi> no better then Rogues and Trewans, men of base qualitie and as low courage. Whilst these were Levying, the Earle (thriftie of all opportunities, and as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to adde what advantage of time and ayde he could) visits the Duke of Brittaine to the same purpose. The Duke propounds it to his Councell, which <hi>Peter Landois,</hi> his Treasurer and chiefe Counsellour objects against, with this reason, That if the Enterpize succeeded well, yet the event must fall out unhappily and ill to him, the Earle having now interested himself to the favour and assistance of <hi>Charles</hi> King of France: And this would be the first linke of so strong an ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Earle and his Confederacy must be lost to Brittaine when he came to be King, being respectively tyed to lend the King of France ayde against them, if any cause should happen, which the King of France had a prepared stomack for, and had not beene nice to seeke any provocation that might countenance a Quarrell against the Dutchy of Brittaine, which was beyond his spanne, so long as they continued in League with England; that being untwisted, and France and England Contracted, how easie was it for the French to envade and swallow up both him and his Dukedome. To make the present advantage (therefore) as profitable, as safe, his advice was to stay the Earle; the Duke knowing his Coffers at that time very lanke, and that the King of England would offer well for him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Counsell, and resolved to be led by <hi>Landois</hi> (whose respects (notwithstanding) were very affectionate to the Earle) But whether by the secret caution of some friends, or suggested to him by his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>genius,</hi> Sure it is by some unknowne meanes he had knowledge of it; and yet this was determined but at night, and designed for the morning; But before midnight, or the knowledge of their flight, he and twelve Gentlemen his followers, had left Vannes, and recovered

Aniow (under the French Kings protection) from thence to the French Court againe, the King being still very pliable and constant to his promise concerning those French forces under his owne charge. The next thing he works at, is how to enlarge the Earl of Oxford out of the Castle of Hammes, committed thither by <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth (and in this he uses, or rather followed indeed) the contrivement of Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> who held good quarter with the Earle of Oxford, and by his frequent visits had a familiar and easie doore open'd, which the Earl readily tooke the opportunitie of, least it might be shut againe by some miscarriage, for Richmond thought or found the constitution of his Designe not a little strengthned by the Earle of Oxfords co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By which time, all preparations were in readinesse; and whilst they make this stay in the French Court, the Earle of Richmond receives a faire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse and protestation from the Duke of Brittaine, with offer of Auxiliary Forces: This supply came very acceptably, and however he resented the Dukes late purpose upon him, his wisedome told him, he must now convert his anger into thanks, which he returns with a reciprocall Protestation and Order, to send the Troopes to Harflew where his Shipping lay, and was the Rendezvous for his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>In the end of July 1485. he tooke leave of the King and his most Noble Cousin Madam <hi>de Beaujen,</hi> departing for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But by the way he made some stay at Roven, and had newes which much distemper'd him, That the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was forthwith to be married to King <hi>Richard,</hi> this quickned his hast for England, presuming, his landing would forbid the Banes, otherwise he might sit downe with folded hands, for upon this marriage insisted the maine hope and consequence of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; without her, all his great praetexts would faint, yet seemed to heare it, as a thing that could not concerne him so much, having so present and provident a wit, that in any chance he wanted not Councell and determination in himselfe for all Fortunes; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly resolving, to apply his suit to her Sister the Lady <hi>Cecily:</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40371:33"/>
but ere he could perfectly fashion these intents, they were also coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchecked, by the next packet, which assured him the Lady <hi>Cecily</hi> was lately married: neither did that (after some Collection) seeme much to discompose him, but quickely, varying his disposition to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he would now fixe himselfe upon some choice in Brittaine, Amongst his nobler friends (for the most part Welsh-men) and treates about a Daughter of Sir <hi>William Herberts,</hi> a Gentleman of a Noble Allyance and principall power in the South part of Wales: who had married the Eldest Daughter not long before to the Earle of Northumberland, to whom the Earle of Pembrooke (by a new created friendship betwixt them) imbosomes the whole designe, and presses his Comprobation in it; for by this meanes it was presumed, the greatest part of Wales would fall under their Command: which had been no small addition to a Banished mans fortune. Whilst those things were in their mould, Doctor <hi>Morton</hi> gave him such assurance (by Letters) of the Countries readinesse to receive him, that it was thought best to take the advantage of landing there, and in the Month of July, they loose from Harfleu, and safely arived at Milford Haven in Pembrookeshire, his native Country: after some refreshing, he Marches to a Town called Haverford West, and was entring amongst his Brittish kindred, who welcomed him as a Prince, descended from their ancient Princes of Wales, (the Country generally very Noble and loving to their friends); whilst he continued amongst them, Sir <hi>Rice ap Thomas,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Herbert,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Savage,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> (who drew his young Nephew the Earle of Salop into this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him) and divers others of all qualities, brought, or sent their Forces; his Army thus strong and united, he passes the Severne, and Marches to Lichfield, purposing to hold on to London, if the King had not interposed it, who though he lay at Nottingham when the Earle landed, and while he marched through Wales, had constant Spies upon him. But as no Policie, or Law can secure their faith, that thinke they may dispense with it, so all Benefits are too narrow, where Ambition and Ingratitude urges merit; and to shew there is not much of our Fate in our own providence, when this King thought the Nobility most firmly cimented to his side, and was to put himself upon their constancy, they make a present and general defluxion to the other; But he had heightned and contracted his Resolution and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the greatnesse of his Cause, and was not now to be outbid by Chance, or danger: The next day (which was Sunday about Evening)<note place="margin">Leicest. inquit, Rex Richardu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Earle of Northumberland was one, to whom he had ever been most constant and forward in his respects and favours; therefore, where he had conferred so much, he suspected little. But no Obligations are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, if not held so: and although in the conflict he stood but as neutrall, yet the suddainesse and example of it, drew many from the King, even at the instant, when he was ready to Arme himselfe, yet this was not of so great and sensible amazement unto him, as the Lord <hi>Stanleys</hi> defection, who in pledge of his faith, had left his Son <hi>George Stanley,</hi> whilst his wife (the Earles mother) had made her subtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of stronger tye, and subinduced him to the Lancastrian sice, which he ayded with 26000, men, if <hi>Phillip de Commines</hi> be not mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: for our stories have but five thousand. But it was a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and made the Earles Army far stronger, so that the chiefest point of Consultation now, was how to preserve him by flight, and the recovery of some strong hold, untill the tempest had scattered, or spent its violence, which they conceived covld not be long, if the Campe brake up, and once dissolved. But no Argument could fasten on him, though the benefit of a swift Horse was offered at his Tent doore, nor the fatality and portent of Prodigies, related by his friends, as presaging some inevitable Calamity, and that Propheticall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.

            <p>For true it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was much diligent search made for their bodies in the Tower: all places opened and digged, that was supposed: but not found; Then it was given out a certaine Priest tooke up their bodies and buried them in another secret place nto to be found; hereunto (but with better decorum for the more credit of this assertion) they might have added it was done <hi>sub sigillo confessionis,</hi> which may not be revealed.</p>

            <p>But it is of no great consequence to our purpose, whether it were the Carcasse of a Child or of an Ape, or whether this young Prince dyed in the Tower, or no: for wheresoever hee dyed, why should it not be as probable hee dyed of a naturall sicknesse and infirmity, as for his young Cozen german the sonne and heire of King <hi>Richard?</hi> many reasons conducing why the qualities and kinde of their death might be the same, and neere one time, being even parallels almost, and in their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane constitutions and corporall habitude sympathizing, of one Linage and Family, of one blood and age, of the same quality and fortune, therefore not unlikely of the same Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Affections, Passions; Distemperatures, so consequently subject to the same infirmities, to which may be added equall and common constellations, the same compatient and commori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fates and times, and then there is reason and naturall cause they might both die of like Diseases and infirmity, and were not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But to open the circumstance a little neerer: what danger could the lives of those two Princes be to <hi>Richard?</hi> who was accepted King by a just title, and his Nephewes declared ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, by the high Court of Parliament, and whilst they were reputed such by so great and generall a conclusion, why should he be lesse secure of them, then <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. was of <hi>Robert</hi> E. of Glocester, base sonne to <hi>Hen.</hi> 1.? or <hi>Richard</hi> the first of his base Brother <hi>Geoffrey Plantagenet?</hi> So although <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> left base sonnes, aspiring enough, yet they were of no danger to the <hi>Lancastrian</hi> Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither did <hi>Henry</hi> 7. or <hi>Henry</hi> 8. stand in any jealousy of <hi>Arthur Plantagenet:</hi> and surely <hi>Richard</hi> the third was as valiant, wise and consident, as any of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and had as little cause to dread his Nephewes, as they stood adjudged, or be more cruell and bloudy; neither hath my reading found any Bastards of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> who have aspired so publickly, onely except <hi>Don Eurique</hi> E. of <hi>Trastamara<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who was drawne into that action by the violent rages of the

people, and by the perswasions of the revolted states of Castile, to put downe a monster of Soveraignty the hatefull tyrant, <hi>Don Pedro &amp;</hi> Cruell. But being Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> and our best Chroniclers make it doubtfull, whether these two Princes were so lost in King <hi>Richards</hi> time, or no, and infer that one of them was thought to be living many years after his death; that might be enough to acquit him; which opinion I like the better, because it mentioneth the survivance but of one of them.</p>
            <p>Neither doe our most credible stories mention the transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of more then one, into Flanders, nor had they reason; it will bee sufficient, if one of them survived him, more, or lesse time; we will follow therefore the examination of his story, under the opinion of those times, and the attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grave and credible men, because it will be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous in the true and simple narration of this one Brother; every story being fraught with reports concerning him, and few or none of his brother finding no mention of the Elder Bothers being in Flanders; but of the youngers much, and of his other adventures: The prudent and honorable care of sending away this younger Brother, by some is ascribed to Sr. <hi>Robert Brakenbury,</hi> by others to the Queene his Mother, and it may well be the projection of them both, though no doubt there was the advise and assent of other well affected friends. And it is the more credible, the Queen wrought in it; for the story of Sr. <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> saith shee was before suspected to have had such a purpose, which was objected to her by some of the Lords; and the Cardinall <hi>Boursier</hi> told her the maine Reason which made the Protector and Nobles so urgeing to have him sent to his Brother (being then in the Tower) was a suspition and feare they had shee would convey Him forth of the Realme.</p>
            <p>So then, it may be cleerly supposed: he was sent into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Country, and that Flanders (as all our stories testify) there commended to a liberall education, under the curature of a worthy Gentleman in <hi>Warbeck,</hi> a Towne in Flanders, but kept very privately all the life time of his Uncle, his Friends not daring to make him of the councell. After his death, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Henry Richmond</hi> a cruell enemy to the house of Yorke, for his better safety was committed to the care of <hi>Charles</hi> of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, and his Dutchesse the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> Aunt to the Prince, as formerly the Dutchesse of Yorke upon a like cause of feare and jealousy had sent thither her two younger sons <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Richard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dutchesse being very tender to let this young Duke have all Princely and vertuous education in Tornay in Antwerp and after in the Court of the Duke of Burgundy, as hee had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40371:47"/>
bin in <hi>Warbeck,</hi> &amp;c. And with the greater circumspection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Dutchesse of Burgundy had as jealous an opinion of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, as the Queene Widdow had of <hi>Richard</hi> 3. Therefore, as yet, it was advised to conceale his Name and Quality: being not come to the growth nor age to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in his own affaires, much lesse to undertake an attempt so consequent and mighty as the recovery of a Kingdome: neither were the times and opportunity yet ripe, or propitious to fashion such an alteration, as was projected and must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, though there was pregnant hope of an induction to a change of Government stir'd by the Kings coveteousnesse, and some acts of Tyrany, Greivance and Rebellions in the North and West parts; not long after (which lent a seasonable hand to these designes) great unkindnesse fell out betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, and <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. who so far provoked the <hi>French,</hi> that he besieged Bulloigne, with a great army by land and Sea, the quarrell was of good advancement to the Dutchesse of Burgondy's Plot, and brought the Duke of Yorke better acquainted with forraigne Princes and their Courts; who was sent into <hi>France,</hi> into <hi>Portugall,</hi> and other places where he was received and entertained like a Prince.</p>
            <p>In which time such of the English Nobility as were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essed in the secret, and knew where this Prince resided, found some opportunity to give him assistance, and sent Sr. <hi>Robert Clifford</hi> and Sr. <hi>William Barley</hi> into Flanders, to give him a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit and intelligence of what noble friends he had ready to serve him: though their more particular errant was, to take a strict observance of him, and such private marks as hee had bin knowne by from his Cradle: there had beene some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits, incouraged to take upon them the persons of <hi>Edward</hi> E. of Warwick, and <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of Yorke; But here, the certainty of their knowledge found him they looked for, by his Face, Countenance, Lineaments and all tokens familiarly and privately knowne to them; observing his behaviour, naturaliz'd and heightned with a Princely grace, and in his discourse able to give them a ready accompt of many pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages he had heard or seene whilst hee was in England; with such things as had beene done and discourst very privately, speaking English very perfectly, and better then the Dutch, or Wallonish: by which Sr. <hi>Kobert Clifford</hi> and the rest, found themselves so well satisfied, and were so confirm'd, That they wrot to the Lord <hi>Fitzwater,</hi> to Sir <hi>Symon Mountford</hi> and others (who had a good opinion towards him;) the full accompt of what they had observ'd <hi>ex certa scientia, &amp; supra visum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris.</hi> About this time (to intermix the Scene with more varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and fill the Stage) some principall persons, well affecting the E. of Warwick, and hoping to get him forth of the Tower in

            <p>From <hi>Ireland</hi> hee sayled into <hi>England,</hi> landing at Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min in Cornewall, the Cornish and Westerne men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts receiving him very gladly, proclayming him King of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c, by the Title of <hi>Richard</hi> the Fourth (as Hee had beene proclaimed before in the North parts of <hi>England,</hi> by the Councell and Countenance of the King of Scots.) Out of Cornewall Hee marches into Devonshire to Exeter, to which Hee layd Siege, having then about five thousand men in his Army; but the Kings being at hand and farre stronger, Hee was forc't to rise from the siege, upon which those few friends Hee had left (finding His want, and the King with greater strength approaching) forsooke him to provide for themselves: thus abandoned, no way before him but flight, and being well mounted, with a traine of some forty or fifty reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Gentlemen, recovers the Abby of Beanely in Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, where Hee tooke Sanctuary, from which the Kings party who persued Him would violently have surprised Him;</p>

            <p>Then the King dealt with the Prior for him, who would not yeeld him, but upon faithfull promise from the King to use him with all favour and grace, which was protested, although <hi>Perkin</hi> no sooner came into his power againe but hee was sent to the Tower, where his imprisonment was made so hard and rude, that it much dejected and troubled him, oftentimes in private and with peircing groanes, having beene heard to wish himselfe borne the Sonne of any Pesant.

Jesus Christ, this man is truly the King <hi>Don Sebastian,</hi> he hath all the markes on his body, without failing in any one as he had in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, only the wounds excepted which he received in that Battel at <hi>Affricke,</hi> he gives the reason of his life, &amp; account of all his passages, &amp;c. He is knowne and re-known by the Conciergres, by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, by the greater part of the Senate, and by his owne Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, &amp;c. and a great deal more of him upon knowledg he justifies: as much witnesses <hi>Ion de Castro,</hi> Sonne to <hi>Don de Alvaro de Castro,</hi> one of the four Governours that ruled the Kingdome Conjunctly with the King <hi>Don Sebastian,</hi> who in his letter the same man sayes thus. The King <hi>Don Sebastian</hi> (whom the enemies call a <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brois</hi>) is the very same which is detained here, as certainly as you are Fryer <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and my selfe <hi>Don Ion.</hi> He departed alive from the battaile, but very sore wounded: God having so delivered him with some other of his company, amongst whom was the Duke <hi>Anegro, &amp;c.</hi> as for the Exterior marks of his body he wants not one of them, he is wounded on the brow of the right eye and on the head, as many witnessed when they saw him in the <hi>Affrick</hi> Battell.

            <p>There might much more be instanced in the behalfe of this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian,</hi> but this may serve for better intelligence, to which I may adde, that men experienced in the Affaires and policy of State, know it a rare thing to find in any History the examples of a Prince being seised and possessed of any <hi>Signiory</hi> or <hi>Principality</hi> (how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull soever) who hath resigned them or any part to the true heires. Have we not instances at home, where the Sonne hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Kingdome from the Father, and would not let it goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but rather endeavoured to hast his Fathers fate?

            <p>In briefe, it is not possible to perswade a private man, though wrongfully possessed to acknowledge the true proprietary hath a better title then he.</p>

            <p>But let us now take a more particular view of those witnesses who stood for <hi>Perkin.</hi> And having formerly mentioned Sir <hi>Robert Clifford,</hi> a Knight of the Noble Family of the Barons <hi>Cliffords,</hi> I will proceed with that which may be the more remarkable in him, because hee was of a Family that long hated the House of Yorke,<note place="margin">Moor, Hollinsh.

            <p>There were some great men (though they made noe professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their knowledge of him,) could whisper it one to another<note place="margin">Hollinshed, Grafton, Hall, Stow.</note> which in generall words, is confessed by all our better writers; who say, that as well the Noblemen, as others, held the said <hi>Perkin</hi> to

be the younger Sonne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth.</p>

            <p>Richard <hi>Grafton</hi> affirmeth the same, in Flanders (saith he) and most of all here in England, it was received for an undoubted truth, not onely of the people but of the Nobles, that <hi>Perkin</hi> was the Sonne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. And they all swore and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> William Cambden.</note> this to be true; The learned and famous Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, there were many wise, grave and persons of good intelli gence, (who liued in that time and neere it) That affirmed consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently this <hi>Perkin</hi> was second Sonne to King <hi>Edward,</hi> then both the Brothers were not made a way by King <hi>Richard,</hi> and sarely it was little reason, or policy, to cut off the one &amp; spare the other, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed was there ever any proofes made, by Testimony, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Presumption, nor by Reason, Honour, or Policy, that this crime could be his, though many to the contrary; for he not onely preserved his Nephew the young Earle of Warwicke, but in his confidence (a speciall note of his magnanimity) gave him libertie, pleasure, and the command of a Statly house of his owne.</p>
            <p>Now if he had beene so Ambitious and bloudy, he would have provided otherwise for him, knowing his Title was to take place, if his bloud had not beene attainted in his Father; in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of King <hi>Richard</hi> when his owne Sonne was dead, caused his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Iohn de la Poole,</hi> Eldest Sonne of the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and<note place="margin">Some think he dyed unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</note> of the Dutches his sister, (then the next lawfull heir to the Crowne) to be proclaimed heir apparant, an Argument of res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to his kindred &amp; next title to the Crowne, in whomsoever it was; which other men regarded not so much as the unhappy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel shewed: (&amp; there was an impious necessitie in that) for whilst the Prince of Yorke survived, (Especially the males) no other titular Lord, or pretender could be King by his owne right, or by colour of right, nor by any other meanes: unlesse he had married a daughter, and the Eldest Daughter of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth.</p>
            <p>And although the deathes &amp; manner of taking away these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (the Sonnes of King <hi>Edward</hi>) is held by our writers uncertaine and obscure, It is manifest (at least for the generall manner of their death) to be either by the Publicke sword, that is the sword of<note place="margin">Publike sword.

               </hi> but it was a great neglect in their malice, makeing King <hi>Richard</hi> soe politick and treacherous as they did, not to charge him also with these Princes Sisters, For it could not serve his turne, to rid away the<note place="margin">Reasons why <hi>King Richard</hi> should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes.</note> Brothers, and not them; who were capable of the Crowne and had their turne royall, before any Collaterall males.

            <p>I would aske the reason too why King <hi>Richard</hi> might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his Nephewes (being by Parliament held and adjudged ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate) as well as the Kings <hi>Henry</hi> 7. and <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Arthur Plantagenet,</hi> the Bastard of the same King <hi>Edward</hi> their natales and cases being alike, or why Sir Thomas <hi>Moore</hi> and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Morton</hi> should in one place, say it was held in doubt, when or how they were made away, and in another place, to averr that Tiroll and Dighton being examined, confessed plainely, the murder of them and all the manner of it.</p>

Then where is their farre seeing knowledge, that will have them transported into Forraign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, or drowned, or their giganticke proofes, that say pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily, they were both murthered and buryed in the Tower by those foure named before: if so, we need go no further for the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40371:56"/>
truth. But these are splenitick reaches, and the <hi>Parachronisme</hi> is too groste as the <hi>Comaedian</hi> said,

            </p>
            <p>Besides, if <hi>Perkin</hi> were not the second Sonne of King <hi>Edward,</hi> he must bee nothing, for the <hi>Flemish, French,</hi> and <hi>Wallons</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no such Noble young man to be borne in <hi>Warbecke,</hi> or in <hi>Tourney,</hi> but make honourable mention of a young Sonne of the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was brought to the Dutchesse of <hi>Burgundy</hi> his Aunt, being then in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and how hee was in <hi>France</hi> and in other Kingdomes. And surely so many Noble and discreet <hi>English,</hi> if they had not knowne him to be the same, by most certaine tokens, and evidence, would not so confidently have laid downe their lives to confirme their knowledge of him, or hazarded their judgements and honours upon an Imposture, or vanity, especially those who had places of Quality and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency neare the King then living, and were in favour at Court. Therefore I would be resolv'd from our <hi>Anti-Richards,</hi> what aim those Noble-men could have, in averring him the Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth by the hazard of their lives and Estates (if the KING pleased) and how could they expect lesse; for though they were enough to justifie it a truth, they were too few to maintaine it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, there could be no aime or hope to super-induce young <hi>Richard</hi> to be King: but meerly I am perswaded in point of truth and honour, as they thought themselves bound to doe, they freely tendred their lives to make good what their Conscience &amp; knowledge witnessed, for it would be an Imposture of a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Deception, so many worthy and wise persons both of the Nobility and Clergy, some of them having served the King his Father and himselfe, that they all in their particular and generall intelligence and understandings, should be mistaken and cheated. I say it was a strange delusion if it could bee so: but indeede those that would have it, so leave it in question, and know not well what to make of their own relations, or how to resolve his History, and if wee marke Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> in the life of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh (though his speculation be tender, and as favourable as hee can that way) touching the History of this young Duke, hee gently slides from it;</p>

Which Contract and Marriage are related in the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aforesaid, where it is disertly called a former Marriage, and the King had a childe by her. But where desires are unlawful, they will be unlimited. We are ever young enough to sin; never old enough to repent: never constant, never satisfied in our neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est desires. Though to morrow shew us the sting of to day, the third shall betray us again; and we are taken (like children in a shop of trinkets) by the eye, liking all things, from one to another, until pleasure dull pleasure, and we grow weary of them.

But she was of so pregnant and reserved a wit, (seconded by the caution and counsel of the Dutchesse her mother) that his highest temptations and sweetest batteries could not win upon her; protesting never to yeeld to any disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable parley or unchaste motion, although it might warrant the safe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nay, his speed admitted not the approved Ceremony of the Banes asking. And such was the want of Reverend Bishops then, that he was fain to take an ordinary Priest to marry them, in a Chamber too, in stead of a Church, and that in a Lodge or Forest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house; no body being present but the Dutchesse, and some few<note place="margin">This Marriage was in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of Which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</note> of her company. So where he first saw her (and by chance) there at the next interview he married her; an act of as high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception as improvidence.

<q>
                  <p>MY Liege Lord, and my dear Son, It is very commonly reported<note place="margin">The Speech of the Dutchesse of York, to King <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.</note> you are purposed to marry the Lady <hi>Gray,</hi> a widow, and a mean Gentlewoman; which you cannot but conceive will redound to your disparagement and dishonour; all the wise, great and noblest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of your Kingdom, thinking it far more to the advantage of your Honour, profit and Safety, to seek the Alliance of a Noble Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and rather in a forraign Countrey then your own, as well in regard thereupon may depend great strength to your Estate, and great possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to enlarge your possessions by such Affinity. Also (if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) you may not safely marry any other then the Lady <hi>Bona,</hi> the Earl of Warwick having proceeded so far in the Current of that Match already, that it is likely he will not sit down contented, if his troublesome and costly negotiation should be so slightly blown off and frustrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d.</p>
                  <p>Besides (Sir) consider it is not Princely for a King to marry his own Subject, (at least no great and important occasion leading him thereunto, nor possessions or other commodity depending thereupon) but will be lesse tolerable to all opinion, then if a rich man should marry his maid, onely for a little wanton dotage upon her person; in which kinde of Marriages, many men commend more the maids fortune, then the masters discretion. Yet there must needs be more honesty in such a Marriage, then can be honour in this which you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40371:61"/>
for the difference is not so great betwixt a rich Merchant and his servant, as you must think between the King and the widow <hi>Gray;</hi> in whose person (albeit there be nothing to be mistiked) there is nothing so excellent, but it may be found in divers other women, much more noble and many ways exceeding her, and more compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to your Estate (those also Virgins, who must be thought of a much more honourable estimation then widows;) wherefore the Widowhood onely of <hi>Elizabeth Gray</hi> (though in all other things she were convenient for you) were enough to restrain you, being a King, and so great a King.</p>
                  <p>And it must needs stick as a foul disparagement to the sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie of a Prince (who ought as nearly to approach the Priesthood in Purenesse and Cleannesse, as he doth in Dignity (to be defiled with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy, in his first Marriage.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far the King could with attention hear the Dutchesse: But being extremly far gone in love, or rather in the hot passion of Love, he was resolute to marry her; and partly in earnest, and partly in play (as one that well wist he was out of the check of a mother) yet reverently thus replied.

When (if a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Alliance were thought so requisite) I could finde the means of that much better by other of my kin (where all those parties would be content) but to marry myself to one whom I should (peradventure) never love, and for the possibility of more possessions, lose the fruit and pleasure of this which I have already: For small pleasure taketh a man of all he hath, or can have, if he be wived against his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
                     <p>And I doubt not but there be (as you say, Madam) other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in every point comparable to the Lady <hi>Gray;</hi> therefore I lett not other men to wed them, no more then have they reason to mistike where it liketh me.</p>
                     <p>Nor doubt I my Cousin of Warwick's love can be so slightly setled to me, as to grudge at that which I affect; nor so unreasonable, to look that in my choice of a wife I should rather be ruled by his eye then

mine own, that were to make me a Ward, and binde me to marry by the appointment of a Guardian; with which servile and hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I would not be King.</p>
                     <p>As for the possibility you urge of more inheritance by new Affinity in strange Lands, that is not always certain; but contrariwise, it is oftentimes the occasion of more trouble then profit. Besides, we have already a Title and Seisine so good and great, as may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be gotten, and so to be kept, by one man, and in one mans days.</p>
                     <p>For your Objection that the Lady <hi>Gray</hi> hath been a wife, and is now a widow, and hath already Children: Why (by Gods blessed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) I that am a Batchelor have some Children too; and so, for our better comfort, there is proof that neither of us are like to be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. And I trust in God (Madam) you shall live to see her bring forth a young Prince, and your pretty Son, that shall be a joy and pleasure to you.</p>
                     <p>For the Bigamy objected; let the Bishop lay it hardly in my way, when I come to take Orders of Priesthood: for I confesse, I understand Bigamy is forbidden to a Priest, but I never wist it yet forbidden to a Prince: Therefore I pray you, good Madam, trouble yourself and me no further in this matter.</p>

            <p>Then she urged his Contract with the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Lucie,</hi> and his having had a childe by her, (as she said;) and thought her self bound in conscience to charge him with. Master <hi>Moor, Grafton, Stow</hi> and the rest, say, the King utterly denied that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and protested it a slander; which well and justly he might do, and these Authors may retract what they have written.</p>
            <p>For the truth is, he was never contracted to her, though he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her well, being of an affable and witty temper; nor did she ever alleadge the King was betrothed to her, but that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled her by sweet and tempting language; And who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not <hi>Credula res amor est?</hi> But true it is, he had a childe by her, which was the Bastard <hi>Arthur,</hi> called commonly (but undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>Arthur Plantagenet,</hi> afterward made Viscount <hi>Lisle,</hi> by <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>In this Relation, the Historians have much and foully erred, not onely corrupting the story, but have injured the Dutchesse of <hi>York</hi> in her judgement and knowledge of these matters, and the tenour of her former Speech, making her to charge the King as contracted to this <hi>Elizabeth Lucy</hi> (of birth and quality much meaner then the Lady <hi>Gray,</hi> whom she conceived so basely of; for <hi>Elizabeth Lucy</hi>
               <note place="margin">Elizabeth Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> was the daughter of one <hi>Wyat</hi> of Southampton, a mean Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (if he were one) and the wife of one <hi>Lucy,</hi> as mean a man as <hi>Wyat.</hi> True it is, the King kept her as his Concubine, and she was one of those most famous three who had peculiar Epithets, being called his Witty Leman.) For that they would have her say, the King was never betrothed to her, it importeth nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conceive it was never extracted from her. But truely to salve the story, and errour of these Writers, we must know, That
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40371:62"/>
Lady to whom the King was first betrothed and married, was <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Talbot,</hi> daughter of a great Peer of this Realm, of a most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and illustrious Family, the Earl of Shrewsbury, who is also called in authentick Writings the Lady <hi>Butler,</hi> because she was then the widow of the Lord <hi>Butler</hi> (a Lady of a very eminent beauty, and answerable vertue) to whom the King was contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, married, and had a childe hy her. This is that Lady (not <hi>Elizabeth Lucy</hi>) the Queen spake of to her son; and (to note <hi>Obiter</hi>) the Kings breach with this Lady, was a cause the subtil widow would not listen unto him before Marriage, having learned, <hi>Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas damno solet esse puellae.</hi> This Marriage cast the Lady <hi>Elianor</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ovid.</note> 
               <hi>Butler</hi> into so perplext a Melancholy, that she spent her self in a solitary life ever after: and how she died, is not certainly known; but out of doubt kindnesse was not the cause, he having a heart for every new face, and was so become exceedingly fancied to his new wife the Lady <hi>Gray,</hi> no Court or pleasure now, but where she is. In this continuance of his amorous Indulgence (which was many yeers, and rendred a fruitful issue to him) no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion that party of her kinred made their best advantage from it. Yet the remembrance of that Pre-contract after a time, moved him by such sensible apprehensions, he could not brook to have it mentioned, which was the cause of his displeasure against his ancient Chaplain Doctor <hi>Stillington</hi> of Bath, because he did what his conscience urged, to God and the Kingdom, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Marriage, occasioned by the Ladies sudden indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and pressing sorrow; who not able to contain her self, had open'd it to a Lady her sister, or (as some say) to her mother the Countesse of Shrewsbury; she to the Earl her husband; he consults it with his noblest kinsfolks and friends, as it was a general scandal to them all: they, to inform themselves the better, had conference with Dr. <hi>Stillington,</hi> who affirmed the Contract and Marriage: with whom they advise, that as he was a Bishop and a Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, it behoved him to prepare it to the Kings consideration, for some redresse and satisfaction. But the Bishop (though willing) durst not deal with the King in that manner; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wisht they would apply it to the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> as the man most inward with the King; whereof <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> thus<note place="margin">Philip de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines.</note> writeth. <hi>Cestuy Euesque d'Bath, mit en avant ace Dux de Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, que le dit Roy</hi> Edouart <hi>estoit fort amoreux, d'un Dame, d'Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre, &amp; luy promise de l'espouser pour veu qu'il couchat avec illa, ells s'y consentit: &amp; dit ceste Euesque, qu'il les avoit Espouses, &amp; n'y avoit que luy &amp; eux deux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of Gloucester, as they desired, prest it to the King, who became more incens'd against the Bishop, saying he had not onely betraid his trust, but his children; and upon that heat puts him from the Councel Table, under a strict imprisonment for a long time, which at length he redeemed himself from, by a heavy fine, as

Of such a venemous <hi>Catarhe</hi> died the young King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth. But by whose hand King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth had his death, it is not said. Certain it is, he was generally beloved of all his Subjects, except those of the Lancastrian faction. As soon as he was dead, the silence brake into a general muttering against his Marriage; then into loud and publike in veighing against it.

               <note place="margin">Parliament, how so called and derived.</note> because (as he thinketh) the Peers of the Countrey did at these Meetings complain each to other of the enormities of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. But the better opinion is, That Parliament is simply from the French word <hi>parler</hi> (and that from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both signifying to speak) and so by adding the termination, <hi>ment</hi> (which is common in the French Tongue, as well to many Nouns as Adverbs) do make up <hi>Parliament;</hi> meaning thereby an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of men called together to speak or confer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it may not unfitly be called Parliament, for that each man should <hi>parler, lament,</hi> speak his minde. But <hi>Laurence Valla</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lawrence Valla.</note> misliketh that Etymologie.</p>
            <p>It may be ghessed the word <hi>Parliament</hi> (being transported out of <hi>France</hi>) began shortly after the Norman Conquest. One of the first authentical reports of that name, is found in the Statute 3 <hi>E.</hi> 1. commonly called <hi>Westminster Parliament;</hi> that Assembly being said to be <hi>Primier generall apres Coronament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le Roy.</hi> But that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40371:63"/>
is not the first word: for in the Statutes called <hi>Articuli Cleri,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished 9 <hi>E.</hi> 2, these words are read: <hi>Temporibus progenitorum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strorum quondam Regum Angliae Parliamentis suis, &amp;c.</hi> Which words <hi>Progenitorum &amp; quondam,</hi> must needs reach higher then <hi>E.</hi> 1. that was but father to him that spake it.</p>
            <p>But at what time soever after the Conquest this Court began to be called a Parliament, the same was before known to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons</hi> or Englishmen, by the word <hi>Sinoth,</hi> and <hi>Micell Sinoth,</hi> of the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, now appropriated to Ecclesiastical meetings onely; and sometimes by these terms, <hi>Micell, Gemote, Witengemott,</hi> and <hi>Calca Witengemott;</hi> that is, the meeting of wisemen, or of all the wisemen: for <hi>witona</hi> signifieth wisemen, <hi>Calca,</hi> all, and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mott,</hi> a meeting: of which last words the names <hi>Shire-motts, Eol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motts,</hi> and <hi>Halymotts;</hi> that is, the meeting or assembling of the men of a Shire, of a Town, and of the Tenants of a Hall or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, had their beginning also.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Sinoth</hi> is more used in the Parliaments themselves; so <hi>Gemott</hi> is more familiar to the Historians.</p>
            <p>And this Parliament of <hi>Anno</hi> 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. could be of no lesse power and vertue; witnesse the many and good Laws made in it, (albeit the second Marriage of King <hi>Edward</hi> was adjudged unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the Acts of that Parliament for the most part repealed and abrogated afterward) yet the evidence is clear enough, that the Judges and Law-makers of that Parliament, were wise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, and their Laws upright and just.</p>
            <p>Therefore whatsoever was adjudged by them, was to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and held as authentick and inviolable (how roughly soever it was afterward handled.) And in this case of the disabling of King <hi>Edwards</hi> sons, there is least reason to suspect them, the cause being so new, so plain, and notoriously known, that no man could be ignorant therein: Therefore to have given any other Judgement, but according to the truth of evidence, and certainty of knowledge, it might justly have been censured an act of errour and ignorance, or partiality and injustice.</p>
            <p>For it was not the opinion of a few, nor raised out of a weak judgement and perverted knowledge; but a strong and general evidence, by the ablest and best knowing.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, The case was obscure and doubtful: That cannot be; for the Estates had all substantial and ready means to inform themselves of the truth, and every circumstance whereby they might be fully satisfied and cleared in all the niceties and doubts: for all the witnesses and dealers in that cause, and such persons as were acquainted with it, were then living; and they must and would have truely and certainly informed the Court of Parliament: For the special and reverend care of this Court is, The advancing of Justice and Right. Therefore all Subjects (by nature or grace) are bound in their Allegeance, to give pious
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40371:64"/>
and religious credit to Parliaments, and to believe in their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power, as the former times did in Oracles. We must also confidently hold the high and transcendent quality and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Court, to have all power and authority: And no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to repeal a good and just Law made in Parliament, is a wrong and scandal to that General Councel, and to the universal wisedom, providence, justice and piety of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In the Parliament 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. there is an Act, attainting the King <hi>R.</hi> 3. of high Treason, for bearing Arms against the Earl of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, intituled The Soveraign Lord (this was at his proceeding from Milford-haven into Leicester:) But when he came to fight the Battel, he was then no King, nor Soveraign, but a Chief of such as made head against their Soveraign. In which Paragraph there appears three grosse faults.</p>
            <p>First, Certain it is, <hi>Richard</hi> during his Raign was a Soveraign, therefore no Subject.</p>
            <p>Next, there was no enemy in the field who was then a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, but all liege Subjects to the Crown.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Richard</hi> being the King and Soveraign, could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a Traitor, nor lawfully attainted of High Treason. Then let it be considered whether a person of sacred Majestie (that is, an Anointed Soveraign) may commit the Crime of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Also in this Parliament, all the Barons, Knights and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that bore Arms in the field for the King, were attainted of Treason, their goods and lands confiscate: and one <hi>Thomas Nan dick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Other such things there be in that Parliament, which detract it in the opinion of some; those of the best and wisest repute.</p>
            <p>Now let us come to examine that Treaty the King had about<note place="margin">The Treaty of Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween K. <hi>R.</hi> 3. and his Neece the Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenet.</hi>
               </note> marrying the Lady <hi>Plantagenet;</hi> which is censured to be a thing not onely detestable, but much more cruel and abominable to be put in agitation.</p>

                  <hi>Item,</hi> That he made away the Queen his wife, to make way for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40371:64"/>
this Marriage; and that he propounded not the Treaty of Marriage, until the Queen his wife was dead.</item>
            </list>
            <p>That there was such a motion for the marriage of this Lady to the King, is true; and (which is more, and most certain) it was entertained, and well liked by the King and his friends, a good while; also by the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and by the Queen her mother; who received it with so much content and liking, that presently she sent into France for her son the Marquesse of Dorset, that was there with the Earl of Richmond, earnestly solliciting him to renounce the Faction, and return home to the Kings favour and advancement, which she assured him: and sends the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to attend the Queen at Court, or to place her more in the eye, so in the heart of the King. The Christmas following (which was kept in Westminster-Hall) for the better colour of sending her eldest daughter, she sends her other four thither, who were received with all honourable courtesie by the King and Queen Regent; especially the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was ranked most<note place="margin">Chronicle Croyland.</note> familiarly in the Queens favour, and with as little distinction as Sisters. But society, nor all the Pomp and Festivity of those times, could cure that sad wound and languor in the Queens brest, which the death of her onely son had left. The addresse of those Ladies to Court (albeit the feigned wooing of the King was in a politick and close way) gave cause of suspition to the Earl of Richmonds intelligencing friends, that the King had a purpose to marry the Lady <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> which must prevent the Earl both of his hope to her, and to the Crown by her Title: a clause that made them mutter very broadly against it (for indeed, what more concern'd them?) therefore the King treats it more privately and coldly; but the Queen-widow and the Lady stood constant in their desires and expectation; onely the Objection was, The King had a wife; as though he could not marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whilst she lived; not remembring how usual it was, not onely for Kings, but private men to put away one wife and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry another, for venial crimes, as well as Adultery and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

            <p>But the Answer which was made in the name of the King to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> concerning his Queen, was, That she could be no impediment of long continuance, being a very weak woman in a Consumption, and past hopes of recovery; her Physitians giving their opinions, she could not live past the middle of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> next following: nor ghessed they much amisse; for the died in the next month, <hi>March.</hi> When the midst and last of <hi>February</hi> was past, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being more impatient and jealous of the successe then every one knew or conceived, writes<note place="margin">The credit of the Duke of Norfolk with King <hi>Richard,</hi> and with the lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi> and her Letter to him.</note> a Letter to the Duke of Norfolk, intimating first, that he was the man in whom she most affied, in respect of that love her Father had ever bore him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then she congratulates his many cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies, in continuance of which, she desires him to be a mediator for her to the King, in the behalf of the Marriage propounded between them, who, as she wrote, was her onely joy and maker in this world, and that she was his in heart and thought: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all insinuating, that the better part of <hi>February</hi> was past, and that she feared the Queen would never die.</p>
            <p>All these be her own words, written with her own hand; and this is the sum of her Letter, which remains in the Autograph, or Original Draft, under her own hand, in the magnificent Cabinet of <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of Arundel and Surrey: by which it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40371:65"/>
that this young Lady was ignorant that a man having a<note place="margin">The Cabinet of the Earl of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel, now Earl of Surrey too.</note> wife living, might marry another, and suffer her to live. But the truth is, the King had no real intent to make her his wife, from the beginning; onely in policy entertained this Treaty, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared afterward, when his Queen was dead, and he had all fit accesses without any impediment to marry her, yet did not; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing he wooed her not to that end, but for some other causes; and made Protestation (in the great Hall at Saint <hi>Iones</hi> neer Smithfield, before all the Knights of Malta, and a great Assembly of Noble-men; the Lord Maior, Aldermen, and many Citizens being present) that he had no purpose nor intent to marry the Lady <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> avowing, <hi>Quodeares (viz.)

Let us look therefore with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er consideration upon the motion or pretence of this Marriage: to call it detestable and cruel, is ignorant and malicious (though she were so neer of kin to him) for Marriages between Uncles and Neeces, have been very frequent and allowed in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys by the Church. In our time, the daughter and heir of Duke <hi>Infantasgo</hi> in Spain, was married to his brother <hi>Don Alde Mendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za:</hi> and more lately, the Earl of Miranda married his brothers daughter.</p>
            <p>In the House of Austria, Marriages in this kinde have been very usual, and thought lawful, the Pope dispensing with them: for they say in Spain, <hi>Que el padre santo quiere Dios loquire:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how could it be so highly unlawful in King <hi>Richard?</hi> Or if his intents had been so forward, where was the Bar, when his wife was dead, and he absolute, unlesse the Ladies aversenesse? But that suggestion is answered by her own Letter, and other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies. So the Account will be (if rightly summed by what hath been produced) that he had never any serious determination of Marriage; onely took the advantage of his gain, by looking into
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40371:66"/>
her hand; then no cause to make away his Queen; which his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers themselves directly and peremptorily charge him not with;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Tho. Moor. Hollinshead.</note> but doubtfully say, The Queen (however it fortuned) departed out of this life the 16 of <hi>March,</hi> in the Lent season. But although he had the commendations of a loving and indulgent husband, I say not he lived always continently; for I finde he had some ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards, two of them I have mentioned: yet peradventure he might have them before his Marriage, and then the fault was lesse. So then, let them that affect not blinde and traditory opinion, more then justice and reason, but equally examine his slanders, they shall finde, Malice and ignorance have been the Kings great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est accusers, which can onely lay Suspition to his charge: and<note place="margin">Suspitio est opinio mali ex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> levibus signis. <hi>B. Th.

Wherefore Suspition of it self bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no sentence by Law Natural or Moral, Civil or Divine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the old <hi>Minographus, Suspitio grave est hominibus malum.</hi> And the Divine <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, A good man hardly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth another to be evil; but an evil man scarcely supposeth any to be good; far from the counsel of this Epigram.

            <p>These may serve for the notions of a Tyrant: to any of which Impieties, our King <hi>Richard</hi> was very little or not at all obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious.</p>
            <p>For first, Whereas a Tyrant imposeth many grievous Taxes<note place="margin">Parliam An. 1 Rich. 3.</note> and Oppressions upon his Subjects, he took away such grievances, and particularly by Act of Parliament, a hateful Tax (though dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised with the name of a Benevolence) forbearing to impose<note place="margin">The Duke of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note> any upon the people.</p>
            <p>Then, A Tyrant doth not onely rapine his Subjects, but spoils and robs Churches and Church-men. But King <hi>Richard</hi> did many good things both for the publike good, advancing Gods service, and maintenance of his Ministers and Church-men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyrannum pium esse non est facile</hi> (as <hi>Sophocles</hi> well observed.) And the Oracle pronounced, <hi>Portae foelicitatis ad Tyrannidem clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sae.</hi> Tyrants be cruel and bloody: but this King, by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his enemies, was very merciful and milde; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse he was of himself gentle, and assably disposed. These be their own words.</p>
            <p>Therefore, where tyrannical acts be objected against him, they must be conceived done by other men, or by their practice, or else before he was King; and what he did then, was not, nor could be properly called Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Amongst those they impute to him when he was King, which are called Tyrannies, the beheading <hi>Henry Stafford</hi> Duke of Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham was the chiefest: yet that act, the cause and just mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of it being well perused, cannot be censured Tyranny; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, due and necessary Justice: for if the King had not put down the Duke, the Duke would have put down the King.</p>
            <p>Then it is objected, He bare a tyrannical hand over his nephew
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40371:68"/>
               <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of Warwick. True it is, he sent him to Shery-Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a goodly and pleasant house of his own, in York-shire, where he had liberty, large diet, all pleasure and safety; and if that were imprisonment, it was a prison Curtoise (as <hi>Iohn Froisard</hi> saith) yet this must not be lesse then Tyranny, according to the style of Sir <hi>Thomas Moore.</hi> When King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, as soon as he had got the Crown, sent this young Prince to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, afterwards cut off his head; yet that was no Tyranny, after Sir <hi>Thomas Moore.</hi> But our King <hi>Iames</hi> (of ever happie memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)<note place="margin">Comes Arund. vi. voce.</note> hath thought it an act of so much detestation, that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly he protested against it, and shewed another temper of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Power in his Royal Clemencie, to certain Noble persons<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames.</hi>
               </note> in one of his Kingdoms, who being Regal Titulars, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding title to the Crown there (as descended from some King of that Countrey) his gracious and pious inclination was so far from seeking their ruine (or so much as the restraining them) that he suffered their liberty, with possession of what they had.</p>
            <p>Then they call the punishment of <hi>Iane Shore</hi> a Tyrannie: A<note place="margin">Iane Shore.</note> common and notorious Adulteresse (as the Duke of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, who knew her very well, censured her) which she deserved so justly, that it was rather favourable, then severe or tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
            <p>Next, the death of <hi>William Collingborn</hi> is made one of his<note place="margin">Anonimus Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris peritus in Apologia K. R. 3.</note> Tyrannies; who (as some trivial Romancers say) was hanged for making a Satyrical Rhyme; when the truth is, he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Treason, and was arraigned and condemned of High Treason, as may be yet seen in the Record; and then it was Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and not Tyrannie.</p>
            <p>Another proof against their grosse Paralogisms, take from this observation made by <hi>Demosthenes: Tyrannus res est inimica Civibus, legibus contraria.</hi> But King <hi>Richard</hi> was ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indulgent to his people, careful to have the Laws duely observed; his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so many good ones, being an evident argument of his love to Law and Justice. It is further observed, that Tyrants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn good counsel, are opinionated of their own wisedoms, and obstinate to determine all matters by themselves.</p>
            <p>These Plaintiffs being called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>But King <hi>Richard</hi> nor did nor would do any thing of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without consultation with the wisest and noblest. And if in any matters he had delivered his judgement, yet his manner
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40371:69"/>
(as his detractors confesse) was, to say in the end and conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>My Lords, this is my minde; if any of you know what may else be better, I shall be ready to change it: for I am not wedded to my own will.</hi> Thus Sir <hi>Thomas Moor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eastly, Largition and excessive expences, are thought vices pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Tyrants; the rather, because the Romane Tyrants, for<note place="margin">

            <p>King <hi>Kichard</hi> was ever held to be frugal, with the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his honour; nor can they tax him with Palliardise, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Epicurism, nor Gluttony, vices following many Tyrants; but moderate and temperate in all his actions and appetites; which is confessed, and therefore needeth no further proof. Indeed it had been advantage and safety to him, in the event, if he had been a Tyrant a while; for then he might have preserved his life and kingdom, and given a timely check to the practice of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Morton,</hi> the Marquesse Dorset, Earl of Devon, and his<note place="margin">King <hi>Richard</hi> in this was like <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who knowing by certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence the conspiracy and conspirators a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his life, also the time and place of execution, yet he seemed to slight and not regard it.

But his remisnesse and patience bred his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, not his tyranny; that had been his protection.</p>
            <p>And now the black curtain of malice and detraction is drawn, let us see this King in his proper Royalty and vertues casting up the general and particular notions of A good King and happie Government; then peruse what was wanting in him.</p>
            <p>First then, There is necessarily required proper to Empire, Wisedom, Justice, Fortitude, Beauty, Magnificence, Temperance, and Piety.</p>
            <p>That he had Wisedom and Prudence, need no other witnesse, then his wise and provident managing both of his own private affairs, and Government of the Publike.

            <p>For his further knowledge and love of Justice, there can be no fairer argument, then his desire and custome to sit in Courts of Justice, hearing and distributing Justice indifferently to all men.</p>
            <p>And when he made his Progresse into York-shire, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed there of some extortioners and foul offenders, who were apprehended, not tried, he caused the Law to take the just cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, giving strict charge and commandment to all Officers of Justice, for just administration to all men, without partiality or private respects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:40371:69"/>The Fortitude and Magnanimity of this Prince (though of lowe stature) were so great and famous, as they need no Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet or Praecony, being bred from his youth in Martial actions: and the Battels of Barnet, Exham, Doncaster, the second of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Albans, and of Tewksbury, will give him the reputation of a Souldier and Captain.</p>
            <p>Being made General of the Kings Armies into Scotland, he prevailed happily in his Expedition, and particularly recovered that famous and strong Hold of Berwick, which King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth had so weakly let go.</p>
            <p>And in this you shall hear the Elogie of one that was loth to speak much in his favour, yet occasion forced him to speak his<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Here followeth another general and memorable testimony of him, and of more regard and honour, because it is averred by one that knew him from his youth, the Duke of Buckingham, who (after <hi>Richard</hi> was made King, and this Duke became ill affected) acknowledged to Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> in private speeches between<note place="margin">Morton. Moor apud Stow, p. 774.</note> them, That he thought King <hi>Richard,</hi> from his first knowledge even to that time, a man clean without dissimulation, tractable, and without injury; and that for these respects, he was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to advance him, and laboured earnestly to make him Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector. Therefore whatsoever the Duke said after, in reproach of the King, it may justly be thought to proceed from spleen and malice.</p>

            <p>Lastly, he gave sundry good Priviledges and Immunities to the said Corporation: which Charter was kept continually in the Office until within these few yeers; but now is in another place: the want of it importeth nothing, being the Duplicate is upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Archives, kept in the Convert-house, now called the Rolls.

            <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Carew,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Trenchard</hi> (principal men in those parts) gave speedy intelligence of this to the King, who was glad of the accident, and purposed to make good use of it, as speedily returning his command to give them all honourable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; but not suffer them to depart, until he had seen and saluted them.</p>
            <p>The Duke ignorant of this, as soon as the Queen and the rest had recover'd and refresht themselves, thought he was onely to give those Knights thanks, and take his leave; which they by way of courtesie and request interpose, in behalf of the Kings vehement desire to salute him and the Queen: a motion the Duke much prest to be excused from, as the necessity of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney stood: but the intreaty was so imperious, he must stay, and alter his journey for Windsor, to meet the King, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him there in a magnificent manner; and at the height of a Feast, propounds a suit to the Duke for <hi>Edmund de la Pool</hi> (then in his Dominions) a pretender to the Crown of England, and not so soundly affected to him: a suit of a harsh exposition, as the Duke apprehended it, and to the blemish of his honour and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, as he nobly urged: but no argument had vertue, nor no vertue argument enough to excuse it; the King must have him, or the Duke must stay. Cast upon this extreme (and foreseeing what disadvantages were upon him, some honourable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted, that he should neither lay punishment nor death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him) he gave his promise to send him, and the King strictly and religiously bound himself to the exceptions.</p>
            <p>The Duke accordingly sent this <hi>de la Pool</hi> into England; who upon his arrival was delivered to the Tower; but his life not toucht until the King lay a dying; then he equivocated his Vow by a Mental Reservation, enjoyning his son after his death to cut off his head; which was done when he came to be King, and was held some taint to them both; though the son held himself acquit &amp; warranted by the example of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was made the instrument of such another subtil slaughter by his father <hi>David,</hi> that thought he kept himself by equivocation: examples not to be imitated by any Christian Prince, being a sin; and sins are to be avoided, not imitated.</p>
