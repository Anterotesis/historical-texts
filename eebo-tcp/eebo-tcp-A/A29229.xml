            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Our Famous and ever-living <hi>Chaucer,</hi> having in his <hi>Knight's Tale</hi> expressed the sweet Comical passages of constant Love, covertly shadowed under the persons of <hi>Palamon</hi> and <hi>Arcite</hi> Corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in their Love to <hi>Emely:</hi> Our merry Host, infinitely delighted with the Pleasure of that Story, desires to have these Tales continued, as the Task was at first by him contrived.</p>

               <hi>Unbokled is the male, &amp;c.</hi>
            </l>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:46879:5"/>
none should be so unsociably retired, as to ingross his Conceits to himself, and not have them discovered.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Now telleth Sir Monke, &amp;c.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>He gives the Monk pre-eminence; but the drunken Miller admits of no such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence: his Drink frees him from all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick reverence.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>But in Pilates voice he began to crie,</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>And swore,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>Here he describes to life the humor of a Drunkard; Fearful Oaths are ever the overflows of full Pots.</p>

               <hi>—Tell on a devil way</hi>
            </l>

               <hi>Thou art a fool, thy wit is overcome.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Wherein the Host discovers his anger, and in a passionate manner gives way to his humor.</p>

            <l>
               <hi>That I am dronke,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>The Miller makes strong Liquor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, purposely to procure more attention, and incur less offence: For true was his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation in Assayes of this nature:</p>
            <l>
               <hi>In telling tales, unless the truth we smother,</hi>

            </l>
            <p>Right cautious are we then to be of the nature and humor of the hearer, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use him, before we disclose our selves unto him.</p>

            </l>
            <p>Like a true Ale-stake, he tels you where the best Ale is; and this was made good long ago, as may appear by that overworn Proverb,</p>

               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>He proceeds to the Argument of his Tale, in these words,</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46879:6"/>
               <hi>For I woll tell a Legende and a Life</hi>

               <hi>Both of a Carpenter and his wife</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>This is the Subject which must give life to his Tale: But entring into more free dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Lightness of the Carpenter's Wife, and the Carpenter's disgrace, he is interrupted by the Reve in these words,</p>
            <l>
               <hi>The Reve answered and said stint thy clap,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>This Reve being of the same Profession, cannot endure to hear a Carpenter defam'd upon any condition. He taxeth him for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such infamy on mens Wives.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Whose spotless Honour is their highest treasure,</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>This dronken Miller spake ful sone agen</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And said, leve brother Dswold,</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>Who hath no wife is no Cockold.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>He proves that the Husband's <hi>Crest</hi> is in his Wifes <hi>Curtsie;</hi> and to allay his fury, he confesseth freely that there are many good Wives, amongst which, the Reve's
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46879:6"/>
Wife may be one, for ought he knows of.</p>
            <l>

            <l>
               <hi>I woll beleve that I am none.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This agrees well with that Tenet, which applied seasonably, may afford a soveraign Receipt to Jealousie: It is better to be one, and think him none, than to be none, and think him one. The old Bard could sing as much:</p>

               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Than he who ne'xe was one, yet thinks him one.</hi>

            <p>An excellent Rule of direction, including a twofold Precept. First, Not to pry too curiously into the secret Cabinet of God's Divine Will. Secondly, Not to be too jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously inquisitive after the Actions of his Wife. For the former, as it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of too daring presumption; so the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of weakness and indiscretion.</p>

Here our ingenious <hi>Chaucer</hi> displays the Frontless boldness of a Rustick. On he will go with his Tale in spite of all opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the end, our Poet, out of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and free-bred Modesty, as one doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, lest some passages might offend the chast ear of a modest hearer, he directs him to other historical Tales, plenteously stored with singular Precepts of Morality; which, together with his own Apology, he expresseth in these Lines, and so weaves up his Prologue.</p>

            <p>It giveth no less life than probable light to any Story, to make mention of the Place, Person, Profession, with other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances concurring. This induced our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et here, as elsewhere throughout all his Tales, to express such a place where his Scene is formed, such persons to whose condition his Discourse is fitted, with all such passages, by which the conceipt of the Reader might become artfully entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, his expectance pleasantly deceived, and the Plot at which he aimed, and by which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46879:8"/>
he was directed, cunningly closed. You are to observe then, that the Scene here, is laid in <hi>Oxford;</hi> in which Shire, our Poet was born and educated, and by <hi>Rich. 2.</hi> with the Mannor of <hi>Newholme,</hi> in the same Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty endowed.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>A rich gnofe.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>A rich grub, or miserable Caitiff, as I render it; which interpretation, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and significant, I gather by the sence of that antient Metre,</p>
            <l>
               <hi>The Catiff</hi> Gnof <hi>sed to his Crue,</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>My Meney is many, my incomes but few.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This, as I conceive, explains the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's meaning; which seems no less second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that antient <hi>English</hi> Bard.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>That</hi> Gnof, <hi>that Grub, of Pesants blude,</hi>

            </l>
            <p>Howsoever, we are to suppose him to be a Lodger or Tabler of Scholars and other Artists, for their Chamber and weekly Commons; as he sheweth after.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>With him there was dwelling a poor Scholer.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This <hi>Poor,</hi> hath been an Epithete (it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46879:8"/>
seems) for Scholars in all Ages; but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for Astrologers, of which profession this Scholar was, who spend so much time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Experiments and Conclusions, and make such a pudder about <hi>Jacobs Staff,</hi> as they never leave, till they get a Scrip to't, and so make up a beggarly conclusion.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>If that men asken him in certain houres</hi>

            </l>
            <p>He professed certain (but most uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) conjectural notions of Weather, and so probably he might, having (as may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) an Almanack in his bones, by the long familiarity he had with his Hostess <hi>Alyson,</hi> the Carpenter's Wife. Howsoever; it may well appear, that albeit he could ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously prognosticate of seasons, and by turning of the Weather-cock, gather where the wind was: It was but ill wind to him; for it blew him no good.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>A chamber he had in that hostelrie,</hi>
            </l>

               <hi>Full tetously dight,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>Here he describes his Chamber and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46879:9"/>
with the privacy he enjoyed, to make his Studies more successfully fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, according to that of the Poet,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>T' improve their knowledge, those who have desire,</hi>

               </l>

            <p>Whence we may ground, that retirement is the best means for improvement of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

               <hi>Of Licores, or of any Cete wall.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Here he glanceth wittily at the delicacy or effeminate privacy of this Scholar: From whence he descendeth to the too accurate disposing or shelving of his Books, his Augur stones, with other mysterious Appendices of his seldom practis'd Art. Likewise, to his Press or Wardrobe, where his Cloaths were curiously folded, his Table with Stammel, or some other Carpet, neatly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, with his Psaltery, or Instrument of Musick hanging at his Bed-head, to give himself and the Family delightful Melody. This he fits with a Song, to make his Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick more compleat, himself more admir'd,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46879:9"/>
and his Suit by his Hostess better accepted. Thus spun our young Astrologer out his time; thus spent he his coin, the yearly Pension which his Friends allow'd him.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>This Carpenter had wedded new a wife.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>An unequal Marriage; frosty Age and Youth cannot suit together. This dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in years, begets a distraction in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: Suspicious he is of her youth, and no less conscious of his own debility; both which (like speedy harbingers) make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way for Jealousie.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>He knew not Cato: for his wit was rude,</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>That bad men wed his similitude.</hi>

            <p>This was not only the advice of <hi>Cato,</hi> but both of <hi>Pittacus,</hi> and that Cynick <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who on a time, being sollicited by a young man, for his best counsel or advice touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Marriage, wished him to go forth into the streets, where the very Children would direct him in his choice: Like will to like.</p>

               <hi>Faire was this yong wife, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>Is any Wisele her bodie gentle and small.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Here he descants on the beauty of this young Bride.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>So small her Wast, as Nature made small wast.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>So sung our modern Poet, which agrees well with his Description: He compares her body to a Weesle, of all other creatures, smallest, sleakest, and straightest. After this, he goes to describe her Apparel; which suits so well with the artless curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that time, as every Line finds out one native Ornament to grace and beautifie her Attire. Her <hi>Seint</hi> studded, or Girdle, barred with Silk; her <hi>Barm-cloath,</hi> or Partlet, as white as morrow milk; her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered <hi>Smock,</hi> her <hi>Colere</hi> of cole black Silk; the <hi>Capets</hi> or Tassels of her white <hi>Uolupere,</hi> Gorget or Stomacher, suted to the same colour; her <hi>fillet</hi> of Silk, and set full high.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And sikerly, she had a likerous eie.</hi>

The eye is called Love's Dart. A wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Eye discovers the affection of the heart. It seldom roams abroad, but it either takes, or is taken. What an <hi>Index</hi> is to a Book, is the Eye to the mind.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Full small ipulled were her brows two,</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>And they were bent, and black as any slo.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>The Brow is the Beacon of Fancy. A bent Brow implies a soveraignty or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Affection. A black brow, constancy of resolution.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>She was moch more blisful for to see,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Then is the new Perigenet tree,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>Here he sets forth the Amiableness of her person in sundry proper and familiar resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances; wherein first, he Metonemically compares the cheerfulness of her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the <hi>Peregenet-tree,</hi> for the fruit of that Tree. Secondly, The softness of her Skin, and tenderness of flesh, being that <hi>Euryale</hi> praised in her <hi>Ulysses,</hi> to <hi>Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wool;</hi> the Lustre of her complexion to <hi>Danaes Tower;</hi> the clearness of her voice to a <hi>Swallow;</hi> her nimbleness to a <hi>Kid;</hi> the sweetness of her breath to <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>

or <hi>Methe,</hi> or <hi>Apples laid in hay;</hi> her wantonness to a <hi>Colt;</hi> her goodly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and presence, to a <hi>Maste;</hi> her straightness, to a <hi>Bolt.</hi> From these, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends to such Ornaments as she usually wore; which (no doubt) received more grace from her, than she from them. With a Broch as broad as the Boss of a Buckler, was she adorned; with shoes or Sandals la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: In a word, she was a <hi>Primrose,</hi> a peerless Paragon, a <hi>Pigges nye,</hi> a Bedfellow for any Lord, a Spouse for a good Yeoman. All this is so fully, freely, and familiarly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by him, as it shall need no farther il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration.</p>

               <hi>While that her husband was at Oseney.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Opportunity is the Bay or Port of Fancy; many storms and billows did this amorous Scholar incessantly suffer; sundry rubs and oppositions did he encounter; before Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity wafted him to this long-expected harbour. <hi>At Oseney;</hi> an ancient Abbey, distant scarce half a mile west from <hi>Oxford;</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46879:11"/>
seated in a Vale no less fruitful, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, whose very Bels were formerly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, in our old English Catches. To this <hi>Oseney</hi> was our Carpenter gone, leaving his Inmate Astronomer at home, to turn over his Books, and try whether the Sign were in <hi>Aries</hi> or no. Much water goes by the Mill, which the Miller little knows on; and some Chips must be cut by the Scholar, which our Carpenter little wots on. To be short, as Fancy cannot endure to be long; Our youthful Boorder boords his amorous Hostess, and that so familiarly, as it requires a Curtain, for the love of Modesty. Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate are his Enter-breaths; affectionate his Protests; intimate his Love; desperate his Life; if he may not enjoy what he seems only to love, and without which, he desires not any longer to live. But relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less she seems, howsoever she means.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>She said, I woll not kiss thee by my faie,</hi>

How far will some young Wenches seem from taking, when they are most taken? What a weak kind of wrestling they will use? What an easie resistance they will make? What a pattering with their Lips, as if they would cry out?</p>
            <l>

               <hi>That she her love granted him at last.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This argued our Hostess <hi>Alysons</hi> good Nature, who would not be won by violence, but by a more easie and affectionate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. She confirms her self his, and swears by <hi>S.

               <hi>Alyson</hi>'s consent quickens <hi>Nicholas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: it rests now, that he contrive some plot, that he may with more conveniency branch the Carpenter's Pate. She accords to his device, and gives way to whatsoever he shall work. This, as it was their first amorous encounter, they express their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love in Lip-labour, hopeful promises of a succeeding favour: So the Poet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Who knows not, Lips are gates to those that woo?</hi>

               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>This Curtsie he requites with a pleasant new Tune on his Psaltery. Thus cheers she his Lip with her Kiss, he, her Ear with his Melody.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Than fell it thus, that to the parish Cherch</hi>

Here he turns aside from the former sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he had in hand, and enters into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discourse; wherein, he first tels you of our Hostess repair to the Church; but in so trim and neat a dress, as by all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty she resorts rather to see and be seen, than hear and be taught; for fashion, than devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Afterwards, he descends to speak of the beauteous feature, and curious attire of the Parish-Clerk, <hi>Absolon.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>
               <hi>Now was there of the chirch a parish clerke,</hi>

               <hi>Troule was his heer,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>In this description he glanceth at the pride of the Clergy; shewing how vanity began to strut within the Wals of a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. For if a poor Parish-Clerk must be so curiously dressed, as to have his hair curled, and so womanishly disheveled, his eyes so effeminately pilled, his shooes artificially carved, and in all points so completely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred; what may we think of those, whose Revenues were greater, places high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and whose persons, in the eye of the world, more popular? Such Poets, these
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46879:13"/>
corrupter times require, to tax our Clergy boldly, where such who should be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Practicers and Professors of humility, become too much Admirers of Apish Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and too serious followers of these sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Vanity.</p>
            <p>But such witty Evasions have some of these, as I never see any of them, but they put me in mind of the pregnant and present Answer of that <hi>Sprusado</hi> to a <hi>Judge</hi> in this Kingdom, a rigid Censor of mens habits; who seeing a neat Finical Divine come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in a Cloak lined through with <hi>Plush,</hi> thus encountred him: Sir, <hi>You never read that</hi> Paul <hi>ever went in a Plush Cloak.

            <p>An excellent description of a Parish Clark; it seems he was a jovial boy; and left his too loose or irregular conversation might bring him to a deprivation, and so exclude him from the benefit of his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he initiates himself sufficiently in other Trades: He can play the Barber-surgeon, in cases of necessity; and keep a dancing School to shew feats of his activity; he can play the Musician too, and make Taverns and Tap-houses resound with his melody.</p>

            <p>A fit person for such a personal employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46879:14"/>
He carries a Censer for <hi>Cupid's</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. Many Objects he eies; sundry amiable presentments he views; yet comparing them with this matchless <hi>Alyson,</hi> he holds them all inferiour beauties below compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And Absolon his Geterne had itake</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>For Paramours he thought for to wake,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And forth he gooth jolly and amerous</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Till he came to the Carpenters hous.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Long and tedious had this task been to <hi>Absolon,</hi> had he bestow'd it upon his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Love's watchful eyes may be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared to those three <hi>Hesperian</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; their Portels are never closed, but ever vigilant to prevent an intrusive Rival. Now are we to suppose him mounting the Carpenter's Wall, where, directly under the beauteous <hi>Alyson's</hi> window, who lay closely locked in the unweldy arms of her jealous husband: He chants out some amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Roundelay, to which he tunes his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious Gittern. Long had he not warbled in this manner, till the Carpenter awakes out of his Leaden slumber.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46879:15"/>
               <hi>This Carpenter awoke, and heard him sing,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And spake unto his wife, and said anon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>What Alyson, heres thou not Absolon,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>Hourly fears, daily frights, and incessant cares beget broken sleeps, short rests, and disquiet dreams. The Carpenter's head lay on so hard a pillow, being, as he thought, stuft with horn-shavings, as his sleeps could not be long. He awakes his <hi>Alyson,</hi> who, perhaps, was awake before he call'd her.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And she answered her husband there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Yes God wote John, I here it every dele.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Notably did he express the effects of Fancy, who sung thus;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Th' Effects of pow'rful love, do best appear,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>When passion feeds the Eye, and fils the Ear.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>How our <hi>Alyson's</hi> affection was seated, or her senses sated, might hence be proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gathered: Like a second <hi>Dulcina,</hi> she seeming slept, but did not sleep; heard, yet would not hear. A favourable Gloss would interpret thus: She was loath to disquiet her diseased husband, or put a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46879:15"/>
disgrace on this amorous Clark; this (as may be well imagined) begot in her a resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved silence. Nor will <hi>Absolon,</hi> though he receive small comfort in his suit, omit the least opportunity for <hi>Alyson's</hi> sake. He wooeth her incessantly, walks all the night long constantly, kembs his Locks curiously, price and prayer intercede for him power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, he vows to become her servant (in those daies a rare kind of Complement) he quavers in his musical Aires melodiously, he sends her Pyment, Methe, Wafers, and choicest Spices, to win her love with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents of delicacy; he shews her proofs of his Activity, and in Theatral actions personates <hi>Herod</hi> in his Majesty.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>But what availeth him, as in this caas</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>She loved so, this hende Nicholas</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>That Absolon may blow the Bucks horne</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>All his labour is but in vain; fruitless are all these tasks; to no purpose his late watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. These are but as if he striv'd to make the Blackamore white: This our Poet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms with an usual Proverb in those daies.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:46879:16"/>
               <hi>Full sooth is this Proverb, it is no lye,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Men say right thus, alway the night flie</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>Maketh the ferre leafe.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>As if he should say, Daily company pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth holiday love. <hi>Absolon</hi> hath too strong a Corrival of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to prevail in his purchase. Long familiarity strengthened with domestick acquaintance, hath so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cemented their affections, as all this trim Clark's Rhetorick cannot dissolve it. Now is it high time for them to address them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for their project.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And so bifell it on a Saterdaie</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>This Carpenter was gone to Osnaie.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>It may seem that he was Carpenter to the Abbey, by his usual resort thither: as sundry other Artificers were constantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and by a yearly Pension tied, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair any such ruines or decaies, as casually befel in the Abbey.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>This Nicholas no lenger would tarie,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>But doeth full soft unto his chamber carie</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Both meat and drink</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicholas</hi> becomes his own Purveior, and has now betaken himself to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46879:16"/>
to devise some plot to deceive the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, and possess him of his dearest Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Private he must be; and retired, and as one with an extasie surprized, lie gaping as if he were Planet-struck. Directions to this purpose are given to his <hi>Alyson,</hi> that the Plot may draw on to a fairer conclusion. All <hi>Saturday Nicholas</hi> mues himself up in his Chamber, where he bestows the day in his repast or repose; and so continues on in this his pleasant restraint till <hi>Sunday</hi> night: Which long restraint of <hi>Nicholas</hi> Liberty, drives our simple Carpenter into a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perplexity.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>This selie Carpenter hath great merbeile</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Of Nicholas, or what thing might him eile,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And saied: I am a drad by S. Thomas</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>It stondeth not aright with Nicholas.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>He is now grown as jealous of <hi>Nicholas</hi> life, as he was before of his <hi>Alyson's</hi> Love. First, By falling into consideration of Man's frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he fears that he died suddenly: And this he holds more probable, by recalling to mind a Spectacle of Mortality which he had lately seen.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:46879:17"/>
               <hi>I saw to day a corse born to cherche</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>That now on monday last I saw him werche.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This confirms him in his fear: Longer he will not debate the matter; forthwith he must be resolv'd what is become of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> of whose safety he becomes so suspicious. One then must be directed, and sent to his Chamber, to see what is acted.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Go up (qd he unto his knave) anone</hi>
            </l>

               <hi>Cleape at his dore, &amp; knock fast with a stone.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>On goes this rude Usher, to observe his Master's command: He cries shrilly, knocks stoutly, presseth him to answer boldly; but <hi>Nicholas,</hi> as one taken with a Fit of Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, resolves him with silence. At last, lest he should leave his Master still in suspence, and so procure his displeasure, he seeks about till he finds an hole or passage, where a Cat us'd to creep in; where he pries like a Cat for a Mouse.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46879:17"/>
               <hi>Till at the last he had of him a sight,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>This Nicholas sate gaping ever upright,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>As he had keyked on the new mone.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Here plays <hi>Nicholas</hi> the part of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Astronomer; and h'as one trick above <hi>Ela,</hi> wherein none of all his fellow-consorts or Astronomical Professants can ever come near him: For he by help of his prospective glass, can distinctly and apparently discover all the starry Regiment quite through the Roof of his Chamber. Howsoever, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he <hi>gapes</hi> for some preferment, or else to make an Asterisme of his mouth, where some Constellation or other may certainly fix. This could not chuse but beget a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful amazement in this pitiful Spy.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Adowne he goeth, &amp; tolde his maister sone</hi>

               <hi>In what aray he saw this ylke man.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This increased the number of his distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fears, as may appear by the sequel: for presently upon return of this sad relation,</p>
            <l>
               <hi>This Carpenter to blissen him began</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And said: now helpe us seynt Frideswide.</hi>

            <p>A Saint in those daies usually invoked,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46879:18"/>
when any one was either blasted, bewitched, or by a spirit haunted. Divers are his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of <hi>Nicholas;</hi> sometimes he thinks that his much study hath made him mad; other sometimes, that he labours of some other Malady, &amp; that now he is struck into a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Extasie, which requires some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent remedy. Amidst these various doubts and distempered fears, far more wisely than could be well expected from the conceipt of such an Head-piece, he imputes the cause of this distemper to his too curious search or enquiry after Gods Secrets.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>I thought aye well how it should be,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Men shoulden not know of Gods pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vete</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>This he confirms with a late Accident.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Right so fer'de another clerk with astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi>

            </l>
            <p>
               <hi>Columella</hi> observes, that man of all other Creatures, hath one Muscle to erect his Eye
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46879:18"/>
upward, whereas others are depressed, and haled downward; yet this was not given him to eye that which is concealed from him. We are so to admire the Creature, as in it we adore the Creator: We are so to bestow the Eye of our outward man, as we darken not our inward light: For by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Eyes too intentively on Objects of Secrecy, we may justly fear, lest we should be consumed by the Beams of his Glory. It is a good Lesson which that Sage so seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously recommended to his Scholars; <hi>Be not wise overmuch; lest ye become ignorant in that which you should know most.</hi> But little needed our Carpenter fear the depth of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his Astronomer. A better course therefore he resolves of; and that is to cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel him out of his humor, and so cure this threatning distemper.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Get me a staffe.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Madness must be cured by Correction, and spare Diet. Spare, did the Carpenter think, were <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s Commons; albeit, he had better provision in his Knap-sack, than he knew of. He means therefore to correct his humour on the one side with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46879:19"/>
Bombasting, as the Patient on the other side had practised on himself by Fasting.</p>
            <l>

               <hi>And to the chamber dore he gan him dresse.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Though <hi>Nicholas</hi> might justly commence an action of forcible Entry against his unruly Host, where he was Farmer, during the Lease of his Chamber; seeing his door rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the Hasps, his deep studies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed, his Astronomical slumber disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, and all things topsie-turvy turned, yet would not he budge a foot, but like one made up in Wainscot,</p>
            <l>
               <hi>This Nicholas sate as still as any stone,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And ever gaped upward into the eire</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>This troubles <hi>John</hi> Carpenter more than all the rest; who verily thinks that he is either fallen into despair, and therefore, like a discreet Monitor, puts him in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of some devout meditation, by awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him from that Lethargy or amazed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction. Or else, that he is forespoken, or blasted by some ill Spirit, which makes him use his Charm to cure this mischance.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>Scarcely could <hi>Nicholas</hi> keep his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, when he heard the Carpenter run so glib with his Spels: But having indent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his Face, not to blush, with his Eye, to look up, and his Tongue, to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46879:20"/>
mute; with a constant boldness, a fixt ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedness, and a resolved silence, he performs his Plot, that at night he may enjoy his Place.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And at the last this hende Nicholas</hi>
            </l>

            <l>
               <hi>Shall all this world be lost?</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Now is <hi>Nicholas</hi> awak'd out of his Trance, and to the Carpenter's great grief, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers what he has seen in his Astronomical Dream. Which, at first, his Host seems to slight, wishing him to <hi>think on God.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>
               <hi>This Nicholas answered, fetch me drinke,</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>Of certain things, that toucheth the and me.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Though <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s Vision was moist, his mouth was dry; down goes the Carpenter to quench the Astronomer's thirst; and now returning with a large Quart of mighty Ale, that might compare with <hi>Stingo,</hi> for it would <hi>cut a Feather,</hi> they toss'd the Cannikin lovingly one to another: Which done, and having set the Carpenter by him;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46879:20"/>
               <hi>Nicholas</hi> begins; yet before he has well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his sad Story, the door being first shut, he solemnly swears his Host to keep counsel in a secrecy of such high conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for should he discover what he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, his light discovery would be throughly revenged.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Nay Christ it forbid for his holy bloode,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Qd tho this sely man, I am no blabbe</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>Now he begins to give better ear to this heavy relation; and vows to be secret, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any condition.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Now John (qd Nicholas) I woll not lye</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>I have yfounden in mine Astrologye</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>A deep red Youth, and such an one as will not stick to belie his knowledge, rather than want Admirers. Amongst those then may he be well numbred, who pretend a familiar knowledge to all the Houses of Heaven, and yet can scarce pay house-rent for their own. See how his Banks over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow! He discovers the time of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Deluge to a minute. The Rain which fell at <hi>Noah's</hi> Flood, was but an <hi>April</hi> shower to this Inundation: Within one hour
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46879:21"/>
must the whole World be drowned, only those few saved, which by his rare and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Art are preserved. The weakly-credulous Carpenter believes him; having never seen the <hi>Bow</hi> in the <hi>Cloudes,</hi> or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard for what <hi>Token</hi> of <hi>Covenant</hi> it was given.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Thus shall mankind drenche, and lese her life,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>This carpenter answered and said, alas my wife!</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And shall she drenche? Alas mine Aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soun</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>There is nothing perplexeth him so much as the loss of his dear <hi>Alyson.</hi> Pity it were, thinks he, that so prety a Morsel of flesh should go the way of all Fish. So as never till now begins he to provide for his own safety, Wife, and Family.</p>
            <l>—<hi>Is there no remedy in this caas?</hi>
            </l>
            <p>As if he should say, Alas, my learned Guest <hi>Nicholas,</hi> must we be all meat for Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docks? No remedy? no means of safety? 'Las, for my self I care not so much; for I have the one foot i'th grave already; I am
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46879:21"/>
not a man long for this world: But that my <hi>Alyson,</hi> who is in the very flower and prime of her time, the very Daisie and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-suckle of her time, that she should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Provender for a Sea-horse, or lodge in the Guts of a Whale, it would make any ones heart yern within him, that has any man's blood in him. Besides, for her Age, she may have many pretty <hi>Chips</hi> when I am gone. O then, good Guest <hi>Nicholas,</hi> provide for her safety, if not for mine. Who knows not, but if you two can agree, she may be meat for you, when I am Worms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat. Thus might the poor Carpenter seem to have expostulated with his learned Astronomer; as one desirous to receive some small comfort from this profound Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, which might minister a remedy in cases of such urgent necessity: and afford to his <hi>Alyson</hi> (whom he preferred before all his Family) some promising hopes of safety.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Is there no remedy?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Yes, yes, full good (go hende Nicholas)</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Now begins he to lay his Lime-twigs more cunningly: He gives the deluded Carpenter directions how to prevent this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46879:22"/>
imminent danger: He repeats unto him the story of <hi>Noah's</hi> deliverance. Nothing is to be undertaken rashly, without serious advice and deliberation; yet in regard both of the apparency aand imminency of that danger, he adviseth him to take some speedy course, that the peril may be seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably prevented, and their safeties procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>This asketh hast, and of an hasty thing</hi>

            </l>
            <p>Here must the Carpenter be sent his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand: He must provide Materials for his security. Though every Tub be to stand upon his own bottom, every one must not strike on his own Tub. Thus is this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter appointed to become Purveyor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this great Deluge. And Love makes all tasks light; for, not the fear of death, but the Love of his dear <hi>Alyson,</hi> which he preferred before his own life, quickens his wind-gall'd feet, to prevent all occasion of fear. But this dark and mysterious Artist
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46879:22"/>
               <hi>Nicholas,</hi> adviseth him withal, that in no case he discover this secresie, either to his man <hi>Robin,</hi> or his maid <hi>Gille;</hi> for they are barred by name from all hope of safety: Neither is it sitting that he should be too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive touching Gods privacies, touching the preservation of some, and subversion of others. Let it suffice him, that these means are provided for the deliverance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his <hi>Alyson.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>
               <hi>Go now thy way.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>The Troughs now are to be provided, and sufficiently victualled, with Hatchets to cut them down from the roof where they are to be tied, when the Flood hath once entred. A passage too must be made for these marvellous Barges through the main Wall into the Garden.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Than shalt thou swim as mery I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi>

            </l>
            <p>A proper and familiar comparison. Two especial inducements there were which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this careful Carpenter to address him to his laborious Task: The first was, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.

The Second, Soveraignty.</p>

               <hi>Light is that Labour which may safety bring,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>In doubtful acts, fear's an ingenious thing.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>That the Carpenter likewise aspired to Soveraignty, might be probably gathered by that comfortable hope of an universal Monarchy, which <hi>Nicholas</hi> suggested to him.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And than we shall be Lordes all our life</hi>

               <hi>Of all the world, as was Noe and his wife.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This sets the Carpenter upon his Panto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles; while the Learned Clerk <hi>Nicholas</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth him by all means, that when every one is to enter into their Roof-trough or Kimelyn, none speak one to another, but with a constant and reserved silence remain as still as the Night. <hi>John</hi> must not speak to his <hi>Alyson,</hi> nor <hi>Alyson</hi> to her <hi>John.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, these Kneading Tubs must be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by equal distance one from another. Thus is the Plot contrived, and no less suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefully continued. The Carpenter's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity promiseth a fair issue to this Torrent of Astronomy.</p>

            </l>
            <p>Love will creep where it cannot go. Dark and straight is that Crany, through which Love cannot find out a way. By this, you may collect, how the Carpenter hath his Commission sealed, his Pasport granted, and all things facilitated for so terrible an Occurrent.</p>
            <l>

            </l>
            <p>Notwithstanding his great hast, he will take so much time, as to impart this Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his dearest <hi>Alyson;</hi> who, as she was known to the Plot, conjures him by all those Professions of Love which he had ever vow'd her, to follow the Advice of their Learned Guest: She cunningly aggravates all those seeming occasions of Fear, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46879:25"/>
wrought strongly enough already on the Carpenter's Imagination, so as it little need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any re-impression.</p>

            <p>Such strange effects works a possessed fear. He considers not the improbability of this Relation, but seemingly apprehends the present approach of this Fanatical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, with all those menacing dangers which accompany it: Yet must not this fear foreslow, but accelerate his dispatch. The three Tubs are provided, Victuals purveyed, and these necessary Store-houses in the Roof reared. Besides, that all things might be with more secrecy carried, <hi>Robin</hi> and <hi>Gylle</hi> are removed, and to <hi>London</hi> upon a sleeveless Errand directed.</p>

stalks they might climb into their Tubs: Where, with a constant and continued si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, they lay closely immured; while the Carpenter lay trembling and shaking, hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expecting this fearful Inundation: But <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Alyson</hi> ever thirsting and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Carpenter's good rest, that with the active joyes of Love they might seal their Affection. The Carpenter applies himself to his Devotion, as if he and all the world were near their dissolution; But these two amorous souls pray for nothing more, than his rest, and their recreation.</p>

            <p>The many employments to which this Carpenter stood engaged, had with a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Medley of Cares and Fears so over-wearied him, that as one now resolved to sleep out that small scantling of time which is left him, about Cock-crow he bids a silent good-night to Learned <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Alyson.</hi>
            </p>

            </l>
            <p>As this Feat was by both equally plotted, so are they now in the conclusion mutually pleased. The Carpenter's Age enjoyes more rest than their youth. Let night's sable Curtain enskreen these dark actions. Lust's Palace hath but very few minutes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting solace. They may sate Sense for a time, but never satisfie Reason with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited touch.

He conjectures by the itching of his mouth, that he shall be graced at least with a Kiss; which prediction he found most true, as you shall read in the Tale hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

And these were the Subjects of his Dreams. In the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous discoursing and discussing whereof, he sets this up for his Rest: He will go sleep an hour or two, that he may more ably turn Night-walker, or more properly, Eave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropper.

daintily trimmed and tressed, under his Tongue a <hi>true-love</hi> Flower couched, to make his Designs more auspicious, himself to his Love more gracious. Up to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter's house he hyeth, where he stayeth, and sueth.</p>

            <p>How this dapper youth melts with Love! His amorous Oration is all Honey and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon: He cals her his Honey-comb, and she makes him her Coxcomb. Then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends to speak of that uncessant anguish of mind that he suffers. Like a Lamb after his Dam goes he bleating; like a Turtle for his Mate waits he mourning: as a Maid without meat sits he fasting; yet for all this, like a Calf she discards him.</p>

contrary to his expectance. She prefers the Stars before the Quire. Her <hi>Nicholas</hi> she enwreaths and enjoyes; mean time let the poor Quirister chant his humming Catch to the Seven Stars: Let him cool his Toes in Moonshine, while she is rid of him she loaths, and enjoys him she loves. Yet, lest <hi>Absolon</hi> should be numbred among those weak woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who relinquish their Suit upon the first repulse, he rears his Battery, though with a more easie sollicitancy, than he did at first.</p>

            <p>He remembers, it seems, the presage of his <hi>itching lips;</hi> the height of his amorous Ambition is now confin'd to a Kiss. All his Night-labour is now brought to Lip-labour. Which Suit our beauteous <hi>Alyson,</hi> in meer compassion, rather than any affection to his person, thus answers,</p>

Small favours would not be neglected, because they may be Introductions to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Curtsies when occasion is offered. Mean time <hi>Absolon</hi> prepares his Cynamon mouth for a tast of an unsavoury Curtsie. He takes his corporal Oath of his constant fidelity, and makes <hi>Alyson's Posteriora's</hi> the Book he swears by. Whence observe, with what intollerable petulancy she jeers the poor Cloysterer! All this while, you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, <hi>Nicholas</hi> slept not; but heard this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward Dialogue, after his long wished, wooed, and now enjoyed amorous encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

            <p>The Worm will turn again. Poor <hi>Absolon</hi> thus abused, of his sleep deprived, casts about in his mind how he may be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. He cannot endure to sit down with this wrong: his Fancy is now changed into a Frenzy; his Love to Revenge. Many had he serv'd, yet was he never so answered; many had he lov'd, yet never so rewarded; many had he kist, yet never any Lip that so relished. His Passion in the end works it self into a vertuous compassion.</p>

            <p>What rare Effects will the apprehension of a conceived disgrace produce?

Stronger is his desire, than his conceit; yet becomes that so quickned by passion, as now he assaies to execute, what his doubtful Imagination hath so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral waies projected.

general inundation, that he should stand in need of some of it to cool his inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But no sooner had he sent forth this pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful clamour, than the poor Carpenter, who lay snorting all this while in his suspended Trough, and had taken more rest though less pleasure, than his Guest, began to rouse himself out of his slumber; and fearing the imminency of danger, with his axe he smites the Cord in two, by which his kimelin or Tub was tyed; that so he might by a passage purposely made through his Garden, slice the depths, and so lanch into the Main Ocean.</p>

This were they enforced, for peace sake, to condescend to, being neither willing to incur his Displeasure, nor cross the Fury of his incorrigible humor. This merry Relation changeth the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Admiration into Laughter; they jeer the lame Carpenter, and by their light Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity vindicate two Wantons from disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Though he vow and swear, they have vowed not to hear. That Beast of many heads will not credit this Beast of one head. They applaud the Jest, and asperse on him the disgrace.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Alyson</hi> cheared, <hi>Nicholas</hi> cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Absolon</hi> revenged, <hi>John</hi> the Carpenter gulled, and the Spectators infinitely pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor is it to be doubted, but if this Accident had not hapned, <hi>Nicholas</hi> or <hi>Aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> would have found one trick or other, to have deluded the Carpenter, enjoyed their Pleasure, and evaded Danger. And none in my judgment more probable than this; to wit, that when this supposed Deluge had

not come according to the time limited, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> out of a dissembled Zeal, would have pretended, how by the incessancy of his Prayers, Heaven's wrath was appeased, their Cataracts stopped, and this universal Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow till an other season stayed. Howsoever, by the sweet Harmony which all this Family afterwards enjoyed, as may be charitably supposed, our Comment upon this Tale shall be in these Verses finally closed.</p>

            <p>This <hi>English Homer,</hi> our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Chaucer,</hi> here brings in an antient Wife of <hi>Bath,</hi> with an Old Wives Tale, yet not so old as true, seeing her own <hi>Experience</hi> had confirm'd, whatsoever her tongue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd: wherein she draws the first occasion of her discourse, from the griefs which accompany a Married life; being either weary of their present choice, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affecting change; or being depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their choice, brings upon them new
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46879:35"/>
discontents, by an untowardly change. Then she discourseth of the number of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands which she had since her Twelve years of Age. Wherein, she presseth an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against such, as held opinion against By gamy.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>That sithen Christ went never but onis</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>To wedding, in the Cane of Galilee</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>As if she should say, albeit Christ, who honoured Marriage with the very first Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that ever he wrought upon Earth, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went to any Wedding but once, and that in <hi>Cane</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> will you hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we are never to marry more than once, and so exclude Bigamy? So might you infer (upon like consequence) because Christ never scourged Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple but once, nor was tempted in the Desart (for ought we read) but once, nor wept over <hi>Hierusalem</hi> more than once, that neither sacrilegious Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists are more than once to be scourged, nor temptation more than once to be suffered, nor tears of compassion more than once to be tendred. Nay, to refell this erroneous Opinion, which, even some of the antient
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46879:36"/>
Fathers of the primitive Church have with too much pertinacy held, this good old wife of <hi>Bath</hi> hath an Argument in store for her own purpose, which she borrows from the very Touchstone of Truth, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>—Iesu god and man</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Spake in represe of the Samaritan'</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Thou hast had five husbands—</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Whence she proves, that in those daies there was no such restraint, but that it was usual and lawful for any one to marry after the Decease of their Husband: Albeit, we find it commended by Apostolical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and recommended to Posterity, That those only were to be honoured for Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, who were Widows indeed. True it is, that in this place here alledged by our Wife of <hi>Bath,</hi> this <hi>Samaritan</hi> was reproved, not for that she had married five Husbands, but for that after their Deaths, she had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her self to one who was not her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; with whom, till then, she had lived without remorse of Conscience in all Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence. Albeit, that any one should be restrained to a prescript number either of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46879:36"/>
Wives or Husbands, it was yet never heard. Not to insist therefore upon the difficulty of the Text, nor to play Schole-Divine, which would ill beseem one of her Sex, she makes use of a Text far more easie and proper for her purpose.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>But well I wote expresse without lie</hi>
            </l>

            <l>
               <hi>That gentill Text can I well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stond</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>She could find in her heart to multiply in Husbands as well as Children. One of the Ends of Marriage she observes, and this she embraceth with so free admittance, as her Age must not deprive her of hope to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: Husbands therefore she holds neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Associates in all Ages, as well for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation as Procreation; being for their Love to leave whatsoever they most tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love. Parental Love is excluded, where Wedlock is admitted. Neither Bigamy, nor Octogamy (if Wives become their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Survivers) are to be questioned. The last is no sooner committed to earth, than a new one is to be sought for on earth. Love and Youth, no nor Age, if it have a Colts
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46879:37"/>
tooth, can converse with Ghosts and Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins. This she confirms by Instance.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Lo he the wise king Salamon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>

            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>As would God it leful were to me</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>To be refreshed halfe so ofte as he.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>She holds it an honour to encrease in this Number; and by variety to allay sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Whence, she reflects upon her own former estate, and highly joys in her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of choyce.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Blessed be God, I have had five</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Of which I have pyked out the best</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>Both of their nether purse, and eke their Chest.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>She provides her self of a Husband to fit every sense, that she might more sensibly enjoy what she did by all likelihood most affect. That she might attain the end, she neglects not the means: No Procreation without Action. She holds it fit therefore to share in his Ability of Person, as well as Fortune. And because Practice begets Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, she loves ever to be in ure: She finds far more Advantage in dispatch, than
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46879:37"/>
delay; Her old Husband must no sooner be dispatch'd, than a new one must be catch'd: Thus is she ever mated and matched.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Of five husbands scolynge am I</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Welcome the sixte when ever he shall dy.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>The thought is taken: All flesh is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but of all flesh, she would have none more mortal than her husbands. She would ever have her aged Husband look like Death's-head; mean time, her sage Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions are never wanting, to bid him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his end. Life is but a Trouble; but of all others, she is most troubled with his Life. Thus dictates she of her Husband's Pilgrimage; which, by how much the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is for her all the better. A new Change is her Royal Exchange: Nor is the Market so scarce, but she hopes to fit her turn with a new Choice. Mean time, you may hence perceive, that she would have her Husband's Life of any Stuff ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Perpetuano</hi> or <hi>Sempiternum.</hi> Like a charitable Wife, she could wish with all her heart that his Soul were at rest, while she were left to the Cares of the World and the Flesh; for both which, she would so
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46879:38"/>
seasonably provide, that as Fortune, and her late Husband's Providence had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently furnish'd her for the one, so she would take especial care that she were not famish'd in the other. This she confirms, not only with her own Opinion, but by Apostolical Doctrine.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>For than the Apostel saith, that I am fre</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>To wedde a godeshalfe, where it liketh me</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>This likewise she strengthens, to give freer scope to her own Affections, with a fresh current of new Instances.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>What recketh me though folke say vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>Of shrewd Lameth, and of his bigamy?</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>Here she makes a Rehearsal of sundry persons (and some of them antient holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob)</hi> who had divers wives: and in the end, proceeds far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, discoursing of the state of Virginity; which was recommended by way of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and no express Precept, by the Apostle; concluding:</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:46879:38"/>
               <hi>He said, thereof precept had he none</hi>

            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>But counsailing is no commaundement</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>He put it in our own judgement.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>To all which, she addeth this enforcing Reason:</p>
            <l>
               <hi>For had God commaunded maidenhede</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Then had he dampned wedding out of drede.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Virginity to have the precedency is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but not that Wedlock should be rejected. To live a Virgin is an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gift: This, she acknowledgeth, her weakness could never attain to. The use of this Doctrine therefore, she thus applies unto her self:</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And for to ben a wife, he yave me leve</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Of indulgence, so it be not to repreve</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>To wedde me, if that my make die</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Without exception of bigamie.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This Doctrine she approves, for it relish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sweetly to her Palat. Yea but hence there ariseth another Objection; It is not good to touch a woman. To which she
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46879:39"/>
answers; not inordinately or licentiously:</p>
            <l>
               <hi>For peril is, both fire and tow to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>It is good for young Folk to avoid occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for it is that which breeds a Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Fire of Fancy needs no Oyl to inflame it, nor any other Fewel to feed it, than Opportunity, which never comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invited. True it is (saith she) that many there are who can live Maidens all their daies; and these prefer Chastity before any man's Society: And much good may it do them. For my own part, I find no such strength in my self; my Frailty requires a Fellow-helper.</p>

            <p>Some of our antient Fathers have compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Virginity to Gold, Continence to Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Both of excellent esteem, albeit the former incomparably to be preferred before the later. But all have not the gift of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, I mean, of Virgin-purity. Many things are in holy Writ unto our Observance offered and recommended, which are not expressly observed. Other things there are by express Precept to some more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally commended and commanded, whereof others may seem to be freed and exempted, at least, not so straitly injoyned.</p>

There was nothing made in vain, much less that main and principal Point, without which, to this wanton wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, all the world were not worth a Point. True it is, and she confesseth it, that there have been many Saints, who have led all their Lives in perfect Chastity; and she is so far from envying their Virginity, as she highly honours their Memory; yet must they give her leave to take another course, for fear she should do worse: Their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must not be her Example.</p>

            <p>She constantly holds to her old Tenet: She was not made for a Maid. What she hath receiv'd, must be as freely us'd. She expects both her Morn and Even Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: She hopes to bestead her self of such a man, as will out of his Honesty or civil Curtsie, pay his Debt. Neither will she for her part be altogether unthankful, as he wipes off the old Score, he may begin a new.</p>

            <p>She means to fit her self of an Husband both for Ability and Conformity to please her mind. He must give her due benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and become enthralled to her service. She expects homage and fealty from him, which she means to requite with some tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation upon his Flesh. She will confirm her Affection with fresh remembrances of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Whosoever wears the Doublet, she means to wear the Breeches. This bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving humor of hers was to Life described by our modern Poet:</p>

               <l>Great's her Ambition, though her Size be small;</l>

Soveraignty she will have, and such a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering power over his captive body, as the Mare must prove the better Horse. This she makes good not only by her own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinion, nor any Fabulous Tradition, but (to her own Gloss) Apostolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Thus picks she out the Kernel, take the Shell who list. So as methinks she very nearly resembles her humor, who, like a sprightly Bride, hearing those words of Matrimony, to <hi>Serve, Obey, Love</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> so hardly digested them, as she willed the Minister to go no farther, till she had considered better of the matter: Whence the Poet, in the person of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall'd Girle;</p>

Imagining belike, that he was then answering in the person of the Child, to forsake the Devil and all his works, presently replied, <hi>I forsake them all.</hi> While the Pardoner, poor man, stands thus perplexed, fearing he need take up no

            <p>The Pardoner had thought the worst was past; but she had another Brewing for him, worse than the first; and this must have a stronger tast of the bitter Hop of Tribulation. Her own Experience, as she confesseth, had sufficiently furnished her for matter of Discourse upon the troubles and afflictions which accompany Marriage; nevertheless, for so much as most part of men are more induced by Examples than Reasons, she means to enlarge her self in that kind.</p>

            </l>
            <p>As if she should say, they were rich in Possessions, but of cold Constitutions. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was decay'd in them; they could not perform the Dues of Marriage.

            <p>They wanted not their Curtain-Lectures; being far better taught than fed. Time was indeed, when she humored their old Chops, and used all diligence to win their Love; not a good Morsel, but they had their part; but this was before they parted Stakes. The world is alter'd from what it was: They have now infeoffed her in the whole. All their Lands and Hereditaments, Estates Real and Personal, were past to her and hers for ever; insomuch, as should they have arrived to the Happiness to have surviv'd her, they could hardly recover their Thirds.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46879:46"/>
here perceive that this wife of <hi>Bath,</hi> out of her grounded Experience, like a judicious Schole-Mistress to all young married wives, begins her Lecture; where she informs them how to demean themselves in their several places.

            </l>
            <p>A twofold Exposition may be drawn from these Lines. First, If the good-wife desire to put Money in her Purse, she will pretend, for want of Grain, or some other vendible Commodity, that her Cow is run mad, and that she hath sold her to the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher for little or nothing, purposely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent danger; mean time she converts the benefit of this pretended Bargain to her self, and so cheats her Husband. Or else thus; She hath appointed a meeting with a private Friend, to whom she can well spare a Morsel, when her Husband sees not; And the place of this meeting is the Byer, or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46879:47"/>
where her Kine lie; where to prevent her Husband's Repair, and free their amorous Embraces from all suspicious Fear, she feigns her Cow to be wood, which she makes good by her Maid's Assent, who is ready to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her Dames Speech: She wills him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be wary that he come not there, lest he receive some hurt. Which Fetch is not much unlike that of hers, who desirous to do a Courtesie to a Friend, but out of all hope to get opportunity for effecting what she did so much desire; at last she remembred, how there was nothing in the world more terrible to her Husband, than a Bear; by which means she fitted her self of what she most lov'd, by affrighting him with what he most fear'd. This trick therefore she plays him, with consent of her Sweet-heart, whom she preferr'd before him. She contracts with her Friend to cover his Servant in a Bear's Skin, and tie him near to that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate place where they had appointed, and which the poor Wittal himself no less suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Up he mounts, but as quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends; for the terrible sight of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Bear drove from his memory the conceit of all other Fear, which the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatist

The first instruction she gave young Wifes, was how to Gull their Husbands, and how they were to cram their Purses with nimble cheats, or enjoy an amorous choice. Now like a domineering House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, she tells them, how they must twit their Husbands, if their Neighbours Wives goe trimmer or neater than they. As if she should say, What Sir <hi>Raynard,</hi> ye fox-skin'd Chuffe, must I come behind such a Gossip for fashion? Must I Snayl-like, keep still under roof, while thou goes a Ranging to thy Neighbour's house, and neighs after thy Neighbour's Wife? You Sir, may whisper a wanton Tale in the ear of such a Maid, and you must not be reproved? Nay Sir <hi>Lecher,</hi> you must be in all your amorous actions approved? Mean time, if I have a Gossip or a Friend, without conceit of ill, I must be chid, while you, Sir, come reeling home, upbraiding me, that I play wanton in such an house, or dishonour you in such a place. Every Ale-bench must be the Stage where you act my disgrace: where sometimes, you revile me, for my poverty; or else disparage me for my Parentage; or if my descent be above yours, you tax me

of pride, and tell me, high blood ever sparkles for good Cloathes. Sometimes my mirth mads you, otherwhiles my melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distracts you. If I be fair, my fort is half wonne, my chastity cannot hold out long; every opportunity tempts me, every light Assailant taints me. Some, you say, chuse us for Portion, others for Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; some for Beauty and outward Feature, others for Breeding and Behaviour; some for Affability, others for Agility; some for pure and dainty hands, others for small enazur'd Arms; All which, you say, are Lures to Lust, and keep the High-Road to the Devil's Court. Again, if I be foul, why then I turn common Haxter; I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want for Trading: As fair Forts are won by long Siege; so we that are foul, will rather lay siege unto others, than not be won. Spaniels are not more fawning, than we are fancying.

Doest thou think, <hi>Lorel,</hi> that to go to heaven by a Wife, is to go by Bow and not by String? Well Sir, I hope to see you go by the String, and then your way will be readier. You say, a dropping, smoaky house and a chiding wife will cause a man fly out of his house. What will a dropping Nose do, you Ice-Ickle you? You say, Wives have the Trick to dissemble and shroud their Vices, yea, and colour them too with fair Pretences, as if they were spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Vertues; But Wood that shines most, is most commonly least sound: We can find time to fit you with a Peny-worth, and make your Ears look through your Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap, after the new Fashion: And what of all this? We leave (I hope) sufficient for your queasie Stomachs, when all this is done.

Spoons, Stools, Pots, &amp; other Vessels, men use to try them, before they buy them; whereas, Wives must not be tryed, till they cannot deny it; being to be wedded before they be Bedded. Heyday! is your Spirit so Coltish? It seems, if your Judgment might pass, or stand for a Decree, you would try before you married, and so take occasion to repent before you needed. Neither will these untowardly humors content you, but they must yet run on worser Extreams. Your Doltship will not stick to say, how nothing displeaseth me more, than not to hear my Beauty praised, my less than ordinary parts admired; Nay, I am discontent forsooth, when you look not Babies in mine Eyes, and fame my Beauty in every place; Again, if you make not a solemn Feast on my Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, with preparation of Luscious Fare for your Guests, of Sumptuous Attire for my self, a free and friendly Welcom to all, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to my Nurse, whom you must that day highly honour, and the Crisp-hair'd Wag that attends me in my Chamber, with all my Fathers Folk and his Allies, you are out of my Books for ever.</p>

            <p>How is it Sir, that you sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised with your body to honour me, and with all your worldly goods to endow me, and that now with the first you dishonour me, and for the later (like a Devil in the Vault) you lock them from me? I think Sir, if it were in your power, you would lock me up in your Chest too, but that's above your cunning. Had you but so much wit in your Sage Sconce, you would rather in this sort demean your self towards me, <q>Good wife, go where you list; disport your self where you please, mine ear is open to no Tales; my knowledge hath given me that approvement of you, as I cannot sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect you.</q> For I must tell you, we women cannot endure that any one should question us where we live, or whom we love; where we gad, or when we Gossip.

This Sentence here this Goodwife useth, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to withdraw her Husband from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling in his own Estate, and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to invest her self in it. As if she should say, You Sir, that have the one Foot in the Grave already, how is it that you incumber your mind so much with things transitory? you have enough for your time; shake hands with the world, seeing the world hath now shaken hands with you. Leave the care of these Businesses to me. Neither, do I only speak this in behalf of your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Estate, but in delights of your Bed. What if another take a Shive of your cut Loaf; must this trouble you? Doubt not, Good man, but you shall have enough left to serve your turn.

            </l>
            <p>What a Racket my pretty Pigsnie keeps? Let me kiss thy tother Cheek, my lovely Honey-suckle. Can you that have preach'd so long of <hi>Job</hi>'s Patience, retain so long in your heart any Malice? Ye men, as you are stronger by nature, so should you be discreeter, and of stayeder temper. What man, are you jealous of me that you do not only enjoy me? What, would you have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46879:55"/>
my best Commodity to your self? Why, take it to you, and much good may it do you. I know you for a notable Soaker; you cannot endure a Sharer: Well, go to; you shall have it to you, and your sole use for ever. For know, my best Spouse, if I would set my Jewel at sale; I could go in more gaie and fresh Arraie than I do now: but the honest Continence of my Desire makes me walk in homelie Attire. Good sooth, you are much to be blam'd; I have no Toy, but for your Tooth. My own Breast knows best whether I love any other; For if I did, your quick Eie would soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Such maner words had we on houd</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Now wyll I speake of my fourth hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Thus far has our Wife of <hi>Bath</hi> discours'd of the Natures, Humors, and Features of her three first Husbands: Wherein she hath exprest to life how harshlie Youth and Age are suited; with especial Directions how the Distastes of a loathed Bed may be allaied; how Youthful Delights may be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46879:56"/>
wisely carried; and the waiwardness of Age better tempered.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>My fourth husband was a revelour</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>This is to say, he had a paramour.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>She is now fitted in her kind; what she feigned to be in her three Husbands before, she finds really lov'd by her fourth: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will she abate him a hair, and she gives the Reason.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>—I was yong and full of ragerie</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Stubborn and strong, and joly as a Pie.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>She was but in the Flower of her Youth, albeit, she had dispatch'd three Husbands; full of Metal and Agilitie; of a stubborn and strong Will, for it had never been deni'd her; of a pliant and nimble Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and this had such found who had tri'd her: One as right as my Leg, and seemingly, of that wanton Wenches humor, who could not endure to have this word, <hi>Notwithstanding,</hi> mentioned in her Jointure, but lik'd well of this Clause, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided alwaies;</hi> which if he were not, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should. That her Education or Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was good, may appear by those singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46879:56"/>
Qualities which she privately both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and practised. She could dance neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and sing to the Harp sweetly, if she had but liberally tasted of the sweet Grape: Which, it appears, she dearly loved, by her free Reproof towards one, by whom his Wife was not only from drinking Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, but being taken at it, was of Life deprived.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Metellus, the foule churle the swine</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>That with a staffe berast his wife her life</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>For the dronke wine: though I had be his wife</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>This is meant of that temperate <hi>Roman, Metellus,</hi> who, albeit he fell into this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Extream, upon the finding of his wife distempered with Wine (which Vice, by the Testimonie both of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> was held among the <hi>Romans</hi> to be more punishable in Women, than Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) was highly renowned for a Noble and Victorious. Souldier, having highly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Fame to his Countries succeeding Honour. But had this Good-wife of <hi>Bath</hi> been <hi>Metellus</hi> his Wife, she vows she would
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46879:57"/>
have pli'd the Pitcher in spite of all his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: and had a little touch of <hi>Venus</hi> Game too, after her Blood were inflam'd with the Spirit of Liquor.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>For also seker, as cold engendreth haile</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Alicorus mouth must have a lecherous taile.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This her own Experience had taught her, which she patcheth up with a shread of her Philosophy, to strengthen it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Wine, indeed, affords Fewel for Lust. The understanding part being darkned and drowned, the Sensitive part becomes domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering, by subjecting Reason to blind Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. She finds poor Defence for her Honour, who deprives her self of that which should be her best Armour.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>But lorde Christ, when it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth me</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Upon my youth, and my jolite</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>It tickleth me about the hart roote</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>Unto this daie it doth my hart boote</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>It delights her to remember the Pranks of her Youth; and no doubt, it would high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly content her to have a Tast of <hi>Aeson</hi>'s
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46879:57"/>
Herb, and so become young again: For her Desires continue strong, though her Strength be weak; her Thoughts green, though her Hairs be gray.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>But age alas, that all woll envenime</hi>

            </l>
            <p>A charitable old Trader! Age like a Venom, hath crept upon her, the Beauty and Strength of her Youth have left her; Both which, seeing she cannot recover, she free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bequeaths the Devil that which she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep with her. Yet holds she on in her old Trade of Folly.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>The floure is gone, there nis no more to tell</hi>
            </l>

               <hi>The bran (as I best can) now mote I sell.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Few or none but they will leave Sin, when Sin hath left them; but this merry Gossip will scarcely leave it, when she is now left by it. Though the Flower of her Youth be lost, the Bran of her age is left, and that must now be bolted, or she will never rest contented.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:46879:58"/>
               <hi>But yet to be right merry woll I fonde</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Now forth to tell of my fourth husbonde.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>All this which hath been said last, must serve for a Preamble to her fourth Husband; of whom her Discourse must be but short, according (as may be supposed) to the length of his Life, and height of her Love.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>I saie I had in hart great despite</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>That he of any other had delite.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>He was of a wanton Life himself, and therefore looks for his Wife in the Oven, where himself had been. Ill Doers are ever ill Deemers. None are more suspicious than such as are most vicious. A Licentious man's Eye is in every Corner; to whom the very least Occasion will minister apparent ground of Suspition.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>But he was quit, by God and sainct Ioce</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>I made him of the same wood a troce</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>Truth was, he could not for his heart be more jealous of me, than I was of him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed, had he any just cause to suspect me of Wantonness. Here she excuseth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that she never consorted with any good
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46879:58"/>
Fellows for her own bodily pleasure, in all this Husband's time. Only she invited them to good Chear; being now turn'd professed Gossipper: And all this, perchance, (so perverse was her Disposition) rather to net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and sting her Husband, than any singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Delight she took, either in respect of her Comrades, or Delicacy of Tooth: as may be probably gathered by those Verses immediately following.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>—I made folke such chere</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>That in his own grece I made him frie</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>For anger, and for very jelousie.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Out of a Jealousie, or rather a constant persuasion, that she was as liberal of her Flesh, as of her Fare, he fried himself in his own Grease: he wasted himself with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: seeing both a weakning of his Fortune, and impeaching of his Honour (as he veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspected) cope so closely one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>By God, in yearth I was his purgatorie</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>For which I hope his soul be in glory.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>It seems she was good for something, if it were but to become her Husband's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46879:59"/>
more properly the Touchstone of his Patience. By this means she thinks he had his Purgatory on Earth, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, without any Rub or Stay in his way, he may go directly to Heaven. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions being Exercises, he needed not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Body to rust for want of them, having both at Bed and at Board such plenty of them.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>For God it wote, he sate ful oft and song</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Whan that his shoe full bitterly him wrong.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Like a down-right honest man, he set the best Face he could on't. Yet when he feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most Mirth, he had greatest cause to mourn. Every man knew not where his shoe wrinch'd him. He might laugh till his heart ak'd again, yet never a whit near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er relief: She had vow'd to be his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, purposely to become his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>He died whan I came fro Hierusalem</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And lieth in grave under the Rode beem.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This good wife, belike, had taken her Pilgrimage to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> either voluntarily
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46879:59"/>
or by Injunction. No doubt, had she plaied Pilgrim all her time, her Husband had a lighter heart. But now coming home, she finds her Husband drawing near his last home. Whom she sees no sooner departed, than she takes course to prevent his Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, to have him no less suddenly, than so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly buried. Under the Rood-loft (a place of especial Reverence in sormer times) she causeth his Grave to be made; albeit in no sumptuous manner as ancient Heroes have been interred, as she after expressed.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>All nis his tombe so curious</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>As was the sepulture of him Darius</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Which that Apelles wrought so subtelly</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>It is but wast to burie him preciously.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>To bestow on him so Gorgeous or Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous a Sepulchre, as was that which was erected in the honour of <hi>Darius,</hi> formed by the curious Art of famous <hi>Apelles;</hi> or as that of <hi>Artimisia</hi> in the Memory of her <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solus,</hi> were but (as she thinks) lost labour: So much cost would make a poor Executor, and too much impoverish the Survivor.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:46879:60"/>
               <hi>Let him farewell, god give his soul good rest.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>He is now in his grave and in his chest.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>He is now laid in Earth, and his Soul, I hope, at rest: He had my leave to be gone before he went. To grieve for that which cannot be remedied is bootless. I will spare then to shed any Tears, seeing they are no less Foolish than fruitless. And so Good night to my fourth Husband.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Now of my fifth husband woll I tell</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>God let never his soule come in hell.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>She had no sooner left her fourth Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in his Grave, than she makes ready to go to Church for a Fifth. And of such an one she speeds her self, that it seems his Soul deserv'd well of her, whatsoever his Body did. Yet is it to be wondred at, how she should be so charitable in her blessings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, who was so shrewd in his blows, towards her. But of this she gives a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Truth is, he was shrewd to me, and gave me store of rib roast, imagining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that I was of the nature of the Wallnut
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46879:60"/>
Tree, that must be cudgelled before it be fruitful; yet for all this, I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him with a great deal of love. Though he gave me correction, he had an other winning way to gain my affection. He was of an able and active body, and could till me on with such pretty Toies and Tales when he desired to have that which I no less desired my self, and he could win me with a smile, and with a smooth brow allay my storm.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>I trow I lov'd him the better, for that he</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Was of his love so daungerous to me.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>A strong Womans reason.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Follow women, they will fly you,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Fly but Women, they'l draw nigh you.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>If you would a Woman move,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Seem to love not, when you love.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>The way then to win them, is seemingly to wean our affection from them. Proffer'd ware, be it never so precious, is disvalued; That only is held worth our purchase, which is with niceness gained: whatsoever is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid us, is with eager appetite pursued by us. To utter our Ware with danger, will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46879:61"/>
improve our commodity most to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and honour.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And to great chepe is hold at to little price</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>This knoweth every woman that is wise</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Far fetch'd and dear bought is good for Ladies. A vile price makes the commodity no less vile. Highly then was this Husband affected, because he was dainty and nice in his affection. He caus'd her now and then to bite oth' bridle, and to fast, that her Stomach might become stronger for the next Feast. She had now and then a bit and a buffet with't. All her dayes were not Holy-dayes; this made her pleasure (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause rare) more welcom, when it came.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>My fifth husbonde, God his soule blesse</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46879:61"/>
respect made her chuse him. He was a Scholar, and unpreferr'd, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not like to be rich. But now had he left Schole, with his hopes of some poor Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, which were but small, in regard of his weak Parts, or that he had no Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters commendatory, from some great or powerful Favorite, to procure it; And now in stead of a Fellowship, he intends to board himself privately with Dame <hi>Alyson,</hi> this Good-wifes Gossip. Now whether this were the self-same <hi>Alyson,</hi> the Carpenter's Wife, mentioned in our <hi>Miller's Tale,</hi> I will not here dispute; Only, with submission alwaies to deeper Judgments, I conceive, that by all probability it should be the very same <hi>Alyson,</hi> but that this Clerk of <hi>Oxford</hi> here mentioned, was <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who fancied Dame <hi>Alison,</hi> I cannot assent; for this bears another name. Be she what she will be, it appears she was a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Gossip, and of inward Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with our Wife of <hi>Bath:</hi> Being ever constantly of her Bosom-counsel, together with another Wife, whom she names not, and her Neece, in all which, she reposed great Considence. No Secret could there
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46879:62"/>
be, which might either concern her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or her self, but it was imparted to one of these three. No counsel so private, no passage so secret, which was not to these communicate.</p>

            </l>
            <p>This Wife of <hi>Bath</hi> was too full of Chinks to be a good Secretary. Her Husband could tell her nothing over night, but next day she would be Carrier of it abroad: wherein our Poet privately glanceth at such as too freely use to commit their nearest thoughts to the secrecy of a Woman: whereof though some be Seals, others be Sieves.</p>

            <p>Now she comes to relate the season and occasion of her first Familiar Acquaintance with this Clark of <hi>Oxford,</hi> her jolly <hi>Jenkin:</hi> This begun in Lent, but she means to make it no time of Abstinence. She and her kind Gossip must take Air, and in such Moneths as afford most delight. Yet cannot those
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46879:62"/>
fresh and fragrant Fields sufficiently refresh them, unless they have <hi>Jenkin</hi> the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for an Usher to conduct them. And a good Opportunity had this Good wife, for her Husband was at <hi>London:</hi> With liberty therefore might she take her range to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils, Visitations, Preachings, Pilgrimages and Processions; to Stage-playes, Puppit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaies and Marriages; where she might see and be seen; yea felt, heard and understood. Her gay Scarlet Petticoat, and Broad-cloath Gown need now fear no Moaths; they are too daily worn to be eaten with Worms. Her Cloaths make every day their Holiday. Till her Husband come home, she means not to make her own house her home. The Field must be her Walk, and <hi>Jenkin</hi> her Mate.</p>
            <l>

            </l>
            <p>Now begun she to grow more familiar with this dainty Clerk. She is now not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for walking, but talking with him; yea, and dalliance too; till in the end, she holds him for her only private Friend, and such an one, as she could find in her heart to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46879:63"/>
commend to his Trust the greatest Secret she has in the world.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>I spake to him, and saied how that he</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>If I were wedowe, should wedde me.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>This is plain dealing, and deserves the Scholar's favourable construction: As if she should say, Ye Scholars are dangerous Youths; when ye woo least, ye win most; when ye speak least, ye prevail most. Did ye perceive nothing, Sir <hi>Jenkin,</hi> when of all others, I chus'd you to keep me compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; walked and talked with you private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and made you acquainted with my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som-Secrecy? Truly, I must tell you, should mine Husband die, as all Flesh is mortal, I am verily persuaded that I should wish with all mine heart to enjoy an Armful of you. In good sooth we women are the veriest Fools in the world: If we love, we cannot lain: whereas you men are mighty Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, and will bring us weak things into Fools Paradise: when you seem to love us, you will soonest leave us. Well, durst I trust you, I could tell you somewhat would make your Ear tingle: But I will not; and yet I think I must; it will needs out. I am
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46879:63"/>
half persuaded you have given me some Love-powder, or I should never fawn nor fond on you after this manner. Know Sir, I made choice of you for your Person, no Preferment nor Possession; for I hear, you have but a poor Scholar's Fortune. Now think not that I stood unprovided before I came to be acquainted with you. No Sir; I must tell you, I need not want for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if I took delight in such Chaffer. I ever held her a foolish Mouse that had but one hole to creep out at. I am neither so old nor mishapen, but I should find one or other to accept of the motion.</p>

            <p>A dainty Device! This was Dame <hi>Aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's</hi> subtilty. And that she might all the better persuade him, that she thinks on him by day, she tels him how she dreams of him by night. Where she relates to him the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of her terrible Dream: How she verily thought in her sleep that he came and assaulted her, purposing to have slain her:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46879:64"/>
and how she started, as she lay upright in her Bed, to resist his Fury; which were the least of her thought upon so fair an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Yet interprets she all this in the best sence. For that abundance of Blood wherewith she thought her self embath'd, did signifie Gold, which he might be sure to enjoy, if ever her Husband should die, and her self to boot.</p>

            </l>
            <p>All these supposed Dreams were but to delude him, and make him more confident of the Love she bare him. A right careful Observer of whatsoever her subtil Tutor Dame <hi>Alyson</hi> had inform'd her. One who had sufficient Experience to instruct an apt Scholar in Rules of Dalliance.</p>

It seems the remembrance of the proper Personage of her neat Clark, had like to have made her quite forget her Tale. Yet, at last, she recals to mind the Story where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on she is to treat, which Subject, sometimes, she was as apt to forget.</p>
            <l>

            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>I wept algate, and made sorie chere.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Or for want rather of natural Tears, she furnish'd her self of other effectual means: She wrapt an Onion in the one Nook of her Handkercher, or pump'd for Tears; or drew her Face into a Purse, purposely to feign a kind of sorrowing, when her Heart was full of Joy, in hope to enjoy her <hi>Jenkin.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>
               <hi>But for that I was purveied of a make</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>I wept but small, and that I undertake.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>No doubt, but she had prov'd a better Mourner, had she been a worser Purveior: Like to that Widow, whereof I have heard this Story. That, having buried three Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and all those with a very small por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or quantity of Tears, she came at last
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46879:65"/>
to the Grave with her Fourth, for whom she wept bitterly; which her Neighbors much wondring at, demanded of her the Cause why she should be so immoderate in her Sorrow for that last Husband, who had been of so harsh and rough a Disposition, and so patient at the Deaths of all the other three, who were of loving and affable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and had deserved so well at her hands? To whom she made this Answer; That she wept not so much for that she was of her sweet Husband deprived, as that she was now destitute and unprovided; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at the Deaths of her other Husbands, she was ever of another prepared before the other was buried.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>To church was my husband born on morow</hi>

            </l>
            <p>It is to be wondred why she let him lie so long unburied; but it seems there was some Solemnity to be used, or else that his Friends and Neighbors did expect it. You may imagine now, when she sees her Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46879:65"/>
               <hi>Jenkin</hi> amongst other Mourners, that she has made a League with her Eyes, not to shed one Tear; with her Heart, not to send forth one Sigh, unless it be in jest, and so fool the Spectators. Neat were his Legs, pretty were his Feet: These were her Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in this Spectacle of Sorrow. This seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Survey or Perusal of <hi>Jenkin</hi>'s Person had so taken up her Eye, as it could fix it self on no other Object, while he was in Presence. Yea, her Blood began to spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle now afresh in her, so as in her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit she was twenty years younger than she was in the Morning. Though forty Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had already blown upon her; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently some Tokens of Age had stamp'd their Impreslures in her: She had alwaies a Colt's Tooth. Yea, she had divers other signs of an Invincible Patient, as she her self after confesseth.</p>

She was gap-tooth'd, or wide-spaced, not like <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> whose Teeth were all one Bone, undivided.

In Sense, she was Venereal; in Heart, Martial; <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> gave her the Gift to be lascivious; <hi>Mars</hi> to be couragious; <hi>Taurus</hi> was her Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>Mars</hi> therein Predominant: But had <hi>Mars</hi> been her Husband, her too common Dalliance might well have chang'd <hi>Taurus</hi> into <hi>Aries,</hi> and enjoyn'd him to hold of her for Term of Life <hi>in Capite.</hi>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46879:67"/>
as though it were inevitable, and thereby use it as a Refuge or Sanctuary, for all their evil Actions. Unto which may be objected the Answer of <hi>Chrisippus,</hi> writing in this manner: Although (saith he) that Nature hath provided all things from the Beginning, and that by her Providence all things are moved and stirred up by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain necessary Reason and Motion; yet notwithstanding our Dispositions and Minds are no further subject or in danger thereof, than their Propriety and Quality is concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and agreeable unto the same. For, if by Nature our Wits be first made wholsom and good, apt to receive good Notions, fair Impressions; by being after indued with Reason and Understanding, either they do utterly put off and avoid all evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and accidents, or else by their discreet temper, receive and bear them more easily without hurt or dammage. If contrariwise, our dispositions be rude and gross, not endued with any kind of Letters or good Learning, to assist and help them withal, with every light Conflict or Assault of our Natural Inclination, we run headlong into all kind of Errors and Vice. For we
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46879:67"/>
ought first to know and understand, that neither the Stars, nor any Natural Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do provoke or force us to any thing, but only make us apt and prone: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so disposed, do, as it were, allure and draw us forward to our Natural Inclination. This might be illustrated by example of the <hi>Cylinder-Stone;</hi> which by nature being apt to roll and tumble, and being cast or thrown down into hollow or steep places, doth run without ceasing, not so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is cast or thrown, as for his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Aptness thereunto, and not having any thing in it self to withstand the same.</p>

            <p>But all these goodly Precepts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs which he delivered in this sort unto me, were but as if he had sown Dust in the Air. I valued them not worth the Bloom of a Haw-thorn. For truth was, those who either corrected me, or reproved those Vices which they saw in me, were never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cater-cosins with me; for such Vices as we love, we defend; nor can we easily forgo them without Distast.</p>

            <p>The Book out of which I tore this Leaf, was entitled <hi>Valerius Max.</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, one who wrote much to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and Dishonour. With him had he joyned <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> at whose Conceipts, he unmeasurably laughed, while I at his Laughter was grievously netled. With these had he bound up St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Book against the Heretick <hi>Jovinian,</hi> together with <hi>Tortulanus, Crisippus, Tortula,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowis,</hi> sometimes Abbess not far from <hi>Paris.</hi> And with these (to enlarge this his Miscel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane Volume) had he bound together the Parables of <hi>Solomon, Ovid</hi> his Art of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, with sundry other Tracts or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, discoursing of several Subjects. Now, would you know how he employed these Books? It was his accustomed manner every night when he had Leisure, to recreate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in these Works: More Legends and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46879:70"/>
Lives had he of wicked Wives, than ye could repeat of good Wives throughout the Bible. All these had he purposely compiled, and were by him nightly recounted to make me discontented.</p>

            <p>It is not now as it was in <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s daies; Present times have Clarks, who can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and love this Sex. Such, I say, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proper Liniments to woo with, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Habiliments to win with, Canonical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of their own to wed with, become no Reprovers, but Improvers of so Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a State. Wherein I hold them wise; Sure I am, they trace the steps of the wise: For all the Seven wise men of <hi>Greece</hi> were married: Albeit; there never wanted in any Age scornful Inveighers against women, yea, and Persecuters of them too in publick Theatres; Such were <hi>Euripides, Hesiodus,</hi> with many others, who out of some bitter Experience had of their own unhappy Choice, made that Sex, now and then, the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46879:71"/>
Subject of their Invection. It was a Stoick's Saying, No wise man was fit for a Woman, yet may a Woman be fit for a wise man; yea, and fit him too a Penniworth for all his Wisdom. But if a Woman would have Hearts-ease, and world at will, let her marry one of our Sedentary-Desk Clarks, or Pedantical Fools, who know not what the world means; for so may she have the world at will. Now in the very last Verse men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by our Poet, this good wife of <hi>Bath</hi> shadows out such jealous Clarks; who, when they suspect their Wives affected to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or any way addicted to Liberty, they will pull out some antient Story or other, discoursing of the Lives of Saintly or Holy Women, to reclaim them from their Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and restrain them in their Freedom of living.</p>

            <p>These Clarks (saith she) are of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as they will neither speak well of Wives nor any other Women. But they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46879:71"/>
can paint a Lion that never saw his Feature, but by Report; This is but only as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Painter. Had women written Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (as our <hi>Theano,</hi> with many moe Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of our Sex could have done) they would have found Colours to display the vicious Natures of men, and discovered them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of more Enormities than the Issue-Male of <hi>Adam</hi> should ever redress.</p>

Yea, their Dispositions are likewise divers; for, Exaltation of the one is the Humiliation of the other; which (as if this good-wife had been well read in an <hi>Erra-Pater,</hi> or some other Astronomical Author) she confirms with this Instance:</p>

He hath so inur'd himself to the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Part, as he is wholly out of use with the Practick. The Remainder of his daies (saith she) he spends like a Cricket, in a Chimney-Corner, in descanting on the Lightness of VVomens Natures, wherein he shews the poorness of his own Humor.</p>

            <l>
               <hi>Upon a night Jenkin, that was our sire</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Redde upon his booke, as he sate by the fire</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Of Eve first</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>But would you know (quoth she) more at large the cause of my Beating? I will now return to my Purpose, and fully relate to you the Occasion. Sir <hi>Jenkin</hi> (as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customably used) having laid his Heel on the Ratting Crook, to pass the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night away, or rather, as I expounded it, to disquiet me, took a Book in his Hand, (a various Volume of Numerous Authors) wherein he read of <hi>Eve</hi> first, how she by consenting to the Serpent, brought all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to the Brink of Perdition. Which mortal Sore requir'd a Soveraign Salve,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46879:73"/>
even the Blood of the Lamb, which regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, before lost, and restored our Blood, before corrupted.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Lo here expresse of women may ye find</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>That woman was the losse of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>
               <hi>Jenkin</hi> applies the Text he had read; but few or none of all his She-Audience will vouchsafe to make Use of his Application. But to the end he may work stronger upon his Wives Phantasie, he brings on a fresh Army of Examples in this kind. What did treacherous <hi>Delilah</hi> to her <hi>Sampson,</hi> when by discovery of his Counsel, she robb'd him of his Hairs, wherein lay all his Strength; and after, of his Eyes, which gave him all his Light? What did <hi>Deianira</hi> to her <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> when with <hi>Nessus</hi> poysoned Shirt, she set him all a fire? VVhat did <hi>Zantippe</hi> to <hi>Socrates,</hi> when she crown'd him with a Chamber-pot? which shameless Abuse of hers, when such as were his Friends, wished him to revenge, he washed off his Disgrace with this Patient Answer:</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:46879:73"/>
It never yet was deem'd a Wonder</l>
            <l>To think that Rain should follow Thunder.</l>
            <p>She thundred so much before with her Tongue, as he could expect no less than Rain. What did <hi>Pasiphae</hi> Wife to <hi>Minos</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> whose Brutish Lust, and Monstrous Birth, have made her infamous to all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times? What did <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> to her <hi>Agamemnon?</hi> What Dishonour did she to her Noble Parents <hi>Tindarus</hi> and <hi>Leda,</hi> when she not only expos'd her self to <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> Lust, but depriv'd her Princely Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of Life? What did <hi>Eriphyle</hi> Wife of <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> when for a Gold-Chain, she disloyally betrayed her Husband <hi>Polynices,</hi> when he had hidden himself, because he would not go to the Wars of <hi>Thebes?</hi> What Dispatch made <hi>Livia</hi> of her Husband, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she lov'd him too little? What Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch made <hi>Lucilia</hi> of hers, because she lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him too much? What Answer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Latumerus</hi> of <hi>Arrius</hi> (a Philosopher in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in <hi>Augustus</hi> time) when he made his sorrowful Complaint unto him, how that he had a Tree in his Garden of such a strange Nature, as all his three wives,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46879:74"/>
through meer despight, had hang'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on it? O (quoth surly <hi>Arrius)</hi> do me the Courtesie, Dear Brother, to give me a Plant of that Blessed Tree, that it may grow and prosper in my Garden: For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any yet plant it, that might make better use of it. What Wives in these later times do we now read of, who not only consented to see their Husbands murdered, but in the very Presence of those dislaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Corps suffered themselves to be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Some have driven Nails through their Brains; Others have depriv'd them of Life by poysonous Potions: As might be instanced in the Tragick Examples of <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silla, Faustina, Corombona, Messalina,</hi> and many others. All which Stories Sir <hi>Jenkin</hi> would read so distinctly, passionately, and devoutly, as if they were his Evening Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons.</p>

               <hi>And therewithall he knew mo proverbes</hi>

            </l>
            <p>He was a most proper Proverbial <hi>Jenkin,</hi> and could twit his testy Wife with store of such Proverbs as these, which he had at
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46879:74"/>
his Finger end. <q>It is better to live with Lions and Dragons, than in house with an angry woman. Better to abide on the Roof ever smoking, than below with a Wife ever chiding. Yea, so perverse, (said he) are they in Will, so contrary in Work, that they ever hate what their Husbands love, like what they loath. They cast away Shame, when they cast off their Smock. And for their Modesty, this is my Opinion, To see Beauty accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by Chastity, were like a Gold Ring in a Swine's Snout.</q>

            <p>How much this Good-wife was netled with his Nightly Lectures, she can hardly express her self, much less her Interpreter. Howsoever, one may easily collect by those furious Sparks of her Passion which issue forth, that there is a dangerous Fire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For first, she takes a poor Revenge on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46879:75"/>
his Book, and tears it; Then she collars with him, and with a sound blow oth' Ear, throws him down backward into the Fire. Which he, never till now inflam'd with such unmanly Fury, requites with such a stroke on her Head, as senseless she fals on the Floor. Die she will needs, there's no Remedy; and the rather, as may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, to make him guilty of her Death, and so raise him to the Ladder of his <hi>Suspended</hi> Advancement. But coming now at last to her self (for long had she been by her self) in this sort she re-assaies to course him, before she leave him.</p>
            <l>

            </l>
            <p>Though she approach near the Gates of Death, she can open the Gate of her Teeth, and make the Poet's Observation true,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Wheel of a Womans Tongue is like a River,</l>
               <l>Set it once going, it will go for ever.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Well; It seems, before her Departure, she means to give him a strange Encounter. Sirrah Thief, do you hear! You that first
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46879:75"/>
enchanted me, 'and so ravish'd my Love from me; you that have seiz'd of what was due to me: Nay, you Blood-hound, you that for my Land have thus murdered me, draw near me, let me kiss thee, and so good night to all the world. It shall not be said, but I die in Charity; So, close up mine Eyes, I shall die presently. This dying Salute could not chuse but drive poor <hi>Jenkin</hi> into sundry Extreams. For, thought he, should she die in spite after this manner, I should make a fair End, but a worse Face in an Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Gladly would he (if she were not past hope) recover her; Down on his knees he goes, and kisses her; rubs and chafes her; though she needed small Chafing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as hot at Stomach, as any Pepper. In the end, he resolves to salute her, and if her Stomach be come down, to reconcile himself to her; but still he fears, she is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nearly dead, or wholly deaf to such an Humor.</p>

            <p>A right fair and proper Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Offence; If she will but forgive him this rash and unadvis'd Assault, may he never desire any Favour, nor deserve any Love from her, nor in his greatest need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Succour, if ever he attempt any such presumptuous part thereafter. And yet alas (saith he) it was your Fault that we fell into this Debate: Had you rul'd your Tongue, I had held mine Hand; yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it me, dear Sister, sweet <hi>Alyson,</hi> and I promise you, upon <hi>Jenkin's</hi> Honesty, that your Tongue shall never force me to like Fury. While poor <hi>Jenkin</hi> is thus labouring in all humble manner to compose his own Peace, the dead Coarse revives, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him such an overthwart Blow, as his Head rings again. Which (good man)
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46879:76"/>
sounds better in his Ear, than ever any of her sweet Kisses relished his Lip; For, thought he, if she have such lightness in her Fingers, she cannot but have some Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at her Heart.</p>

            <p>Like the humorous Lady in the Comedy, she is every foot dying, to make him the more despairing; Though she had already wreaked her self of him sufficiently, yet will she die with this Revenge, in spite of all his Remorse. And to confirm, that she is near Death, she concludes, <q>I may no longer speak</q>: A dangerous Sign that she is past all hope of Recovery. For when a woman is laid speechless, the Bell may well ring out. But see what a bright Beam darted forth of this black Cloud!</p>

And having now to his succeeding memory reduced his Countrey to quietness, and planted the Peaceful Olive in his Confines; to express his true Love to Chivalry, and memorize such who were not only Associates, but As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants in his Victory; He constituted the Order of the Round Table, in which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he only retained such of his Nobility, as were most Renowned for Vertue and Chivalry.

unriveted the very Secrets of their own Brests, and told him plainly what of all things in the world they for their parts most desired, and what of all others most contented them. For my part, said one, there is nought that delights me more, than to have Hearts-ease, to be cheared, cherished, flattered and pleas'd; ever to have my Words seconded, my Arguments maintained, and in all my Business to have my self duly attended. Another of the same Sex, and for her Opinion, by all likelihood of the same Sect, starts up, and affirms; That for her part, she lov'd nothing better, than to be free and at her own Dispose; to be countermanded by none, to do what she list; not to be reproved for any Vice that she loved; to be esteemed wise; more free than nice; more buxom than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>

A general Silence by an O Yes, thrice pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly cried, was to all Women injoyned. A Task, I grant of no small difficulty, but this was, to th' end this Knight should not be interrupted. The Knight, after his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and so free Audience, with a shrill Voice and stout Spirit, as one confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his Answer, assoiles the Question with this Resolution:</p>

            </l>
            <p>There is nothing which a woman desires more than Soveraignty; Command is her Content; Dominion her Minion; her will her Weal. This the Poet confirms:</p>

               <l>Nor Love, nor Life, nor Liberty, nor Land,</l>
               <l>Can please a Wench, unless she have Command.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Soveraignty is such a Pearl in her Eye, that Life is a loathing unless it be attending. Thus hath he returned his Answer; now hear what Applause it receives in this fair Foeminine Assembly.</p>

            <p>By general Voice and Vote he is held worthy to have his Life. Their own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms else would have condemned them, and

She puts him to his Book-Oath, but he will neither take it, nor her by his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will. He must now turn over a new Leaf, and act another fresh Scene of Sorrow.

Thusto live were to die; yea to die were to live, rather than embrace such a Life. Better thinks he, it had been by many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to have stood Mute, and submitted himself to the extreamest Censure, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such hard tearms to have procur'd an Answer, the issue whereof will undo him for ever. He resolves then to make her a fair Proffer, the Acceptance whereof, though it should make him a Beggar, yet in his Conceipt infinitely happier.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Take all my good, and let my body go.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nay qd she, than I shrewe vs both two.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>As if he should say, I confess freely, that I have receiv'd an incomparable Courtesie from you; being the next Means under God and my Gracious Soveraign, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving my Life; Nor will I deny but I promis'd you upon the Answer I receiv'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46879:91"/>
from you, whatsoever were in my power, I would freely and without exception give you. But little did I expect that my self should be the Gift. Alas! You are an old Woman, and should think of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, than such youthful Marriages. For what would this beget but Jealousie in you, Discontent in me, and some miserable End to us both? This Disparity in our Years, can make no true Harmony in our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Age, generally is more given to the World, than the Flesh; Accept then of my Fortunes, I lay them down at your Feet, and leave me to the wide world to raise me an Estate. I have nothing too dear for you but my self; release me of that, and take all. This, he thought would have prevail'd, but he is far deceiv'd; She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly answers him, that it was not his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes that could content her; No, nor all the precious Ore, Metals, nor Minerals of the whole Earth. As his own Life was by her means saved, so expects she that his own Person shall recompense it. Set your heart then at rest, saith she, as you receiv'd from me the Benefit of your Life, so nothing will content me but being your Wife and your Love.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46879:92"/>
               <hi>My loue (qd he) nay my dampnation Alas that any of my nation</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>My Love, my loathing! Hanging and wedding go by destiny, and he holds it disputable, whether his loss of life or choice of such a Wife, were the greater Misery. He holds <hi>Martial</hi>'s opinion in his affiance to this woman.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Paula</hi> likes me, so shall I never her,</l>
            <l>Because she's old, unless she elder were.</l>
            <p>He could be the better contented to marry her, if he were but persuaded that he should shortly become her Survivor; mean time, this is his conceipt; though, he received from her the benefit of his life, yet he holds his life at too high a rate to be enthralled to her love. Neither, as he verily thinks, would this disgrace which he should thus incur, by ingaging himself to this unweldy Beldame, who was a very far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Diseases, reflect only upon himself, but on his whole Nation: For to describe her, and bestow on her her true Character, what was she, but a sapless seer stock with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out verdure; a crawling creeping Cricket,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46879:92"/>
without vigour; a proportionless feature without favour? One, whose mouth like a common sewer, was ever driveling; whose Nose, like a perpetual Limbeck, was ever dropping. The <hi>Sciatica</hi> had taken Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of her Hip; the Megrim of her Head; An aged Film had quite covered her Eyes; And an incessant Cough taken seizure of her Lungs. Her Mouth was discharged of the Grinders; from which issued such a Steam, as it would have put a Serjeant in mind of his Mortality. Yet must this proper Puss be this Knight's dainty Bride; For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hold himself highly disparaged, his Nation dishonoured, his succeeding Hopes eternally dashed;</p>
            <l>—<hi>The end is this, that he</hi>

            <p>He must perform his Promise; Where women are Judges, the worst of their Sex must not be wronged. Now what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Bridal this was, let them judge, who have known the misery of a Loathed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46879:93"/>
Bed. Bat no Remedy in cases of such inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Necessity; He must put on the best Countenance he can, and learn to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the World, the bitterest of whose Discontents he hath now sufficiently tasted.</p>

            <p>Now some (saith this old Wife of <hi>Bath)</hi> will perhaps expect that I should speak of the Joy and Jollity, Feasts and Solemnity of this goodly Marriage, As first, how the Bride and Bridegroom were attired, with what Companies attended, what Dainty Cates were provided, how the Feasters were ranked, with what Musick and Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cheared.</p>

            <p>They that expect any jovial Day at such a Bridal-Day, are much deceived; There was nothing there but Pouting, Louring, and Cloudy Weather; All things were out
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46879:93"/>
of temper; No Consort could keep any Concord, when the Chief of the Feast were at such mortal Discord. They that came to their Table, might be sure to find store of Foul in every Corner; Foul Looks, Foul Lips, Foul Linnen. Well may we think then;</p>

            <l>
               <hi>He waloweth, and turneth to and fro.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>His old wife lay smiling euermo</hi>

            <p>While he makes his Bed his Rack, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro, tossing and wallowing in his Sheets of Shame, for so he holds them, his Bed-fellow expostulates the Cause with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46879:94"/>
him, and with a comfortable Smile, as you may gather, by her amiable Favour and Feature, thus accoasts him; <q>Good God, Dear Husband, what a tossing and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you make! Fares every Knight with his Wife as you do? Is this the Comfort of a first Nights Marriage? Marry, Fie upon Wedding and this be it. Are King <hi>Arthur's</hi> Knights so dainty of their Love, as they will tender no Benevolence to them from whom they receive the Benefit of their Life? Sure, others are neither so coy nor curious, so dainty nor dangerous of their Busses nor Embraces as you be. Am not <hi>I</hi> she, who preserved your Life from Danger, and since have married you, which deserves some Honour? How is it then, that like a mad man, you shew this Distemper, and with-hold that Freedom of Love from me, which you ought in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to tender? First Night had been no such great matter, if you had been more sparing of your Love hereafter.</q>
            </p>
            <l>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:46879:94"/>
               <hi>Fy, what is my gilt? for gods loue tell me it</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And it shall be amended if I may.</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>Amended (qd this knight) alas nay nay</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <p>Sure my Guilt cannot be so great, but if you look on the Means of your Safety, that will excuse me; But if I have been in ought blame-worthy, do but impart it, and I shall amend it. Amend it (quoth the Knight) that's impossible. When I look on thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, it makes me quite forget the means of my Safety. Thy Presence makes my Bed loathsom; thy Old Age and base Birth make my Life wearisom. No wonder then, if I thus toss, turn and turmoil my self, when I see no Object that may afford to my rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Misery the least Hope of Comfort. Burst then, poor hapless Heart, since thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of all Hope, and deprived of all Means of Help.</p>
            <l>

            </l>
            <p>What, saith she, is this all you can object against me? Is it my Base Parentage, or
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46879:95"/>
Mean Personage the only Reason of your Distast? Yes, answers he, what Reasons can be greater, when neither outward Worth, nor Equality of Birth suits with mine Honour?</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Now sir (qd she) I couth amend all this</hi>

            </l>
            <p>Well Sir, these are no such great Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sores, but they might be cured; yea, and before three Daies were expired, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned your self towards me as became a Loving Husband. But whereas you stand so much upon Gentility of Blood; Trust me, sweet Spouse, these Titles are but Trifles. Those only are to be held generous, who are Vertuous; those Ignoble, who are Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Nobility of Blood, if it want inward Worth, is soon corrupted; and the highest Family without Vertue, stained. It is true, we derive from our Ancestors our Descents, yet if we come short of them in Deserts, we more dishonour them, than we are honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. For howsoever they confer on us their Inheritance, they cannot leave us their Goodness; That must be by our
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46879:95"/>
own Endeavours obtained, not to us Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally derived. He is a right Gentleman, that has gentle Conditions; from whence he took his Name, as it agreed best with his Nature.</p>

            <p>Here this old Woman shews her self gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with inward Worth, though she want outward Parts, in a free Delivery of her Reading both in Poetry and Philosophy. Wherein she first repeats <hi>Daunt's</hi> Divine Sentence, how we are to attribute all glory unto God, from whom we receive not only outward Prowess, but all inward Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. From our Elders, we may receive Fortunes and Temporal Blessings, which usually prejudice most, where they are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd most: But for inward Abilities, it is not in their power to derive them to us, nor bestow them on us. And he gives the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which he confirms with a Familiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: For, saith he, Should Goodness be derived lineally, then where there is any goodness in the Ancestor, it should dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse and propagate it self to all his Family; None that descended from him, should be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46879:96"/>
addicted to any Villany: There would be an Heritage of Goodness in the whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. Just as Fire, should you carry it into the darkest Cell betwixt Heav'n and Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen <hi>Caucasus,</hi> yet would it, according to its Natural Quality and Operation, give Light and Heat; The Darkness of the House could neither obscure nor extinguish it; till what fed it were consumed, and so it self became quenched. But it is far otherwise with Gentry, it derives no such Native Motion nor Operation from her Family.</p>

               <hi>A lordes son done shame and villany—</hi>
            </l>
            <p>As Bastard-Slips take seldom deep Root, so the freest and most generous Plants bring not alwaies forth most Fruit. The hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest Cyens are oft-times most degenerate. <hi>Catiline</hi> and <hi>Cethegus</hi> were a shame to their Fathers; So were <hi>Semphroma</hi> and <hi>Lucilla</hi> to their Mothers. He or she then (saith this Moral Bride) that would be accompted Generous, let him be Vertuous; He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Gentleman, that is not endowed with a Gentle Mind. Be he or she never so nobly Descended, if Debauch'd, they are
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46879:97"/>
but Peasants. Neither can we justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to our selves any Honour from our Ancestors, if we second them not in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worthy the Renown of those Ancestors. It is neither Priority of Place, nor Nobility of Race, that deserves Approving, but Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness and Affability, which from God have their sole Beginning.</p>
            <l>

               <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> was the third King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> a Prince of Singular Sobriety, a singular Observer of all Vertues; Insomuch as his own Goodness rais'd him to that Greatness. His Poverty could not keep him from Imperial Dignity, because the Eyes of all good men were upon him; by whose general Suffrage he was elected, and to a Regal Seat advanced. Peruse likewise the Works of <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Boetius,</hi> two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors most sententiously Divine, and you shall find (saith this old Bride) that it is gentle Deeds that make one truly Gentile. By all which, she expressly concludes, that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46879:97"/>
an Honourable Descent infers not ever Eminence of Desert; For as one may be Low bred and well dispos'd, so may one be High-born, and ill-affected.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And therefore dere husbond, I thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Al were it that mine anceters were rude</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Yet may that hie god, and so hope I</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Graunt me grace to live vertously.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Surcease Husband, to twit me thus with Baseness of Birth; Though mine Ancestors were rude, yet if God give me Grace to be good, my Vertuous Life shall ennoble my low Line. Let not this therefore so much distast you, though my Descent be mean, I purpose to supply that Want by Deserts, if that may please you.</p>
            <l>

            <p>Secondly, Whereas you seem so much to tax me for my Poverty; That Condition is rather to be loved, than reproved. He who may be a Pattern to us all for Imitation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred voluntary Poverty before any other
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46879:98"/>
Condition. Neither may we think would He have chus'd it, if there had been any Evil in it. The Philosopher saith, To be silent in Prosperity, chearful in Adversity, in both to shew an Indifferency, is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Pitch of Philosophy. It is the Saying of <hi>Sage Seneca,</hi> and other Learned men, That he only is Prosperous and Happy, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himself with his Poverty; Admit he be not worth a Shirt to his back, he has Wealth enough, who holds himself content. He is the richest, whose Desires are fewest; He the poorest, whose Wishes are fullest. There is no Poverty but Sin properly. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> speaks merrily:</p>
            <l>
               <hi>He that's so poor he is not worth a Groat,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Before a Thief may sing a merry Note.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Yea, to describe more fully the Excellency of Poverty; It is a Soveraign good, though generally hateful, inwardly fruitful. An expedite Dispatcher of Business; For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we pay for Expedition in these Courts on Earth, this is that leads us in the expeditest Course to the Court of Heaven; It enlighteneth our Understanding, enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Conceiving, rectifieth our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46879:98"/>
if in these Gusts of seeming Affliction we be patient. These, and many other excellent Fruits produceth Poverty, though few or none entertain it willingly. Nay, which is more, it brings Man to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of himself, and of God, who, for his Love to Man, humbled himself. Besides, It is a very clear Mirror or Looking-Glass, wherein he may distinguish Friends from Foes, and try whom he may safely trust. Reprove me then no more (Gentle Sir) for my Poverty; nor grieve your self at that which brings with it more Comfort than Misery.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Now sir, eke of elde ye repreued me</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And certes sir, though none autorite</hi>

            <p>Lastly Sir, Whereas you despise me for mine Age; If no Authority did enjoyn you, nor no Book inform you, that Age were to be reverenced, even your own Gentility would exact this from you, and that inbred Civility which Nature hath planted in you. When you see an Old Man, for the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46879:99"/>
you bear unto his Age, you clepe him Father. Will you contemn me then, because I am like your Mother? In this respect, you should rather cherish, than discourage me, honour, than disparage me.</p>

            <p>Now whereas you still cast in my Dish, mine Age and Deformity; This you may use for an Antidote against Jealousie. When you are abroad, you need not fear me; Affection is grown so cold in me, it can work no strong Effects on my Phantasie. Neither
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46879:99"/>
will any one desire much to court me, for my Deformity. Decrepit Age and want of Beauty, are sufficient Guardians to preserve Chastity. For as Age is ever attended on by Honour, it is with more Reverence lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than lusted after.</p>

            </l>
            <p>But go too Sir; I see these pleas will hardly please. The Bride that lyes by you must be beautiful or she will not content you. Beauty is a dainty Pearl in your eye. Well; you shall have your desire: There is nothing that may delight you, wherein I will not satisfie you, if it be in my power
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46879:100"/>
to grant you. Go to then, I will offer to your choice two things, wherein please your self, and you shall please me who am your second self. First is, whether you will have me aged and deformed as I now am; and so find me an humble, loving, and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wife, unwilling to displease you, ready at bed and board to be disposed by you, in all respects conformable unto you. Or else, you will have me young and fair, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject your self to the hazards of beauty. For well you know, that as youth is sooner tempted, so is beauty soonest tainted. I cannot avoid it but I must have Suitors to court me, Servants to comfort me, dainty Didappers to visit me. Your house must be alwayes open to Strangers, mine arms to embraces, my perfum'd Lips to youthful Kisses.</p>

               <hi>Now chese your seluen whether that you liketh</hi>

            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>But at the last, he said in manete:</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>My lady and my loue, and wife so dere</hi>

            <p>The world is well amended; Now when it is in his choyce, he stands indifferent for her Change. Yet could he find in his heart that she had Beauty, so none might share with him in her Beauty. But Jealousie is such a dangerous Malady, as to prevent all occasion, he will content himself with her Deformity, rather than become subject to so cureless an Infirmity. First therefore he here adviseth, then sigheth, lastly thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth: Albeit, Dear Wife, you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what Comfort it would be to me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a Beautiful Bed-fellow; one whose out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Parts might make her honoured where-ever she resorted; and whose sweet. Society might allay my Distasts, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46879:101"/>
my Comforts whensoever occasioned; yet shall not you find me so drenched or drowned in sensual Delights, as to prefer mine own Appetite before the Light of Reason. I understand by your grave and discreet Arguments, that you are wise, which is to be incomparably valued above all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Beauty. Make choyce then of what may seem best in your own Discretion; I will in no wise give way to my own blind Affection; which of these two soever may tender you most Pleasure and Honour, chuse it, and so dispose of me and it, as your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may be most advanced by it. I shall hold my self content whether of these two you accept.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>For as you liketh, it suffiseth me.</hi>

Now what she so long aim'd at, she has got; her <hi>own Will;</hi> and therein, which may seem more strange, his Happiness. You have given me, saith she, the Mastery; which shall be such a Government, as it shall not have the least tast of Tyranny. This you have done so freely, as it injoins my Usage to be friendly. Go to Sir; You shall hence find what Benefit an obedient and observant Husband may reap by resigning his Will to the Will of his Wife: You stood doubtful at first, whether of those two Offers which I made you, were to be accepted by you; That is, whether you would have me conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as I am, Aged and Deformed, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Constant, Continent, and to your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Obedient; Or Young and Beautiful, but withal Youthful, and in danger to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Incontinent. But now I shall take from you all Occasion of Doubting, and make you happy in your Affection. For I will be to you both Young and Beautiful; and withal so constant in my Love, so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in my Desires, so Moderate in my Delights, so Temperate in my Resolves, so Discreet in my Directions, so Vertuously Good and Gracious in all my Actions, as you
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46879:102"/>
shall find your Happiness fully Crowned in enjoying me. Nor will I feed your Hopes with any long Delay; For by the next Morning, shall my Beauty be such, as no Lady from East to West may compare with me; whereof, with my Life, dispose as may best please you.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>And so they slepte till it was morow graie</hi>

            </l>
            <p>Howsoever it be said, that they both slept; It is probably to be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, at least, slept or no. Such a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desire he had to see this approaching Hour of her Transmutation. But when this happy Hour was approached, <hi>Aurora</hi> her burnish'd Beams dispersed, and the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain drawn aside, by which this Brides Beauty might be discerned; it is not to be imagined how strangely this over-joyed Bridegroom was intranced. Straight-waies he inwreaths her in his Arms, looks Babies
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46879:102"/>
in her Eyes; and as one embathed in Bliss, a thousand times a row he kisseth her, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transported with joy for the Beauty he saw in her.</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Thus did they surset it in midst of Plenty,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ten Kisses short as one, one long as Twenty.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>To treat farther of it, I will not; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty would have this Subject enskreened, &amp; left to the Imagination to conceive it. Let it suffice, that as her Beauty could not chuse but give him Content, so was she to him constant and obedient: In which mutual Affection; seconded with perfect Joy, free from all Jar, they continued till their Lives ended.</p>

            </l>
            <p>Here at last this good Old Wife of <hi>Bath</hi> ends her long Relation with a serious Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; By which she shews that she has
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46879:103"/>
one Colt's Tooth yet left; Neither doth she pray only for her self, but for the whole Congregation of her Sex: That they may have Husbands <hi>Meek,</hi> to live with, <hi>Young,</hi> to love with, and <hi>Fresh,</hi> to lie with; That they may ever be their Survivors; That such Husbands may have short Lives, who will not suffer their Wives to be Governors; And that a Pestilence may light on all such Husbands and Niggardly Cot-queans as cannot dispose of their own, but are Misers. And so ends she her Story to make her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience merry. Thus then will we conclude our Comment, and recount the Comical Passages of their Nuptial Content, woven up in these Verses.</p>
