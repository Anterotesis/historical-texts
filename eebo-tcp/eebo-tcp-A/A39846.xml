            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Have many Reaſons for my Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the following Treatiſe to your
ſelf: The particular Favours you
have ſhewed me, have deſerved a greater
Acknowledgment, than this ſmall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
I make you, as a Teſtimony of my
Gratitude; but in this Undertaking I
ſhall Appeal to you, who are well read
both in the Ancient and Modern Authors,
as the moſt Candid and Learned Judge,
concerning their Old Notions, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in the Aſthma, which I ſhall here
prefer, for their uſefulneſs to all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns
that have Writ on that Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I think my ſelf ſo much obliged
to thoſe Learned old Authors you lent
<pb facs="tcp:49327:3"/>
me, from that Large and Curious Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in your own Study, that I cannot
but here own the Benefit I received by
Reading of them, and following their
Method of Practice on my ſelf and others;
I hope this will be a ſufficient Excuſe for
my endeavouring to juſtify their Notions,
and Explaining of them, and for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
I ſhall give of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I here preſent you with your own
old Authors, dreſs'd up in the preſent new
Philoſophy, for that changes its Faſhion
in every Age; for it would not now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
Modiſh to expreſs themſelves in the
<hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> way, but as to their ſenſible
Obſervations, and uſeful Methods of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
they will laſt for ever, as being
true Deſcriptions of Natural Things, and
confirmed by frequent Obſervation and
Experiments.</p>
            <p>My Deſign is not in this Dedication to
Compliment your Philoſophic way of
Living, your Univerſal Learning, nor
Greatneſs of Mind in retiring from all the
Pleaſures, and Impertinent Buſineſs of
Life, that you might more freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with your Learned Authors; Tho'
theſe are ſufficient Subjects for a large
<pb facs="tcp:49327:3"/>
Encomium, I muſt confeſs my ſelf unfit
for well performing of it; neither would
your great Humility admit of a juſt Praiſe
of your Virtues.</p>
            <p>I know your Curious Genius requires
ſome Variety of Thoughts to divert it,
or ſome Philoſophic Enquiry to entertain
it, for which end I will here propoſe my
following Obſervations, by which you
will diſcern the deſign of this Treatiſe,
and the good Performance of the Old,
and the Faults of the New Writers, in
treating of the Aſthma.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall obſerve that that is the
moſt uſeful Notion of the Aſthma, from
whence we can take our Indications for
Practice, and which is deduced from an
exact and full ſenſible Hiſtory of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
its Subject, Cauſes, and Symptoms.</p>
            <p>I have aſſigned the immediate Cauſe
of the Aſthma, to the Sraitneſs, Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or Conſtriction of the Bronchia;
and in the continued Aſthma, the Cauſes
muſt be conſtant, as Dropſy, Tubercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the Periodic Aſthma,
the Returns muſt depend on the Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Humours on the <hi>Primae viae,</hi> where
the Inflations begin, or on the Lungs and
Nerves, if either were formerly weakned
<pb facs="tcp:49327:4"/>
by other Diſeaſes; theſe Hypochondriac,
or Pneumonic, or Nervous Inflations,
depend all on the ſame Defluxion of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;
and they all frequently happen in
old Aſthmatics at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>This Defluxion of Serum evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in looſe Stools, fluxes of Urine,
great Spitting, and the Drowſineſs of the
Head in the beginning of the Aſthma Fit:
This Defluxion depends on the Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of Humours, becauſe there is a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh
Heat at that time, which rarefies
the Serum, and drives it through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Glands. I think it not probable that the
Nerves could contain ſo much Serum,
but rather that the ſlimy and flatulent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymia
irritates the Heart to ſtronger
Pulſation, and Excretion of thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
as the bilious Contents do irritate
the Guts. For when we find Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
Humors evacuated, we may rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
ſuppoſe that their Vellication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
their Excretion, rather than any
preternatural Faults of Spirits.</p>
            <p>The Cacochymia which irritates, we
obſerve by the Windineſs and Slimineſs
of Humours evacuated.</p>
            <p>This Inflation in the Stomach, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence
in the Blood, and Inflation in
<pb facs="tcp:49327:4"/>
the Pneumonic Membranes, comprehend
the large Nature of this Diſeaſe; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to theſe our Practical Notions muſt
aim, by ſuppreſſing the Efferveſcence,
which Cures the Defluxion at the ſame
time; and then the flatulent and ſlimy
Cacochymia muſt be Evacuated and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
            <p>If the Aſthma be but partially deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and a falſe Hypotheſis built on that
Deſcription, the Practice anſwering that
is very Impertinent, or injurious.</p>
            <p>Tho' the old Notion of the Aſthma's
being a Defluxion of ſerous Humours, was
certainly true, becauſe evident to our
Senſes, by the Evacuation of Seroſities;
yet the Explication of that Defluxion, by
comparing the Head to a Cupping-Glaſs,
which draws up Humidities by its Heat,
and cauſes them after to deſcend on the
Lungs, was notoriouſly falſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Structure of the ſolid Parts,
and the Circulation of the Fluids.</p>
            <p>This fanciful Notion occaſioned much
impertinent Practice, by Fumes, Errhines,
Apophlegmatiſms, Plaiſters to the Head,
and Iſſues, which have all fallen with the
Hypotheſis they roſe from. Theſe Old
Writers neglected the Efferveſcence, and
<pb facs="tcp:49327:5"/>
the Nervous Inflations I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>The Age ſucceeding obſerv'd a great
Viſcidity in the Humours of the Lungs,
and to that alone, they impute this Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torous
Wheeſing; theſe endeavoured to
Cure this Viſcidity and the Tubercula, by
prodigious pectoral Antidotes, made for
the Aſthma, but ſtill they neglected the
Efferveſcence, and nervous Inflations, and
therefore had no ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The Later Writers, as <hi>Van Helmont,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> have moſt particularly
deſcribed the nervous Symptoms of the
Aſthma, and built their Hypotheſis on
the ſuppoſition, that 'tis a Convulſion;
and that what Cures that will relieve the
Aſthma: This falſe Hypotheſis led them
into an injurious Practice, by giving hot
Tinctures, acrid Gums, and volatil Salts,
and ſulphur Medicines.</p>
            <p>Some Writers, as <hi>Sylvius,</hi> and <hi>Etmuller,</hi>
have obſerved the Hypochondriac Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
in the Stomach, and conclude the
Aſthma is a Hypochondriacal Flatus, and
wants Digeſtives.</p>
            <p>By theſe Obſervations I deſign to prove,
that all our Practical Notions and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
ought to be taken from all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Obſervations in a Diſeaſe, and then
<pb facs="tcp:49327:5"/>
we ſhall avoid the ſeveral Errors into
which many Learned Hypotheſes lead us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and then our Practice will alway be the
ſame, though the general Philoſophy, by
which we explain our Notions, alters
with the Age.</p>
            <p>The old ſenſible Cacochymias muſt ſtill
be allowed, and the Method of Curing
them by contrary Taſtes, becauſe very
rational; therefore though the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Blood be lately diſcover'd, and
the Circulation of the Serum through the
Lymphatic Veſſels, yet theſe Diſcoveries
have made but little Alterations in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Phyſic, but by that we can bette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
explain the Motion of Humours, and the
Tranſlation of Diſeaſes from one Part to
another; therefore this Diſcovery has
only helped us to ſolve ſome Difficulties
we knew not before, and to give Reaſons
for them: Yet ſtill this is the chief Scope
of our Practice, to Evacuate the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Correct the ill Quality of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymia's
anciently deſcribed; and we
muſt uſe the ſame Medicines as the old
Writers adviſe.</p>
            <p>The Nervous Juice is ſtill as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
as formerly, and therefore its Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are inexplicable; and though it
<pb facs="tcp:49327:6"/>
ſtill be a Diſpute whether the Motion of
the Heart in a Fever be by an Irritation of
the fermenting Blood, or the diſordered
Spirits, yet it will be the ſame thing as to
Practice; for by which ſoever of them
the Rarefaction happens in the Aſthma,
I muſt level my Method againſt the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence,
if I will cure the Fit or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it.</p>
            <p>If I compare our Bodies to a Watch,
and the Spirits to the Spring of it, becauſe
on that all its Motions depend, as alſo on
the Spirits in an Animal Body, as in the
Watch: The reaſon of its going falſe,
may be the fault of the Wheels, or many
other Contrivances; and as it would be
abſurd, when the Watch is out of Order,
to lay all the faults on the Spring, becauſe
on that depends all its falſe as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Motion; ſo it is in our Bodies, tho'
the Spirits produce all the regular and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Motions, yet, as in the Watch,
the irregularity muſt depend on other
Organs ill conſtituted, ſo in the Body the
Lungs being oppreſſed, the regular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
becomes a Dyſpnaea; if the
Bronchia be conſtringed, an Aſthma; if
any extraordinary thing or Fume affect the
Skin of the Eyes, Tears immediately flow,
<pb facs="tcp:49327:6"/>
and the Saliva runs upon any Acrimony
which irritates the Palate. The ſame
Motions which are expected in the Nerves
by external Objects, are produced by
ſharp Acrimony in the Humours, which,
if bilious in the Stomach, excite Vomiting
and Purging in the Cholera. If the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
ferment in the Veins, they irritate
the Heart to a violent Circulation, which
raiſes the Fever, which laſts only till the
Fermentation ceaſes; but in thoſe Fevers
which depend on the diſordered Spirits,
they are but of ſmall continuance. And
we muſt obſerve that the Animal Spirits
riſe from the Blood, and have both their
Origine, and good or ill Temper thence;
and tho' they move the Fluids, yet that
external Motion only helps and promotes
the inteſtine Motion of the Humours (as
Beer and Wines are promoted in their
depuration, by being carried on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.)
If the Spirits ſhould circulate
Water through the Veins (and the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical
Serum is not much different) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Blood nor a true natural Heat would
ariſe in the Water by Ten thouſand Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations;
by which we find we muſt look
back to the old Cacochymias, to explain
the Nature of Humours, and the Diſeaſes,
<pb facs="tcp:49327:7"/>
and in the Aſthma we muſt retain the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulencies
anciently obſerved, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of Serum both on the Guts, the

            <p>The Dulneſs and Drowſineſs of the

Nerves in Hyſteric Caſes, as well as the
Flux of Urine in them; but for ſatisfying
the <hi>Helmontians,</hi> I will confeſs the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric
Aſthma has no Defluxion through
the Glands of the Lungs, till it is an old
Diſeaſe; but the Serum in this only makes
its Defluxion through the Glands in the
Stomach, and Guts, and Brain; there is the
ſame Efferveſcencies, the ſame Flatulencies,
and conſequently the ſame Cacochymias
in theſe, as in the Spitting Aſthma.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould deſcribe only the Nature of
Spirits in Wine, all Perſons would believe
I talked like a Philoſopher, but not much
to Edify any one, who only from the
Taſte of the Wine can beſt deſcribe its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whether ſweet, rough, or ſharp, or
bitteriſh; and when it is vitiated, 'tis flat,
or wateriſh, ſour, roapy, windy, bitter,
fetid, full of Lees, and Ferments; theſe are
all ſenſible Vices in Wines, and the ſame in
Animal Humours we call our Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias.
And as the Vintners can Cure all
<pb facs="tcp:49327:7"/>
their Wines by particular Taſtes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being vers'd in the Mechanic, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,
or Microſcopical Obſervations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Wines; ſo may Phiſicians both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
and cure Diſeaſes by a rational
Uſe of ſenſible Obſervations, and the old
<hi>Galenical</hi> Practices built on them, may
yet ſtand unmoved.</p>
            <p>It is a very ſhort way of Explaining
Diſeaſes, to tell us, that the Spirits, or
Archeus, are either weak, or ſtrong; in
a fury, or ſtupid: This Philoſophy is
much admired, tho' not underſtood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Plebeians, or Philoſophers, who
ought to admit nothing either in Diſeaſes
or Medicines, but ſenſible Obſervations,
and thoſe Notions which are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deduced from them. Theſe we can
be certain of, and on theſe the <hi>Galeniſts</hi>
built their Practice, and theſe two ſenſible
Obſervations will always ſtand good;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Aſthma is a Defluxion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all Medicines in the Aſthma
ought to be inciding without Heat.</p>
            <p>The Invention of the Microſcope has
much diſcovered the ſenſible Mechaniſm
of the ſolid Parts; but what Indication
can I take from the Globuli of the Fluid?
Tho' they may help me better to Explain,
<pb facs="tcp:49327:8"/>
yet I fear I ſhall not be inabled by their
Diſcovery eaſily to cure any Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>All the old Notions of the Aſthma
grounded on ſenſible Obſervations, on
which a ſucceſsful Practice depends, ought
ſtill to be retained, and if it be neceſſary
they may be better explained. So in the
Aſthma, we obſerve there is a Defluxion
of Seroſities, and for this Vomits and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were ſucceſsfully uſed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients;
therefore the new Writers unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explode that ſenſible Notion, becauſe
ill explained. In this caſe we muſt mend
the Explication of a Defluxion, and not
ſearch for the Fountain of Rheum in the
Head, but in the Blood, and allow the
Nerves to be the Inſtruments of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion.</p>
            <p>If it were poſſible for us to diſcern all
the Mechanical Structures of the ſolid
Parts, and all the Motions and Figures of
the Fluid, we might then that way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
all our Diſeaſes; but ſince that will
alway be impoſſible to our dull Senſes,
'tis not fair to trouble the Learned with
fancied Figures and Motions, becauſe
poſſible: But by obſerving the ſenſible
effects of Mechanic Motions, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymias,
we do as much as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb facs="tcp:49327:8"/>
For from thence we take our Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of thoſe Remedies which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
vitiated Humours to their natural
State.</p>
            <p>The Chymiſts unjuſtly reject the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenic</hi>
Cacochymias, and explain as well
as cure all Diſeaſes by their Mineral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which ſeems very abſurd, ſince
Minerals are of a very different Nature,
and they are produced by different Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
and Preparations. Animal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
are made by particular Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Circulations, Secretions, in our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiz'd
Bodies, from a pure Milk, but
Minerals ariſe from ſulphur Fumes, and
ſtony Particles coagulated in the Earth.
And all Chymical Product from them are
the Effects of a violent Fire; ſo that by
the mixtures of Chymical Medicines, we
can gueſs but little at the diſeaſed State of
Animal Humours.</p>
            <p>I generally obſerve, that all pure Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Authors know little of Anatomy,
and the Nature of Animal Humours; for
Diſtillation alters the natural or diſeaſed
Conſtitutions, and therefore we cannot
diſcover either by the Fire: The Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
wholly depend on the extolled
Virtue of their Medicine; if prepared
<pb facs="tcp:49327:9"/>
from Antimony, or Quickſilver, it is a
certain Panacea, given in all Diſeaſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Method; and the Chymiſts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
great Knowledge to their Medicine,
in finding out the Diſeaſe, and making
various Operations, or corroborating Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as Nature requires, all which are
more abſurd than any thing in the <hi>Galenic</hi>
Hypotheſis, and ſhew the Ignorance of
the Chymiſt in the nature of Medicines,
and method of Practice.</p>
            <p>The Empyrical Doctors reject all our
Cacochymias; they want general Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
Anatomy, and Chymiſtry, and
ſo cannot make any rational Notion of the
Diſeaſe, from the Conſideration of all its
Symptoms; they know therefore nothing
of any rational Method of Practice, but
go on in the dull Road of Vomiting,
Purging, the Cortex, Steel, Salivating,
Medicinal Waters; whereas the true Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<hi>Galeniſt,</hi> conſiders that Notion of
the Diſeaſe which agrees with all the
Symptoms, and preſcribes ſuch Taſtes as
will cure each Cacochymia; he conſiders
the Conſtitution of the Patient, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of Diſeaſes, and can give a good
Reaſon for altering the common Method,
when neceſſary. He with his Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb facs="tcp:49327:9"/>
more cures ſafely, than with Minerals;
he makes no Preparations, but what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has prepared he gives, in Powder or
Decoction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is Nature's Servant,
and alters his Methods to ſerve her, and
uſes the only means we have to obſerve
her, our Senſes and Experience.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make this my laſt Obſervation,
that the old Writers found out the moſt
uſeful Medicines in the Aſthma.</p>
            <p>There is a natural Inſtinct, by which
all Animals find out their proper Food,
and by the ſame Method they obſerve
what Medicines are moſt ſuitable to their
Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The Stomach prepares all the Humours
for the Veins, and in chuſing of the Food,
it naturally deſires that which is like to
our Humours, to nouriſh them; the
Tongue is well pleaſed with thoſe Taſtes
which agree with the Stomach, becauſe
of the common Membrane which covers
both.</p>
            <p>In a healthful State, the Tongue and
Stomach delight in ſweet Taſtes, becauſe
the Blood and Saliva have that; but in
a diſeaſed State of Humours, thoſe Taſtes
are moſt pleaſant, which alter it; as when
we are too hot, cool Taſtes; when dry,
<pb facs="tcp:49327:10"/>
the Humid; and <hi>e contra,</hi> Nature teaches
us to Cure our ſelves by contrary Taſtes.
And Reaſon and Experience tell us, that
thin Humours require incraſſing viſcid
Taſtes; and the glutinous Humours, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Acrids; and the roughneſs of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Parts, Oily Lenients; and the flux of
all Humours, Styptics. In Fevers we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
deſire Acids; and in ill Digeſtions,
Bitters are grateful.</p>
            <p>'Tis of no ſmall moment in curing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
that our Taſtes can inform us what
Medicines are agreeable to the Stomach
and Humours; and our Smells inform us
what Medicines are ſuitable to our Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits. And ſince the Objects of
theſe two Senſes differ only in the Tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Subſtances; for Bitters, Acerbs,
Acrids, affect our Taſtes in the form of
a Liquor; but a <hi>Halitus</hi> from the ſame
Medicines, affects our Smells; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of this ſmall difference, from the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the Taſtes mentioned, we may
eaſily gueſs at the Efficacy of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Smells.</p>
            <p>The old Writers obſerved, that the
Cacochymia in the Aſthma required Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtives,
becauſe of the Wind and Slime
in the Stomach, and for this they uſed all
<pb facs="tcp:49327:10"/>
the Wormwood Bitters, as Polium,
Southernwood, Mugwort, and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
it ſelf; and all the bitter Gums, as
Ammoniacum, Galbanum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
Ariſtolochia, Briony.</p>
            <p>The ſame Authors obſerved, that the
Medicines in the Aſthma muſt cool, as
well as incide, they therefore uſed Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and mixed divers Bitters and Acrids
with it, to make it more inciding, as
Squills, Orris, Nettles; and they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by their Taſtes, that the Salſo-acids,
ſuch as Niter, and Sal Armoniac, had both
an inciding and cooling Quality. They
obſerved the Flatulencies in the Aſthma,
and for that uſed the Carminatives ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Vinegar, and boiled many Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,
as Thyme, Hyſſop, Calamint in
Oxymels.</p>
            <p>They uſed Anticonvulſives, as Caſtor
with Oxymels, and Rue mixed with Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in Diaſpoliticum, and Briony <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. in
a Cyathus of Vinegar. Neither did they
omit the uſe of Opiates, but gave a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about them.</p>

               <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt have begged your Pardon

            <p>I am of Opinion, that moſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes

which have been diſuſed, and neglected

            <p>THE deſign of the following Treatiſe
will be better underſtood, by giving a
general Scheme of the ſeveral Cauſes
and Species of the Aſthma; but ſince that is a
Depravation of Reſpiration, I think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to treat firſt of Reſpiration, its natural
Cauſes and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and the ſimple Species of it,
when depraved. I ſhall firſt obſerve that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
depends on the Pulſe of the Right
Ventricle of the Heart, which naturally ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulates
an Animal to the Reciprocal Motions
of Inſpiration and Expiration; for the Pulſe
inceſſantly injects Plenty of Blood through the
Arteries of the Lungs, and that ſoon fills the
Blood Veſſels, and oppreſſes the Lungs, which
preſſure being felt by the Nervous Parts, and
that Senſe communicated to the Muſcles ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Inſpiration, they, by their Contraction,
immediately enlarge the Cavity of the
Breaſt, and then the Air by its Elaſticity
preſſes through the Trachea, and expands the
Bladders of the Lungs. This Expanſion of
<pb facs="tcp:49327:12"/>
the Bladder does neceſſarily extend and
ſtretch the Blood Veſſels, which are ſpread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Convex Superficies of the Bladders, and
that ſtretching conſequently leſſens their Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which is alſo compreſſed by the intruding
weight of the Air; therefore both by the Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Lungs, and the Compreſſion of the
Air, the Blood is drove out of the Pneumonic
Veſſels, and the free admittance of more Blood
is hindred, during a continuance of a full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.
This obliges the Animal after
ſome Interval, by a feeling of a new Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from the Blood, and injected by the Pulſe,
and ſtopt in its Circulation during Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to uſe the Muſcles deſigned for Expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which by their contraction pull down the
Ribs and Sternum, and by forcing in the
Belly, force the Diaphragme to go upwards
into the Breaſt; and the Air which came into
the Lungs in a ſtate of Compreſſion, is blown
out intermixt with watery Vapours, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much rarefied by the heat of the Blood
there, it is not unlike the Artificial Wind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in an Aeolopile half filled with Water,
and heated by the Fire. This Rarefaction of
the Air, makes its Efflation more eaſy, in
Coughing, Sneezing, Speaking.</p>
            <p>If either Inſpiration or Expiration be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
a Suffocation ſucceeds, which is a full
<pb facs="tcp:49327:13"/>
ſtop in the Circulatien of the Blood.</p>
            <p>After Expiration the Veſſels are ſhrunk as
the Bladders be, and the Reticular Fibers of
the Bladders, by cloſing them, expreſs the
Blood out of the Veſſels; ſo that both a full
Inſpiration, and Expiration, force the Blood
out of the Lungs, and during the Interval
betwixt them, there is no Circulation thro'
the Lungs, but a ſtop is for that ſhort time
given: And if we inject any Liquor thro'
the Lungs of a dead Animal, it paſſes with
difficulty; therefore the Circulation thro' the
Lungs is more eaſily performed, whilſt the
Lungs are in continual motion of Expanſion,
and cloſing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall next obſerve, That neither Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
nor Expiration, are ſimply neceſſary of
themſelves, but the reciprocal Motion only,
whereby the Bladders of the Lungs are diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and afterwards contracted, is abſolutely
neceſſary for the prolongation of an Animal
Life.</p>
            <p>If the Air were mixed with the Blood in
Inſpiration, that would eaſily appear by the
Airs blowing up the Blood Veſſels, as well as
the Bladders, when we blow up the Lungs by a
pair of Bellows, but we find no Air to paſs into
the Blood Veſſels; the Air therefore can only
cool the Blood by its contact thro' the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
<pb facs="tcp:49327:13"/>
as we feel it cools thro' the Skin; and
for that end, when we are very hot, we deſire
to inſpire cool Air; and it appears that Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
does not impreſs any new Matter on
the Blood, becauſe the Blood is drove out of
the Lungs by Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>Neither is Expiration abſolutely neceſſary,
becauſe many Fumes expire with the Air;
for thoſe Vapors may be collected in <hi>Bartolet's
Pneumatolabium;</hi> and though the quantity
be conſiderable, yet if all that is expired in a
quarter of an Hour, were retained in the
Blood Veſſels, the Animal could not thereby
be killed, ſo ſoon as we ſee it dies, if the
Windpipe be but accidentally ſtopt. Morever
the Animal dies in Mr. <hi>Boyle's Vacuum,</hi>
where there is room enough for the Expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Fumes.</p>
            <p>The third Obſervation I ſhall give, is,
That the true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Reſpiration is for the
preparing the Blood, and freſh Chyle injected
into the Lungs, by the Heart, for a larger
Circulation, by dividing it into ſmaller Parts,
and Globuli, and by procuring them a more
perfect mixture.</p>
            <p>The Circulation of Blood thro' the Lungs
began after the Birth of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> when
the Reſpiration alſo began, and the firſt was
the occaſion of the other. The joint Original
<pb facs="tcp:49327:14"/>
of theſe Motions ſhew, they were deſigned for
the ſame end.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the Blood that is injected
from the Right Ventricle of the Heart, we
may obſerve that it has a mixture of Chyle
and Lympha with it; and that this reciprocal
Motion of Reſpiration may help the mixture
of theſe, appears, becauſe the ſhaking of the
Lungs, as well as the compreſſion of the
Pulſe divides the Globuli of the Blood, which
appears always black, before it has paſſed the
Lungs; but it acquires a floridity afterwards,
as Blood long ſtirred by a Stick does, by the
ſeparation of the Globuli.</p>
            <p>This change of its black colour into a flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,
is all the ſenſible Alteration the Blood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
by paſſing thro' the Lungs, which is
beſt accounted for by the ſeparation of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli:
For in the Feveriſh, the Hyſterical
and Maniac, the Blood is made, becauſe of its
violent Motion, very florid; but in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholic,
where the Globuli are coagulated
together, and where the Motion is languid,
the Blood appears black, as in the Veins,
where the motion is ſlow, but 'tis florid in the
Arteries.</p>
            <p>This mixture of Chyle and Blood in the
Heart being imperfect, it would not be fit
to be injected into the more ſolid Parts, and
<pb facs="tcp:49327:14"/>
the Viſcera, and to paſs the Muſcular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
leſt it ſhould ſtick there. Therefore
it was neceſſary, that this new Maſs of
Humours ſhould have its firſt preparatory
Circulation through a Part compoſed of Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Air Veſſels, which would eaſily
yeild to its Circulation. The Chylous Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being ill mixed, often ſticks in the Lungs,
and produces its Tubercula, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Conſumptions, by evacuating too much
Chylous Matter. By the Blood's ſudden
Return to the Heart, 'tis evident, this ſhort
Circulation was only a Preparative for a
larger, <hi>viz.</hi> by well mixing the new Chyle
with the Blood, and by dividing both into
Globuli more ſmall, and fit for Circulation, by
the compreſſion of the Pulſe, and the ſmallneſs
of the Veſſels it paſſes, and moſt particularly
by the Compreſſion of the Air, which forces
the Blood forward in Inſpiration, and the
Reticular Muſcles in Expiration; ſo that
the moſt probable uſe of Reſpiration is, the
preparing the new Blood and Chyle by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
diviſion, for the next Circulation through
the Arteries.</p>
            <p>I will next conſider the ſeveral Species of
the depravations of our Reſpiration, and
thoſe Cauſes which they uſually depend on.</p>

Ventricle of the Heart.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>II.</hi> On the Obſtruction of the Blood Veſſels

                  <hi>III.</hi> On the Muſcles deſigned in Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            </list>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> If the Blood be copious, fermenting, or
much rarefied, the Pulſe beats high, and full,
and then the Lungs being much oppreſſed by
Blood, that ſtimulates the Muſcles by conſent,
to diſtend the Breaſt fully for a large Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Air to fill the Lungs, and compreſs
the Blood Veſſels, and promote the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through them; and this is to be called a
full, great, or long Reſpiration, and is a ſign
of hot Blood.</p>
            <p>When the quantity of Blood is ſmall, or
when its heat is moderate, the Pulſe ſtrikes
low, the Lungs are not ſo much ſtimulated
to a large Expanſion, and therefore this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
is ſmall; and as the Pulſation of the
Heart declines in Vigor, ſo does the Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
decreaſe in greatneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49327:15"/>
If the Pulſe beat quick, by the ſtimulation
of hot fermenting Blood, then the Lungs are
ſoon filled with Blood, and a denſe or thick
breathing is occaſioned thereby, in which the
Interval is ſhort, and the Inſpiration and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
follow one another quick.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, if the Pulſe be ſlow, and
the Blood be crude, the Lungs are not filled
therewith of a long time, and then the Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is rare, and the Interval betwixt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
and Expiration is long.</p>
            <p>If the Lungs be much oppreſſed, and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated
by the Blood, the Reſpiration is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a ſhort time, and that we call a quick
Breath; but if the Lungs be not much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
the Reſpiration is ſlow, that is, a long
time in doing.</p>
            <p>Short breathing in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is uſed for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of theſe Species, for a ſmall Reſpiration,
for the denſe, for the quick; for all who have
theſe may be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Since the ſeveral Species of ſimple Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
mentioned do depend on the Pulſe, I
may infer, that Reſpiration in its natural
Conſtitution does ſo too; and as there is a
great Analogy betwixt the Pulſe and Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in their motion of Syſtole and Diaſtole,
and the Intervals betwixt them, ſo they both
agree in their uſe; for as the Pulſe, ſo does
<pb facs="tcp:49327:16"/>
the Reſpiration help the Circulation through
the Lungs, and the Separation of the Globuli,
and the moulding of them to fit them for a
large Circulation through the whole Habit of
the Body.</p>
            <p>The Diſeaſes of the Blood alter Reſpiration,
by altering the Pulſe, as Fevers, Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which make Reſpiration denſe or great,
becauſe the Pulſe beats high and quick, and
ſoon fills the Lungs.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> Reſpiration is altered by Obſtructions
of the Blood Veſſels in the Lungs, or elſe by
thoſe of the Air Veſſels.</p>
            <p>An Inflammation, Tumor, Abſceſs, and
all conſtant Obſtructions of the Blood Veſſels,
give a ſtop to the motion of Blood through the
Lungs, and make the Reſpiration denſe and
quick; the ſame is the Reſpiration in the
Dyſpnea from Tumors of the Belly, and in the
Gibbous.</p>
            <p>When the Muſcles labour much for Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Expiration, through ſome Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or Compreſſion of the Bronchia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
we properly call this a Difficulty of Breath:
But if this difficulty be by the Conſtriction of
the Bronchia, 'tis properly the periodic Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:
And if the Conſtriction be great, it is
with Wheeſing; but if leſs, the Wheeſing is
not ſo evident; the Pulſe being ſtopt in the
Aſthma Fit, the Reſpiration is rare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49327:16"/>
The Veſiculae being ſtraitned, or purſed up,
the Inſpiration is ſmall; the labouring and
ſtraining of the Inſpiratory Muſcles, makes
the Reſpiration high.</p>
            <p>The ſtop, or conſtriction, or compreſſion,
makes the Reſpiration ſlow.</p>
            <p>The Muſcles of the Breaſt ſeem to feel the
weight of the Atmoſphere, and labour under
its preſſure, becauſe the Air cannot be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the Lungs, to help the inlarging of
the Breaſt.</p>
            <p>This high and ſlow Reſpiration differs from
the Delirous, becauſe in the Aſthma it is
with labour and wheeſing, tho' theſe Diſeaſes
agree in the low Fever, and coldneſs of the
Extremity.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> Theſe alterations of Reſpiration de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the Muſcles and Spirits.</p>
            <p>Every Organ, when diſeaſed, hinders the
Action in that way or manner it helped it
when well; and therefore if the Muſcles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the Aſthma, they muſt be Convulſively
affected, and then we ſhould obſerve them to
move with twitching, as in Hyſteric Fits,
and ſuch ſtops in Breathing, are always a ſign
of Convulſions.</p>
            <p>If the Breathing be with trembling, 'tis
a ſign of Weakneſs, as in the Palſy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49327:17"/>
If the Breath be ſuddenly ſtopt, it is by the
Convulſion of the Pneumonic Muſcles, as in
an Hyſteric Apnea, when either the Muſcles
of the Belly pull down the Sternum, or elſe
the Diaphragme convulſed, keeps the Breaſt
dilated for ſome time.</p>
            <p>The old Writers thought the Animal Spirits
diverted by odd Phancies in the Delirium,
and that that hindred the Action of the Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic
Muſcles; and therefore a great, and
large, and rare Reſpiration happens, which
was judged by them peculiar to the Delirious;
and ſo in reality it is: For the greatneſs and
freeneſs of the Inſpiration diſtinguiſhes it
from the Aſthma; but the reaſon of the rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is a ſtop on the Pulſation of the Heart,
by the contraction on it in Deliriums; but
if a high Fever be complicated with Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,
the Pulſe and Reſpiration muſt be
quick, ſmall, and denſe, as <hi>Galen</hi> has well
obſerved in Deliriums.</p>
            <p>An Intermitting Pulſe depends on the ſtop
of the Circulation through the Lungs, becauſe
the Left Ventricle of the Heart, by that
ſtop, wants ſufficient Blood, to continue its
conſtant Pulſation, (like a Mill which ſtands
ſtill for want of Water,) and this is plain in
the Aſthma, where the Pulſe intermits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Conſtriction, which ſtops the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
through the Lungs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49327:17"/>
'Tis obſerved that the Aſthmatic cannot
Cough, Sneeze, nor Speak eaſily, becauſe a
ſufficient quantity of Air cannot be drawn
into the Lungs to produce thoſe Actions, and
the Expiration is difficult in them, as well as
Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>The Aſthmatic cannot move ſtrongly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis neceſſary to hold the Breath in all
ſtrong Motions.</p>
            <p>I was ſurprized to obſerve our Great <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s
Miſtake, about the denſe Reſpiration in
the Aſthma, but I perceive he deſcribes only
the continued Aſthma; and his Miſtake was
alſo occaſioned by the Obſervations he made
upon <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Caſes of Aſthmas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
with Fevers; for in both the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and Aſthma joyned with Fevers, he
obſerved <gap reason="foreign">

broke ſhe was Aſthmatic.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> plainly deſcribes the Aſthma
continuing after the Fever was over, and the
Aſthma complicated with Epidemical Fevers,
and then the Aſthmatic have a denſe or a
thick Reſpiration.</p>
            <p>If the Aſthma be without a putrid Fever,
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:49327:18"/>
becauſe the Breath goes no farther than
to the top, and not to the bottom of the
Lungs: But it is plain, that the high
Breathing is ſo called from the lifting up the
Shoulders, and the <hi>Reſpiratio Sublimis</hi> is
a rare, ſlow, and laborious high Reſpiration,
by which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> diſtinguiſhes the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,

               <p>My deſign in this Treatiſe is chiefly to deſcribe
the Periodic Aſthma, to which I have been long
ſubject, and that has given me many Opportunities
of conſidering the Hiſtory of that Diſeaſe more
nicely than it was poſſible for Phyſicians, who have
always an imperfect account of Chronical Caſes
from their Patients; and to that I muſt impute their
ill Succeſs in many Chronical Diſeaſes. I hope this
Treatiſe will excite thoſe Phyſicians, who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Chronical Diſeaſes, to obſerve nicely the
Hiſtory of their Diſeaſe, and to deſcribe all its
ſenſible Phaenomena; to conſider all the Antients
ſucceſsfully uſed in thoſe Chronical Diſtempers,
and to give the Publick a more exact Account from
their own Experience and Obſervation of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of their Chronical Diſtempers, which can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by this means, be fully deſcribed; and never
from the Relation of our Patients; and then any
Ingenious Phyſician may from all the ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
given, eaſily take his Practical Notions.
And though there be many Hypotheſes to explain
the ſenſible Phaenomena, yet the Method of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
being grounded on the Contrariety of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
to ſome ſenſible Fault, in the ſolid or fluid
Parts, the Candid and Rational Practiſers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſagree in their Cure of Diſeaſes, which in all
Ages will be the ſame. Though a deſire of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
alters the Philoſophy, and ſometimes the
Medicines, to the great Prejudice of Phyſic, whoſe
uſeful Obſervations are thereby diſcredited, and
experienced Medicines diſuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49327:22"/>
I ſhall not treat much of the Continued Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
becauſe they are depending on other Diſeaſes,
both in their Cauſes and Cures, which are well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by many Authors; as for Inſtance, the
Dropſy of the Breast: And for that the common
Method of Cure is uſed, Purging by Pills of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogia,
and the <hi>Pil. Lunares,</hi> and <hi>Elaterium,
Diuretics, Salts,</hi> and with theſe may be compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
the Anti-Aſthmatics, upon the occaſions of
Fits; as the <hi>Oxymel,</hi> and <hi>Acetum Scylliticum,</hi>
and <hi>Laudanum:</hi> But my chief Aim in theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatic
Aſthmas, is the Curing the Original Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
without which no Anti-Aſthmatic can do any
good.</p>
               <p>I have in the following Treatiſe recommended
a Diſpenſatory-Medicine, <hi>Acetum Scylliticum,</hi>
which is a bitter Acid; (and that I ſometimes
make more grateful by Aromatics, or turning it
into a Syrup with Sugar for nice Palates,) this
gave me an occaſion of conſidering the whole Claſs
of Acids, and to propoſe a farther Tryal of other
mixt Acids in the Aſthma. The Acid Syrups and
Oxymels I give in the Morning in a Glaſs of
Water in the Summer, and the Aceta chiefly, if
nauſeous, at Night, for many Months.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
TREATISE
OF THE
ASTHMA.</head>
            <p>SINCE the Cure of the <hi>Aſthma</hi>
is obſerved by all Phyſicians,
who have attempted the Eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
of that Chronical Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
to be very difficult, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unſucceſsful; I may thence inferr,
That either the true Nature of that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
is not thoroughly underſtood by
them, or they have not yet found out
the Medicines by which the Cure may
be effected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49327:26"/>
It is my Deſign in this Treatiſe, to
Enquire more particularly into the
Nature of this Diſeaſe; and, according
to that Notion I can give of it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
thoſe Methods and Medicines
which appear to me moſt likely to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
its Cure, or, at leaſt, to palliate it.</p>
            <p>I have ſuffered under the Tyranny
of the <hi>Aſthma</hi> at leaſt Thirty Years,
and therefore think my ſelf to be fully
informed in the Hiſtory of that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe:
And ſince I have Practiſed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
I have made many trials for the
Relieving and Preventing of the Fits,
and out of Compaſſion to thoſe Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Patients, I deſign to relate what
I have found uſeful both to my ſelf and
others.</p>
            <p>The Method I ſhall take in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
is, Firſt to deſcribe the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
preceding the Fit, and thoſe which
attend it, and the different Intervals
of the Periodic Fit: And that this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the <hi>Aſthma</hi> may be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I will give the Hiſtory of my own
<hi>Aſthma,</hi> which I ſhall, for diſtinction
ſake, name the True Flatulent <hi>Aſthma,</hi>
and hereafter give my Reaſon for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49327:26"/>
it ſo. I have for many Years
kept a Diary of that Diſeaſe, out of
which I can give a more true Account,
than if I had now Recollected what has
long ſince paſſed.</p>
            <p>I will afterwards give the Hiſtory of
the <hi>Aſthma,</hi> which is commonly called
<hi>Hyſterical,</hi> from the Obſervations of an
Ingenious Lady, who has ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Diſeaſe Twenty Years, and
gave me that Account, in Writing an
Anſwer to many Queries I ſent her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aſthma</hi> is a long Diſeaſe, and it
requires a long Obſervation to give a
true Account of its Symptoms, Changes,
and various Cauſes, which common
Patients cannot nicely obſerve; and
therefore I thought it very neceſſary in
the Firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe, to
give a full Hiſtory of the Aſthmatic
Fits.</p>
            <p>In the next Chapter I will deſcribe
the Viſcous and Flatulent Cacochymia
of the Chyle, Chylous <hi>Lympha, Serum,</hi>
and that Rarefaction of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
which give the chief Diſpoſition to
the Fits of the true <hi>Aſthma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49327:27"/>
In the Third Chapter I will deſcribe
the Accidental Fits of the <hi>Aſthma</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the Air; and its Changes;
and ſhew that they are real Fits of an
Ephemera Fever, ſuch as a ſlimy flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Blood, and windy Spirits, are
capable of. And I will enumerate all
the other evident Cauſes, as Diet, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
Paſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I will there
obſerve the ſeveral Diſeaſes on which
the <hi>Aſthma</hi> depends, as a Symptom,
and give ſome Remarks for diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true <hi>Aſthma</hi> from other Species
of the Dyſpnea.</p>
            <p>In the Fourth Chapter I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the ſeveral Indications neceſſary
for the Cure of the Fits, and thoſe
which are to be perſued for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Returns; I will obſerve what
I have found injurious to that Diſeaſe,
and deſcribe thoſe Medicines I have
found moſt Beneficial.</p>
            <p>I have frequently compared my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of my <hi>Aſthma,</hi> with thoſe of
my Patients, and found them much
alike: But ſome variety of Symptoms
have appeared in all I have Diſcourſed.
I have put my Notion of the Diſeaſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49327:27"/>
to ſome very intelligent Aſthmatics;
and they agree with me that there is a
ſlight Fever, and windy Rarefaction of
Humours in the Fit, which I call an
Efferveſcence; and this will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Medicines I uſe, which
are of that Taſte, which Experience has
obſerved to ſucceed well in the Cure of
the Flatulency of our Humours, and
their Rarefactions, by an Efferveſcence.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <head type="sub">Containing a Deſcription of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
preceding the Fits of the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent
<hi>Aſthma,</hi> and of the Fits
themſelves, with the ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
betwixt them.</head>
            <p>IN the Afternoon which precedes
the Fit of the Flatulent <hi>Aſthma</hi>
(which is commonly called the
Humid, or Spitting <hi>Aſthma)</hi> about
two or three hours after Meat, moſt
Aſthmatics are ſenſible of a great ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or fulneſs about the Pit of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
which is then much oppreſſed
with Wind, and an inſipid Ructus riſes
from it; and this fulneſs of the Stomach
is the firſt ſign of the enſuing Fit; it
appears before any Cough or Straitneſs
happens in the Lungs. This Fulneſs
at the Stomach ſeems to me to depend
partly on the Windy Rarefaction of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49327:28"/>
Digeſting Meat contained in its Cavity,
and alſo on the Inflation of the Nervous
Fibres of the Skins of the Stomach.</p>
            <p>An Efferveſcence in the Blood ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
this Inflation of the Stomach;
for theſe Aſthmatics are obſcurely hot
in the Night, and cannot bear the heat
of the Bed-Cloths on their Breaſts; all
hot things diſorder them more, as ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by the Fire, Wine, Tobacco, all
cool Liqours, as Water, relieve the
Fulneſs at Stomach; the Iſſues are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
inflamed before the Fits, and
very ſore and bleed: There appears a
great Dulneſs and Fulneſs of the Head,
with a ſlight Head-ach, and great Sleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
towards the Evening before the
Fit, and frequently great Retchings
and Yawning many times, and towards
Night a great quantity of pale Water
is made, and the ſame pale Water all
that Night, and alſo all the firſt day of
the Fit; but though the Water be pale
before, and in the beginnings of the
Fits, yet it is as high coloured after it,
and appears plainly to have a Feveriſh
Colour and Sediment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49327:29"/>
After this obſcure Efferveſcence in the
Blood, ſucceeds a Rarefaction of the
Spirits in the Nerves, and Membranes
of the Lungs themſelves, for they feel
rigid, ſtiff, or inflated; there is a great
Reſtleſneſs on the Spirits all the Day
before the Fit; the Head ſeems filled
with Fumes, or Serous Humours, with
ſome pain; the Limbs appear heavy
and unfit for motion, the Breaſt has the
ſame weight and heavineſs as appears in
the Limbs, the Aſthmatic ſeem to ſuck
in their Breath, and wheeze a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Night: This Straitneſs of Breath
ſeems to be for want of an eaſy Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
the Diaphragme cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
it ſelf to move downwards, and
that occaſions a laborious Breathing to
draw in Air; the <hi>Trachea,</hi> or its <hi>Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi>
have their Membranous and Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Fibres Contracted, by which the
Wheezing is made in Expiration. The
Aſthmatic ſeem to have a Convulſive
Cough before the Fit, and ſometimes
a little ſlimy Phlegm is ſpit up, but both
of them are very inconſiderable. The
Lungs in the Humid <hi>Aſthma</hi> do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
appear to be much oppreſſed with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49327:29"/>
Phlegm before the Fit, and at the end
of the Fit, the Straitneſs goes off before
any conſiderable quantity of Phlegm is
ſpit up, which would not happen if the
Straitneſs depended on a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Phlegm.</p>
            <p>At firſt waking, about one or two
of the Clock in the Night, the Fit of
the <hi>Aſthma</hi> more evidently begins, the
Breath is very ſlow, but after a little
time more ſtrait, the Diaphragme ſeems
ſtiff, and tied, or drawn up by the
<hi>Mediaſtinum.</hi> It is not without much
difficulty moved downwards, but for
enlarging the Breaſt in Inſpiration, the
Intercoſtal Muſcles which ſerve for the
raiſing of the Ribs, and lifting up the
Breaſt, ſtrive and labour more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently,
and the Scapular and Lumbar
Muſcles, which ſerve for ſtrong Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
join all their force, and ſtrain
themſelves to lift up the Breaſt and
Shoulders, for the enlarging the Cavity
of the Breaſt, that the Lungs may have
a place ſufficient for their Expanſion,
and the Air may more plentifully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49327:30"/>
The Aſthmatic is immediately ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to riſe out of his Bed, and ſit
in an erect Poſture, that the weight of
the <hi>Viſcera</hi> may pull down the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme.</p>
            <p>The Muſcles which ſerve for Expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cannot eaſily perform the Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> being hindred in that
by the Stiffneſs or Inflation of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
in the <hi>Thorax;</hi> for though the
Aſthmatic expire more eaſily than they
can draw in their Breath, yet the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
is very ſlow and leaſurely, and
Wheezing, and the Aſthmatic can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cough, Sneeze, Spit, or Speak
freely; and in the Aſthmatic Fit the
Muſcular Fibres of the <hi>Bronchia</hi> and
<hi>Veſiculae</hi> of the Lungs are Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and that produces the Wheezing
Noiſe, which is moſt obſervable in
Expiration: But it is evident to me,
that all the Lobes of the Lungs are not
conſtringed alike. For in the Fit I
could never breath tolerably, if I lay
or leaned on the Left ſide, which made
me very ſenſible that all my Straitneſs
lay on the Right ſide of my Lungs, and
that inclined or naturally occaſioned me
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49327:30"/>
to lie on that ſide during the Fit; but
after the Fit was over, I always lie eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
on the Left ſide: I perceive the
Right ſide to be moſt affected in my
Caſe, and from the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eall the Spit does
plainly riſe when the Fit goes off.</p>
            <p>After the Fit is begun, the Stomach
ſuffers a great Inflation of its Muſcular
Membranes, and alſo a great Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of its Contents; and this Flatuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
oppoſes the deſcent of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,
and ſtraitens the Breath much
more. If the Fits be Extreme, the
Aſthmatic often Vomits green or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Choler: Cold Liquors beſt agree
with the Stomach; and hot Liqours,
whether Vinous or naturally hot, make
the Flatuoſity, very Vehement, and
Suffocating.</p>
            <p>I muſt obſerve that the Fit of the
<hi>Aſthma</hi> happens often after Purging,
Vomiting, or Faſting, when none or
few Contents are in the Stomach, and
then this Flatuoſity muſt be a Nervous
affection of the Membranes: But I
cannot but confeſs, that if any Surfeit
or Fulneſs be in the Stomach, when the
<hi>Aſthma</hi> Fit firſt ſeizes, the Danger of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49327:31"/>
it is very great, and the Fit very Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and longer, with much more Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſities.</p>
            <p>The Aſthmatick is extremely hot,
burning and inclined to Sweat, as in
the Fit of a Fever, and his Pulſe is quick,
though unequal; and all the Feveriſh
Symptoms continue during his keeping
in Bed, which is not ſafe in a ſtrong
Fit, nor tolerable to the Aſthmatic,
who is neceſſitated to riſe into the cool
Air; and after he is riſen out of Bed, a
looſe Stool frequently happens from the
great working in the Belly, occaſioned
by the Fit: And I have often heard the
Aſthmatic complain, that the Fits of
Inflation fall lower in their Bellies than
ordinary, and then the Fits go off with
leſs ſhortneſs of Breath, and a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wind downwards, with ſome
Stools.</p>
            <p>The Motion of the Muſcles of the
Heart is altered or ſtop'd by the Fit;
for the Pulſe is weak and intermitting,
and the Hands and Feet cold, for want of
a free Circulation, and the Face often
blackiſh by the Stagnation of the Blood
in it, and for the ſame reaſon the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49327:31"/>
are very much ſubject to Swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Palpitation of the Heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Blood Veſſels are conſtringed,
as well as the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> by the Inflation
of the Nerves and Membranes; for the
<hi>Par Vagum</hi> ſends Branches both to the
Heart and Lungs, and Orifice of the
Stomach, where the firſt Nervous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
or Inflations begin, and that by
the ſame Nerves is communicated to
the Heart and Lungs and Membranes
of the Breaſt.</p>
            <p>The Intercoſtal Nerves are alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
for that communicates with the
<hi>Par Vagum</hi> Fibres, by which alſo the
Nerves of the Guts are inflated in the
Fit, and that ſends Branches to the
<hi>Gula,</hi> which can ſcarce ſwallow in the
Fit, but it makes a Noiſe like breaking
of Wind. From theſe Nerves come
the Inflations in the Belly and Stomach
and the frequent Eructations.</p>
            <p>The Lips ſeem to be drawn into a
poſture for Sucking, the Eyes ſeem to
ſtart, and ſhed Tears involuntarily,
which frequently colour the Skin near
the Eyes yellow, or blackiſh, the Face
is pale or livid, the Muſcles of the whole
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49327:32"/>
Body ſeem to ſubſide, or loſe their
Plumpneſs, for want of the Circulation
of Blood through them, and all Motion
of the Limbs is languid.</p>
            <p>After ſome continuance of the Fits
the Head often Aches much, and is
very dull, and troubled with dreaming
Fancies, and that this depends on the
ſtopping the Circulation, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe Combing the Head back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
very much relieves it, by promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Circulation that way; the
Aſthmatic during the Fit have a great
dullneſs to ſleep, but ſleep little till the
Fit has ſpent the Windy Spirits; and in
the firſt day of the Fit they have often
broken ſleep ſitting in a Chair, leaning
on one ſide, or forward, but cannot
lean backwards: A ſtrait Room, and
a fire in it, are extraordinary offenſive,
as well as any Duſt, or ill Smell during
the Fit; and all things heated by the
fire, or of a vinous Nature; and all
things which oppreſs or ſtraiten the
Breaſt, encreaſe the Suffocation.</p>
            <p>If the Fit laſt but two or three hours
after riſing out of Bed, the ſtraitneſs
abates, and ſome raw Gelly-like Phlegm,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49327:32"/>
like the White of an Egg, or the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gum Tragacanth, is ſpit up,
both in the Humid and Old Hyſteric
<hi>Aſthma,</hi> and that is ſtreaked with black,
like a Feather, or Spiders Web.</p>
            <p>When a ſhort Fit happens, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
only with Wind, and Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
with a feveriſh quick Pulſe, and
a diſpoſition to Sweat, and the Water
is higher coloured in the Morning, no
oppreſſion at the Stomach precedes, nor
no pale Water, and but a little ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
over Night: This I call a Spitting
Fit; ſuch as my <hi>Aſthma</hi> was before it
ſetled into Periods. And theſe Fits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on Diſorders in Diet, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of Weather; and appeared to
me a Fit of an Ephemera Fever.</p>
            <p>If the Fits continue long, <hi>viz.</hi> two,
three, or four days, the firſt two days
none or little Phlegm is ſpit up, but
on the third or fourth day it is Cough'd
up ſomewhat digeſted, and leſs viſcid,
of a white, greeniſh, or yellow Colour;
and in old Aſthmatics, ſweet in Taſte
like Blood, or Liquoriſh, or elſe a little
putrid, ſaltiſh, or acid; and the Spit
of the Aſthmatic is often ſtreaked with
Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49327:33"/>
The Fits uſually go off in three, four
or five Days clearly, ſo that little
Phlegm is ſpit afterwards, till the next
Fit.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of ſetled Periodic Fits
in my ſelf, were an Intermitting Fever;
of theſe I kept a Calander for ſeven
Years, that I might better obſerve their
Intervals, and their reſpect to the
Moon and Weather; and ſuch Phyſick
I uſed for them. The Obſervations I
made thence are as follow.</p>
            <p>I obſerved that in the Winter were
ſixteen Fits, but in the Summer Months
I had twenty Fits; and in the Summer
the Fits were more ſharp and longer,
and that I ſpit more digeſted Phlegm
then: In <hi>Auguſt</hi> I always had the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Fits. The longer the Fits, the
greater the Intervals; the long Fits
laſted 3, 4, or 5 days; the ſhorter the
Fits, the ſhorter were the Intervals.</p>
            <p>The ſhort Intervals were 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, or 7 days; the longeſt Intervals 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 days. The
Winter Months I reckon from <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
till <hi>March,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
the Summer Months.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49327:33"/>
In Rainy Weather or towards Snow,
and in the Foggy, I am frequently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of a great ſtraitneſs at the Stomach,
ſo that ſuch Weather gives an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a Fit before either the Rain or
Snow fall; but in all that kind of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ſometimes miſſed a Fit.</p>
            <p>The Fits uſually returning once in a
Fortnight, they frequently happen near
the Change of the Moon; but I could
not perceive they kept any certain times
either before or after, but ſometimes
they happened near an equal diſtance
from both the Changes; but, I believe,
as the ſeveral Phaſes of the Moon alter
the Weather, by that means it produces
ſome Alterations on the Spirits of the
Aſthmatic.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Helmont</hi> obſerves the Influence the
Moon has on an Aſthmatic; <hi>Exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

quas ideo praeſentit &amp; praeſagit.</hi>
And I always upon unexpected Fits;

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49327:34"/>
A Change from a Froſt to a Thaw
frequently gave me a Fit, with a Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
Pain in the Temples.</p>
            <p>A change of the Wind into the <hi>East</hi>
often produced a Fit.</p>
            <p>In the Intervals of the Fits I unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully
tried theſe Medicines. I drank
many Pectoral Drinks, as <hi>Gill</hi> and <hi>Hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop,</hi>
and ſometimes <hi>Rue</hi> in Diet-Drinks;
the laſt was good for the Wind, but
troubled my Spirits; I uſed <hi>Syrup of
Garlick, Syrup of Sulphur, Tincture of
Gum Ammoniacum</hi> in <hi>Elder-flower Water,

            <p>None of the preceding Methods would
ſucceed, but increaſed the ſeverity of my

relieved me for three or four months

and the Fits returned as bad as

my Phlegm, and ſtop'd up my
Lungs. Next Summer I drank the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
at <hi>Bath,</hi> where indeed I had no Fit;
but they returned ſeverely when I came

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49327:35"/>
I found I had read moſt of the Modern
Writers, and hitherto had tried their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
and hot Pectorals, and Cephalics
in vain; I believed, by my ill ſucceſs in
their way, that they never underſtood
this Diſeaſe; and therefore turned over
ſome of the Old Writers, <hi>Galen, Aegineta,
Aetius, &amp;c.</hi> where I found more rational
Notions, and was directed by them to
the uſe of that Medicine which does very
much relieve and prevent my Fits, of
which I will hereafter give an account.</p>
            <p>I cannot remember the firſt Occaſion
of my Aſthma, but have been told that
it was a Cold when I firſt went to School:
As my Aſthma was not Hereditary from
my Anceſtors, ſo, I thank God, neither
of my two Sons are inclined to it, who
are now paſt the Age in which it ſeized
me. I at firſt was only troubled with it
at the great Changes of the Year, and
preſerved my ſelf tolerably in Health for
ſome Years, by taking Purging Pills fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently:
I never had any conſiderable
Fit in <hi>Oxford</hi> for Twelve Years that I
lived there, which I imputed to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that Air, and the ſpare Diet there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but as oft as I came into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Native Air, I was uſually viſited
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49327:35"/>
with a ſevere Fit or two: The Air of a
Town makes the Fits more ſevere when
they happen, but I do not think the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
ſo much expoſed to the Accidents
of the Weather in a City, as in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
The Aſthma being a Fever Fit, all
hot Regimens and hot Air, ſuch as that
of a City, may diſpoſe ſome lean hot
Bodies to Coughs, and conſequently Fits;
but I could never obſerve my Fits to
come oftner in <hi>London</hi> than in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
only I find them more ſevere in a
cloſe Air, as they would be in a cloſe hot
Room, when they happen.</p>
            <p>I have met with ſome Aſthmatics,
who have been ſo for fifty Years, as they
informed me, and yet in tolerable Health,
without any conſiderable decay of their
Lungs, or diſability to perform their uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Employments, which I oft reflect on
to Encourage my Patients, and my ſelf,
who yet can Study, Walk, Ride, and
follow my Employment, Eat and Drink
and Sleep as well as ever I could; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
am I yet ſenſible of any Decay in my
Lungs, though I believe all old Aſthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
have ſeveral Tubercula there, and
the Glands of the Trachea are much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed
by the frequent Defluxion of a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49327:36"/>
through them; but the frequent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorations
carry off the fulneſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and I have obſerved very few to
die of the Aſthma Fit, but the frequency
of that often occaſions Conſumptions in
lean Habits, and Dropſies, Lethargies,
or Inflammations of the Lungs in fatter
Conſtitutions, which prove fatal.</p>

and thoſe of ſeveral ſorts, as Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
Laughing, and Silent; and in one
of theſe Fits Tobacco being blown on my
face recovered me; but in other Fits
this being repeated, I found my Breath
become ſtreight: This difficulty of
breathing was much more uneaſy to me
than any of the Fits of the Mother. And
after this I was troubled ſometimes with

But after I was married, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

great Extremity five or ſix Hours, and
went off generally at Noon; and after
that, till the next Fit, I was tolerably
well, but for ſeven weeks time I never
went into Bed till after my Fit was off.
I ſlept in a Chair leaning on a Table,

Then Treacle Water; afterwards Prince

all the Varieties of Hyſterical Medicines,

               <p>My Fits have often return'd, and the

ten Years; afterward the Bark ſometimes
fail'd me, and then I bled oft.</p>
               <p>About 15 Years ago Spring and Fall I

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49327:38"/>
once a Week in that courſe with <hi>Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picra;</hi>
for all Potions were more apt to

without Purging, which made me worſe,

               <p>Four Years ago after my Fever, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

I am always moſt eaſy when I am

in the Humours, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces

            <p>THAT the Preternatural State of
the Chyle in the Aſthma is a Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent
Crudity, appears becauſe all flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
things, as new Beer, Turneps, Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage,
and all Roots which have a Muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
and Acrimony mixt, very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree
with the Aſthmatic, by irritating
the Spirits, and creating a Windineſs in

            <p>Frequent Eructations precede the Fits
of the Aſthma, and a Fulneſs is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complained of in the Stomach before
the Fits.</p>
            <p>That the ill ſtate of Chyle ſupplies the
new Matter before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it of the Aſthma
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49327:40"/>
appears, becauſe the Oppreſſion at the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and ſome ſmall ſtraitneſs of Breath
happens within two or three hours after
Dinner; and the Exacerbation of the fit
happens in the Night, about two a Clock,
when the Chyle is moſt plentiful in the
Blood; and no other Humour is ſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Fermentation and Flatuoſity as the
Chyle is: For if the Chyle be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
digeſted by a thorough Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it reſembles new Ale unripe, which
is very Windy; and this cauſes the ſame
Inflation that the other does in the <hi>Primae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Agitation of the Spirits, and their
Expanſion of the fermenting Maſs, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the fermentation and diſſolution of the
Meat in the Stomach; which being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deficient, or elſe ſtopt in their motion
by a viſcid Slime, the Spirits remain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſcated
in the roapy Liquor, and there
raiſe Bubbles, which we call Wind.</p>
            <p>It is commonly obſerved, that fulneſs
of Diet, and all Debauches, render the
Fits moſt ſevere, and a temperate Diet
make the Fits more eaſy. I have heard
ſome Objections againſt the Digeſtion of
Meats by a fermentation in the Stomach,
to which I will give the Solutions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49327:40"/>
'Tis objected that Fruit and new Wine
are eaſily fermented, but not eaſily dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
which they ought to be if Digeſtion
was made by a fermentation.</p>
            <p>To this I may anſwer, that that kind
of Diet eaſily raiſes Windineſs in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and therefore ſome fermentation
happens after eating thereof, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
the Ructus, and Swelling of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and 'tis rather an exceſs of fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to which that kind of Diet is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which produces the Fevers, Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and Fluxes to thoſe that uſe it, than
a defect of the Digeſtion or Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And, as we obſerve, Wines may
be under-fermented and crude, or elſe
over-fermented or acid; ſo we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
two contrary faults in Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
the one when the Meat is crude,
ſlimy, windy, acerb; or elſe when the
Meat is over digeſted, and becomes acid,
bitter, ſalt, putrid.</p>
            <p>'Tis further objected, that Bones, Fleſh,
Fat, and putrid things are eaſily digeſted,
and yet difficultly fermented.</p>
            <p>To this I may Anſwer, That Fat is of all
things the moſt difficultly digeſted, and as
difficultly fermented: I have obſerv'd Suet
to lie in the Stomach of a Dog fed with it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49327:41"/>
twelve hours undigeſted, and very little
altered as I found when I open'd him.
Fat Meats often go whole through the
Body unaltered; and Butter is heavy or
hard of Digeſtion to many Stomachs: As
to Bones they lie long in the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their diſſolution; 'tis their Gelly they
are reſolved into by digeſtion that is fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
in the Stomach, but the hard
Parts go off undiſſolved in the Foeces.</p>
            <p>The New Digeſter diſſolves them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Broth, by Heat, rarifying the Air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in their Pores, and in their Juices,
and the gentle heat of the Stomach in a
lower degree, and a longer time rarifies
the Air in the Animal Juices contain'd in
the Bones, which may occaſion the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſolid parts of the Bones, and a
full digeſtion of the Liquors iſſuing from
them.</p>
            <p>Putrid things are eaſily digeſted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
half fermented, and therefore they
are apt to ferment too much in our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs,
and occaſion Surfeits.</p>
            <p>Fleſh Meats are eaſily made putrid, and
that is the higheſt degree of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The external Heat of the Hen Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquates
the Humours contained in the
Egg when 'tis hatching; and if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49327:41"/>
of the Foetus miſcarries, nothing
is more putrid; which is an evident proof
of a Fermentation in Animal Humours:
And if the Digeſtion of Fleſh in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
be obſerved, the Foetor and Acid
ſmell from a Carnivorous Stomach may
more plainly prove the diſſolution of it,
by a putrefactive Fermentation.</p>
            <p>The common Objection is, That the
Contents of the Stomach, when diſtill'd,
yield no inflammable Spirit, and therefore
are not fermented.</p>
            <p>To this I may anſwer, That no Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſtay long enough in the Stomach
to be perfectly fermented; and till Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables
are perfectly fermented to a ſharp
Acidity, they do not yield their inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Spirits; but the Fermentation in
the Stomach is continued but ſome few
hours for the diſſolution of the Meat,
which is then carried out into the Guts,
where the Choler and ſalt Lympha being
mixt with the Chylous Maſs, a ſtop may
thereby be given to all farther Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. But that an inflammable Spirit
may be diſtilled from Animal Humours
fully prepared, appears by a remarkable
Inſtance given in the <hi>Collectanea Chymica,</hi>
in the Anatomy of the Bile, where the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49327:42"/>
Author deſcribes a volatile Spirit from
Choler diſtilled in B. M. which is inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
like Spirit of Wine.</p>
            <p>Not only the Chyle and Alimentary
Maſs in the Stomach and Inteſtines have
their preternatural State, but the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha
Lactea (which is a Chylous Humour
ſeparated from the Chyle by the Mucous
Glands in the Stomach and Lungs) is
too crude, ſlimy and flatulent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
leſs fit to promote the Fermentation
of the Meat in the Stomach. This is
evident and viſible if a Vomit be given to
an Aſthmatic, a great quantity of this
frothy, crude, or ſlimy Mucilage is eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated;
and this way a great eaſe is given
to the Paroxyſms, ſome Matter of the
Diſeaſe being evacuated, which increaſed
the Inflation of the Stomach; and this
viſcid Saburra in the Stomach is moſt
obſervable in old Aſthmatics, both in
thoſe that have the Spitting and Hyſterical
Aſthma.</p>
            <p>In the Spitting Aſthma this ſlimy
Lympha is very evident, and gives the
Matter of the viſcid Phlegm uſually ſpit
up at the end of the Fit: It at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
clear, like a Solution of <hi>Gum Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacanth,</hi>
but after ſome days like the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49327:42"/>
viſcid and digeſted Phlegm in a Cold.</p>
            <p>All kinds of viſcid gummoſe Meats or
Drinks ſtop and oppreſs the Stomach and
Lungs of the Aſthmatic, and occaſion
their Fits, which is by ſupplying a great
quantity of viſcid Chyle and Lympha,
which will not eaſily circulate through
the Lungs of the Aſthmatic, which are
frequently obſtructed by crude Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula.
The Serum is made of the Chyle,
and therefore muſt have the ſame kind of
Flatulency and Slimineſs as the Chyle has.
In the hot Scorbutical Temperaments 'tis
deficient and viſcid, which occaſions ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tubercula or Inflammations in the
Lungs; or elſe 'tis too wateriſh in the
Hydropical, or very apt to Efferveſcences
in the Hyſterical and Hypochondriacal.
The pale Water in the Fit is the thinner
part of the Serum occaſion'd by ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
of the Lymphatics. For as in
the Fits of the Stone, the Urine is pale,
becauſe of the Conſtriction of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatics,
through which the remaining Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
ought to be carried off, upon the
Secretion of part of it through the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys;
but the Pain cauſes that Conſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And in the Aſthma, the Inflations,
by ſtopping the Circulation of the Serum
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49327:43"/>
through the Lymphatics, occaſion this
great Diabetes in the Aſthma; as will
hereafter be more fully explain'd.</p>
            <p>This defect of Digeſtion and Mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous
Slime in the Stomach, are very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
and obſerv'd by Writers, and were
ſuppoſed the immediate cauſe of the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;
but their ill ſucceſs with Pectorals
and Digeſtives, occaſions my doubt of
that Aſſertion; eſpecially ſince I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Aſthma from a more probable
Cauſe, and ſhew that the mentioned Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
of the Humours, are produced
by the long continuance of it, and do not
produce the Fits of the Aſthma, but
only make them worſe, or diſpoſe us to
them.</p>
            <p>All Chronical Cauſes, as the Gout,
Conſumptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> produce the ſame vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcid
Saburra, with Windineſs in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and yet are not uſually attended
with Aſthmatic Fits, and the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lungs, the Tubercula in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,
the great clog of Phlegm in
Catarrhs, ſtuff and oppreſs the Lungs,
and occaſion a Dyſpnaea, but do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
give Aſthma Fits; and therefore
we muſt ſeek for ſome other Cauſe of
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:49327:43"/>
The Blood of Aſthmatics is very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Efferveſcences; and whatſoever
produces that, occaſions the Fits; as great
Heats or Cold, violent Motions of the
Body or Mind, any Exceſs in Eating and
Drinking, or Venereal Pleaſures; the
Heat of the Bed, the Changes of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Rain, Snow, or from Froſt to a
Thaw; the Alteration of Clothes, the
Changes of the Air at Spring and Fall:
All theſe are cauſes of the Fever we call
an Ephemera, and they alſo produce the
Fits of the Aſthma; from whence I may
infer, that the Nature of the Aſthma con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in a ſlow Efferveſcence, or Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
of our Blood, on which the ſeveral
Symptoms of that Diſeaſe depend.</p>
            <p>The common Ephemera happens in a
healthful ſtate of Blood, when 'tis not
tinctured by any morbid Cacochymia;
and that Ebullition is attended with the
common Symptoms of Fevers; as Heat,
Pains, quick and high Pulſe, Thirſt, and
ſometimes high-colour'd Water: But in
the Aſthma, the Efferveſcence happens in
a mucilaginous ſtate of Humours, and
therefore the Heat is ſometimes obſcure,
the Urine pale, the Pulſe quick but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
ſome Pains in the Head, or Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49327:44"/>
attends it; and if the Patient keep his
Bed in the beginning of the Fit, they are
very hot, and inclinable to Sweat; and at
the latter end of the Fit, the Urine has
evidently a feveriſh Sediment.</p>
            <p>The great Conſtriction of the Pulmonic
Arteries, and the other Blood Veſſels, as
well as the Heart it ſelf, in the Fit, ſtops
the Pulſe of Aſthmatics, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
the feveriſh Ebullition, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
the Heat, high Pulſe, and high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd
Urine at firſt.</p>
            <p>The quick and ſtrong motion of the
Heart promotes the Ebullition in Fevers;
and if by Opiates we can ſtop the violent
Pulſation, the Efferverſcence conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſubſides.</p>
            <p>That the Nerves may ſtop the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
very much in the Aſthma, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the frequent Circumvolutions
they have about the Blood Veſſels near
the Lungs. And ſince the Nerves make
an evident conſtriction on the Bronchia
during the Fit, we may obſerve by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
Pulſe, that they make the ſame
ſort of Ligature upon the Arteries, and
thereby check the high Efferveſcence of
the Aſthmatic Fever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49327:44"/>
The ferment of this Aſthmatic Fever is
the flatulent <hi>Succus Nutriticus,</hi> which by
reaſon of ſome Crudity is not fully dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
into Blood, but is thence eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
by the changes of the Air, Diet,
or other external Accidents; or elſe of it
ſelf, like as in other intermitting Fevers,
once in 10 Days it ſeparates from the
Blood, and by making its Conſiſtence
turbid, it produces in it an obſcure Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence,
by which the ſeveral great Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
of the Aſthma are produced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> A great quantity of pale Urine is
thrown off by that Efferveſcence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> A flatulent Lympha is evacuated
into the Stomach and Guts, which raiſes
the Alimentary Maſs there into violent
Flatulencies, like Wine over ſtummed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The Glands of the Trachea and
Veſiculae of the Lungs receive part of the
mucilaginous flatulent nutritious Juice ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the Blood by the Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
For the occaſion of this Symptom
in the Spitting Aſthma, is the Weakneſs
left in thoſe Glands, which they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from that Inflammation of the Lungs,
which produces the Spitting Aſthma.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> The more ſpirituous part of this
ſlimy and flatulent nutritious Juice paſſes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49327:45"/>
through the Nerves, being forced by the
Efferveſcence, and there, becauſe of the
ſlimy Vehicle of the flatulent Spirits,
difficulty circulates through the Nerves,
but fills them, and cauſes an Inflation in
the Membranes of the Breaſt, and Lungs,
and Stomach.</p>
            <p>The Nerves of the Breaſt were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weakned by ſome Dyſpnaea, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Inflammation of the Lungs, or
ſome Hyſterical Convulſion, and thereby
loſt their Tone, and became too open for
the admitting of flatulent, unripe, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted
Spirits from the Blood; and this
prediſpoſition determines the Flux of
windy Spirits chiefly into the Pulmonic
Nerves.</p>
            <p>When I have been in a Fit of the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
I have ſeriouſly conſider'd all the
Symptoms deſcribed, and always believ'd
from my ſenſe and feeling of the Diſeaſe,
that the Fit depended on an inward burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heat which occaſioned them, ſo that
I am fully convinc'd that the Aſthma Fit
is a Fit of a Fever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carolus Piſo </hi>affirm'd this long ſince;

            </p>
            <p>The Modern Phyſicians have obſerv'd
many Intermitting Fevers to lurk under
the Diſguiſe of Chronical Diſeaſes, as
Coughs, Cholicks, Head-achs, Fits of the
Mother, and Swooning Fits; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh
Heat, quick Pulſe, and high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd
Water diſappears, till the Blood
be raiſed to a higher Digeſtion, or Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:
The ſame is often the caſe of
the Aſthma; the Efferveſcence is in the
Blood, decay'd by ſome former Diſeaſe,
which occaſions the Water to be pale, and
the Heat little.</p>
            <p>That the Aſthma may be a Symptom
of an intermitting Fever, is evident by
the Deſcription of ſome caſes of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in ſome Modern Writers: And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
an Apothecary who, after drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
largely, was ſeized with an Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Fever, with an Inflammation of the
Lungs, and every Night a fit of the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
accompanied a fit of the Fever, which
after three Weeks was cured by frequent
Bleeding, Vomiting, and at laſt Purging;
but the Aſthma long after continued, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
every Night with large Spitting.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49327:46"/>
He uſed too little of the Cortex, and
therefore ſuffer'd theſe Returns of the
Aſthma upon any Diſorder, for half a
Year, when the Fever evidently return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Change of the Year, ſeiſed his
Head with a Delirium and Convulſions,
and ſo killed him.</p>
            <p>In this caſe it appears to me, that the
Aſthma depended on the Fever whilſt
that was evident, and afterward when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the Relicks of that Fever were agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by an Accident into an Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
they produced only the Aſthma
Fit, without the uſual Symptoms of the
Fever.</p>
            <p>I will give another Inſtance of a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
about 50 Years old, who after an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Intermitting Fever, without any
Symptoms of the Aſthma, Relapſed after
14 Days into the ſame Fever, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
every 12 Hours, and held him
ſhivering and ſhaking, with a terrible fit
of the Aſthma, for about half an Hour,
and that paſſed off without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sweat, or Heat, or Spitting: This
Perſon was ſubject to a Paralytick ſhaking,
and in the Fever had ſtrong Convulſive
motions: The Cortex would not ſtop
any of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <hi>Riverius</hi> Salt mixture
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49327:46"/>
did put off the fits for ſome time, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that nor Alexipharmics would cure
him.</p>
            <p>By this Inſtance I obſerv'd, that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
Fever having its Matter tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Nerves, produces the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
Fevers deſcribed by the Antient
Writers; in which many Irregular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
happen, and thoſe great Shakings
which denominate the Fever, Horrifica,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which they obſerved Nervous
Symptoms with pale Water.</p>
            <p>I was conſulted for a Gentleman, who
at the latter end of a Tertian, was taken
with Swooning Fits at certain Hours
every Night: He grew very cold, ſhort
Breath'd, and then ſwooned, unleſs he
uſed great quantities of Spirits and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials:
This was certainly the Relicks of
his former Ague, and he was cured by
Salt of Wormwood, and <hi>Elixir Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi>
given at convenient times. And
the ſame ſwooning Fits I knew cured in
another by the Cortex. In neither caſes
the Fever was diſcernible, either by
Thirſt, Heat, or Urine. I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
theſe caſes, to ſhew that all Fevers
are not regular in their Symptoms, and
that the Aſthma is one of thoſe Irregulars,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49327:47"/>
both as to any extreme Heat, Thirſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and alſo in its Periods, becauſe it returns
every tenth Day in the Periodical fit, or
elſe Spring and Fall, as intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
and it has this peculiarity of Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous
Fevers, that its greateſt Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
appear in the Nerves, <hi>viz.</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flations,
which I ſhall next deſcribe.</p>
            <p>That old diſtinction of Natural, Vital,
and Animal Spirits, muſt be ſtill admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and approved by all Modern Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
and I will give my Explanation of
it, being obliged to admit that there are
Animal Spirits which produce the Inflati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Membranes in the Aſthma fit.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the Generation of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Spirits, we may more eaſily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Riſe and Conſtitution of the
Animal.</p>
            <p>That all Vegetable Spirits are prepared
from their Oil and Acid, appears by their
Preparation; for if the Vegetables be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
a Spirit may be diſtilled from
them; but if the Vegetables be diſtilled
after a ſhort Digeſtion, an Oil is diſtilled
from the ſame. Fermentation diſſolves the
Tartar of Liquors, and makes it ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
by which it affects the Noſe ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49327:47"/>
By Fermentation the Air is mixed or
united with the moſt volatil Particles of
the Oil and Acid, and that gives the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity
and briskneſs of motion to the Spirits
of fermented Liquors; their Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is from their Oil, and their ſharp
Pungency from the volatile Tartar: This
volatile Oil and Tartar, if they ſwim in
the Air, they are like the reſinous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Smells, affecting our Noſes by their
Spirituouſneſs; but if contain'd in a Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Water, they may be called the
Spirit of that Liquor. Thoſe volatile hot
Parts, like fire, rarify the Air included in
the Bubbles, and make it more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Elaſtic; the Oil and Acid being
of different natures in different Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
they variouſly denominate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
theſe ſeveral Spirits, and give
different Rarefactions to the included Air
in the Bubble conſtituting thoſe Liquors.</p>
            <p>The firſt production of the Spirits in
animal Humours is in the Stomach, when
the Meat being diſſolved by Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Agitation of its aerial Particles,
the volatilized oily Parts (which give the
Foetor) and the volatile Acid, which
ſmells ſharp or ſour, mix'd with the aerial
elaſtic Particles, and included in a Bubble
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49327:48"/>
of Water, compoſe the Spirits of animal
Humours; the frothineſs of the Contents
of the Stomach ſhews the oily Viſcidity
of the Chyle, and that was neceſſary to
conſtitute the Bubbles for containing the
Spirits of animal Humours.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Bohnius</hi> deſcribes in the Chyle,
by the help of the Microſcope, <hi>Chylus eſt
fluidum ex globulis diaphanis, per liquorem
cryſtallinum agitatis.</hi>—And <hi>pingues chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
particulae in bullulas ſive veſiculas ab aeris
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omis reducuntur.</hi> If too much Slime
abound in the Chyle, the moſt rarified
Parts of the Air, and volatile Parts of
Meat, are fully incloſed and retain'd, and
create a very windy Liquor; ſuch as is
that of new Wine, or Beer, undepurated
from its Slime, and windineſs, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Air. It is in animal Humours as in
all other fermented Liquors, the better it
is fermented, the more quick and brisk are
the Spirits; but if they be not ſufficiently
fermented, the Spirits are windy and flat;
if over fermented, the Spirits are eaſily
Evaporated, or elſe turned eager, or acid,
or foetid: So all Aromatics, as Orange or
Citron Pills, if fermented too long, they
yield a foetid Oil and ſtink; if leſs fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they yield an Aromatic Oil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49327:48"/>
In the Chyle the Spirits are like that of
new Beer, crude, raw, and not inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable;
but in the Blood they are more
depurated by ſecretion of ſlimy Humours,
ſuch as the Lacteal Lympha, and by long
and frequent Circulations, the oily, acid,
aerial Spirits become more volatile, and
are contain'd in the Bullulae which
make the red particles of Blood: And
theſe <hi>Bohnius</hi> thus deſcribes; <hi>Rubicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
portionem autopſiae mobiliorem eſſe, hinc
magis activam ratio ſuadet.—Sphaerulae
illae agiles gelatinoſa ramenta ſimul in motus
perennes abripiunt, &amp; mutua attritione deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant,
rubicundae veſiculae per Microſcopium
apparent per Cryſtallinam Lympham ferri,
quae ſtatim cum ſecum quietem componunt,
motore vitali deſtitute, in grumum nigri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantem
faceſſunt.</hi> Theſe large red Bullulae
in the Blood contain the rarified Air, and
volatile Particles; and becauſe they do
not readily mix with Water, they may
have ſome Fatneſs or Oil in them. The
uſe of theſe is to diſſolve and make the
mucilaginous Maſs of Blood more fluid,
which helps its Circulation and Secretion,
Digeſtion and Aſſimulation of the new
Chyle; and in this conſiſts the uſe of the
Vital Spirits. If theſe Globuli contain a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49327:49"/>
very windy Spirit, that makes it ſubject
to Efferveſcences, and Fevers, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions;
for that forces the Serum that is
Cacochymical, too much through the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalic,
or other Glands, which ought na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
to be perſpired, or go off by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
            <p>If theſe windy Globuli fill the Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Nerves, and Muſcular Membranes,
they produce that ſtiffneſs or rigidity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the Breaſt in the Aſthma Fit.</p>
            <p>The Spirits we call Animal, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
a Congeries of the Globuli obſerved
in the Blood, and are ſeparated from it
by the Glands of the Brain; and ſince the
Animal Spirits pre-exiſted in the Blood,
they muſt partake of the ſame preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Quality and State, as is obſerved
in the Chyle and Blood, and be very
windy, and eaſily rarified; and becauſe
of their mucilaginous Vehicle, unfit for
a free Circulation through the Nervoſum
Genus, but apt, upon great Rarefactions,
to ſtand inflated.</p>
            <p>There is a continual Flux of the Animal
Spirits into the Pneumonic Nerves, for the
neceſſary uſe of Reſpiration, and alſo into
the Cardiac Nerves, to perpetuate the
Circulation of the Blood, as alſo into the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49327:49"/>
Par intercoſtale, to promote the conſtant
Periſtaltic motion of the Guts; and theſe
Nerves are chiefly affected in the Aſthma,
and none of thoſe which ſerve for volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Motion, and by reaſon of the continual
Flux of Spirits through the mentioned
Nerves, they muſt be more open, and apt
to receive the windy Spirits from the
Blood, by which the Aſthmatic Inflation
is made in the Breaſt and <hi>Primae Viae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Nerves of the Lungs were alſo
weakned by ſome precedent Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Spitting Aſthma, or elſe by
Hyſterical Dyſpnaea's in the Hyſteric Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;
and that determines the motion of
the windy Spirits very much that way.</p>
            <p>I have deſcribed the mucilaginous
windy Temper of the Chyle, and Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence
of the Blood, and windineſs in
the Animal Spirits, in a mucilaginous
Slime, to whoſe Rarefaction the Stiffneſs
and Rigidity and Contraction in the
Membranes is to be imputed.</p>
            <p>If I had only deſcribed the Globuli, and
imputed all Effects to mechanic Motion,
I could not have taken any Indication
thence uſeful in Practice, therefore 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to deſcribe the Cacochymia's, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which I muſt direct my Method
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49327:50"/>
and Medicines: And I muſt deſire the
Mechanic Writers to explain in what

the old Galenic Cacochymia's: For tho'

yet 'tis eaſie for me to obſerve the Effects
of that great Inſtrument of Natures,
whereby ſhe changes Liquors from one
Cacochymia to another, and makes the
preternatural State ſenſibly ſlimy, windy,

or putrid; this I can ſee, taſte and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;

which is raiſed by the natural Heat,

after a perfect Digeſtion; and when the
innate Heat (by which is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Fermentation of Humours) is

thick, glutinous, that impure Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

perſpire, eſpecially if the Pores be

the Heat being increaſed, the thick

thick Vapours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> deſcribes the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as
the Matter of flatulent Tumours, which

<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; and this he explains by a different
Conſtitution of the Air in the South and
Northwinds; a tempeſtuous Air full of
Vapors is like the windy Spirits, but a clear
ſedate Air like the natural Aetherial well
digeſted Spirit. This notion is eaſie, obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and true; for in fermenting Liquors
there riſes a ſpirituous Vapour from them,
which burſts the Veſſels if reſtrained, and
this is the windy Spirit; but that which
agitates the Globuli of perfectly Ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Depurated Liquors, that is more
pure and leſs Elaſtic than thoſe before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>I will next deſcribe thoſe nervous Parts
that are fill'd, inflated, and become tenſe or
ſtiff by this immature or ill prepar'd Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> obſerves, That the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
is contained ſometimes under
the Skin covering the Bones, ſometimes
under the Peritonaeum, ſometimes in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49327:51"/>
Belly, ſometimes under the Skins cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Muſcles, and ſometimes in the
membranous Tendons, and the Muſcles
are filled with that Spirit; by which we
may obſerve, that he obſerved it was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
for that Spirit to affect the Membranes;
but this it does not only externally by
Inflating them, but enters into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Tubes of the nervous Fibrillae, which
conſtitute the Nerves and Membranes.</p>
            <p>The Membranes that are inflated, and
thereby contracted in the Aſthma; are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Thoſe of the Lungs and Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Breaſt. Almoſt the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Lungs is Membranous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of the Trachea, Bronchea, and
Veſiculae; the exterior Membrane of the
Trachea is deſcribed to have motritious
Fibers, which go along the length of it,
to abbreviate the Trachea, and circular
Fibers to contract its Cavity. It has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
an inward Membrane extreamly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of Fume, Duſt, or the leaſt Injury,
and the Veſiculae of the Lungs conſtitute
a great ſpungy Subſtance of it, and they
are deſcribed to have muſcular Fibers,
for to contract them in Expiration.</p>

Muſculoſis coagmentari,</hi> is obſerved by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts;
and theſe Muſcular Stamina,
like the Fibrae Nervoſae, which move the
Stomach and Guts, are inflated in the
Aſthma, as the others be in the <hi>Primae
Viae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Cavity of the Breaſt, the
Intercoſtal Muſcles, the Diaphragme and
Sternum, are cover'd with the ſame Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
which are affected more or leſs
with an Inflation in the Fit of the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;
and on this do the Symptoms, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in the Breaſt, depend.</p>
            <p>By this Inflation the Bronchia are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
or ſtraitned, and that produces the
Wheezing noiſe in Expiration, and that
this Symptom does not depend on Phlegm
is plain, becauſe the Hyſteric, who have
no Phlegm, Wheeze very much.</p>
            <p>The Lungs feel ſtiff, ſtrait, and admit
but little Air, becauſe the Veſiculae are
contracted, as well as the Bronchia; and
ſome expreſs their feeling, as if the Lungs
roſe and were drawn upwards, to choak
them. This contraction of the Veſiculae
is very probable, becauſe the Bronchia
are contracted, and the Veſiculae have the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49327:52"/>
ſame Muſcular Fibres to help Expiration,
by which they may be drawn ſo up, as
not to admit the Air.</p>
            <p>From this Contraction of the Veſiculae
and Bronchia of the Lungs, it follows, if
the Air cannot be admitted there, the
Breaſt cannot be dilated duly, to make a
true Inſpiration. The motion of our
Lungs is like a Pair of Bellows, if they be
open'd by the force of our Hands, and the
cavity will freely admit the Air, we can
move them eaſily; but if the Noſtrils and
entrance of the Air be ſtopt, or ſuppoſe a
Bladder tied within the Bellows to the
Noſtrils, ſo to receive the Air, and ſuffer
none to get into the cavity of the Bellows,
but what it contains; it will follow, that
in a perfect ſtoppage of all the entrances of
Air, the Bellows could not be opened; and
if no more entred than may be contain'd
in the Bladder (ſuppoſed above) the
Bellows would be opened but a little way,
and would inſpire difficultly. So it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apears
in the buſineſs of the Aſthma, the
Inſpiration is difficult and laborious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
but little Air can be admitted into
the contracted Bronchia, and the Veſicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae
drawn up: This puts the Scapular and
Intercoſtal Muſcles and Diaphragme upon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49327:52"/>
a violent endeavour to preſs in the Air, and
open the Lungs, which niſus Authors have
miſtaken, and ſuppoſed the Pneumonic
Muſcles, eſpecially the Diaphragme, to
be convulſively affected; but it may be
eaſily apprehended, that the Diaphragme
cannot preſs the Viſcera downwards to
enlarge the Breaſt, if the Air cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitted
into the Lungs to follow its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and fill the cavity of the Breaſt;
for in that caſe the weight of the Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere
preſſing on the Belly, would more
than counterpoiſe its force. And this is the
true reaſon why the Diaphragme can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
move in the Aſthma Fit. Not only
the Membranes immediately compoſing
the Lungs are Inflated, and thereby the
cavity is contracted in the Aſthma, but
alſo ſometimes the Membranes of one or
both of the Pleura's, and that draws the
Aſthmatic to lie and lean on that ſide du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Fit, and flying Pains are many
times obſerv'd after the Fit. The Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtinum
is affected in others, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of ſtraitneſs, weight, or pains to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sternum; and the Pericardium
is alſo affected in thoſe who are ſubject to
Fainting Fits, or Palpitations, or I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Pulſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:49327:53"/>
The Membranes of the Muſcles and
Diaphragme being tenſe or ſtiff, may
hinder the motion of the Pneumonic Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
becauſe the Membranes being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ariſe from the Tendons, and being
continuations of them, they may divert
the Spirits from the body of the Muſcles,
and by their ſtraitneſs hinder both the
flux of Spirits and Blood into the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
by compreſſing the Arteries and
Nerves.</p>
            <p>The ſlowneſs of Inſpiration and Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the Fit depends on the ſtiffneſs
or ſtraitneſs in the Lungs, and Parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated,
which reſiſts the Action of the
pectoral Muſcles; 'tis a long time before
the Air can be drawn in, and almoſt as
long before it can be forced out, becauſe
of the conſtriction of the Bronchia.</p>
            <p>The rareneſs, or ſtop, or interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Inſpiration and Expiration, depends
on the ſtop given the Pulſe by the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Fit, (and that ſtop is made either by
the Conſtriction on the Pericardium, or
the Membranes of the Arteries;) for the
ſtronger and quicker the Pulſe is, the
more frequent are the Inſpirations and
Expirations</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49327:53"/>
The great labour for Inſpiration, is,
becauſe the Diaphragme cannot move
downward, by reaſon of the ſtop given
in the Lungs to the Airs Inſpiration; for
the Diaphragme ſhould depreſs the Belly,
and thereby enlarge the cavity of the
Breaſt for Inſpiration: This defect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
the Aſthmatic to labour more with
the Muſcles of the Shoulders to lift up the
Breaſt, and for the ſame reaſon the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
muſt ſit up, that the weight of the
Belly may a little weigh down the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,
and the Aſthmatic finds eaſe in
leaning forward, or being held up under
the Arms to enlarge the cavity of the
Breaſt for Air; and this ſort of Breathing
is called <hi>Sublimis</hi> and <hi>Magna,</hi> becauſe the
Breaſt is more enlarged upward in this
Dyſpnaea more than any other, and yet
but little Air is drawn into the Lungs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Membranes of the Head
are much affected in the Aſthma with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation,
which makes the ſenſe of numbneſs
in ſome, in others fulneſs, or ſtraitneſs, as
if the Membranes were on all ſides drawn
downwards; and this ſtraitneſs produces
a ſtop in the Blood Veſſels, from whence
comes Pain, Dulneſs, Stupidity, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
irregular Phancies; but this uſually
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49327:54"/>
remits before the Fit goes off, after the
ſleep of the firſt Night of the Aſthma;
and is much abated by Combing the Head
backwards, and keeping it cool, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of Bed in the beginning of the
Fit. This ſtop on the Veſſels does in old
Aſthmatics produce the Dropſie in the
Head, of which they always die Lethargic.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Membranes of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and Guts are much affected by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flations
in the Fits: Hence come frequent
Eructations, when the Stomach is empty,
yet it feels full, diſtended, and the
Guts are diſturbed with continual Wind,
which ſometimes gripes them, or gives
Inflations and Contractions; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the ſmall Fits of the Aſthma, which
depend on Weather, are only in the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae
viae,</hi> where the nervous Fibres and
Membranes ſuffer Inflations: The changes
of Weather very much affect the <hi>Primae
viae,</hi> by a flux of ſerous and flatulent Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
that way, by which the Contents
are violently Rarified, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
irritated into Inflations, and alſo
the windy Spirits raiſe ſome diſturbance
in the Membranes, and a diſtention which
hinders the motion of the Diaphragme.</p>
            <p>The Incubus is very like the Aſthma.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49327:54"/>
It takes Perſons therewith affected in their
ſleep; they have a difficulty of Breath,
and they have the ſame difficulty in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Hands and Limbs, which is
more than is in the Aſthma; the Incubus
laſts but a ſhorter time, depending on the
crude Spirit, filling the Nerves from a
full Stomach, which evaporate on waking,
or elſe the Stagnation of Chyle in the
Heart and Lungs, for I have obſerved
their Pulſe to Intermit.</p>
            <p>In the Palſie, where the Nerves are
obſtructed above, there is no Inflation of
the Parts beneath, but they are rather
weak and flaccid, but the Aſthma Fit
laſts but few hours, or ſome days; and if
in the Aſthma the Nerves were obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Plexus, how can that be ſo ſoon
removed? or the Lungs appear ſtiff and
inflated below? they would rather be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed
below the Obſtruction.</p>
            <p>The Irritation of the Nerves by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
extravaſated in the Head is only in
Cachectic Perſons, and thoſe who are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical,
and cannot ordinarily produce
the Fits, but is the effect of a long Diſeaſe.
The Aſthma oft ends in Tympanitical
Inflations of the Belly, and that Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
by Analogy may explain the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49327:55"/>
State of the Spirits; for windy
Inflations affect the Guts alike in both,
and that makes the Parts ſtiff and rigid;
all hot things increaſe the Inflations, and
cool ones allay them in both; ſo that
the ſame is the preternatural ſtate of the
Spirits in both, they being crude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe,
becauſe contained in a mucilaginous
Lympha; ſo that being Rarified on any
occaſion into large Bubbles or Froth,
they produce that Inflation in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
Fibres, the which makes them
ſtiff, and the Inflation contracts the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they conſtitute in the Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The windy Tumours of the external
Parts, which preſently ſubſide again, are
not unlike the Aſthmatic Inflations. In
the Belly, thoſe windy Tumours depend
on the Tumour of the Viſcera, compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the nervous Parts, and are therefore
more laſting; but in the Aſthma the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are only Rarified, and cauſe their own
Obſtruction and Stagnation for a ſmall
time, till the windy Spirits are Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or again compreſſed and reſtored to
their natural Conſiſtence.</p>
            <p>I never could obſerve any Tumour,
Pain or Stiffneſs, Fullneſs or Convulſion
in any of the Expiratory or Inſpiratory
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49327:55"/>
Muſcles. If the Diaphragme was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed,
that would help the Inſpiration,
by enlarging the Breaſt, as in its natural
Motions; If the Muſcles of the Belly,
which help Expiration, were convulſed,
that might eaſily be obſerv'd by their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in the Belly; and the ſame would be
obſerv'd in the Triangular Muſcle of the
Sternum. I muſt confeſs I have obſerv'd
a twitching ſometimes, when the Breaſt is
almoſt perfectly ſubſided, but that is not
conſtant; ſo that I cannot think any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion
is commonly found in the Aſthma
Fit, but is ſometimes a Symptom, upon
Extremities of Labouring and Suffocation.</p>
            <p>No other Hypotheſis ſeems to me fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to explain this laſting Stiffneſs of the
Lungs, but an Inflation in its Membranes,
which hindring the entrance of Air, gives
a Catalepſis, and Rigidity, or immobility
to the Diaphragme, the Part moſt unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accuſed of this Tyrannic Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall from the Diſcourſe above about
the antecedent Cauſe of the Aſthma, and
the parts affected by it, give the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Definition of this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The Aſthma is a high, ſlow, rare, and
laborious Reſpiration, which depends
immediately on the Inflation of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49327:56"/>
of the Lungs (which conſtringe
the Bronchia, Bladders of the Lungs and
Blood Veſſels) by windy Spirits, rarified
or propelled through the Glands of the
Brain, either by external Accidents, or
a periodic Febrile Efferveſcence of the
Blood.</p>
            <p>The Priapiſm is reckoned by old Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
amongſt the windy Inflations; and it
is truly ſo; for as the windy Spirits in the
ſleep inflate the Membranes of the Penis,
and by ſtopping the Circulation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
make a Stiffneſs or Inflation; ſo it
may be in the Nervous Fibres of the Lungs,
there are no true Muſcles in either part to
make this Inflation, but only nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,
and in the muſcular Membranes, the
ſtiffneſs of theſe Parts is not a Convulſion,
for that is tranſient, but a true Inflation,
which may endure many days; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Helmont</hi> was miſtaken when he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Aſthma <hi>Pulmonis Caducum,</hi> which
ſeems rather to be of the nature of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talepſis,
in which all the Parts ſtand rigid,
ſtiff and immoveable.</p>

the Spirits, which are alſo of an Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic
Quality, and expand themſelves the
more the external preſſure of the Air is
abated. This Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has ſufficiently
proved. For Animals are wonderfully
inflated or blown up in his Vacuum; the
Eyes ſtart out, and they Vomit; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the readmiſſion of Air, they ſubſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their former bigneſs; and in very high
mountainous places, 'tis obſerved, by
reaſon of a leſs preſſure of the Atmoſphere,
that Vomiting, Choleras, Hemorrhages,
and Dyſpnaea's happen. The Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is moſt particularly affected by the
Alteration of the preſſure, becauſe in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
the Air, by virtue of its Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
expands the Veſiculae of the Lungs,
and therefore that expanſion muſt alter
according to the different preſſure and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity
of the Air. For want of this due
Expanſion in the Vacuum, the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Blood is ſtopt in the Lungs,

               <p>If the Experiments above mentioned
are not ſufficient to convince the Reader,
let it be conſider'd, that the Spirits of
Vegetables are very Elaſtic, and force
their Veſſels in very high Fermentations,

of the Weather make Vegetable Liquors
clear or turbid, and ſet them to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Changes may be obſerv'd in Animal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,

the preſſure of the external Air being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
the Internal Spirits and Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
rarefied by its Heat, and ſwell the
ſolid Parts in which they are contained.</p>
               <p>I will next conſider how the Spirits of
the Aſthmatics are affected in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
States of Air, and ſhew that thoſe
Effects are produc'd in Animal Bodies, by
the ſame cauſe as the Alterations are in a
Weather-Glaſs.</p>
               <p>In a dry ſtate of Air, the Spirits of the
Aſthmatic are moſt lively, and they
breath free, there being then no Vapors
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49327:58"/>
in it, or Fumes to weaken the preſſure of
the Air; for in Serene Weather the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
ſtands higher than in other ſtates,
becauſe a larger Cylinder of Air unmix'd,
preſſes up the Mercury in the Barometer,
and by this heavy preſſure of the clear
Air, the Spirits of the Aſthmatic are kept
from that Expanſion, which ordinarily
produces the Fit. 'Tis obſerv'd that the
Intervals of the Fits are largeſt in dry ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Weather.</p>
               <p>When any Miſt ariſes, the Aſthmatic
breaths difficultly, and finds an Oppreſſion
on his Spirits, eſpecially a Straitneſs and
Fulneſs at the Stomach, upon Changes of
Weather, though the Fit does not always
ſucceed that complaint. The Moiſture
of the Air is moſt prejudicial to the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic,
whilſt the watery Vapours retain
the nature of Exhalations, becauſe then
they act moſt on the Spirits, and cauſe the
Inflation at the Stomach.</p>
               <p>The Rain when it falls, does not much
affect the Aſthmatic, but the watery Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
which precede it one, two, or three
Days, becauſe the Vapours weaken the
preſſures of the Air, as appears by the
Barometer, which ſinks ſometimes before
Rains, and great Storms, and the Aſthma
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49327:59"/>
Fits happen two or three Days uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch Changes; but I have obſerv'd
the Animal Spirits to be more nice, and
predict the Alteration before the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Glaſs.
It is obſerv'd by Seamen,
that if there be any bad Weather in a
Month, it uſually happens two or three
Days before, or after the Full or Changes
of the Moon, which is the reaſon why
the Aſthmatic Fits happen at thoſe times.
The preſſure of the Air being weakned
by the Vapours, the windy Aſthmatic
Spirits expand themſelves, and inflate the
Pneumonic Nerves and Membranes, and
occaſion the Aſthmatic Fits before great
Rains.</p>
               <p>All damp Houſes and fenny Countries,
and thoſe Winds that bring fenny Vapours
and Miſts, by altering the preſſure of the
Air, very much affect the Spirits of the
Aſthmatics; and ſuch the Eaſt Wind
often brings, which at its firſt coming
uſually give, the Aſthma Fits, upon very
great Winds and Storms, though no Rain
follows, the Mercury ſinks loweſt of all;
for theſe drive away a great quantity of
the uſual Cylinder of Air, by which the
preſſure of the Air is alter'd; and before
great Storms I have frequently obſerv'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49327:59"/>
great Aſthma Fits. It was one of <hi>Van
Helmont</hi>'s Obſervations, <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as obſervavi,
quae ſpirante Boreâ ſtatim vel in Hypocau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis
Aſthmate plecterentur inſontes.</hi> The
South Wind is alſo offenſive by the moiſt
Air it brings, but the Weſt and North
are leaſt prejudicial here in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From other Cauſes I have obſerv'd the
Fits of the Aſthma to happen, in all the
various Points of the Winds, ſo that the
Changes of the Air and Winds only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
or incline the Aſthmatic to their Fits,
and oft occaſion them; but ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
Fits are ſhort, and I generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them to trouble the Stomach moſt,
where a Windineſs inflates it, and hinders
the depreſſion of the Diaphragme, but
no great alteration happens in the Lungs;
for the Fit goes off with Wind, and a
little Spit, and looſe Stools.</p>
               <p>In Summer the Aſthmatic Fits are moſt
frequent, and grievous; the Aſthmatic
are moſt impatient with Heat, eſpecially
that of the Fire, before which they do not
willingly ſit, but moſt of them, taught
by long Experience, chuſe to ſit on the
ſide of it. The heat of the Fire rarefies
the Air, or over-heats it, ſo that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands
the Animal Spirits in the Lungs,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49327:60"/>
and diſpoſes them to their Aſthmatic In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flations.
So we obſerve in Dogs, a great
Dyſpnea occaſion'd by lying too hot near
the Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Van Helmont</hi> obſerves, <hi>Aeſtate ſaltem
ſaepius &amp; ſaeviùs infeſtat acceſſus, quam hyeme,</hi>
which is generally true, though I have
diſcourſed ſome who complain moſt of
the Winter. Theſe Winter Aſthmatics
have a Catarrh join'd with their Aſthma.
I had once a Patient who was a fat Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who complain'd of her Winter
Aſthma; ſhe Spit very much, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of frothy Urine, and Stools like
Barm, who by a Diarrhaea was run very
Conſumptive, and during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that, ſhe had none of the Aſthma.</p>
               <p>That Vegetable Spirits are expanded
by Heat, appears by the Thermometer,
and the Animal are alike expanded by the
Heat of the Sun, Fire, Clothes, and the
Bed, or a Crowd, or cloſe Room, becauſe
of the hot Air in them are very offenſive.
All Heat weakens the preſſure of the Air,
as it appears in Cupping-Glaſſes, and that
being weak, it cannot eaſily expand the
Bladders of the Lungs; therefore Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics
ſeek a moderate cool and free Air,
which makes a more vigorous preſſure on
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49327:60"/>
their Lungs, and cools their expanded
Spirits, which thereby does refreſh them;
they love the Windows open, and to be
carried into the open Air in a Chalaſh, to
avoid all hot Places, and Weather, which
Suffocate them.</p>
               <p>The Fit of the Aſthma is generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by the Heat of the Bed, and it
uſually ſeizes them there, and they are
obliged to riſe out of it, and they can bear
a great degree of Cold, in ſitting up all
Night with the Windows open on them,
becauſe of the great Expanſion of Animal
Spirits by the Fit.</p>
               <p>I have often had great Fits when the
Weather has continued very clear, and
only very hot Weather has ſucceeded, to
which I then imputed the Fits.</p>
               <p>In very cold Weather the Fits of the
Aſthma are leſs violent, becauſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
the Expanſion of the Spirits; but
before any great Snows, the Aſthmatic
uſually have a Fit, and that a ſevere one;
or, or leaſt, when the Fit does not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
they feel a Fulneſs at Stomach.</p>
               <p>The Quickſilver falls in the Glaſſes for
want of preſſure in that ſtate of Air, and
occaſions or gives way to the Expanſion
of the Spirits; and before ſuch Storms of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49327:61"/>
Snow, the Spirits feel very uneaſy and
reſtleſs, and ſome Rheumatic Pains affect
the Temples, or top of the Head, with a
lightneſs in the Head, and other Pains are
obſerv'd in the Limbs: Hence it appears
that frozen Vapours have the ſame effect
on the Barometer, and the Spirits, as the
floating moiſt Vapours have, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of both is a leſs preſſure in the Air at
ſuch times.</p>
               <p>In calm froſty Weather the Mercury
ſtands high, the cold Air being condens'd
weighs moſt; and in ſuch Weather the
Aſthmatic is moſt free from Fits, for by
compreſſion of the Spirits the Aſthma is
hindred.</p>
               <p>The Mercury ſtands higheſt in the cold
Eaſterly and Northerly Winds, becauſe
the cold condenſed Air is drove hither by
thoſe Winds; and ſince that Air is heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
we muſt impute the Fits occaſion'd
by them to a ſudden check of Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which produces the Efferveſcence,
on which the Aſthmatic Inflation depends,
and not only to the want of preſſure in the
Air.</p>
               <p>In extreme cold Weather the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is more ſtop'd in the External Parts
by the compreſſion of Air, and therefore
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49327:61"/>
then the ſerous Humours are carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
towards the Belly, Lungs or Brain,
where they paſs thoſe Glands, after the
manner of a Defluxion.</p>
               <p>Any kind of Smoak offends the Spirits
of the Aſthmatic, and for that reaſon
many of them cannot bear the Air of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
whoſe Smoak, like Fire it ſelf, irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
their Spirits into an Expanſion. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
obſerv'd the Smoak of Wood more
Suffocating than that of Coal, and more
apt to occaſion a Cough.</p>
               <p>The fetid ſmell of a Candle put out,
or the ſmell of melted Greaſe, will often
occaſion a Fit: And I remember an Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
Lady had a ſevere Fit by the ſmell
of an Ointment ſhe boiled. <hi>Horſtius</hi> has
a Remarkable Story of a Woman who
grew Aſthmatic, by holding her Head
over the ſmell of a Lixivium, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Soap, of which ſhe died after 7
Years; and in her Wind-pipe opened,
black Glands were obſerv'd, of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Peas or Beans, to which the Fit
was imputed.</p>
               <p>A Lady inform'd me that ſhe ſmoak'd
Tobacco for an Hyſterical Pain in her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
by which ſhe fell into the Aſthma,
for which <hi>Aſtrop</hi>-Waters gave her ſome
Relief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49327:62"/>
During the Fit of the Aſthma, the
ſmoak of Tobacco is ſo offenſive, that it
very much ſtraitens the Breath, if it be
ſmoak'd the firſt Day of the Fit, and much
endangers a Suffocation. There are many
Aſthmatics that cannot bear the ſmell of it,
therefore its Foetor is injurious at any time,
its Heat thickens the Phlegm, and rarefies
their aerial Spirits, making them reſtleſs;
all the good it can do, is, to diſcuſs the
Windineſs after the Fit abates, and to
help the Coughing up the Phlegm; but
it generally over heats the Air in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of Animals, and raiſes the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
too much.</p>
               <p>There is a Remarkable Inſtance in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netus,</hi>
of an Aſthmatic who fell into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Fit, by going into a Wine-Cellar,
where the Muſt was fermenting; and
this ſhews how much the Spirits may be
diſturbed by Fumes, which are capable
of Rarefying them, or elſe cauſing a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
in the Humours, which will
certainly cauſe their Expanſion to produce
an Aſthma Fit.</p>
               <p>The Fumes of Metals dry the Lungs,
and eſpecially thoſe of Quickſilver, which
may corrode the Trachea, or at leaſt irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Spirits there, and determine their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49327:62"/>
motion much towards the Lungs, where
the Fumes are received. <hi>Fumus Mercurii
(qui ut larvatus ſemper eſt tamen Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius)

Helmont</hi> gives us this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
from whence we may obſerve the
Stipticity of Mercury, and that Stipicity
was obſerv'd by <hi>Avicenna</hi> in Mercury,
which Taſte is always injurious to the
Aſthma: Thoſe Fumes which Irritate,
may vitiate the Trachea, and produce
the Humid Aſthma, as <hi>Helmont</hi> deſcribes
the Aſthma from ſuch Fumes.</p>
               <p>The Duſt of other Metals fills the
Lungs and irritates them, and the Fumes
dry the Lungs like Fleſh dried with
Smoak, and this Aſthma is to be cured by
moiſtening them with Oil, and Milk-Diet,
Mucilaginous Pectorals, and open
Air.</p>
               <p>Mineral Poiſons are beſt corrected by

               <p>There are ſome Inſtances of Shortneſs

are ſtrong ſcented and ſweet, and moſt
Aſthmatics are affected by Perfum'd Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

               <p>I will deſcribe the Matter of Smells,
then their Differences and Manner how
they variouſly affect the Animal Spirits.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49327:63"/>
well as taſte, therefore all Simple Bodies
are without ſmell, as Water, Air, and
Fire are without ſmell; but that the Earth
alone has a ſmell, becauſe moſt mixt.</p>
               <p>Taſtes and Odors are therefore chiefly
to be obſerv'd in Juices of Plants or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
or Metals, and it is is a particular
Texture in thoſe Juices, which ariſes from
the mixture of the Principles of things,
<hi>(viz.</hi> the Oil, Acid, Earth, and Water)
which ſtrikes the Organ of Taſte, with a
particular taſte, and the ſame ſpecific tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and mixture was neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a particular ſmell, which every Plant
and Animal has peculiar to it ſelf; for
what gives the taſte in the form of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
if it be Rarified and aſcends into the
Air in Vapour, it ſtrikes the Organ of
Smelling with a particular Odor.</p>
               <p>Since there is no Odor without Taſte,
nor Taſte without ſome Odor, and the
Odor in Wines and Fruits are changed
with their Taſtes; the matter of both
Taſtes and Smells appears to be the ſame
which gives ſuch a vicinity and ſociable
accord to both thoſe Senſes, that Plants
are ſaid to taſte as they ſmell, and <hi>è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra;</hi>
and we uſe the names of Smells, as
Foetid and Aromatic, to expreſs our Taſtes;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49327:64"/>
and, I think, we ought alſo to uſe the
Names of Taſte, to expreſs the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of our Smells, as I ſhall do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Odors are not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh'd
into their Species, which want Names,
and they muſt be borrow'd from the taſtes
of Plants.</p>
               <p>Odors are commonly diſtinguiſh'd into
pleaſant or grateful <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ungrateful

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but ſince all Animals
have a great variety in their Food, and
that was deſign'd to be grateful to them
both in Taſte and Smell, the different
Temperament of each Animals Humours
and Spirits muſt make one Food grateful
to ſome, which will prove very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to others: So it may be obſerv'd of
Birds of Prey, as Kites, Crows, delight
in putrid Fleſh, which is to Mankind ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ungrateful and unnatural; therefore
the gratefulneſs or diſagreeableneſs of a
Taſte or Smell conſiſts in its ſuitable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the Spirits of each particular Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</p>
               <p>Every Animal has his peculiar Odor,
according to the particular Temperament
of the Humours, which is pleaſant and
ſincere in the Vigour of its Age, and in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49327:64"/>
perfect Health; it is ſweet in Youth, but
ſtrong, viroſe, at the Seaſons for Coition,
or when the Humours are changed by
Age or Diſeaſes, they ſmell ill, ſtrong,
rank, as in Rabbets, Goats, Deer.</p>
               <p>The Matter and vaporous Nature of
Smells in Plants and Animals, does moſt
immediately repreſent the Nature of the
Spirits of Animals, and their various
States.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> Odors are very volatile, lighter
than the Air in which they ſwim, and
ſuch are the nature of Animal Spirits vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile,
inviſible, as Odors, and the effects
of a thorough Digeſtion; for Plants have
not their true Odor till they be full ripe,
and in Flower; Wine ſmells more odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
than their unripe Muſt, and Plants
in their native Soil are better ripened,
and therefore more odoriferous than in the
Garden Soil, where there is too much
crude Juice: And in a Morning, after a
perfect Digeſtion of Animal Humours,
we are ſenſible that our Spirits are moſt
pure, active, and lively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The Matter of Smells in Plants, is
chiefly an Oil, or Turpentine, or Roſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Wine and Oil does moſt eaſily imbibe and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49327:65"/>
diſſolve Odors, becauſe of the ſimilitude
of oily Subſtance; and in Oil of Ben and
Almonds we uſually preſerve Aromatics.
In Animals the moſt odorous Juices are
Oily, as Musk and Caſtor; nothing ſmells
ſtronger than the Axungia's, and all theſe
readily mix with Oil, by reaſon of their
oily nature.</p>
               <p>Amongſt Minerals the Bitumens, which
are of a ſtrong ſmell, have an evident
Oilineſs, as Ambergreaſe, and Petroleum,

               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> All Aromatics give a briskneſs to
the Spirits, and pleaſe them if ſmelt to,
and ſupply a larger quantity, if deficient,
and are therefore accounted Cordials;
foetid Smells are accounted Hyſteric Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
and inlarge the Expanſion of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
and ſince Smells act ſo immediately
on the Spirits, there muſt be a great ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
betwixt their oily Subſtances.</p>
               <p>But theſe effects of Smells on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
muſt be more particularly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and for that end I will divide Smells
into their ſeveral Species, and give the
Names of Taſtes to ſeveral of them, whoſe
Effects being well known, it will be more

               <p>Theſe kind of Smells are moſt ſpecific
to thoſe indiſpoſitions of Spirits, which
happen to ariſe from that ſtate of Humors
which requires a hot acrid Taſte to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them; in Hypochondriac caſes we
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49327:66"/>
excite the Animal Spirits by volatile Salts,
and we give the ſame inwardly: In Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric
caſes, we diſcuſs the flatulent Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
by foetid and acrid Gums, both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and inwardly, ſo that it may be
a Rule, where any Taſte is neceſſary and
uſeful inwardly, we ought to apply the
ſame, if Odorous, outwardly, to rectify
any Diſorders of Spirits, that may happen
in that caſe; and why may we not infer,
that ſince any Medicine externally applied
to the Smell, very much gratifies it, the
ſame may be given inwardly to alter the
Cacochymia, from whence the diſorder'd
Spirits are produced? This ſeems a piece
of natural Reaſoning, whereby Brutes
diſcover their Medicines when they are
Sick, and they eat what pleaſes their
Smell; and if any Medicine or Meat pleaſes
both Taſte and Smell, we readily uſe it.
If the piercing and volatile Nature of acrid
Smells be conſider'd, we ſhall never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them to Hyſterics, where the Spirits
are over-volatile and fiery, which ſeem
only proper for the ſtupid, dull, contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

we apply to fainting Perſons, and the

Foetid Smells outwardly, and Foetid
Medicines inwardly, are uſeful always in
the ſame caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Lethargic and great
Dulneſs of Spirits; the Antients gave Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor

5 days, they u'sd the ſame quantity in Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
they mixt it in Sternutories, or uſed its
Fumes, and they anointed it outwardly,
and in very hot Bodies they contrived to
temper its heat, by giving it in Oxymels,
or Vinegar, and not in Brandy Spirits, as
we improperly do. 'Tis plain to me, that
Foetids do more good after their Acrimony
is abated by Vinegar, than in a finer Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
We therefore act very odly, when

Vinegar does not diſſolve Gums well, but
coagulates them; but nothing corrects

Drink which Experience ſhews us is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Aſthmatics, and what is moſt
diſagreeable to them, by occaſioning their
Fits.</p>
               <p>All ſtrong Liquors are very injurious to
the Aſthmatic, and this is confirm'd by
their conſtant Experience of ſhortneſs of
Breathing upon any Debauch by them.</p>
               <p>Strong Wines inflame the Spirits, and
all ſtrong Malt Liquors increaſe the Fits
of the Aſthma, and ſhorten the Intervals
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49327:70"/>
by expanding and rarefying the Spirits, by
raiſing a violent Fermentation in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
as alſo by breeding great quantity
of viſcid Phlegm, whereby the Lungs are
oppreſſed and ſtop'd: But Brandy above
all Liquors is moſt pernicious to the
Aſthma, it rarefies the windy Spirits moſt
of all, and certainly gives a violent Fit.
And ſince Spirits are ſo evidently Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
to Aſthmatics (for Punch will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
give me a Dyſpnaea) we may
thence infer, That the Animal Spirits in
the Aſthma are too much rarefied or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded,
and that whatſoever is contrary
to Brandy Spirits, as Watery and Acid
Liquors, they will beſt agree with Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics:
And ſince this is by my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
found to be true, I may infer the
ſame thing, <hi>à Nocentibus</hi> as well as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantibus,</hi>
that the Spirits and Humours
are too much rarefied in the Fits of an
Aſthma; this ſeems to me the true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
way of diſcovering the unknown ſtate
of Humours in occult Diſeaſes, for that
Diet is moſt agreeable in every Diſeaſe
which is contrary to the ſtate of Humours
which produce it, a cooling Diet to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refied
hot Humours, and a hot aromatic
acrid Diet to a crude mucilaginous ſerous
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49327:71"/>
State. If then I conſider the Nature of
any Diet, that ſick Perſons by Experience
find moſt agreeable, I may by that be
inſtructed, that the Nature of the Diſeaſe
is contrary to it; and if I know what are
the Taſtes and Temper of a Diet which
agrees with the Diſeaſe, I may chuſe the
ſame Temper and Taſtes ſomewhat
ſtronger, but of the ſame kind in my
Medicines, and thoſe will prove moſt
Specific to the Diſeaſe, and that particular
Conſtitution which has experienced the
Diet. As for Example; I have obſerv'd
Sack, Sherry, Frontiniac, and all other
rich Wines to be the occaſion of Aſthma
Fits, by raiſing a Fermentation in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and an Ebullition in the Blood,
which ends in an Inflation of the Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic
Membranes and Fibres; but on
the contrary I obſerve, that Mead, or
Mulſum unfermented, Wine and Water
are the moſt agreeable Liquors, becauſe
they are not apt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erment and raiſe
Wind in the Stomach, and therefore do
not agitate or rarefy the Humours and
Spirits, neither do they thicken the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha
Lactea, and occaſion much Phlegm.
By this certain Experience, and my <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale</hi>
on it, I learn to avoid all hot Diet,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49327:71"/>
and conſequently all hot Medicines in the
Aſthma, and I am taught to uſe all the
cooling methods, which create no Wind,
nor Phlegm, nor rarefie the Spirits, and
it is of no ſmall moment in the Aſthma,
and many other caſes not to offend in our
Liquors, as to the ſort of it, or its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
for our Healths, in Chronical caſes,
much depends on our Liquors, which by
raiſing accidental Ebullitions occaſion our
Fits.</p>
               <p>All fermenting Wines, or new Drinks
have an inteſtine Agitation of aerial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which they communicate to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Animals, ſuch an effect in a high
degree all bottled Liquors have, which,
by reaſon of its Windineſs is very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to the Aſthma. By this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
'tis plain, that all windy Liquors
and Medicines are to be avoided by Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics;
therefore, if poſſible, they muſt
abſtain from fermented Liquors, which
are more or leſs Windy, and they ought
to live on Decoctions of Woods, or ſome
other watery Decoctions of Herbs.</p>
               <p>I know an Aſthmatic, who upon any
tendency towards a Fit, drinks plentifully
of Milk and Water, which preſently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
the Inflation of his Stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:49327:72"/>
Water with a burnt Toaſt is a good
Liquor for young Stomachs, but the aged,
whoſe Spirits are leſs hot, cannot bear
ſuch poor Liquors; and frequent Fits oft
make the Spirits languid, and then they
require a moderate Spirituous Liquor,
ſuch is a ſmall Ale of Six-ſtrike in the
Hogſhead, which is the ſtrongeſt Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics
ought to drink, with green Broom
or Gill dried, putting <hi>

                  </hi> of either to be
hung in a Bag in ſix Gallons of this ſmall
Ale, for ordinary drink at Dinner.</p>
               <p>All drinking betwixt Meals is injurious,
eſpecially all morning or evening draughts
of Wine or Malt Liquors, for that raiſes
unnatural Windineſs in the Stomach: My
general Cuſtom is to drink Toaſt and
Water every morning half a pint, to
drink about a quart of Broom ſmall Beer
at Dinner, and at night to take a Toaſt
and Mead, or Hydromel for my Supper,
or elſe Bread eat with a Glaſs or two of
Wine and Water: And then in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>
                     <abbr>lbſs.</abbr>
                  </hi> of Mum agrees well; all hot Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
as Coffees, Theas; of Cephalic
Herbs, as Sage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Stomachic, as
Buckbean, which is a Centaury I have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but find none ſo good as Toaſt and
Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49327:72"/>
No Diſtemper requires more orderly
Diet than the Aſthma, but eſpecially a
moderation in Drinking, that the Serum
of the Blood may not abound too much,
and a conſtant uſe of thoſe Liquors that
are moderate, neither too hot nor cool,
but ſuited to the Conſtitutions and Age.
I know a fat Aſthmatic who was much
relieved by drinking very little of any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
               <p>From theſe Obſervations of the Nature
of hot Diet, and its diſagreement, I may
argue, that all hot Taſtes, as Aromatics,
Acrids, Gums, Fetids, or Balſams, or Oils,
or Reſins, or Salts, by raiſing a Windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Rarefaction of Humours and
Spirits, are likewiſe injurious to the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic.</p>
               <p>As to the Food of Aſthmatics, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that all that which produces a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcid
Chyle, thickens the Humours, creates
Phlegm and Wind, and ſtops the Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſuch is that of Pudding, Cruſt, and
moſt Meal-meats, of Rice, Wheat, Peas,
Beans; and Milk-meats, as Cream, Cheeſe,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and amongſt Fleſh-meats, thoſe which
abound with a Mucilage, as Fiſh, Eggs,
young Creatures, young Pigs, and the
Extremity of Animals, and Jelly-Broths,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49327:73"/>
Oyſters; all which breed a thick Chyle,
which ſtops in the Lungs in the Spitting
Aſthma, and that oppreſſes them.</p>
               <p>From this Experience I may infer, that
no mucilaginous Gums or Medicines, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
or Pectorals of that nature, can be
convenient for the Aſthmatic, but rather
Medicines which attenuate without heat,
and proper to diſſolve a thick mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Chyle, without exciting an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence,
ſuch as the following Vinegar.</p>

               <p>The leſs the Aſthmatic are nouriſhed,

I cannot perceive much drineſs or faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to attend the pale Water; and ſince
that happens only in the beginning of the
Fit, I cannot believe a true Diabetes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
it, but rather an Efferveſcence of
Humours, (which is at laſt evident by the
high colour'd Water) may at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Fit throw off a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of crude Serum, which may be
the matter of the pale Water; but I am
inclined to believe that the true cauſe of the
pale Water is the Aſthmatic ſtraitneſs,
which ſtops the Circulation of the Serum
through the Lymphatics; for if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lympha up the Thoracic du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
be forc'd by the compreſſion of the
Belly in Inſpiration, in the Aſthma, that
being defective, and the motion of the
Diaphragme being hindred, it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the Lympha muſt ſtagnate in
the Lymphatics; and if that Serum which
ſhould return from the Kidneys through
the Lymphatics be ſtop'd in its Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for want of the preſſure of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,
then all the Serum which comes
in the Arteries into the Kidneys muſt paſs
into the Ureters, becauſe it cannot cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
through the Lymphatics; and this
happens till the Serum is very much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

I remember an Ingenious Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Mr. <hi>Nuycke,</hi> who teaches us to
make Ligatures on the Veins and Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatics,
whereby the Liquor injected
through the Arteries is forc'd into the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and this ſeems to confirm my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
about the pale Water.</p>
               <p>In the Fits of the Mother the pale Water
flows in great quantity, becauſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Serum is ſtop'd in the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatics,
by the convulſive Conſtrictions,
or the ſtop put to the motion of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme.</p>
               <p>A fat Woman, who lived long an Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic,
told me ſhe found benefit by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her own Water, and that ſhe obſerv'd
that before the Fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I have taſted my own pale Water, but
never obſerv'd it either ſweet or ſour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably,
but rather very ſalt.</p>
               <p>Alum will not curdle it, as it does other
nutritious Juices, which inclines me to
believe that the pale Water is none of the
nutritious Juices, but that this Serum
ought to be carried off by the Fits, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by this, becauſe when it is ſtop'd a
Dropſy uſually ſucceds.</p>
               <p>That the pale Urine is from the Serum
is manifeſt, becauſe it taſtes as ſalt as any
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49327:77"/>
ordinary Urine. I evaporated it in a
Spoon, and it left only a brown ſaltiſh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment;
it ſmells as ſtrong of Saltneſs as
any ordinary Urine.</p>
               <p>The quantity of pale Urine made in one
Night was about two Quarts, though I
drank not half a Pint at Supper time.</p>
               <p>The Sediment left upon evaporation
was not viſcid, but ſandy and gritty, and
taſted very ſalt, and therefore had none
of the Succus Nutritius in it.</p>
               <p>This pale Urine would not coagulate
Milk though mixt with it, and therefore
no great acid was in it.</p>
               <p>From the paſt Reflections I conclude
the pale Water to be the thin part of the
Serum of the Blood, with a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Salt in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helmont</hi> obſerv'd before the Fit, that
the Saliva in an Aſthma was ſalt; but this
I was never ſenſible of in my ſelf, but that
it is uſually viſcid or mucilaginous the day
before the Fit.</p>
               <p>As to Spitting and Coughing, that is
common at the latter end of the Spitting
Aſthma, upon the going off of the Fit:
The firſt and ſecond day they ſpit little,
but more the third, when the ſtraitneſs
goes off, and then the mucilaginous Phlegm
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49327:77"/>
digeſting and putrifying, it loſes its viſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and ſo comes up eaſier. The Phlegm
indigeſted is like the White of an Egg,
and the firſt Spits of the Aſthma are ſtreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or feathered, and like a Spiders Web,
of a blackiſh colour, from Blood, or ſome
acid Splenetic Juice, which probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Salt nature, it ſhoots into Figures:
This Phlegm comes from the Glandulous
Coat of the Trachea, which by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
of the Bronchia is expreſſed from
that Skin. This Spit <hi>Helmont</hi> calls <hi>Guttas

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:49327:78"/>
No Pectoral can do any thing towards
the curing or preventing of the Fit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oily or deterſive, but at the latter
end of the Fit, the oily and ſweet Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
help the Expectoration of the viſcid
Phlegm, which gathers in the Bronchia
during their conſtriction, and it is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the Fit, but the product of it;
for if it were ſo, the Fit would not come
ſo ſuddenly as it does; and before the Fit
I never was ſenſible of an Oppreſſion or
Stuffing of Phlegm, though I ſpit much
after a Fit.</p>
               <p>Vomiting very much relieves the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
by evacuating a great quantity of
this Phlegm, or mucilaginous Slime from
the Stomach and Lungs, which appears
to me all of the ſame nature, but after
ſome ſmall time the Fits will return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>I have often vomited a Choleric Matter
in the beginning of the Fit, which I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the vehemence of the Fit, and
ſome compreſſion on the Guts, or the
Gall Bladder, and to be purely accidental.</p>
               <p>I have diſcourſed an Aſthmatic, who
was extreamly troubled with violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Vomiting in the beginning of
each Fit, and nothing compos'd it like
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49327:78"/>
drinking Water; this Gentleman told me
that he received much benefit by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Bath</hi> Water, which cured him of his
Aſthma for ſome Years, but the Aſthma
returning, he came to <hi>Bath</hi> the ſecond
time, where I met him; he was of a full
Habit of Body, he drank the Waters, but
durſt not adventure to bathe; he lives near
<hi>Northampton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The giving of a Vomit will put ſome
Perſons into Fits, tho' it generally relieves
the ſtraitneſs and oppreſſion at Stomach
in all Aſthmatics, but that will ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and the Phlegm be again evacuated
into the Stomach. The breeding of this
great quantity of mucilaginous Slime both
in the Stomach and Lungs, depends much
on the frequent ſtop given to Circulation
of Humours by the Aſthma Fit; for 'tis
the motion of Humours, and quick cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
that diſſolves the mucilaginous
Liquors of Animals; but if they once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that motion, they naturally thicken
like Gelly-Broth as it cools.</p>
               <p>The want of the motion of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme
in the Aſthma Fit, may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the ſtagnation of the Contents in the
Guts, as well as the Chyle in the Lacteals,
and alſo the Blood in the Meſentery; for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49327:79"/>
theſe are all helped by its depreſſion in
Reſpiration: From this ſtagnation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
the Guts may be irritated into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flations,
which will hinder their natural
Periſtaltic Motion, and all the Humours
ſtagnating will be much rarefied, become
windy, and ſwell their Veſſels, ſo that the
Aſthma has theſe degrees; Firſt, there
is a ſtraitneſs in the Bronchia and Veſicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae,
that hinders the deſcent of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,
and the defect of that gives the
pale Water and Inflations in the Belly.</p>
               <p>Bleeding, though never ſo oft repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will not cure the Aſthmatic, but a
little for the preſent relieve the ſtraitneſs
and ſuffocation. It is agreeable to young
Perſons, but very prejudicial to old habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
Aſthmas, who at preſent are not
much relieved thereby, but after ſome
time they become Cachectic.</p>
               <p>No Diuretic Balſam, or Turpentine,
can prevent a Fit, nor cure it, but they
rather make it worſe, by rarefying and
heating the Humours and Spirits.</p>
               <p>Some Perſons during ſome critical Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations,
as Dyſuria, Looſneſs, or Ulcers,
have no Fits of the Aſthma; and I have
heard ſome commend Iſſues on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;

               <p>I have obſerv'd the Aſthma to be better
in ſome after the Legs begin to ſwell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
then the Blood is not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined

I have oft taken Spirit of Hartſhorn to

it cauſes an extraordinary Tumult in the

               <p>Narcotics are accounted dangerous to
Aſthmatics by ſome Authors, becauſe
they apprehend that they make a greater
ſtoppage in the Breath and Pulſe, and
thicken the viſcid Humours of the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
if given in any great Doſe; but if in
a moderate quantity, they are the fitteſt
Medicines to compreſs the Inflations; and
<hi>Riverius</hi>'s Experience confirms it, and all
our Moderns, as well as the Antient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
uſed it in the Aſthma.</p>
               <p>I wiſh we had in common uſe a Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Opium with an acid, that I am
certain would prove more agreeable to
the Aſthma, becauſe the acid beſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
the Opium, and that makes all acrid
and bitter Medicines more ſuitable to that
Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:49327:82"/>
The Antient Writers often object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the knowing of the Nature of all
Medicines by the Taſtes; that Narcotics
are hot by being bitter, acrid and foetid,
and yet they cool the Humors and thicken
them.</p>
               <p>To which I may Anſwer, that Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
by thoſe Taſtes produce hot Effects,
as well as cool in our Humours; Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
are Diuretics, and evidently Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics,
by their bitterneſs and acrimony,
and they cauſe an itching in the Skin ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
many of them are alſo Vomito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Purgers, as Tobacco, which
is a <hi>Solanum,</hi> and <hi>Solanum lignoſum</hi> is
Purging; all which Qualities depend on
the Acrimony of them. But beſides this
Taſte, there is an evident mucilage in
Narcotics, as appears in Poppy-leaves,
which always cools; but the chief Effects
of Opium lies in the fetid Smell, which
being deſtructive to the Spirits by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
texture of its Principles, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtupified, evaporated, or made leſs
elaſtic; the motion of the Heart and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of Humours are ſtop'd, on which
the coolneſs and viſcidity accidentally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
that all theſe Effects are produc'd
by the hot Taſtes of the Narcotic is plain,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49327:82"/>
becauſe ſtrong Spirits long uſed, and all
hot Regimens, as hot Baths, hot Drinks,

of other Poiſons, as Vegetables, lies in

               <p>I ſhall next deſcribe thoſe Diſeaſes

               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> The Suppreſſion of the natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations
of Blood by the Haemorrhoids
or Menſes, which being ſtop'd, do occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
a great Oppreſſion of the Lungs, by
the Viſcidity or Fulneſs of Blood ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Blood Veſſels, which oft makes
them varicoſe, and not only hinders the
Circulation there, but occaſions a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49327:83"/>
on the Bronchia and Veſiculae, for
the Veins and Arteries accompany the
ſeveral Branches of the Trachea, which
keep the middle, and the Veins lie over
them, and the Arteries underneath; and
by this it appears, that the Stagnation of
the Chyle or Blood in thoſe Veſſels, may
compreſs the Bronchia, and by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a conſtant Wheezing in them; and
this is to be cured by reſtoring the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Evacuations of Blood. This ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
of the Haemorrhoids I have obſerv'd
increaſe the Fits in many Aſthmatics, who
were troubled with them, and during
their Flux the Aſthma was very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p>This ſtop of the Haemorrhoids is an
occaſion of a Scorbutic Spitting of Blood
in many Aſthmatics; this Hawking up
Blood return'd every Afternoon in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Aſthmatic towards four of the
Clock, and I could not ſtop it by any
Evacuations, or Styptics; but the Cortex
immediately cured it.</p>

                  <hi>2dly,</hi> By a great quantity of Blood Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoric
Perſons have an Oppreſſion in the

Purging, with a ſpare Diet.</p>

                  <hi>3dly,</hi> A Polypus in the Heart and Lungs,
upon any motion gives a Shortneſs of
Breath, becauſe the Blood cannot freely
circulate through them, without oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Bronchia; this gives alſo a Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and intermitting Pulſe, and upon
violent motion they die ſuddenly; and
this is incurable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> The Coagulation of the Chyle in
the Lungs produces the Aſthma, and of
theſe Aſthmas there are many Inſtances
given in Authors: This ariſes from drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cold Water, or waſhing in it whilſt
the Body is very hot, which by a ſudden
compreſſion of rarefied Humours coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
them, and from hence came the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhus
Suffocativus,</hi> which ſuddenly kills
many Children, who drink cold Water
being hot: This is without Intermiſſion,
and accompanied with a Fever. Upon
this I believe the Pulmonic Aſthma in
broken Winded Horſes, frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends;
it is a continu'd Aſthma upon any
motion, they have a dry Cough at firſt,
but after ſome time they vent ſome Slime
by their Noſtrils, and are eaſier whilſt
their Bodies are kept open by a moiſt
Food; they have a dry Cough, which is
a ſign of ſome great Obſtruction in the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49327:84"/>
Lungs; they breath thick and ſhort,
which differs from the Aſthma, becauſe
that is a high Breathing, and the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are very high, and both Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Expiration very rare and ſlow,
the Muſcles in the Abdomen, which cauſe
Expiration, labour as well as the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,
which helps Inſpiration, as we
may obſerve by the motion of the Flank
out and inward: The Diaphragme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Air is not freely admitted into
the Lungs, moves but little downwards,
as in ordinary Reſpiration, and the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
returns very quick, and cauſes a
trembling motion in the Flank of the
Horſe thus affected.</p>
               <p>The Crock in a Hawk is uſually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

               <p>
                  <hi>5thly,</hi> The Viſcid Serum in a Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia
obſtructs the Blood Veſſels, and
the Glandules of the Lungs with Viſcid
Phlegm, and the Dyſpnaea produc'd by it
is at firſt without Stertor, but that by long
continuance ſtrains the nervous Fibers and
Membranes, and diſpoſes them to Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
Inflations. And from this cauſe
the common Pneumonic Humid or Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49327:84"/>
Aſthma takes its Original, which is
attended with much Spit as the Fit goes
off. It is obſerv'd that the inward Skin
of the Trachaea is Glandulous, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctuoſo
humore perfunditur contra aeris aſperitatem;</hi>
and by the Conſtriction of the Bronchia a
great quantity of this is expreſſed during
the Fit; for the Circulation of the Blood
and Chyle being retarded by the Fit,
ſome of the Chylaceous Maſs is obliged
to paſs the Glands of the Membranes in
the Trachaea. If a Liquor be injected
into the Arterial Vein of the Lungs, ſome
of it will paſs into Trachaea, and this way
the ſlimy Spit paſſes in the Aſthma Fit;
which by its colour and conſiſtence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
of a Chylous Nature.</p>
               <p>Theſe Pneumonic Spitting Aſthma's
have been obſerv'd upon Diſſection to
have Tubercula or Schirroſity in the
Lungs, and they frequently turn to an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſs,
and that into an Empyema; but that
ſmall Tubercula alone will not produce
the Aſthma is plain, becauſe all Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
People who have them are not Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic.</p>
               <p>The Lungs uſually in theſe Aſthma's
adhere to the Sides, which makes only
ſhort Breath'd upon any motion, for which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49327:85"/>
Inconvenience Authors commend the
motion of the Arms and Breaſt, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollient
Bathes, and Milk; but all theſe
Aſthmatics uſually die Conſumptive.</p>
               <p>This Pulmonic Aſthma depended ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
on a Fever, and ſo does the ſeveral
Fits of it, which force ſome Chylaceous
Lympha through the Glandules of the
Lungs, and that produces the Spitting
Aſthma.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fits come ſuddenly, and with
out any ſenſe of Matter collected in the
weakned Glands before the Aſthma Fit,
but it flows through them in the Fit, ſo
that an Inflammation of the Lungs does
not produce the Aſthma in all Perſons,
but only the Spitting Symptoms in thoſe
who have a Cacochymia, which diſpoſes
them to this Diſeaſe, or elſe it occaſions

Glands into the Trachea, and diſpoſes
them to receive any flux of mucilaginous
Slime, upon any Efferveſcence of Humors,
and this uſually happens in the great
Changes of the Year, and gives an Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
Aſthma, which a Catarrh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
and accompanies, and that ends in
much Spitting. It may be obſerv'd, if
the Aſthmatic catch Cold, and have a
Rheume in the Teeth, Throat, or Head,
within a Night or two the Fit will follow.
In this caſe 'tis plain the Efferveſcence
which uſually attends all Catarrhes, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
ſome ſlimy Lympha on the Lungs,
which produces the Fit.</p>
               <p>As the Peripneumonia produces a Fit
of the Aſthma in thoſe diſpoſed to it, and
cannot produce it in others not ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
ſo it is in Catarrhs, the Phlegm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in a Catarrh cannot produce the
Aſthma in thoſe who are not diſpoſed to

in the Aſthma, and excites a diſpoſition to

gathers or flows into the Glands, it irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates

of the Blood and Air Veſſels to
produce another Fit.</p>
               <p>A young Boy had the Aſthma almoſt
from his Birth, upon catching Cold, which
occaſion'd a great running at his Noſe,
and conſtant Wheezing; no Medicines
relieved him, but he died ſuddenly, being
one Year and half old.</p>
               <p>If a long Catarrh produces any Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula
in the Lungs that are large, and they
conſtantly oppreſs the Bronchia, by that
means a conſtant Aſthma may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
which is truly Pulmonic, like that in
Broken-winded Horſes, which frequently
comes after a long Cold, and they are
Aſthmatic upon any motion.</p>
               <p>The ſign of the Breeding of a Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,
is when any one in good Health
begins to breath ſhort, and as that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
a Stertor is obſerv'd in Breathing.
There is an Example in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> of the
Daughter of <hi>Agaſius,</hi> who being a Girl,
breath'd ſhort from a crude Tuberculum,
which did not eaſily digeſt, but when ſhe
was with Child it broak, and ſhe became
Aſthmatic. By this we find that a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berculum
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49327:87"/>
may produce the Aſthma, whoſe
Fit will return as oft as the Chylaceous
Matter fills that Tumor, for then it muſt
conſtringe the Bronchia, and that Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
is truly Symptomatical, depending
on that Tumor, and not the windy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymia.</p>
               <p>The Itch repelled, or Ulcers ſtop'd up,
may occaſion an Aſthma, by filling the
Blood with too much malignant Seroſity,
and that either flows through the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
of the Lungs or Brain, and excites
an Efferveſcence in the Humours.</p>
               <p>If a flux of Serum falls on the Stomach,
and Inteſtines, that occaſions Gripes and
Inflations there, and many looſe Stools,
and then the Aſthma Fit appears very
little in the Nerves, the Fits are very
ſhort, and little Spitting happens; theſe
ſort of Fits frequently happen from a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh,
as appears by a Looſneſs, but if
any defluxion of Serum oppreſſes the
Bronchia, it cauſes much Spit, and the
ſtraitneſs on the Bronchia, and the ſame
Inflation there in its muſcular Membranes,
which happen in thoſe in the Belly, when
the Defluxion of Serum runs through
thoſe Glands, but if the Defluxion of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
paſſes the Glands of the Brain, the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49327:87"/>
ſtraitneſs is moſt with dulneſs in the Head,
and the Fit is longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>9thly,</hi> The Aſthma depends on Fevers,
the Small Pox oft leaves viſcid Matter in
the Lungs, which upon any Efferveſcence
of Blood ſtops that, and the Chyle, and
that ſtoppage occaſions an Inflation in the
Lungs. I am certain the Small Pox en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
the Aſthma in my ſelf, and others
I have diſcouſed with. <hi>Horſtius</hi> gives an
Example of an Aſthmatic who died of an
Impoſthume in the Lungs in that Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>A Young Gentleman about Twenty,
was taken with an Aſthma after a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy,
which Spring and Fall gave him
great trouble, but after he had had the
Small Pox, his Aſthma was very ſevere,
and drew his Breath with more difficulty.
He complain'd to me of ſtraitneſs in the
Sternum about the middle of it; he could
lie on either ſide, and does not Wheeze:
The ſtraitneſs takes him in a Morning,
and Spits more now than at firſt; he found
ſome Benefit by this Method, by gentle
Vomiting, and Purging with gentle Pills,
and Caſtor Pills at Night. I anointed him
with Anticonvulſives, and Emollients; he
uſed an Antiſcorbutic Diet-Drink, and an
Anti-aſthmatic Syrup; by theſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49327:88"/>
well ſome time, but the Fits return
ſometimes; I gave him the Cortex, but it
occaſion'd more ſtraitneſs at the Stomach.</p>
               <p>Intermitting Fevers are often the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Aſthma Fit, as appears by the
Inſtances above mentioned, and then it
cannot be cured without a plentiful Doſe
of the Cortex; but Bleeding, Vomiting,
Clyſters, and Bliſters muſt precede, and
in great Faintneſs Anti-ſpaſmodics.</p>
               <p>About Eight Years ſince I had an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Fever, with Swooning Fits e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Afternoon, to this I impute the
ſetled Periods of my Aſthma: In this I
uſed great quantities of the Cortex, and
<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii. of Spirit of Hartſhorn every Day,
which then very much reliev'd me; but
no Pectorals nor Balſams, or Purging,
Vomiting, Bleeding, nor a long uſe of the
Cortex would put any ſtop to the Periods
of the Fits, till I uſed an Oxymel hereafter
deſcribed, and bitter Thea of Buckbean,
with an exact Diet.</p>
               <p>A Gentlewoman of a lean Habit of
Body had been Aſthmatic from her Youth,
after ſhe had had the Small Pox, to
which ſhe imputed it; but theſe Fits
came ſeldom but upon taking Cold, or
the turns of the Year; but after the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49327:88"/>
Ague, which was cured by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,
it came frequently towards Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſhe had alſo a pain on the left
Side. I gave her a Vomit of Oxymel Scil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticum,
ſhe Purg'd with <hi>Pil de Hieracum
Agarico, de Succino, ad</hi> ℈i. once in a week,
afterwards ſhe uſed a Decoction of the
Cortex with an Hyſteric Julep, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric
Pills, with an Aſthmatic Syrup, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe was very ſubject to Hyſteric
Fits, and did not Spit after her Fits; ſhe
drank an Antiſcorbutic Diet Drink, and
the Decoction of Bitters, without Sena,
for a long time, by which ſhe continu'd
well for Twelve Months, but then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
return'd again with the Aſthma Fits,
which were cured by the ſame method.
And by this Inſtance, and the former I
mention'd, I learn, that the Hyſteric
Aſthma depended on an Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as well as the Spitting Aſthma, and
that both of them have the ſame Periods,
of which I muſt obſerve two ſorts; for the
one, in Pulmonic or Hyſteric Aſthma's,
happens once in Ten Days, or Fourteen
Days at fartheſt; and the other only upon
Changes of the Year, when Intermitting
Fevers return uſually; therefore ſuch
Aſthmatics ought to uſe the Cortex
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49327:89"/>
Spring and Fall, after Vomiting, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Purging.</p>
               <p>I knew a Divine, who after the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
Ague was every Spring ſeized with
the Aſthma, to whom I recommended
the method mention'd.</p>
               <p>Every Fever will not occaſion an Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Fit, neither had I any in the Small
Pox; therefore where the Aſthma is a
Symptom, there ſeems to be a crude fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent
Cacochymia in the Blood before
the Fever came, and a flatulency of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which being rarefied by the Fever,
produces the Aſthmatic Symptoms, with
Windineſs in the Stomach, much Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Intermitting Pulſe, Palpitation,
Coldneſs, Fainting; which Symptoms
oft appear, attending an Aſtmatic Fever.
If Tubercula in the Lungs ſtop'd the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh
Blood, and occaſion'd the Aſthma,
then that would happen in all Fevers to
Aſthmatics, which I am certain does not,
but ſome Intermitting Fevers occaſion it;
and upon curing that, it goes into its old
Periods again.</p>

on the left ſide of his Belly, which
gave a great Dyſpnaea; I found in him
upon Diſſection, a Bladder filled with
clear Salt Water, containing about a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
of it; this Bladder grew on the Spleen,
and ſtuck to the Muſcles of the Belly, ſo
that if it had been tapped, it would have
ſunk; and the Water might have been
evacuated; this Tumour by its greatneſs
ſtop'd the motion of the Diaphragme,
and cauſed that Dyſpnaea that killed
him.</p>
               <p>I once obſerved a Diabetes to end in a
Tumour amongſt the Muſcles of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which gave the Patient a continual

               <p>The Inflation in the Guts and Stomach

               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> I have obſerved an Aſthma in very
old Perſons after a ſlight touch of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplectic
Fit, or Giddineſs, which at firſt
makes them to fall to the Ground; this
Aſthma laſts ſome weeks, and ſometimes
months, with loſs of Appetite, and it ends
in Oedematous Tumours of the Legs,
and there ſeems to me always in this caſe
a Dropſy in the Breaſt: Vomits of Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
very much relieve theſe Patients:
Bitters and Diuretics agree, but Purging
did never agree with them: I have given
ſome of them ſtrong Purgers without
much advantage. This Aſthma in half a
Years time proving fatal to theſe Patients,
I have obſerved this to happen to freſh-colour'd
old Men, that have ſipped much,
though not very intemperately of ſtrong
Liquors, and every Night they have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Fits, but in the day alſo a continued
Dyſpnaea.</p>
               <p>The Gout alſo oft ends in a fatal Dyſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naea.
A Gouty Lady who firſt had an
Apoplectic Fit, by Medicines had her
Head very much cleared of that, but a
ſevere Aſthma in a ſmall time ſucceeded,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49327:92"/>
neither Bleeding, Bliſters, or any volatile
Medicines gave the leaſt relief.</p>

               <p>I have obſerved an Aſthmatic Fit to

               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Hyſterical Fits frequently occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the Aſthma, becauſe the Convulſions
oft ſtop the motion of the Diaphragme,
and binding and ſtraitning the Bronchia
and blood Veſſels, by the Nerves, which
encompaſs them, that diſpoſes all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
or ill digeſted Spirits to move
that way, to inflate and conſtringe the
Lungs and Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> imputes the hyſterical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
very much to Wind, becauſe of the
frequent eructations, and windineſs of the
Belly, or pains of Back or Loins: This
windy Spirit in hyſterical Fits is more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and inflates the Muſcles, but in the
Aſthma the high flatulencies being eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49327:92"/>
they only inflate the nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
of the Membranes of the Lungs:
And we may obſerve the hyſterical Fits
to end in the Aſthma, and for that reaſon
it muſt be a leſs degree of expanſion than
the Spirits have in the hyſteric Fits. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical
Women hold their breaths long
through the Convulſion of the Muſcles of
the Belly during their Fit, and therefore
may by ſtopping the motion of the
breath, ſtrain the Nerves and Membranes,
and diſpoſe them to receive windy Spirits,
when admitted into the Nerves.</p>
               <p>The frequent Convulſions, by retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the motion of Humours, may at laſt
make them mucilaginous and ſlimy, by
which they are better prepared to retain
the Spirits in the form of Wind, and the
frequent diſorders of the Spirits ſpend
much of the volatile Parts, ſo that the
Spirits after long Fits, have neither a true
volatility, or a thin Lympha to float in,
and upon theſe accounts the Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Aſthmatic, and the ſolid Parts are
diſpoſed to the ſame, by the Convulſions
and Strainings mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helmont</hi> calls this hyſterical Aſthma,

It will not be improper here to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pare
the Fits of the Spitting and Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rical
Aſthma.</p>
               <p>In the Spitting Aſthma there is no
leſs Inflation of the Lungs, and the ſame
rigidity in the Spitting Aſthma, as in the
Hyſterical, which is commonly called a
Convulſion, but is more like a continued
Inflation, or Catalepſis.</p>
               <p>The Lungs in the Spitting Aſthma are
vitiated by Tumours frequently, which
ſtop the Circulation of the Blood, Spirits,
and Chyle, and the filling the Lungs,
may produce the Inflation, or Rigidity,
and then this conſtriction may be called a
Symptom of the Diſeaſes of the Lungs;
but in the Hyſteric Aſthma, the Diſeaſe
firſt began in the Nerves, where a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
is made on the blood Veſſels, and
Bronchia, and thoſe Humours ſtagnating
help the Inflation and Rigidity of the
Lungs by their fulneſs.</p>
               <p>The Hyſteric Aſthma in time degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
into the Spitting, after Humous have
been oft ſtop'd on the Lungs by frequent
Fits, and the Glandules there filled and
become Schirrous Tubercula, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the Circulation of Chyle, cauſing
it to paſs in ſmall quantities into the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49327:93"/>
Bronchia, where it cauſes the Spit.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are moſt ſubject to the Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Aſthma, who are of a lean Habit of
Body, and are ſubject to Rheums, and
glandulous Swellings in their Youth, which
are inclining to the Scrophulous Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
theſe are moſt ſubject to the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercula
of the Lungs, and much Spitting;
they have too much Appetite, and are
troubled with Hypochondriacal Flatuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</p>
               <p>I obſerved ſome fat Hyſterical Women
who have had the Hyſterical Aſthma, in
which they Spit little after Twenty Years
continuance, but have the ſame ſort of
Spit as the lean Aſthmatic, clear and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilaginous,
ſtreaked with black.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever Cauſes produce the Fit of
the Hyſterical Aſthma, produce the ſame
in the Spitting Aſthma, as Changes of
Weather, Heat and Cold, violent Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Paſſions, Wine, Surfeits; in neither
kind of Aſthma can they bear the heat of
the Bed; ſince the ſame Cauſes produce
the Fits in both ſorts of Aſthmatics, there
is certainly the ſame Efferveſcence in both,
which occaſions the Fits, and that is
plainly proved; for at the end of the
hyſteric Aſthma Fit, the Water appears
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49327:94"/>
feveriſh, with a thick Sediment; and I
obſerve that there is the ſame Interval
betwixt the hyſteric Aſthma Fits, as there
is in the ſpitting Aſthma; and there is the
ſame quantity of pale Water in both kinds
of Aſthma.</p>
               <p>Since therefore theſe two kinds agree
in the ſame ſort of Conſtriction of the
Bronchia, in the ſame Efferveſcence of
Humours, occaſioned by external Cauſes,
all theſe two kinds differ in, is, the firſt
occaſion that produced them, and the
Spitting attends the one and not the other,
the reaſon of which I impute to Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Lungs, or a Catarrh, and
the other riſes after Hyſterical Fits, or a
Fever.</p>
               <p>In both ſorts there is the ſame flatulent
and mucilaginous Cacochymia, which by
the Efferveſcence is forced upon the Lungs
in the one, and on the Nerves in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Hypochondriac Fits occaſion ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49327:94"/>
of the Breaſt, as the Mediaſtinum, and
this muſt be cured as the original Cauſe
requires, by Vomiting, Purging, Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beats,

               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> When the Scurvy affects the

produces the <hi>Aſthma Convulſivum,</hi> with
ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt. This is Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>'s
Opinion; and for that he uſes volatile
Spirits, Tincture of Antimony, Sulphur,
Caſtor, Lavender, Flowers of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,
Benzoin, Elixir Proprietatis:
He preſcribes Sudorifics, ſharp Clyſters,
Diuretics, for the evacuating of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> relates a Hiſtory of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive
Aſthma, from the Serum in the
hinder part of the Head, and violent Fits
of the Aſthma ſeizes them in lying down;
and this ſucceeds other Diſeaſes, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexies,
and is a deplorable ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zecchius</hi> obſerves an Aſthma without
Stertor; when the Conſtriction or Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia
falls on the blood Veſſels, more than
on the Bronchia, he imputes the Cauſe of
Aſthma wholly to a Catarrh from the
Head, and preſcribes the uſual methods
for it to the Head, which is as abſurd as
the explication of a Catarrh deſcending
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49327:95"/>
thence; yet we muſt allow that in the
Aſthma there is a real flux of Serum, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through the Lungs or Nerves, and
all defluxions like the Aſthma are apt to
return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zecchius</hi> obſerves many other uſeful
things relating to the Aſthma, which I
will mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> He obſerves that Aſthmaties are
hurt by hot Medicines, and that in cold
Climates, if dry, they have beſt Health,
and that the South Wind is injurious; for
the heat of their Liver, that is, their Blood
(of which the old Writers made the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Fountain) he adviſes, the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Juice of Cichory, and Goats-whey;
he obſerves alſo a Crudity in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> He obſerves that the Aſthma is
<hi>Reſpiratio tarda, magna, rara;</hi> and to his
Honour be it, that no other Authors, who
generally call the Aſthma <hi>Reſpiratio
Denſa,</hi> have given a true Deſcription of it
but he; and he obſerves the Cough the
Aſthmatics ſometimes have in Expiration,
which puts then to great pain, becauſe
their Lungs are not full enough of Air to
cauſe a Cough; he obſerves alſo, that
the Urine is thick and turbid in the Fit.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He obſerves the Praeludia of the Fit to
be a heavineſs in the Head, and a Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
with a ſmall Cough, to prevent
which <hi>Zecchius</hi> well adviſes a Clyſter,

            <p>THE Cure of the Aſthma Fits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
theſe following Intentions
and Remedies:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To abate the quantity of the
windy Chyle in the Belly by Clyſters, if
the Aſthmatic be bound, which carry off
the flatulencies: In the Fit they have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
looſe Stools; but in an extream Fit
I once took a Clyſter of Poſſet-Drink,
Chamomile-flowers and Sugar, which
immediately eaſed me, after the Fit had
continued many days before.</p>
            <p>Vomiting, if gentle, very much relieves
the Fit, by evacuating a great quantity
of fermenting Humours from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and the ſtraining to Vomit diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates
the Inflations both in the Lungs and
Stomach, and ſome ſlimy Lympha is eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
from both.</p>
            <p>I never could approve of a ſtrong Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in the Fit, one ounce of Oxymel Scyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticum,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49327:96"/>
and as much Oil of Sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
is ſufficient, with Poſſet-drink or
warm Water. Much ſtraining to Vomit
is ſuffocating, and it is impoſſible to drink
much in the Fit for the uſe of a ſtrong Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
therefore my cuſtom is to ſip about
half an Ounce of <hi>Acetum Scylliticum</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any mixture, which in a ſmall time
makes me ſick, and by the help of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and warm Water, I Vomit ſo much
as to evacuate all the Contents of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
which very much relieves the
ſtraitneſs, though it does not always take
off the Fit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To relieve the ſtraitneſs, or
conſtriction in the Bronchia and Blood
Veſſels, which can no other way be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
done if the Fit be extream, than by
bleeding a ſufficient quantity, for that
helps the circulation through the Lungs,
it empties the fulneſs of Humours; but
this very little relieves the old Aſthmatic,
and ought not to be practiſed upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fits, but only in great Extremities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Rarefaction of the windy
Spirit, both in the Stomach, Blood and
Nerves, muſt be compreſſed by cool Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
as Toaſt and Water with Gas Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuris,
or Pectoral Ptyſanes, but theſe by
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49327:97"/>
their ſweetneſs are apt to ferment, and
create Wind, as Mead does; I rather
prefer fair Water with an acid Spirit, or
Sal Prunel, Niter, Sal Armoniac unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
ſmall cold Beer, and Wine and
Water and diſtilled Milk are agreeable
Liquors for acid Spirits or cool Salts;
theſe compreſs the Inflations, check the
Eſſerveſcence of Humours, and by their
coolneſs much refreſh the hot Spirits in
the Fit: On the contrary, I have found
by experience this very certain, that all
hot Medicines, as volatile Salts, acrid,
aromatic and Fetid Plants, all Chimical
Sulphurs, Oils, and ſpirituous Waters,
though never ſo carminative, endanger
the ſuffocating of the Aſthmatic in the Fit,
and very much diſagree with them out of
it: No ſolutions of Gum Ammoniacum,
nor Caſtor Medicines, nor the Cortex
ought to be given in the Fit; the ſhortneſs
of breath can bear no Pills, nor Bolus, nor
Electuaries. Salts, or acid Spirits, in a
carminative Julep, or Ptyſan, are the beſt
Anti-Aſthmatic in the Fit; the old Poſca
of Water and Vinegar, or Verjuice and
Water, may do well in thoſe who cannot
purchaſe other Medicines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:49327:97"/>
Take Sal Prunel, or Niter and Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,
of each ℥ſs. Sugar Candy ℥i. mix
them, give <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i in Milk-water, or the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Julep or Decoction.</p>
            <p>Take Elder-flower Water, Rue, Black-Cherry,
Chamomile-flower Water of each
<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iv. Syrup of red Poppies ℥iſs. mix them
for a Julep.</p>
            <p>Take Eryngo Roots candied <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iſs. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh
<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii. Barley <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs, Raiſins ℥i. boil
them in three Pints to two for a Ptyſan,
add Syrup of Violets, or Syrup of Vinegar
a. a. ℥iii. Theſe cool Febrifuges are to be
uſed two or three times in a day, till the
heat and ſtraitneſs is repreſſed, according
as the Stomach can bear them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> The motion of the Spirits may
be turned to the extream Parts, by many
Bliſters applied to the Arms, and Legs,
and Shoulders, which may diſcharge a
Serum from the Nerves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> After all the Evacuations men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
if neceſſary at Night we ought
to compoſe the Inflation of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Membrane both of the Stomach
and Lungs by gentle Opiates, at Bed-time
thus; Take Diacodium and Oil of
Sweet Almonds, mix equal parts of them
with Sugar Candy; take a Spoonful or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49327:98"/>
two at Bed-time, till ſleep comes: Or 10
or 12 drops of Laudanum Liquidum may
be given in an Hyſterical Julep, which
muſt be mild, and mixed with Gas Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuris.
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſays, <hi>Pro ſubitâ Diſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeae
mere ſpaſmodicae ſedatione, nullum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentius
remedium expertus ſum laudani opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ati
tinctura noſtra, quippe ſomno ob repente
ſpiritus inordinationes ſuas remittunt.</hi> I
have oft drank Poppy-water ℥iii. with
Syrup of red Poppies <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vi. and Sal Prunel
<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. to my very great Advantage.</p>
            <p>If Caſtor, Amber, Aſſafetida, volatile
Salts, or Sulphurs be taken inwardly,
they rarefy the Spirits, raiſe the Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence,
and drive the windy Spirits vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
into the Nerves, whereby the
Strangulation is increaſed, by which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
I find, that the contrary are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proper for the Aſthma, <hi>viz.</hi> cool,
watery Liquors, acids, Spirit, or cooling
Salſo-acids, or ſome Carminatives tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
by Vinegar.</p>
            <p>The Antient Phyſicians in a Fit gave
<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iii. Aphronitri in <abbr>lb</abbr>ſs. of Mulſum;
ſome of them uſually preſcribe a Spoonful
in a Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verum in his qui ſuffocantur Aphronitri</hi>
               <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iii.<hi> cum aquae Mulſae cyathis tribus praebe,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49327:98"/>
&amp; aliquando cum Cardamomo &amp; ſtatim
auxiliatur Aegineta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three Drams of Sal Armoniac may be
mixed with <abbr>lb</abbr>iſs. of Mulſum, or Honey
boiled with Water, and given at many
draughts in a day.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Aſthmatic awakes, they
ought to riſe out of their Beds, though in
the Night, which ſhortens the Fit, makes
the ſtraitneſs leſs, and by ſitting up they
breath better; the next day, if the Room
be not large, they muſt remove into an
airy Place, where they may ſit in an eaſy
Chair all day without any motion, for
that increaſes the ſtraitneſs.</p>
            <p>During the Fit the Aſtmatic ought not
to eat any thing, the firſt day of it, but
Small Beer, and Toaſt and Butter, or
Mead, or Wine and Water with a Toaſt,
and this may be taken at Noon, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Morning till then, but the
cooleſt Juleps, and Salts; and the ſame
again at Night, or elſe an Egg or two,
with Vinegar in good quantity.</p>
            <p>If the Fits continue violently for two
or three Days, continue the ſame Diet;
for the thinner and ſmaller the Diet is,
the leſs Chyle is bred to ſtop on the
Lungs, and the ſooner the Phlegm will
digeſt and come up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:49327:99"/>
Upon occaſion of Faintneſs, I take a
Glaſs of Sack and a Toaſt, but that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
a greater Inflation, and ſtraitneſs;
A potched Egg or two at Dinner time,
with a great quantity of Vinegar, is good
Diet, but all Fleſh-meats are very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in the Fit, and therefore touch none
of it, for the firſt or ſecond Day, till the
Phlegm begins to expectorate: And that
I may deter all Perſons from Fleſh-meats
in the Fits, I muſt tell them, that by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof many have been ſuffocated,
and that cauſes the Fits to laſt four or five
Days longer.</p>
            <p>No Pectorals but Oil and Sugar do
any ſervice in the Fit, but that I uſe
the ſecond Day, to help the ſlipping up
of the Phlegm, and I ſometime uſe a
Pectoral Ptyſan of Figs and Liquoriſh
made very thin in the Summer, and in
the Winter time only common Oil and
Sugar, to relax the ſtraitneſs, and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricate
the Trachea, and I frequently
Butter the Toaſt and dip it in Small Beer.
I take all Medicines cold, for no hot Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
agree with the Aſthmatic; the Fire
offends, if very hot; the Bed increaſes
the ſtraitneſs; ſo much are the Spirits of
the Aſthmatic diſturbed by every hot
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49327:99"/>
thing, that warm Beer, or hot Water-gruel
is very injurious, and encreaſes the
ſtraitneſs.</p>
            <p>I always order the Aſthmatic to go to
Bed the ſecond Night, though the Fit
continues, having firſt taken his Opiate,
or ſome of this Linctus to compoſe his
Breathing.</p>
            <p>℞ <hi>Ol. Amygd. Dulc. Diacod. </hi>ad ℥iſs.<hi>Oxymel. Scyllitici </hi>℥ſs.<hi> Sacch. Cand. </hi>
               <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii.<hi>Miſce cap. Coch. ſemel bis vel ter repetatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Day as the Fit goes off, he
may take a Spoonful of this Aſthmatic
Syrup Morning and Night; ℞ <hi>Syr. de
Eryſimo, Praſſio, Balſamic</hi> A. ℥ii. <hi>Oxymel
Scyllitici &amp; aq. Bryon Compoſit.</hi> A. ℥i. <hi>Balſ.

               <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>ſignetur</hi> the Aſthmatic Syrup.</p>
            <p>Since the Fit of the Aſthma begins three
Hours after Meat, a Clyſter in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
is very convenient, before the Fit
grows worſe, and then Vomit alſo if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and eat little or no Supper, but
take an Opiate.</p>
            <p>I have tried Vomiting, Purging, Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over Night, and the Cortex to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Fit I apprehended was coming,
but all in vain, for the Fit was frequently
worſe for it; but I find moſt benefit by
drinking of Toaſt and Water very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49327:100"/>
and adding ſome Niter and Sal
Armoniac to it; and at Bed-time I take
<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii. of <hi>Galen</hi>'s bitter Acid, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
puts by the Fit.</p>
            <p>I think I may appeal to the Cure of
the Aſthma Fit, to juſtify my Notion of
it, that a Fit of the Aſthma depends on
an Ephemera, becauſe whatſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the inflamed, rarefied, or expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Spirits in an Ephemera, as cool Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
Clyſters, Opiates, acid Medicines,
Quiet and Abſtinence, that only agrees
with the Aſthmatic in the Fit, and all
external Accidents that occaſion the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemera,
produce the Aſthma, and thoſe
muſt be removed in both.</p>
            <p>The feveriſh Ferment in the Aſthma is
very volatile, and perſpires inſenſibly, as
it does in the Ephemera, without much
Sweat, the moſt part goes off in Urine, or
looſe Stools, and the feveriſh Sediment in
the Water appears but for one Night or
two after the Fit.</p>
            <p>The Air of the Room muſt be kept cool
in the Fit, becauſe that has moſt weight
to open the obſtructed Lungs.</p>
            <p>All Fumes and Smells muſt be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe they offend the Spirits of the
Aſthmatic, by rarefying them: A Fire
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49327:100"/>
of Wood is more ſuffocating than that of
Coals, by the Fumes which ſmell and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe
more in a Room. The ſmell of
Charcoal is moſt Suffocating. The Air
of a City, by the plenty of Fires and
Smoak is more hot and rarefied than
that of the Country, which makes the
Fits worſe there; the Air of a Square has
but little vent, and the Smoak ſtands
more in them like Water in a Pool; but
thoſe Streets which are ſhort, and that
part of it where four Streets meet, have
a more conſtant motion of Air, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are more fit for Aſthmatics, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
that part of the City which ſtands
higheſt is beſt: In the Air of a City the
viſcid Spit is tinged black with Smoak,
which gives a blackiſh Spit every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and may irritate the Fit.</p>
            <p>The Breaſt of the Aſthmatic ought to
be kept cool in the Fit, and not anointed
with Oils that have any ſmell, becauſe
that offends much.</p>
            <p>All ſtrait Cloaths, and the weight of
Blankets hinder the Extention of the
Breath, and raiſing the Shoulders for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration;
and the Aſthmatics in Bed
uſually lie high, leave their Breaſt unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and put one Arm out of Bed,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49327:101"/>
leaning the Hand upon the Thigh, that
the Shoulder may be raiſed high in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration;
and the Belly muſt not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by any thing, that it may give
way readily to the motion of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme;
any Plaiſter on the Breaſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Reſpiration.</p>
            <p>Frictions of any Roots give great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
by promoting the Circulation
of Humors.</p>
            <p>The Medicines of Caſtor, Saffron, and
Musk ſeem moſt proper in fainting Fits,
and in them I alſo uſe volatil Salts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zecchius</hi> recommends Saffron 10 grains,
Musk gr. i. in a draught of Aromatic
Wine in extream Fits.</p>
            <p>When the Aſthma continues for ſome
Months, it is a true Pulmonic Aſthma,
and depends on ſome Diſeaſe in the Breaſt,
as Dropſie, Tubercule, Abſceſs, which
compreſs the Bronchia, and till that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
cauſe be removed, 'tis impoſſible to
Cure the Aſthma Fits; for removing
this Compreſſion, Vomiting, Purging,
Bleeding, and the ſtrong Cleanſing Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorals
are uſeful; but if that cannot be
effected, 'tis beſt to palliate theſe Caſes
by cool methods, as cool Liquors, Acids,
and Opiates, and a very ſpare Diet, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49327:101"/>
an open Air, which will not irritate any
Cough, by the ſmoakineſs of it; this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
prevents Inflammation, Inflations of
the Membranes, and the increaſe of any
ſtraitneſs.</p>
            <p>This uſeful Obſervation the Antient
Phyſicians have left us, that Acids pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all Impoſthumations, and Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and for this end in the Pneumonic
incurable Aſthma, 'tis very uſeful to uſe
the Vinegar Acids, to palliate it, and to
abate the Suffocations which depend on
the Paroxyſms, which happen in the
Night in continued Aſthma's, as well as
thoſe which are Periodical.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved very little Spit in ſome
of theſe continued Pulmonic Aſthma's,
except a ſmall quantity of a ſlimy Muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
though the Diſeaſe had laſted ſome
Years; and that no Balſams, as that of
Sulphur with Turpentine did them any
ſervice. Theſe Aſthmatics breath thicker
and ſhorter than thoſe in the Periodic
Aſthma, who breath ſlowly and very
rarely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerved in <hi>Agiſis,</hi> that ſhe

I ſhall next deſcribe that Method
whereby the Return of the Aſthma Fit
may beſt be prevented, which is to be
performed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> By Evacuating the flatulent and
windy Cacochymia.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> By correcting of it by Digeſtives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> By preventing any Efferveſcence
in our Humours, or Rarefactions of
Spirits.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Obſtructions of the Glands in
the Lungs muſt be removed, if any be,
and the Glands of the Brain conſtringed
or reduced to a better tone.</p>
            <p>If all theſe Intentions can be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we may prevent the breeding of any
more Cacochymia, which when it is in
any great plenty, produces a Periodic
Efferveſcence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the viſcid Lympha muſt be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a gentle Vomit both from the
Stomach and Lungs; ſuch is a Vomit
with Carduus, or Radiſh-ſeeds boiled
in Water, to which Oil and Oxymel Scyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticum,
of each an ounce or two, may be
added, and this Vomit may be repeated
once in a Month in old Aſthmatics, when
the Fits return once in ten Days, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49327:102"/>
and in others where the Fits are

            <p>All Aſthmatics ought to Vomit fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
but it is to be managed warily,
becauſe of their aptneſs to Fits of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Hyſterical Aſthmas by ſtrong Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits;
and I have obſerved a Fit of the
Aſthma to have been occaſion'd by them.
I have given ℥i. of Acetum Scylliticum
to Aſthmatics to Vomit them, tho' they
had formerly ſpit Blood, and that without
any Injury.</p>
            <p>Without Vomiting ſometimes no Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
can be throughly relieved, and at
Night after the Vomit, give an Opiate, to
quiet the Diſorder of Spirits.</p>

3. By Purging once, or twice, or three
times after the Vomiting, or once in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

            <p>Pills of <hi>Ammoniacum, Hiera cum Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico,

either ſingle or mixt ℈ii. at Night.
<hi>Pil. Coch. cum Caſtoreo,</hi> theſe are proper

uſe Purging Salt ℥i. in White Wine Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
Drink, or the Purging Waters boiled
very much: This Purge raiſes no Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcencies
in the Humours, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
occaſions an Aſthma Fit.</p>
            <p>After ordinary Purges, <hi>Decoct. Senae,</hi>

            <p>The Decoction of a Cock in Broth, with
Sena, and Pectorals, is much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by many Authors.</p>
            <p>Purging oft occaſions Fits, by raiſing
an Efferveſcence in the Humours, and
therefore an Opiate is neceſſary after them,
and ſometimes the Cortex too, to prevent
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49327:103"/>
the feveriſh Returns, which happen after
Purging, like thoſe in the Ague.</p>
            <p>The Old Authors Purged with <hi>Elate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi>
and Troches <hi>Alhandall;</hi> theſe may
be proper in the Hydropical Caſes, where

de Cambogia,</hi> but in the hot thin Tempers
they are certainly miſchievous, for the
Serum is deficient in theſe, but Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant
in the Hydropical; and where
that overflows, Purging is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and injurious if deficient.</p>
            <p>

are very fainty, languid, and hot after

            <p>The common Diuretics are Woodlice,
Saſſafraſs, Pine-tops, Gill, Horehound,
Enula Campana, Orris, Radiſh-roots,

            <p n="1">1. By diluting and cooling the viſcid
Humors, for which end we muſt drink
much of Mead, and Milk-water, Sack

Thoſe Aſthmatics whoſe Blood wants Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
may bear Chalybeat Waters, but
in thoſe who have old habituated Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's,
the Serum is too abundant, and in
them the Chalybeat Waters affect the
Nerves, and fill the Veſſels with too much
Serum; and in ſome they coagulate the
Serum, and give Rheumatic Pains. Aſſes
Milk, and common Milk, make the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49327:105"/>
too viſcid, and they cannot agree
with the Aſthmatics: Though I know
an Aſthmatic, who commends Milk and
Water, for allaying the Inflations at the
beginning of a Fit. Drinking of Water
agrees with the Young Aſthmatic, but
the old habituated Aſthmatic muſt uſe it
moderately, for fear of a Dropſie, and
Pains of the Stomach and Spleen, of which
I have heard old Perſons complain who
drink Water much; but I have obſerved
that a Perſon who drank no Malt Liquor,
but only Toaſt and Water, and rarely a
Glaſs of Wine, lived free from the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
which certainly returned if he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his Liquor.</p>
            <p>The drinking <hi>Bath</hi> Waters is much
commended for the Aſthma, but the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the <hi>Bath</hi> rarefies the Blood and
Spirits, breeds more viſcid Humors, and
is very injurious to all Aſthmatics, as all
Authors affirm, and I find obſerved in
<hi>Crato</hi>'s <hi>Concilia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I diſcourſed an Aſthmatic at <hi>Bath,</hi> who
was extreamly troubled with a violent
motion to Vomit in the beginning of each
Fit, and nothing compoſed that like
drinking Water; This Perſon aſſured me,
that he received much benefit by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49327:105"/>
               <hi>Bath</hi> Water, which cured him for
ſome Years, but the Aſthma returning,
he came then to <hi>Bath</hi> a ſecond time: He
was of a full Habit of Body, and drank
the Waters, but durſt not adventure to
Bathe.</p>
            <p>I drank the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters, whoſe heat
ſeemed very diſagreeable to me, ſince no
actual hot Liquor can well agree with me,
but I liked theſe Waters beſt when I drank
them no hotter than new Milk: They
paſſed well, but I found no benefit by
'em. I went twice for trial into the <hi>Croſs
Bath,</hi> and that each time made my Breath
ſtrait, and Spirits and Stomach very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid,
by which I learn'd the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of bathing in the Aſthma.</p>
            <p>I met with other Aſthmatics at <hi>Bath,</hi>
who found benefit by drinking, but durſt
not bathe.</p>
            <p>I know the Hypochondriacal have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſome Relief of their Pains on the
Breaſt by Purging and Bathing, but none
for the Aſthma, as I could obſerve in a
Perſon who was both Hypochondriacal
and Aſthmatic, neither drinking nor ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
did him any ſervice.</p>
            <p>Thin Bodies can neither bear the heat,
nor Purging of the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters; and all
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49327:106"/>
Sulphur Medicines are diſagreeable to
Aſthmatics, the Tubercula in the Lungs,
Impoſtumate by bathing; the Heat and
Seroſity of the Water, does more injury to
ſuch Conſtitutions, than the cleanſing qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Niter or Sulphur can compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate:
And I have heard an Ingenious
Aſthmatic complain, that her Aſthma ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was ſevere till ſhe had drunk the <hi>Bath</hi>
Waters.</p>
            <p>The opening the Pores, and rarefying
the Humors, make the Aſthmatics more
ſubject to every nice Change of Air, than
they were before; the drinking the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
gives a ſtrange Oppreſſion and Stupor
to the Spirits, with Sleepineſs, and that
muſt conſequently affect the Nerves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Reſpiration, and make them more
open for receiving of flatulent Spirits. I
do in ſhort think the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters moſt
agreeable to fat and cool Conſtitutions,
who can well bear their Heat and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
and their cleanſing Qualities. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
they ſunk the Habit of the Body
too much in very lean dry Bodies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt avoid all occaſions which
make the Chyle viſcid or windy, ſuch is
Milk, Cheeſe, Fiſh, Gelly Broths, ſtrong
Wines of a thick conſiſtence, Malt-drink,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49327:106"/>
baked Pies, and Cakes, and Puddings, all
Flower Meats unfermented; for all theſe
breed viſcid Humors.</p>
            <p>All crude ſlimy flatulent Meats are to be
avoided, as Herbs, Sallads, Muſhrooms,
Peas, Beans.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſimple Diet is of Fleſh-meat
boiled or roaſted, once in a day, with
good Bread well fermented and well ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and the Bran not too much dreſſed
out; the Drink may be Toaſt and Water,
for all young Aſthmatics; Wine and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the declining Age, and good ſmall
Beer or Ale not bottled; and no Malt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
ought to be uſed but at Dinner by
thoſe who cannot leave it off.</p>
            <p>Extream cold Air increaſes the viſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and is to be avoided by living in a
Town; gentle Riding and Walking atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
Humors, and diſcuſs Flatulencies,
which ariſe from ill Digeſtion; violent
Exerciſe makes our Humors more viſcid,
as we obſerve in labouring People, and
their Horſes, whoſe Blood is made ſeizie
by conſtant Sweating, by which the Blood
becomes inſpiſſated like Serum heated by
the Fire.</p>
            <p>Too many Clothes heat and thicken
the Blood, by evacuating the Serum, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49327:107"/>
this Practice makes them more ſubject to
take Cold; for the more the Humors are
rarefied, the quicker does the Air com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
them, or rarefie them upon the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Weather; they therefore catch
leaſt Cold whoſe Spirits and Humors
have the Air moſt compreſſed in them.</p>
            <p>Sadneſs ſtops the motion of Humors,
and makes them more viſcid. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that all Aſthmatics being angry or
ſad, do fall into Fits oftner than when they
are chearful.</p>
            <p>The Belly muſt be preſerv'd fluid, the
Urine muſt flow in due quantity, and the
Sweat muſt be moderately promoted by
Exerciſe; for all theſe ways the viſcid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
may be evacuated, and the windy

               <p>I have obſerved the Merchants to try
the Salt Petre before they buy it, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it into the Fire, to ſee whether it will

Taſte, is, of the Acid Febrifuges, which
coagulate the conſiſtence of Humors, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Forms of them that I could collect out of

               <p n="1">1. The ſtyptic acerb Taſtes, ſuch is

               <p>The Virtue of theſe Acerbs is to cool
Inflammations, Fevers, and aſtringe all
Fluxes of Humours: Their Tartareous
Acidity makes them cooling and diuretio,
and their Stipticity makes them proper
for intermitting Fevers, and in theſe
Caſes theſe acerb Acids muſt be uſed.</p>
               <p>The moſt Phyſical Acerbity we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in the Fruits of Trees, as in Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Services, Quinces, Granates, Rhue,
Opſoniorum, Barberries, Grapes, Sloes,
Bilberries, Cherries, Pears.</p>
               <p>The moſt acerb Taſtes are too ſtyptic
for the aſthmatic; but the fermented
Acids are commended in the Aſthma, as
old Verjuice and Vineger.</p>
               <p>The acerb Taſte depends on the want
of a due Fermentation in the Fruits, for in
a farther and perfect Maturation, they
become ſweet and more acid, with a leſs
Aſtringency: The crude acerb Juice of
Grapes has no Acrimony, but Vineger
having undergone, firſt, a vinous or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
Fermentation, and after that, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
putrefactive Fermentation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

               <p>Vineger does Injury to the Womb by
ſtopping the Menſtrua, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by an Orgaſmus, Efferveſcence,
Ebullition, or Turgeſcence, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
not only a quick Circulation of the
Blood, but alſo an inteſtine or fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Motion before the Menſtruum hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
for two or three Days, which gives
Pains in the Back and Loins, with a Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude,
Pulſation and Heavineſs in the
Limbs, Pain in the Head, Inflation in the
Hypochondria, and I hope by theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
I may ſay that Women have then
an Ephemera, which occaſions the Flux
of their Blood, which being rarified, ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulates
the circulating Veſſels for its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion:
But Vineger, if mixed with Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or Hony, does not ſuppreſs the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49327:117"/>

               <p n="6">6. Vineger corrodes the Parts ulcerated,

               <p>All Authors agree, that the aſthmatic

He cures the viſcous Humours by
Evacuations, and the Uſe of attenuating

Humors require much Drink to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and expectorate them: He obſerves
that all Medicines for the Aſthma, ought

doubts of the Uſe of Millepedes, which

Anti-Convulſions, if I had not ſo much
Authority as well as Succeſs by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Method I have propoſed. I ſhall
next add thoſe Prognoſtics which the
old Writers give, That young Men are
difficultly cured; old Men, and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Aſthma is only palliated; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are uſually Suffocated by it: If a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripneumonia
happen with the Aſthma,
and Phrenitis, I generally obſerved it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
The Aſthma uſually ends in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
in lean Bodies, and then Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula
are bred in the Lungs, by the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
frequently ſtop'd on the Lungs,
as I have obſerved in a Diſſection of a
Conſumptive Aſthmatic, for whom I am
certain no hot Pectorals can be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
It ſeems to me much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to keep the Tubercula from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumating
by Acids, and by a cool
Regimen, than to endeavour to cure them
by a hot one.</p>
               <p>The Polypus in the Heart oft kills Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics
ſuddenly, and the Aſthma fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ends in Abſceſſes, Tumours, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micas,
Ulcers, Spitting of Blood.</p>
               <p>The Liver is ſtopt, and the Aſthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
are ſubject to the Jaundice, both in the
ſpitting and dry Aſthma.</p>

The Dropſy or Tympany ſucceeds the
Aſthma, either from too ſerous Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or the Rupture of the Lymphatics,
by the Tumors of the Viſcera, which
compreſs them or the Conſtriction of the
Blood Veſſels.</p>
               <p>As to the Head, the Aſthma very much
affects that, with Pain, Fulneſs, Vertigo,
Lethargy, Apoplexy, or Palſy.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> gives a Hiſtory of a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Aſthma, after a Vertigo, Pain of the
Head, with a fear of Swooning, which
after a few Days became a Lethargy, and
this ſettled into a Paroxyſm of the Aſthma;
and this he cured by Vomiting with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs
of Antimony, Cream of Tartar, of

and Purging with Reſin Jalap gr. v. Merc.

               <p>I remember an old Aſthmatic, who
was troubled with difficulty of ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
upon which his Aſthma left him;
he ſeemed to me to have ſome Tumor,
or Palſy in the Oeſophagus, but no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
would relieve it; but ſince that he
has continued ſeven or eight Years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Aſthma, who formerly had the
Fits periodically for fourteen Years, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49327:130"/>
they were ocaſioned, as he tells me, by
drinking Small Beer: The Powder of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper-berries

of his Swallowing.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved many Aſthmatics, to
have the Stone and Gravel, and to die of
it, with a ſtoppage of Water.</p>
               <p>A Patient, who had a Convulſive Cough
from his Father, was ſeized with the
Aſthma, and a ſort of Diabetes, with
frequent returns of an Intermitting Fever,
with Lethargic Symptoms; he ſpit much,
and had ſharpneſs of Urine, and frequent
Stools; but the Decoction of the Cortex,
Vomiting, and Steel-waters cured him
for a Twelve Month, when he relapſed
into the ſame Symptoms: His Legs ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the Aſthma returned by Fits; he
was obſcurely Feveriſh, and died full of
Fleſh. All theſe Symptoms depended on
an Intermitting Fever originally.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved divers Aſthmatics
with Rheumatic Pains, and Looſeneſs at
laſt, and others conſume by a Diabetes,
and a great quantity of Water is made
out of the Fits, as well as in them; and
when this flux of Water ſtops, the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
become Hydropic, their Legs ſwell,
and their Breaſts are filled with Water.</p>

ſome Years Aſthmatic, died ſuddenly;

Cauſe of his Death; but the Ventricles

that depended his Drowſineſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

without any Injury appearing in the

full of Water.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Slare</hi> gave me a particular account

                  </gap> Sir <hi>Patient Ward</hi>'s Aſthma, with an Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moptoe,
which laſted about a Year: He
often hawk'd up Blood mixt with tough
Phlegm; the Cortex did him no Service,
after he became Hydropical, the Legs and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49327:131"/>
Belly ſwell'd; two ſpoonfuls of the <hi>Acetum
Scylliticum</hi> vomited him, and made him
to make much Water; then Steel and
Diuretics relieved him for ſome time;
and <hi>Laudanum</hi> help'd his Dyſpnea always.
When he was opened, 4 or 5 Quarts of
Water was found in his Belly, and two
in his Breaſt, his Lungs were without
Schirrous Matter, or Tubercula; the
Lungs ſtuck to the Right Side: He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
this Aſthma to have been Nervous,
and the Dropſy to have happened at laſt:
He obſerved the Left Kidney full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and Hydatides encompaſs it without,
from whoſe Rupture the Dropſy might
come; the Cartilages of the Sternum were
grown Oſſeous, the Gall in the Bladder
was thick and muddy; there appeared
no Veſtigia of the Haemoptoe mentioned,
upon his Lungs.</p>
               <p>The Inundation of the Brain, Breaſt,
Abdomen, by an Hydropical Serum, is
commonly the effect of an old Aſthma,
and the Anaſarcous Tumors of the Body,
depend all on the frequent Conſtriction
of the circulating Veſſels, by the Aſthma
Fits, by which they are weakned, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
and broken, and the digeſtion
of Humours decays; as the Circulation
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49327:131"/>

matter to all the ſorts of Dropſy, into
which the Aſthmatic fall, through too

might be in the Caſe deſcribed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall next give a remarkable Caſe,
communicated to me by the Ingenious
and Learned Dr. <hi>Tyſon,</hi> by which my
Hypotheſis will be plainly demonſtrated,
that the Aſthma Fit may depend on the
contraction of the Veſiculae, and Bronchia
of the Lungs; and how far that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the ſtraining the Lungs by ſwift

               </head>
               <p>When I was a Student formerly at
<hi>Oxon,</hi> hearing of a Spanel Dog, that had
been noted for his ſwiftneſs in Running;
but of late, and on a ſudden, had fallen
into ſo great a ſhortneſs of Breath, that he
could not run 15 or 20 Yards, but was
forced to ſtand ſtill and pant for a good
while after, would breath very ſhort and
quick, and with a great deal of Labour.
I had a Curioſity of ſeeing him, and upon
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49327:132"/>
my own Obſervation found what was
told me, to be exactly true. The Perſon
that kept the Dog could give me no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how this happened to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rendred altogether uſeleſs, for

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I purchaſed the Dog,
having a mind to ſee what occaſion'd this
ſhortneſs of Breath upon ſo little motion.</p>
               <p>Upon Diſſection in the Abdomen, there
was nothing unuſual or uncommon to
be obſerved: But upon opening the Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
I found the Lungs to be very much
pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>'d up, or contracted, ſo that they
did ſeem to fill but half that ſpace which
the Lungs of an other Dog of that ſize
would occupy: However I did not find
the Lungs in any other reſpect out of
Order; there was no Diſcolouration, no
Adheſion to the Pleura; and within
no Tubercule or Glands, but the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Lungs, ſoft and ſpongy as
uſually. Upon blowing into the Wind-Pipe
the Lungs would be inflated ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
but not half ſo much as in an other
Dog. And what hindered this Inflation
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arther, I could plainly perceive was the
Contraction of the outward or common
Membrane of the Lungs, which did ſeem
upon this Contraction to be ſomewhat
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49327:132"/>
Incraſſated, and its Colour a little Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>In the Cavity of the Thorax, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a ſmall quantity of Water, and
ſometimes did ſuſpect whether this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(if of a Corroſive Nature) might
not contribute to the Contraction of the
Membrane. But this I did not think of,
till<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'twas too late to make tryal of the
Nature of this Extravaſed Serum; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flung away; nor upon the whole do
I think it might be the cauſe of it. But
here I rather ſuſpect the Dog might have
lighted upon ſome ſort of Poyſon which
might particularly affect that Membrane,
and cauſe the Contraction. I will not
trouble you with at preſent the Reaſons
I have for ſuch a Conjecture; or if it
was not from an outward Poyſon taken
inward, it might otherwiſe happen from
an Internal Cauſe.</p>
               <p>However this Obſervation plainly
ſhews us the Reaſon why upon Motion
this Dog proved Aſthmatical, nor could
he continue his Motion but for ſo ſhort a
Time; ſince by means of the Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the outward Membrane, the Lungs
could receive by Inſpiration, not half the
Quantity of Air at a time, as it could
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49327:133"/>
before or uſually was wont to do.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give ſome Obſervations which
were Communicated to me by my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Friend Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Bath,</hi> about four
Years ſince, by which he aſſures me of
the great benefit of the <hi>Bath</hi>-Water;
which he tried on many Aſthmatics both
in the nervous and humorous Aſthma,
in which the <hi>Bath</hi>-Waters dilute the
Viſcidity of the Phlegm, and deterges it
by helping its Expectoration.</p>
               <p>He firſt mentions the Benefit the Old
Dutcheſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> received, by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Bath</hi>-Waters, when ſhe was ſixty
Years Old, which recovered her Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
helped her Expectoration ſo well,
that ſhe could lie down in her Bed, and
walk about her Room before ſhe went
away; and on this good Succeſs was
incouraged to viſit the <hi>Bath,</hi> and drink
the Waters there ſome Years after.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Caſe he gives me, is of
one Mr. <hi>Comin,</hi> who came both Aſthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
and Scorbutical, and Hydropical to
<hi>Bath,</hi> where he drank the Waters, which
paſſed well after Purging, Vomiting, and
the uſe of <hi>Aqua Aſthmatica Quercitani,</hi>
and <hi>Aqua Raphani Compoſita;</hi> he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

frequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By all which, in two
Months time, he perfectly recover'd to a
Miracle.</p>
               <p>The third Caſe is of the Lady <hi>Mary
Kirke,</hi> who oft drank the <hi>Bath</hi>-Waters
for an Orthopnaea, with great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
for thereby her Fits did Intermit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
many Months. She bathed by the Lady
<hi>Elizabeth Littleton</hi>'s Perſwaſion, who
ſays, ſhe was cured of her Aſthma chiefly
by Bathing.</p>
               <p>The fourth Caſe is of Sir <hi>Edward Villers,</hi>
who upon the Healing of an Ulcer in the
Leg, was Aſthmatic, for which he drank
the Waters, and his Fits came not ſo oft,
and the Pain of the Ulcer was relieved by
bathing the Leg.</p>
               <p>The fifth Caſe is of a Lady of Thirty
or Forty, Hydropical and Aſthmatic,
who both drank the Waters and bathed
for the Aſthma.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Caſe is of Mrs. <hi>Whittacre,</hi>
who had a great Cough and Palpitation of
the Heart, with ſhortneſs of Breath, and
ſhe was always hot and feveriſh: She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by drinking <hi>Bath</hi>-Waters.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Caſe is of Sir <hi>Robert Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
who was Aſthmatic, and in his fat
Body the Thymus was obſerved to be
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49327:134"/>
enlarged to a great bulk, which upon any
great commotion by Laughing, Talking
earneſtly, gave him ſevere Aſthmatic Fits,
with blackneſs in the Face.</p>
               <p>This Caſe ſhews us how readily the
Aſthma is produc'd by any external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Lungs, and theſe Fits did
immediately go off again, on the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Preſſure of this Glandulous
Tumour. He died not of this Aſthma,
but of a Fever.</p>
               <p>The former Caſes teach us to uſe the
<hi>Bath</hi>-Waters for the viſcid Humours of
the Aſthmatic; and two of the Caſes
ſhew the benefit the Hydropical and
Aſthmatical have by drinking the Waters,
and bathing, which is an extream diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Caſe to Cure; but theſe Caſes being
Matter of Fact, ought to be admitted;

in the Stomach, the ſame Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence
of Humors, and Rarefaction of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49327:139"/>
Spirits, as in the other Aſthma; no hot
hyſteric Medicine is uſeful in the Fit, as
volatile Spirits, or Gums, or Caſtor,
but only <hi>Laudanum</hi> twelve Drops, or
more in a mild hyſteric Draught, the firſt
and ſecond Night if neceſſary, after a Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

               <p>For the preventing this Species of Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma

upon the Turns of the Year; this
Medicine I have found moſt effectual in the
hyſteric Aſthma, much more than in the
ſpitting Aſthma, for which reaſon I gueſs
that the periodic hyſteric Fits depended
originally on a latent Fever, but in time
they introduce a ſlimy flatulent Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,
which requires due Evacuations
and Digeſtives, and then the Repetition

            <head>AN
APPENDIX,
Containing ſome Obſervations omitted,
and one about Weighing of an Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
after <hi>Sanctorius</hi>'s Manner;
with an Account of the Weight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and in, and after the Fits.</head>
            <p>SOME Mornings the Aſthmatic
(who was betwixt 40 and 50 Years
old) upon weighing faſting was
179, others 178, and 180, and 181. But
the Day before the Fits in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>May 2d.</hi> 1698, he was 180 Pound
(including the weight of the Chair 33
Pound, and the Cloaths.) <hi>May 3d.</hi> the
Morning weight was 178 Pound, after
having paſſed by Urine a Pound and half,
by Stool half a Pound. The Weather
was very cold, and Wind N. E. and it
Snowed in the Afternoon; the Aſthmatic
drank Ale, which with the change of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49327:142"/>
Weather, gave a ſhort Fit with very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Spit. The Obſervations I ſhall make
are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Defluxion of Serum is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the quantity of Urine unuſual,
and ſome Spit more than uſual, and the
Stools looſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The change of the Air to Snow
made the Air lighter, which leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the Blood diſpoſed it to the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Fit with the drinking of Ale, which
occaſioned an Efferveſcence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great coldneſs of the N. E.
Wind affected the ſenſe of the Skin, and
that by its ſhivering Contraction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
the Circulation of the rarefied Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
inwardly, and occaſioned the flux
of Serum by Urine and Stool.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There was no unuſal weight obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Aſthmatic the day before the
Fit, therefore the Matter of the Aſthma is
not any great quantity of Serum, ſince it
cannot be obſerved by weighing; but the
cauſe of it muſt be an Efferveſcence of
Humours, which are flatulent and ſerous.</p>
            <p>The Aſthmatic took a ſpoonful of this
Acid Syrup in <abbr>lb</abbr>ſs. of Water, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it three times before Dinner time:
Take Vinegar <abbr>lb</abbr>ſs. Aron Roots ℥ii. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49327:142"/>
them three Days, ſtrain them, and
add Sugar <abbr>lb</abbr>ſs. make a Syrup.</p>
            <p>Orris, Enula Campane, or Horſe Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,
or Fenil Roots may be infuſed in
the ſame manner, or any Carminative
Seed ℥i. in <abbr>lb</abbr>i. of Vinegar to make the
like Syrup.</p>
            <p>Theſe cool things, Toaſt and Water,
with an acid Syrup abate the Windineſs,
and compreſs the rarefied Serum; for
the Humours are rarefied by Heat into
Bubbles, which we call Wind. We find
in Vinegar a cool Taſte from its acid, fit
for the cooling of bilious or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly Humours;
the Acrimony in it makes it biting, and,
as the Antients ſay, fit for Obſtructions,
from viſcid Humours, where there is a
Fever too becauſe it cools and opens
both. The Water drank in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
run off by Urin before Dinner.</p>
            <p>The Diet of the Aſthmatic on the Fit
day was at Dinner two Eggs, Toaſt and
Butter, Small Beer and Water after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
two Pound and a half in weight, the
weight of Supper one Pound and quarter,
Diet in all, three Pound three quarters.
The weight loſt on the Day of the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
three Pound three quarters; by Urine,
three Pound; Inſenſibly three quarters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:49327:143"/>
By this 'tis evident, the Inſenſible is
the fourth part of the whole weight loſt
on the day of the Fit; and it appears to
me, that uſually the Inſenſible Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>April</hi> laſt, when it was cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
amounted to but a third or fourth
part of the weight loſt. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Aſthmatic was the ſame weight
as on the Morning of the Aſthma 178,
which is lighter than uſually.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 6. the former Fit being only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
the next change of Weather on
this day towards Rain, the Wind Weſt,
and the Weather warm, raiſed a new Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence
and gave a new Fit, rather
worſe than the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 4th the weight was 178.</p>
            <p>5th the weight was 178 three quarters,
the weight not conſiderably increaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fit.</p>
            <p>6th in the Morning, loſt then by a
Stool and Water <abbr>lb</abbr>iiſs.</p>
            <p>The weight was in this Morning 178
Pound, after the Evacuation mentioned.</p>
            <p>The whole weight loſt the day before
the Fits was thus;</p>
            <p>Breakfaſt <abbr>lb</abbr>i. 3 quarters.</p>

If we conſider the different weight of
our Air, and the groſſneſs of our Diet, in
reſpect of the <hi>Italian</hi> Air and Diet, we
may well ſuppoſe a difference in <hi>England,</hi>
where the ſenſible Evacuations are three
or four times as much as the Inſenſible:
But, by <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> the ſenſible
Evacuations are exceeded by the inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and they amount to five Pound, if
any one eats eight Pound every day; but
much the contrary happens here, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
commonly exceed the inſenſible three

none; there was no Water in the Belly nor
Breaſt; the Diaphragme had no Injury, but
was preſſed by the Guts much up towards the
Thorax: And the prone Poſture of Horſes
makes the Guts more ſubject to preſs on the

Out-ſide of the Lungs ſeem'd like Tubercula,
but upon preſſing I found thoſe only Bladders
very much diſtended with Air, as I found by
cutting them. I blew up ſome Lobes of the
Lungs, and found the Air would no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> come out
again, nor the Lungs ſubſide of themſelves;
by which it was plain, that the Bladders of the
Lungs had been extended or broken by ſome
Strain in Running, and that the Air remaining
either in the over-diſtended Bladders, or elſe
paſſing through ſome Breach of them, betwixt
the Fibrous Subſtance of the Lungs; that
caus'd a continual Inflation of the whole Lungs,
which compreſſing the Bronchia and Blood-Veſſels,
produces a continual Dyſpnaea, in
which the external Air cannot paſs freely thro'
the Trachea and its Branches in Inſpiration
or Expiration; and this difficulty occaſions the
great Labour and Niſus of the Reſpiratory
Muſcles. There was no Polypus in the Heart,
or the Blood Veſſels of the Lungs; no Adheſion
of the Lungs to the Sides, nor any ſigns of any
quantity of Phlegm in the Trachea and Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,
nor no Decay, Tumor, or Corruption or
Obſtruction in any Part of them, only the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſeem'd to make the Superficies of the Skin
of the Lungs unequal, and the whole ſpungy
Subſtance of the Lungs ſeem'd ſwelled with
Wind; for no quantity of Humour appear'd
any where. This Mare had not been Broken
Winded above one Year. By this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it appears, that the Broken Wind depends
on an Injury done to the Membranes, rather
than to the Humours of the Body.</p>

            <head type="sub">Some Reflexions on the Diſſection of the
Broken Winded Mare.</head>
            <p>THere are two ſorts of windy Tumors
in the external Membranes of the
Body; the one from the admiſſion of the
external Air amongſt the Membranes, as
appears in a Wound of the Thorax, in
which the Membranes are inflated if the
Orifice be ſmall: And another windy
Tumor happens to the Membranes of the
Knees, Feet, Hands, Eyes, Belly, by a
rarified Serum filling the Canals of the
Nervous Fibers, and this is properly a
Nervous Inflation: For if this Tumor be
opened, no Humour appears to come
forth. I deſire to apply this Diſtinction
of flatulent Tumors, to the Inflations
which produce the flatulent Aſthma, and
I ſhall reckon two Species of theſe Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
the firſt is, the Broken Wind,
from the Rupture or Dilatation of the
Bladders of the Lungs, by which the Air
is too much retain'd in the Bladders, or
their Interſtices, and thereby produces a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49327:19"/>
permanent flatulent Tumor in the whole
Subſtance of the Lungs. 'Tis not eaſy to
explain the Production of a permanent
flatulent Tumor in the Lungs, by a Strain
in Running; but by ſuppoſing the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Trachea too much diſtended,
and the muſcular Fibers which conſtringe
them in Expiration thereby over-ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and made unfit to expreſs the Air
afterwards: So that theſe Bladders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
more Air than is uſual, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Lungs muſt appear always
Inflated. I could not find any other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
but this flatulent Tumor of the
Lungs, in this Mare I Diſſected, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall impute all the Symptoms to
this only Cauſe, though I have with the
Vulgar conjectur'd, that the Diſeaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on Polypous Concretions of Blood,
or Tubercula, which are obſerved in
ſome Horſes; they are only the effects
of a long Broken Windedneſs, by its long
continuance. This windy Tumor, by
compreſſing the Trachea, hinders the
admiſſion of the Air, and makes a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reſpiration: The ſame Tumor
hinders the Efflation of Air, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
the Muſcles of the Belly to ſtrain
much, as appears by their Working in the
Flank.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:49327:19"/>
The return of the Blood to the Heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the deſcent of the Chyle into the
Guts, and its depuration, ſecretion, and
diſtribution, do naturally depend on the
Motion of the Diaphragme and Breaſt,
and that being hinder'd, the Horſe is
languid, and fainty, for want of a free
Circulation, which is alſo ſtopt on the
Lungs, by the flatulent Tumor of them,
and that much encreaſes the Tumor and
Anguſtia, Fulneſs and Straitneſs in the
Breaſt. The Parts are Emaciated for
want of a full Circulation of Humours
into them; neither can the Chyle be well
prepared or aſſimulated to the Blood,
where the Circulation is weak and ſtopt;
'Tis only digeſted into a ſlimy Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is the Matter of the ſlimy
Phlegm, both in the Stomach and Lungs.</p>
            <p>A Windineſs is always obſerved in the
Belly of the broken Winded Horſes, for
want of a quick Diſtribution, or a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
Preparation, or Fermentation of
the Aliments, for which the ſlimy Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Stomach ſeems unfit.</p>
            <p>Theſe Horſes Wheeze much after fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Stomachs, by Water, or Food,
becauſe that keeps up the Diaphragme,
and that by reaſon of their prone Poſture
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49327:20"/>
of Body preſſes much upon the Lungs,
which by their Tumor take up too much
room in the Breaſt. The other flatulent
Tumor of the Lungs depending on a
rarefied Serum in the Nerves and Fibers
of the Membranes, is ſufficiently deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in this Treatiſe, as to its frequent
Paroxyſms and Cauſes.</p>
            <p>As it happens in external flatulent Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
they at firſt go off and return, but
at laſt fix in permanent flatulent Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors;
ſo it is in the flatulent Aſthma,
the frequent nervous Inflations induce at
laſt a conſtant windy Tumor, or Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and it ought to be conſider'd how
far the holding the Breath in Hyſteric
Fits, or the violent Coughing in long
Catarrhs, or the great Diſtention of the
Lungs, by an Inflammation in the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumonia,
may ſtrain the Bladders,
and their Muſcular Fibers, and thereby
produce the ſame Rupture, or Dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Hernia, as happens in the broken
Winded. This muſt be obſerv'd by the
help of the Microſcope; and if the Air
blown into any Lobe will not be expelled
thence, by the natural Tone or Muſcle
of the Bladders, that the Lobe may again
ſubſide of it ſelf, 'tis certain, ſome Injury</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:49327:22"/>
is done to the Ventiducts; the Bladders
are either broken, and admit the Air into
the Membranous Interſtices, or elſe they
are over-diſtended, like a Hernia in the
Peritoneum; and this will produce an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation
of the whole Subſtance of the
Lungs, and that a continual compreſſion
of the Air and Blood-Veſſels, which will
produce a conſtant Aſthma; But where
the Fits are Periodic, 'tis certain there is
no permanent inflated Tumor, but that
depends on a flux of windy Serum into
the Nerves, or on the preternatural Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction
of the <hi>Succus Nervoſus,</hi> by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Accidents.</p>
            <p>This flatulent Tumor of the Lungs
has been oft obſerv'd in Aſthmatics.
<hi>Car. Piſo</hi> obſerves a Dyſpnaea in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritic,
<hi>à Pulmone tumente.</hi> And <hi>De
Graaf de Succ. Pancreatico,</hi> has this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<hi>Saepius offendimus Pulmonum
Parenchyma, atque vaſa ſtatu diſtenta.
Rhodius</hi> obſerves, that the Lungs of an
Aſthmatic were Turgid with Wind:
Other Authors have obſerved the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
bigneſs of the Lungs, and that
they could not be eaſily kept in the Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax
opened.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:49327:23"/>
The Cure of the broken Wind cannot
eaſily be projected any other way, but
by a Paraſenteſis in the Thorax; for if
the external Air be admitted, it will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the flatulent Tumor, and through
the ſame hole a Styptic and Carminative
Hydromel may be injected, to reſtore by
its Stypticity the Tone of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
and diſcuſs by its Aromatic A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony
the windy Spirits, or Air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Lungs. This may eaſily
be tried in the broken Winded Horſes,
by injecting through a Hole made in the
declining Part of the Breaſt.</p>
            <p>I perceive the Experiment of Dr.
<hi>Lowers,</hi> by which he produced the Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
in a Dog, by cutting the Nerves of
the Diaphragme, has occaſioned ſome
Moderns to impute the Aſthma, as he
doth, to ſome Strain, or loſs of Tone in
the Nerves of the Diaphragme. But
this cutting of the Nerves, if nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd,
doth only hinder the motion of
the Diaphragme, and that being hindred,
the Breaſt cannot be dilated fully by the
Intercoſtal Muſcles; the want of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation
compreſſes the Lungs, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
their due Expanſion, and this muſt
occaſion a Dyſpnaea, as Gibboſity, or a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49327:23"/>
Pleuriſy doth, in which the Intercoſtal
Muſcles are hindred from dilating the
Breaſt, for which they ſerve as well as
the Diaphragme. It ſeems to me a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
to believe the Nerves of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme
can be injured by any Strain;
for Strains only affect the Body of a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcle,
and not the Nerves inſerted into it;
and I could never perceive any Injury
done to the Muſcle or Tendon of the
Diaphragme in the Aſthma, but that as
well as the Intercoſtal Muſcles, ſtrive
with all their force to dilate the Breaſt,
but all in vain, becauſe the Bronchia are
compreſſed or conſtringed by the Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Membrane: And if the Air
cannot be admitted, the Breaſt cannot be
dilated by its Muſcles, as we plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
when any External Body ſlips into
the Windpipe, whereby the Air is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in ſome meaſure; this produces a
violent Orthopnaea and Suffocation very
ſuddenly.</p>
