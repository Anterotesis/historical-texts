            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of temperaments of divers eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe they naturally are
more excrementitious, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1174:19"/>
commonly they purge not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
as others doe, by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> Why is it that women mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

than others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is becauſe that kind of
appetite is awakened, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
in them before its time,
and naturall paſſages being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that kind of delight
much increaſeth in them, and
often-times proves a dangerous

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore is it, that women
with child, have diſordinate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
and a longing to eate unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
food?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> This happeneth about
the ſecond or third Moneth of
their conceiving, when the
naturall purgation gathers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about the Matrice, for the
nouriſhing of the fruite: For if
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1174:20"/>
the naturall purgation be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupted, and over char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with ſome ill humour, this
evill imparteth it ſelfe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
as by ſome contagion to
the Orifice beneath, and from
thence to the ſtomacke, and
cauſeth her to deſire meates of
the ſame quality as that humour
requires; ſo that if that corrupt
humour bee participant of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
it happeneth that
the party with child deſireth to
eate coales, tyles, aſhes, or
ſome other aduſt things: If that
humour be of the quality of a
pricking and biting phlegme,
ſhe deſires Vinegar, or ſowre
meates, and ſauces of ſuch
kind, and ſo of other humours.
But this happeneth not to all
women with child, becauſe all
have not that naturall purgation
ſo vicious and corrupt: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1174:20"/>
the wiſer ſort of them doe
moderate, or conceale theſe kind
of deſires and longings: The
ſame reaſon is, for the loathing
and deteſting that they have to
ſome meates, which ſeeme hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
unto them, according to the
evill humours which predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
as aforeſaid.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> VVherefore is it, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

than thoſe that go with a Female:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is becauſe in the males
there is a great deale more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
heate; which the mothers

doe feele and perceive, and by
conſequence are better colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and more healthy, than
when they goe with a female.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> VVhat is the reaſon, that
women with Childe are more tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
then when they are not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is, becauſe they are
then leſſe afraid of being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſo long as they are bigge,
wherein they diſcover their

perſons, become more inſolent
when they know themſelves

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> VVhy are women more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,

than men?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By reaſon of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their nature; for being
not able by force to ſupport and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1174:21"/>
maintaine themſelves, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> VVherefore are women more

ſome moneths with childe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe at the beginning
the infant participates not ſo
much of the humours within the
body of the Mother, as when it
groweth a little bigger; for it is
nouriſhed by the naturall purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ſuperfluous humors of
the Mother.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> VVherefore hath nature
placed the Paps of the woman upon
the ſtomacke, and not lower, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
female animals?</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1174:22"/>
creature, and of a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
perfection above all other
females, Nature provided her
a place more decent for them,
and freed her from a great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which were they otherwiſe
placed, would be undecent, and
incommodious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore have not men
great Paps, and large Dugs, as
women have?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Nature frames nothing in
vaine: theſe great Pappes being
given to Women as veſſels to
receive their naturall purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are converted into
Milke, for the ſuſtenance of the
infant; it was needleſſe, that
men, that have no ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and is not fit they

ſhould have any ſuch large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles,
or veſſels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But how comes it, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1174:22"/>
Paps or Breaſt, begin not to
riſe or appeare, before the age of 12
or 13 yeares?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe then beginneth
the time of their naturall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,

that age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore is it, that women
and children weepe oftner, and
with more facility, than men of a
perfect age?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is, becauſe both women
and children are very humide, &amp;
therefore being ſurcharged and
preſſed by griefe and vexation,
they eaſily evacuate that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of moyſture by the way of
teares.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Whence is it, that the man
and the woman both old, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
cold, that the woman is
not ſo eaſily, nor ſo ſoone drunke as
the man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By reaſon that women
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1174:23"/>
being cold and moyſt, doe
more reſiſt the heate of Wine;
and old men being dry, and the
Wine ſoaking in, and greatly
moyſtning their bodies, doth
more endamage them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore is it, that women
are more mutable and variable
than men?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe they are of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parament
leſſe perfect, being
more cold than men, and things
of more perfection, are leſſe
mutable: moreover, women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more weake, are ſo much
the more ſuſpicious, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and ſuſpicion brings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
with it a change of will:
But let me ſay thus much in their

when they are in their teenes
grow bigge, and not before that

                  <p>A. <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> ſaith,
the reaſon is, that then her

that reaſon her breaſts grow
bigge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Why hath a woman that is
great with childe of a boy, the
right dug harder than the left?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the Male-childe
is conceived in the right ſide of
the Mother; and therefore the
Flowers or Termes have more
courſe to the right Pap, than to
the left, and ſo by this reaſon
cauſeth it to be harder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> And likewiſe why doth the

the health of the Childe in the
Matrix?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe
her Terms are turned into milk,
and that Milke doth nouriſh the
fruite in the wombe aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and thereby its ſtrength is
manifeſted (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith.)</p>

of?</p>
                  <p>

may perceive a ſeame or

                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> Becauſe Nature hath
three Receptacles, wherein
the ſeed of man doth flow;
the one in the right ſide,
which commonly doth
breed the Male; the other on
the left ſide, which doth
breed the Female, and the
third veſſell or receptacle, is
that which is in the middle,
in which the ſeed doth fall,
whereby the Hermophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
is begotten, which we
commonly terme Monſters;
but this is not ordinary, but
rather extraordinary; for
Nature doth never produce
any of theſe Monſters, but
by ſome extraordinary and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1174:25"/>
laſcivious thoughts in the
very act, or elſe after the
act, which bringeth ſleepe,
there to continue in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Female, which I
thinke, and ſome other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
are of my opinion, is a
maine cauſe of theſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
called Hermophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites;
and ſometimes Nature
hath given them that are
thus luxurious, no comfort
of their iſſue; for if not Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mophrodites,
then they
proove fooles and ideots.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> Why doe ſome children

father or mother which hath

the leſſer, and being
more deſirous of luſt, which
cauſeth the ſame likeneſſe:
And againe, it is, when in the
very act the man remembers
the viſage of the Woman,
which is a great matter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it in his thought at that

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1174:26"/>
by reaſon of the watery and

which hath rule in every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
whatſoever; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Moon is retrograde,
&amp; ill deſpoſed at that time, is

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The reaſon is, (as wee
may ſee in divers fruites)
when they be ripe, they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
fal, and ſo likewiſe, when
the childe is at full growth,
then the veſſell doth breake,

mixture of the aduſt terrene
dryneſſe, elevated by the
power of the Sunne, and
mingled with the moyſt
vapours that fall into the

                     <hi>A.</hi> The cauſe hereof is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the Miſtreſſe of
moyſture, the Moone: for
at her increaſe or decreaſe, it
is certaine that the humours
almoſt of all things doe
change and alter. Wherupon
the Moon running under the
Sun, (which happeneth in
her change) the light of both
being hindred, cannot ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
the ayre, which being
groſſened, is turned to water,
and the encreaſe of the Sea
is augmented in ſubſtance, &amp;
a flowing muſt neceſſarily
follow: but the Moone being
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1174:61"/>
in oppoſition of the Sunne,
(which happeneth in her ful)
diſperſeth her light all over
the inferiour bodies: neither
is ſhe a hindrance to the Sun,
for the imparting his light
and power to the Sea; and
hereupon the water of
the Sea, which by the reaſon
of its groſſeneſſe contayneth
vapours, becomes thinne,
aſcends and flowes like the
droppes of warme Milke;
and this encreaſe is not in
ſubſtance, but by accident,
by the rarefaction: But
in the interpoſed <hi>quartiles</hi>
of the Moone, the Sea
encreaſeth and decreaſeth
by the like cauſes. In the
firſt <hi>quartile</hi> the Sea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth:
in the ſecond it
increaſeth accidentally by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1174:62"/>
the way of rarefaction:
In the third it decreaſeth by
the rarefaction, by the
decreaſing of the light: In
the fourth the Moone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
nearer the Sunne, the
ſubſtance of the Sea againe
increaſeth by the thicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ayre. As for
the foure quarters of the day
naturall, the Sea imitates
the motion of the Moone:
For while the Moone upon
the Horizon aſcends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the middle of the
Heaven, the Sea increaſeth
and floweth: But the Moone
declining from the middle
of the Heaven towards
the Weſt, the Sea decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and ebbes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the Moone going
forward to the Weſt-ward,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1174:62"/>
towards the corner of the
night, the Sea increaſeth,
and flowes: but the Moone
aſcending from the corner of
the night towards the Eaſt,
it decreaſeth and ebbes.

it is Etymologiſed <hi>quaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aëris,</hi>
and by us, it is by the
reaſon of ſimilitude or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
tearmed a Raine-bow,
<hi>quaſi</hi> Rainy-bow; which
ſeemed ſo admirable, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1174:72"/>
the Ancients called it, The
daughter of Admiration.<note place="margin">Plato in Theat.</note>
But never theleſſe, it will not
ſeeme ſo ſtrange, if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what is ſaid before,
touching the diverſity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which oftentimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the aire; for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of the colours in the
Raine-bow appeare to us, as
produced from the like cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is the cauſe of the
Raine bow, and diverſity of
its colours?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Raine-bow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
it ſelfe in the aire, when
we perceive the Sun through
a ſomewhat thicke, but a
tranſparant cloud towards
us, by the reaſon it is dewy,
and diſpoſed to bee melted
into raine, but groſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1174:72"/>
the Sunne, ſo that his
raies cannot penetrate it;
for in this manner, wee ſee
three principall colours, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range
colour, green, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and by the mixture and
confuſion of theſe colors, by
reaſon of the reflection of the
light of the Sun, and our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
others confuſedly like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
are repreſented: even as
I ſaid before in the Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the ayre; that upon the
neck of a Pigeon, or Peacock,
or of a changeable Taffety,
according to the poſtures
they are in, in the way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
of the light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore is it, that
ſometimes two or three
Raine-bowes are ſeene at one
time?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe when the cloud
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1174:73"/>
is very cleare and Chriſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
it accidentally happens,
that by the reflection of the
light, two oppoſite, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegate
Raine-bowes alſo
appeare in the Ayre: but
this happens rather, when
the Sunne darts his ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
upon two Cloudes,
and both diſpoſed to receive
the ſame impreſſions: ſo that
ſometimes a third Raine-bow
is ſeene meerely by the
reflection of the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
or both: But thoſe that
take their reflections from
the firſt, have their colours
far more dimme, nothing ſo
quick norlively as that which
takes its firſt reflection from
the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore is it, that
the Raine-bow appeare but in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1174:73"/>
a ſemicircle, and not wholly
round?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the Sunne
illuminates the cloud cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
and in the way
of rotundity; but not ſo,
that it may perfect a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
by the reaſon of the
connexity of the Heaven:
ſo that by how much the Sun
is higher upon our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,</hi>
ſo much the leſſe
the Raine-bow ſeemes: but
morning and evening it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
greateſt: And by
the ſame cauſe wee ſet our
ſhadowes longer in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and evening, than at
noone-day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Whether doth the Raine-bow
preſage faire or foule
weather?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The opinions concerning
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1174:74"/>
this point are ſo divers and
different,<note place="margin">Senec. li. 2. na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. queſt. c. 6.</note> that it is hard to
judge. <hi>Seneca</hi> is of opinion,
that in the morning it por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
a faire day, at noone
raine, at night Thunder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pliny,</hi> who in my conceit
was a more curious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the incertainty, writes,
that it neither promiſeth
certainely raine, nor cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
faire weather, but if
it be double, or two, it will
bee attended with raine.
And the reaſon hereof, I
gueſſe, is, that the cloud
being very humid and moiſt,
then when a ſecond Bow ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by reflexion, ſo that
it is ready to melt into
raine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> Wherefore is it, that
many mountaines in <hi>Sicily,</hi> as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1174:74"/>
                     <hi>Aetna, Naxus, Lipara,</hi> and
<hi>Brocano</hi> are burning, and
many Fountaines alſo?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> The cauſe of ſuch
fires is, that the hot exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being encloſed, and ſhut
up in the cavernes or dennes
of the earth, ſeeking to
breake out by force, kindle
by their alliſion and attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the earth, and ſuch
hard bodies as they meete
with, and ſo breake out in
flames through the crannies
and chinks of the earth,
which of it ſelfe being ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phury,
ſlimy, and oyly, and
capable of fire, is the cauſe
of the continuance of the
fire a long time, caſting up
fire, ſmoake, and aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
As for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
we muſt preſuppoſe,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1174:75"/>
that they dreane through a
ſulphury earth, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
apt to burne, ſo that the
more ſubtile exhalations iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
through the hollow
concaves of the earth, kindle
as afore-ſaid, and heate the
very waters, and thence
come our naturall Baths.</p>

the ſperme of the right

the left: if then the ſeed

ſuper fluities which oppreſſe
it ſo much, which if they did
