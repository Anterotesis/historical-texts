            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>2 Cor. 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>It is not expedient for me doubtleſs to glory: I will come to viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and revelations of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>I knew a man in Chriſt above fourteen year ago (whether in the
body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell, God
knoweth) ſuch an one caught up to the third heaven.</p>
                  <p>And I knew ſuch a man (whether in the body, or out of the body,
I cannot tell: God knoweth)</p>
                  <p>How that he was caught up into Paradiſe, and heard unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
                  <p>Of ſuch an one will I glory; yet of my ſelf will I not glory, but
in mine infirmities.</p>
                  <p>For though I would deſire to glory, I ſhall not be a fool; for I
will ſay the truth: but now I forbear, left any man ſhould think of
me above that which he ſeeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</p>
                  <p>And leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the fleſh,
the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me, leſt I ſhould be exalted above
meaſure.</p>
                  <p>For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
from me.</p>
                  <p>And he ſaid, My grace is ſufficient for thee: for my ſtrength
is made perfect in weakneſs. Moſt gladly therefore will I rather
glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is but lately that we were here lamenting the loſs of this
City and the Church of God, in the removal of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Saint; we are now come on the like occaſion. It
is a year of Jubile for holy ſouls, and a harveſt for heaven,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61124:3"/>
The ripeſt are gathered, and the green and ſowre fruit is yet
left on earth: But Oh what a heavy judgement is it, to the
needy world, which wants ſuch lights, as God is taking in.
But we are not the Chooſers! Its well if we be obedient Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and can follow ſuch to life in the Holy path.</p>
            <p>The Text read to you hath ſo much matter of Inſtruction
that will excuſe me if I ſcarce name the moſt. It is part of
<hi>Pauls</hi> Vindication againſt the accuſers of his Perſon and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
which were ſome Erroneous Judaizing Teachers. He
confeſſeth that <hi>glorying</hi> is an <hi>unexpedient</hi> thing, and ſounds like
folly; but yet in caſe of neceſſary defence, it may be modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſincerely done: Eſpecially the opening of thoſe Divine
Revelations and gifts which makes for the ſtrength of the
Faith of others. The Explication ſhall be taken in as we go.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 1.</hi> It is no new thing for the wiſeſt and holieſt of Chriſts
Miniſters to be accuſed even by the Teachers of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>For 1. There are many Erroneous Teachers, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
they are in the right, and oppoſe the Teachers of Truth
as if they were the erring men.</p>
            <p>2. And there are Worldly, Proud, Malignant Hypocrites,
who bring their unſanctified Hearts into the ſacred Office, and
manage it as men do common Trades, but with greater enmity
and ſtrife.</p>
            <p>3. And there are abundance of ignorant or halfwiſe injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men, who have ſelf conceitedneſs enough to be peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and confident, but neither knowledge nor humility enough
to perceive their own weakneſs and miſtakes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 1.</hi> Therefore let it not become a ſcandal to you if you
hear ſome Teachers accuſing and vilifying others.</p>
            <p>2. And think not that a Miniſter is erroneous or faulty,
meerly becauſe others, though of great name, do accuſe him,
or ſo repreſent him. It hath ſtill been ſo, and while Satan is
Satan, and man is Corrupt man, and there is ſo much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſo much Worldly Temptations, and Croſs Intereſts,
it will be ſo: And Preachers will be made the common and
dangerous hinderers of Preachers; And where they have Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
will ſilence them, and diſgrace their work.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>Glorying or boaſting is in it ſelf an inexpedient
thing.</hi> It ſavours of <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Selfiſhneſs,</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61124:3"/>
it is not neceſſary and juſt. And therefore all Chriſtians ſhould
be backward to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 3. Yet</hi> that which is ſo inexpedient, may on juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
become good, and a duty.</p>
            <p>That is, 1. When it is made needful to Gods honour, and
the vindication and ſucceſs of our Miniſtry and the Truth. And,</p>
            <p>2. VVhen theſe are our true ends. And,</p>
            <p>3. VVhen we ſpeak nothing but the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> III. O that men knew how great a ſin it is, by their
confident Errors and raſh Accuſations, to put Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
upon ſuch a defence; much more to ſeek their ſilence and
deſtruction.</p>
            <p>2. And here you ſee that <hi>inconveniencies</hi> will not excuſe us
from neceſſary duties; nor prove that all is unlawful which
hath ſuch. What is it in this confuſed and imperfect
VVorld that hath not its <hi>inconveniencies?</hi> In Government,
both <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> abſolute and
limited, have their many <hi>inconveniencies.</hi> In Churches,
the power of People and Paſtors, equality and ſubordination,
riches and poverty, ſeverity and lenity; to uſe Diſcipline or
neglect it, have their <hi>inconveniencies.</hi> In Worſhip, impoſed
words of free, and all humane forms and modes have their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies.</hi>
In Houſes, a marryed life and a ſingle, to have
Children and to have none, to have ſervants or none, to have
much buſineſs or little, to be high or low, rich and poor, to
rule greatly or ſeverely, have all their <hi>inconveniencies.</hi> In our
converſations to be yielding or not, to converſe with few or
many, with high or low, to ſpeak or to be ſilent, have all
their <hi>inconveniencies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet there are men that on one ſide can ſilence Chriſts
faithful Miniſters by hundreds or thouſands and perſecute the
true Members of Chriſt, and caſt out true diſcipline, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the Churches, and juſtifie all this by urging ſome <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.</hi>
And there are others that can unchurch moſt
Churches in the World, and ſeparate from their Worſhip,
and think the charge of <hi>inconveniencies</hi> will juſtifie all. And ſo
we ſhould have no Government, no Miniſtry, no Worſhip, no
Families, Wives or Children, or Servants, no Books, no
Trades, no Food, no Phyſick, if all meer <hi>inconveniencies</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61124:4"/>
By this our inſtance <hi>Solomon</hi> may be underſtood, what it is
to be <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Righteous overmuch,</hi> ſome are ſo <hi>Wiſe</hi> and
<hi>Righteous</hi> (materially not formally) that they can find faults
in all perſons, all duties, all ſpeeches, all actions, and on
pretence of doing all better, would hinder us from doing what
we can, and undo all as if it were for amending, not but that
inconveniences may make actions ſinful. But the great part of
Chriſtian prudence lyeth in holding the ballance, and trying
wiſely whether the good or hurt, the benefit or inconvenience
do weigh down; We ſhall never Preach or Pray, nor converſe
with mankind without ſome <hi>inconveniency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 4.</hi> Divine Revelations acquainting the ſoul with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
are matters moſt worthy of lawful, humble, modeſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Pauls</hi> Heavenly Viſions which he gloryed in as his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
when he had mentioned his many perſecutions
and ſufferings in the way.</p>
            <p>Theſe tend to that perfection and felicity of ſouls: In theſe
men have to do with the glorious <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Angelical <hi>Chore,</hi>
the heavenly Society, our glorified Head, our higheſt Hopes, and
matter of the greateſt everlaſting joys. O if God would but give
you and me this Heavenly ſight, and let us but once ſee what
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaw, what little things would Crowns and Lordſhips
ſeem to us when we look down from ſuch an height? What
trifling ſhould we think moſt of the buſles of this world? what
toyes and dreams, their wealthy honour and ſinful Delights.
I ſhould then ſay, Now I ſee what it is that we ſeek and hope
and ſuffer for, what it is to enjoy God and our Redeemer:
And therefore now I know, what it is to be a Beleiver, a Saint,
a man indeed. O what a help to mortification would ſuch a
ſight of Paradiſe be? How eaſily ſhould we after reſiſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
deny the Fleſh, contemn the world, and hate our ſins.
O how it would overcome all theſe diſtruſtful trembling fears
of death, and make us long, and grown and cry, to be with
Chriſt? VVhat life would it put into all holy duty? How eaſily
ſhould we bear our ſhort afflictions? How would it mellow
our ſowre contentious minds toward one another, and teach us
better whom to love and live in Peace with, than pride and
VVorldlineſs or Faction will teach us.</p>
            <p>

Fellow Chriſtians, Though you and I may not expect ſuch
Raptures, and Extaſies as <hi>Paul's;</hi> yet we have the Goſpel of
Jeſus, a Divine Revelation of this ſame heavenly glory; not
to be ſet light by, becauſe we ſee it not our ſelves, It is by the
Son of God that ſaw it, and now is there preparing it for us;
it is by a ſealed certain word. And the heavenly beams are
ſent down from him upon our hearts, to ſhew it us and lead
us up. VVe are capable of a lively beleif of the full aſſurance of
hope, of the pledges, earneſt, and firſt fruits; and of rejoycing
with unſpeakable glorying joy. We are capable in our manner,
and are ſure of traffick for heaven, and with heaven, of ſending
up our treaſures, and there converſing in ſpirit as in the City
which is our home, and hearing by Faith the joyful harmony
of the heavenly Songs and Praiſes of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Here we are
capable of ſuch a powerful touch with the Loadſtone of Divine
Love, or to have our Spirits ſo refined and ſublimated, as
ſhall make it as natural to them to make upward towards
Chriſt, and long for full and perfect union. O had we lived
as Beleivers ſhould have lived, how much more of heavenly
mindedneſs, and delight might we have attained than we have
done? O thank God for the Goſpel revelation, and beg grace
to bring it in power on your hearts; And then, let world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
take their earthly portion; VVe can ſpare them all that
hindereth not the gathering and edification of the Church, and
the heavenly intereſt of ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 5.</hi> There is a third Heaven and Heavenly Paradice,
where are the concerns and hopes of holy ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> was thither taken up; had he no intereſt there, no
hopes, no friends, no buſineſs there; VVhy then ſhould he
have been rapt up thither? <hi>How many Heavens</hi> there be, and
why it is here called the <hi>third,</hi> I will not interrupt your more
neceſſary thoughts, by conjecturing enquiries: Moſt ſay the
<hi>Air</hi> is called the firſt, the <hi>Starry Heaven</hi> the ſecond, and the
<hi>place</hi> of the <hi>glorified Spirits,</hi> the third; but theſe are vain conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
No man knoweth how many there be, the Globes or
Stars are at vaſt diſtance from each other, ſome great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
have been tempted to think that VVorld is <hi>infinite</hi> as
an adequate effect of infinite Power, becauſe God hath no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
power; All this is prophane raſhneſs. The Heavens
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61124:5"/>
which are our inheritance are the place where perfect Glorious
Spirits ſhall live in bleſſed Society with Chriſt and one another;
joyfully beholding the Glory of God, and feeling the delights
of mutual Love; And yet there are different degrees of Glory
from the different degrees of the Capacity of Spirits: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alſo from any difference in the place and communicating
Cauſes, we ſhall ſhortly better know. There are more ſorts
of Spirits thatn we can now know. Though I know not how
to receive <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s Doctrine that no two Angels are of the ſame
Species; the diverſity as well as the incomprehenſible Glory
and Numbers, are unknown to us. Thoſe that God employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
under Chriſt as his Purſuivants, Meſſengers, and Servants
for his Church, are called Angels: Whether there be orders
over orders quite above Angels, and how Angels differ from
the perfected Spirits of the Juſt, we know not.</p>
            <p>As it is deſigned for Saints, its Glory conſiſteth,</p>
            <p>1. In the Glory of the Place.</p>
            <p>2. In the perfecting and glorifying the Natures and Perſons
that enjoy it.</p>
            <p>3. In the Glory of the Heavenly Society, Chriſt, Angels
and Saints.</p>
            <p>4. In the Glory of their high and excellent work, to Love
and Magnifie God for ever.</p>
            <p>5. In the Communication of the Joyful Love, and Light and
Life of God, upon theſe glorified Spirits. O what doth every
one of theſe words ſignifie! Is not this a Paradiſe indeed, that
is a place of pureſt greateſt pleaſure?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 1.</hi> And are we not taught by ſuch a glaſs as this, how
Great and how Good a God we ſerve? O look up to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and ſee what he is by that which he hath made. Yea, its
ſaid <hi>Pſal. 113. 6.</hi> that he humbles himſelf to behold the things
in <hi>Heaven;</hi> as well as upon earth. O ſinners! what a God do
you deſpiſe, neglect, and forget! and what a Heaven do you
fell for fleſhly luſt, and to feed a Corruptible Body for the
Grave! O Chriſtians, what a God have we to ſerve and fear!
and how Zealouſly and purely ſhould we ſerve him! What a
God have we to truſt and hope in, and how great a ſin is it to
diſtruſt him! What a Heaven have we to ſeek and hope for,
and how chearfully and conſtantly ſhould we do it. Alas, our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61124:5"/>
cold Hearts, and ſlothful Lives, and worldly Cares, and ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirits, beſeem not ſuch a God and Heaven. Were we
deſigned but to inhabit the Sun, or ſome reſplendent Star, how
high is it above this Earth? Shall we creep only on Earth and
feed on duſt, and defile our Souls as if we were preparing them
by Sin for Hell, when we have a <hi>third heaven,</hi> and <hi>Paradiſe</hi>
to look up to, and ſeek and hope for?</p>
            <p>Doth Satan ſay, <hi>what is that to thee, that is ſo far above thee.</hi>
It is to us; it is the place where the Glory of God is which we
ſeek; where our glorified Head is. The place of holy Spirits,
whither alſo <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were Tranſlated: where <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> live; whither Chriſts Spirit went at
Death, and where he received the believing Thief; where
<hi>Lazarus</hi> is in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom; which <hi>Stephen</hi> foreſaw, and
to which he was received. It is the place which we are ſet on
Earth to ſeek; dearly purchaſed; ſurely promiſed; to
which Gods Spirit is now preparing us: and of which it is our
pledge and ſeal. Were it not for ſuch an end and hope, how
vain were Man, and what a dream this World. Take Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from us, aud take our Lives, our Joyes, yea, more
than many ſuch lives as theſe: O that we could be more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſible for what we are Chriſtians, and for what we hope!
what holy, patient, joyful Chriſtians ſhould we then be.
But it is not a wavering Belief, a divided heart, and a few cold
ſtrange and ſtaggering thoughts of Heaven, that will do this,
as we deſire it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 6.</hi> Souls are not ſo cloſely tyed to the body, but
now they may be rapt up into Paradiſe, or the third
Heavens.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> could not tell whether it was in the body or out
of it, it ſheweth ſome how the Soul was there, and that its
<hi>poſſible</hi> it might be <hi>out of the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If it were in the body, the body muſt go with it: If out
of the body it muſt leave the body dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It might be in the body and not take up the body: If
man were born blind, the Iucid Spirits, and viſive faculty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61124:6"/>
would act only within: But as ſoon as a Miracle opened his
eyes, he would ſee as far as the Sun and Stars. And the Sun
ſends down its beams even to this Earth. Should God open
this dark Lanthorn of the Body, we little know how far a
Soul may ſee without any ſeparation from the body: Did not
<hi>Stephen</hi>'s Soul in the body ſee Chriſt in Glory?</p>
            <p>And if it went <hi>out of the Body,</hi> it followeth not that it muſt
be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the body and leave it dead. When <hi>London</hi>
was on fire, how high did the flame go above the fuel, and yet
it was not ſeparated from the fuel: A Soul can ſtay in the body,
and yet not be confined to it as a Chicken in the Shell; but
may ſee, and mount above it to the Heavens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Therefore think not of Souls as you do of Bodies,
which are Circumſcribed in their proper places. We know
not what formal thoughts to have of the <hi>dimenſions</hi> or <hi>locality</hi>
of Spirits: Somewhat ſuch <hi>eminenter</hi> they have, (for they
have <hi>individuation</hi> and <hi>numeral quantity,</hi> and ſome <hi>paſſivity)</hi>
but not <hi>formaliter</hi> as groſs bodies have: While the Soul is in
the Body, it worketh on it, and is a Subſtance diſtinct from it,
and ſuch a <hi>form</hi> as hath alſo its <hi>own form;</hi> even its formal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
or Virtue, of Vital Activity, Senſitive and Intellective
Perception, and Senſitive and Rational Appetite. It is <hi>Active
Life</hi> it ſelf, as the Principle: It perceiveth it ſelf, and loveth
it ſelf, it underſtandeth what other Spirits are, by it ſelf; It
remembereth innumerable things paſt: It riſeth up to ſome
knowledge of God. It can ſeek, love, and obey him, and
all this though not <hi>out</hi> of the body yet <hi>above</hi> any <hi>efficiency</hi> of
bodily Organs. O what a ſad part of Mans Fall is it, to loſe
ſo much as the World hath done, of the knowledge of our
ſelves. And to begin to know our ſelves, our ſouls, and how
Man differs from a Beaſt, is the firſt part of recovering know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
leading up towards the knowledge of God, which is the
higheſt.</p>
            <p>O then, Sirs, do not only <hi>own</hi> the heavenly dignity of
Souls, but <hi>uſe</hi> your Souls accordingly. Are they good for no
better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to ſerve the Body in Luſt and Appetite, and keep
it in motion and ſome Pleaſure, or at leaſt from ſtinking a
while in the World, Sinners, hear and conſider, If you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61124:6"/>
willfully Condemn your own Souls to Beaſtiality, God will
Condemn them to perpetual Miſery. Yea, you do it your
ſelves, and paſs from bruitiſhneſs to the <hi>Deviliſh Nature and
Woful State.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 7.</hi> The things of the Heavenly Paradiſe are to
Mortal Men unutterable.</p>
            <p>That is,</p>
            <p>1. Such as cannot be uttered. <hi>And,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Such as muſt not be uttered. <hi>It is not</hi> lawful <hi>to</hi> Paul <hi>that
ſaw them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that <hi>nothing</hi> of it may or muſt be uttered: Chriſt
hath brought Life and Immortality to Light: They are
great things and glorious which are by him revealed. Enough
well believed and uſed to overcome the Temptation of this
Fleſh and World, and to raiſe us to a holy Life, and joyful
Hope, and comfortable Sufferings and Death. Chriſt beſt
knoweth the juſt meaſure of Revelation meet for Earth. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
muſt ſerve for narrow and dark Rooms, and are more
worth than all the Gold on Earth: The Sun by day muſt not
come too near us leſt it burn us up, but ſend us its beams at
the diſtance that we can bear them. And all Souls are not
here meet for the ſame meaſures; Much leſs for that ſight
which the glorified enjoy. The <hi>pure in heart</hi> do <hi>ſee God, Mat.
5.</hi> and even <hi>here</hi> more than impure Souls.</p>
            <p>1. There is no humane Language that hath words fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
that part of the heavenly things which God hath ſhut up
from us as his ſecrets. Mans <hi>words</hi> are only fitted to Mans
Uſe and to Mans Concerns, and not to Angels and the ſecrets of
Heauen: We ſpeak not a VVord of God himſelf, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
formally what God is, but only analogically or by ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
and yet not in vain. <hi>Paul ſaw,</hi> and holy Souls ſee,
that which no humane Language can properly expreſs.</p>
            <p>2. And if it could, yet mortals could not <hi>underſtand</hi> it: No
more than a Language which they never heard.</p>
            <p>3. And <hi>Paul</hi> had it revealed in a manner ſuited to his own
uſe, and not in a manner meet for Communication.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61124:7"/>
2. And it was unlawful alſo to utter it. For God ſaw not all
that meet for the dark world of undiſpoſed ſinners, which was
allowed to one eminent Saint.</p>
            <p>2. Nor would he have ſo much more revealed by a Miniſter
than the ſon of God from heaven; had himſelf before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
            <p>3. And the revelation is to be ſuited to the fruition. Full
knowledge is fit only for thoſe that muſt fully enjoy it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Therefore remember with what meaſures of heavenly
knowledge, we muſt be here content, ſo much as Chriſt hath
revealed and is ſuitable to a diſtant life of Faith. I have
known ſome that have run into greater calamities than I will
mention, by an expectation of viſible Communion with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
and others by raſh conceits of Viſions, Dreams and
Prophetical Revelations: But the common Errour of Chriſtians
is, to content themſelves with a feeble Faith (or at leaſt get no
better) and then think it ſhould be made up by ſomwhat like
to ſight or corporal ſenſe, and to be unſatisfied becauſe they
know no more than by beleiving they can reach to: As if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving
were but an uncertain apprehenſion, (with which we
are unſatified) and we are not content to live on that which
God hath revealed, but we would fain know more, before we
are ready for it; whereas we muſt <hi>explicitly</hi> beleive all that is
<hi>explicitly revealed,</hi> and <hi>implicitly</hi> beleive and truſt God for the
reſt.</p>
            <p>VVe are here uſed to live by ſight and ſenſe, and the ſoul is
ſtrange to ſuch apprehenſions as are quite above ſenſe and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. And fain we would have God bring down the unſeen
things to theſe ſenſations and perceptions: And we would fain
have diſtinct and formal knowledge, of that which God hath
but generally revealed. It is ſomewhat excuſable for a ſoul to
deſire this, as it is the ſtate of perfection to which we do aſpire.
But it is not well that we remember not more that ſight and
full fruition, are reſerved together for the life to come; and that
we live no more thankfully and joyfully on ſo much as we may
in the body by beleiving know.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What may we conjecture thoſe things are which <hi>Paul</hi>
had ſeen and muſt not utter?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61124:7"/>
VVhy ſhould we enquire, when they muſt not be uttered?
VVe may mention a poſſibility to rebuke our bold unquiet
thoughts.</p>
            <p>Our ſouls would fain have not only <hi>Analogical,</hi> but <hi>formal
conceptions</hi> of the eſſence, ſubſtance, glory, immenſity, eternity
of God. Hope for much in heaven (but never for an adequate
comprehenſion) But this is the very higheſt of all thoſe things
which are not to be uttered, and therefore not to be here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
            <p>Our ſouls would fain be perfect extenſively and intenſively
in Philoſophy, and know Heaven and Earth, the Spheares,
or Orbs, or Vortices; the magnitudes, number, diſtances,
motions, and the nature of all the Stars, and the Compagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole frame of Being. But this is unutterable, and
not here to be known.</p>
            <p>Our ſouls would fain know more of the Angelical nature;
what ſuch Spirits are, whether abſolutely immaterial as meer
acts and virtues; or ſubſtances which are pure matter, and
what their number and differences are, and how vaſt and many
and diſtant their habitations, and what are their offices on
Earth or elſewhere; and how much they know of us and our
affairs, and in what ſubordination Men, Churches and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
ſtand to them, and they to one another, and how they
are individuated, and how farre one: But all theſe are unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable,
and lockt up from us.</p>
            <p>Our ſouls would fain know whether there was any VVorld
before this Earth, and the Creation of the ſix dayes; and
whether there was any ſpiritual Being, which was an eternal
effect by emanation from an eternal Cauſe, as Light from the
Sun: And whether the Sun, and Stars are intellectual or ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and exceed man in form as well as in matter, and
what the noble nature of fire is. But theſe things are unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and ſo not knowable to us.</p>
            <p>Our ſouls would fain have more ſenſible perceptions of
themſelves, as to their ſubſtance, and their ſeparate <hi>ſtate?</hi>
Whether they are ſubſtances utterly immaterial, how they are
generated? How they ſubſiſt, and act out of the body? And how
they do enjoy? How they are indivuate, and yet how far one?
How far one or not one with Chriſt, and one another? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61124:8"/>
they are diviſible in ſubſtance as continued quantities, as
well as in number as <hi>quantitates diſcretae:</hi> What place and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
do confine them (being not infinite)? How far they have
ſtill ſenſation? And how they ſee, Praiſe and enjoy God?
And how they converſe with one another? And how farre
they know the things on Earth? And how their ſtate before
the Reſurrection differs from what it will be after? And how
far the ſoul will be inſtrumental in the raiſing of the Body: But
all theſe are unutterable things.</p>
            <p>We would fain know more of the decrees of God, and
how all his acts are Eternal, and yet produce their effects in
time? How they are many, and yet but one, producing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and contrary effects. Many ſuch things inquiſitive nature
would fain know which are unutterable.</p>
            <p>But this muſt ſatiſfie us.</p>
            <p>1. That ſinful ſouls, and dark, in a dark body, and a dark
World, are not fit for ſo great a Light, nor capable of it; It
will put out our eyes to gaze ſo neerly on the Sun.</p>
            <p>2. That Chriſt hath revealed ſo much of the greatneſs and
certainty of the heavenly glory, as he ſeeth meet and ſuitable
to Gods holy ends and us.</p>
            <p>3. That the Church hath ſo much clearer a revelation than
the Heathen and Infidel World, as ſhould make us thankful
for our Light.</p>
            <p>4. That if we believe the revelation of the Goſpel ſoundly,
we may live a holy joyful life, and die in the Peace and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
of our hopes.</p>
            <p>5. That it is not by ſight, but by Faith that we muſt here
live, in our VVilderneſs expectant ſtate.</p>
            <p>6. That the more we cleave to God, and live by Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Fleſh and World whilſt we are in it, the clearer and
ſweeter our apprehenſions of heaven will be.</p>
            <p>7. That God muſt be truſted implicitely about that which
is yet unknown to us, as well as explicitly for what we
know. And,</p>
            <p>8. That what we know not now, we ſhall know hereafter
and the day is neer. Let theſe things quiet our ſouls in
health and ſickneſs, though we are yet in darkneſs as to the
unutterable things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61124:8"/>
9. And always adde, that <hi>what we know not, Chriſt knoweth for
us,</hi> to whom it belongeth to prepare the place for us, and us
for it, and to receive us. Had we but a Friend in heaven whom
we could truſt, we could partly, take up with their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Our head is there, and the Eyes that we muſt truſt to
are in our Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how was</hi> Paul <hi>in danger of</hi> being exalted above meaſure,
by the abundance of Revelations?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer, 1.</hi> It might have been <hi>above the meaſure meet for
man in Fleſh,</hi> and ſo unſuitable to his preſent ſtate.</p>
            <p>2. It might have been <hi>unto ſinful Pride,</hi> as the Angels fell
from God, and as <hi>Adam</hi> fell, deſiring to be as a God in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 8.</hi> Even Heavenly Revelations may be made
the matter and occaſion of unmeet and ſinful Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For, 1. It is the nature of ſin to turn all our objects into it
ſelf to feed it. Not as they are without us <hi>in eſſe reali,</hi> but
within us <hi>in eſſe cognito,</hi> the idea's in our minds. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſaith indeed, that <hi>Grace</hi> is that <hi>quo memo male utitur,</hi> but he
muſt mean it. 1. As in <hi>it ſelf.</hi> 2. And <hi>efficiently,</hi> Grace never
doth evil. But <hi>objectively</hi> in the <hi>Idea</hi> or remembrance of it, it
may be abuſed to pride.</p>
            <p>2. And the <hi>greateſt</hi> and moſt <hi>excellent</hi> objects as <hi>ours,</hi> give
Pride the greateſt advantage. Heavenly Revelations are far
more excellent than Gold, and Dominion and VVorldly
Pomp. Children are proud of fine Cloths, and VVordly fools
of Vain-glory; but Saints may be more tempted to be proud
of VViſdom, Holineſs and things above the reach of others.</p>
            <p>3. And Satan knoweth how to fetch. Temptations from the
Higheſt, Beſt, and Holieſt things: And his Malice being as
much againſt them as againſt us, he will be here moſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly
induſtrious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> VVe ſee then that Pride is ſuch a ſin, as the holieſt Saint
is not fully ſecured from, no not when he hath been hearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61124:9"/>
words, and ſeeing the Heavenly Paradiſe it ſelf: No
not if he came down from the third Heavens, (and bring his
unperfect Nature with him) Though he came newly from
Converſe with Angels; Much more when he cometh from the
moſt fervent Prayers, or holieſt Meditations, or moſt heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſucceſsful ſtudies, and from hearing the moſt Seraphick
Preacher, or Preaching as ſuch an one himſelf: He is not out
of danger, when he newly cometh from the moſt Self-denying
acts of Mortification, or the greateſt Victory againſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the greateſt Suffering for Chriſt. VVhat a ſad deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> make of the miſcarriages of
ſome Confeſſours that had offered to die for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Let none therefore abuſe the Grace of Chriſt, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of perſeverance, by thinking that it ſets him above all
danger or fears of falling, unleſs he can ſay that he is better
than <hi>Paul</hi> was, and hath ſeen and heard more than he did in
Paradiſe, or than <hi>Peter</hi> did with Chriſt, and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
on the Holy Mount. O that this Age did not loudly tell us,
how much the real or ſuppoſed knowledge of Divine things,
may be abuſed to ſinful Exaltations! By one ſide, even by
moſt famed Teachers, to contempt of others, and Lording
it over the Heritage of God, and wracking and rending his
Church by their needleſs, yea wicked comvulſive impoſing
deviſes. And by other ſide, by hurtful unwarrantable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and Separations, and ſpeaking evil of the things which
they know not. Have you heard and ſeen more of heaven than
others? Be then more Holy, Loving, Merciful and Peaceable,
and liker thoſe in Heaven than others: Read over and over
<hi>Jam. 3.</hi> ſhew out of a good Converſation your works with
meekneſs of wiſdom: For the wiſdom from above neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendeth
Enmity to <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Peace,</hi> but is firſt pure, then
peaceable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how is <hi>Paul</hi> kept from being exalted above meaſure?
<hi>God gave him a thorn in the fleſh.</hi> Note,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 9.</hi> God ſeeth our danger when we ſee not our
own, and ſaveth us from that which we ſaw not, or had
not elſe prevented. <hi>Thanks to him, and not to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61124:9"/>
But how doth God do it? By a Thorn <hi>in the Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 10.</hi> It is better that the fleſh ſmart, than the
Soul be overmuch exalted.</p>
            <p>No pain or ſuffering of the Fleſh is ſo bad as Pride, nor
hath ſo bad effects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Why then do ſo little fear Exaltation. How gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
do ſome Religious People deſire it? How impatient of
any thing that croſſeth it and humbleth them: How little do
they lament it and confeſs it. Is Pride ſo rare or ſo ſmall a
ſin? even among Preachers and zealous men.</p>
            <p>And why do we ſo much fear every Thorn in the Fleſh:
Every Sickneſs, Pain, or Croſs, as if Pride could be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or killed at too dear a rate? And why do we quarrel with
God for our ſufferings as if our Diſeaſe were not ſo bad as his
Remedy. Who ever heard you in health cry out of your
Pride, as in Sickneſs you do of your Pain. It's a happy
Thorn which lets out this corrupt aud peſtilent blood.</p>
            <p>But what was this Thorn in the Fleſh of <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Greek word ſignifieth a <hi>ſharp ſtake, Pale, nail,
ſtub,</hi> or <hi>Thorn,</hi> or any ſuch ſharp thing that runs into the fleſh,
as it falls out with barefoot Travellers among ſuch Thorns and
Stubs.</p>
            <p>Its ſtrange how many Expoſitors came to take up that injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conceit that it was <hi>fleſhly luſt;</hi> which hath not the leaſt
colour in the Text.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Luſt</hi> wou'd be rather likened to a <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Itch,</hi> than to a
<hi>Thorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It would be called an <hi>alluring</hi> rather than a <hi>buffeting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Paul</hi> had a Life of Labour and Suffering, which would
keep down fleſly Luſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61124:10"/>
4. This <hi>Thorn</hi> is <hi>given him,</hi> as ſent <hi>from God</hi> to ſave him
from ſin; But where is God ſaid to give men <hi>luſt to</hi> ſave them
from Pride.</p>
            <p>5. This Thorn was the buffeting of a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of Satan.
But it is not like, that Satan could ſo excite Luſt in <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth thrice that it might be taken from him: It
is not like that Satan could ſo follow him with Luſtful motions,
and that <hi>Paul</hi> would not have mentioned faſting and other
means of Cure.</p>
            <p>7. God doth not yet ſay that he will yet take it from him,
but under his <hi>weakneſs</hi> manifeſt his <hi>ſuſtaining Grace:</hi> which
ſounds not like an anſwer of a Prayer againſt Luſt.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Paul</hi> is vindicating his Miniſtry againſt Accufers, by
mentioning his Infirmities, that is, his bodily Sufferings and
his Revelations; and is the telling them of his <hi>Luſt</hi> a meet
means for this?</p>
            <p>9. It is called his <hi>weakneſs;</hi> which is his uſual Title for his
Sufferings; but you may ſee <hi>Rom. 7.</hi> that he calleth <hi>Luſt</hi> by
more odious names.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but it was ſome bodily Suffering which was this
<hi>Thorn,</hi> but <hi>whether</hi> by <hi>Perſecutors</hi> or by a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> is the chief
doubt: Many think that it was by <hi>Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Becauſe it was by a Meſſenger of Satan.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe wicked men are in Scripture likened to
Thorns.</p>
            <p>I more encline to think it was a fit of ſome violent pain in
the fleſh, and moſt likely the <hi>ſtone</hi> (or ſome ſuch thing) which
indeed is a Tormenting Thorn in the fleſh. For</p>
            <p>1. VVe read of his frequent Perſecutions, but never that he
ſo named them, or that he ſo much prayed againſt them, but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61124:10"/>
rejoyced, as Chriſt bids ſuch, with exceeding joy: <hi>Mat. 5.
11, 12.</hi> And when he and all the Apoſtles ſo much exhort
Believers to rejoyce in ſuch Sufferings for Chriſt, is it like he
would here tell men how he prayed againſt it?</p>
            <p>And as to the Reaſons for the contrary ſenſe,</p>
            <p>1. VVicked men are called <hi>Thorns</hi> as <hi>hurtful,</hi> and ſo are
other hurting things. Chriſt had a Crown of Thorns on his
head, <hi>Joh. 19. 5.</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> muſt feel one in his Fleſh. <hi>Job 41. 2.
Prov. 26. 9. &amp; 22. 5. Hoſ. 2. 6. &amp; 9. 6.</hi> Any thing hurtful is
likened to Thorns.</p>
            <p>2. And Satan is in Scripture uſually mentioned as Gods
Executioner, even in trying his Children. It was into his
hands that <hi>Job</hi> was put: Hurting work is fitteſt for an evil and
deſtroying Angel. He would ſift the Apoſtles as wheat, by
outward affrighting as well as inward Tempting. However
<hi>ſuffering</hi> it was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 10.</hi> A Thorn in the Fleſh is one of Gods
means to keep the beſt from being overmuch exalted.</p>
            <p>You have heard that the beſt may need it;</p>
            <p>1. And the <hi>Fleſh</hi> hath ſo much hand in our ſin, that it is fit
to bear its part of <hi>ſuffering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And it is the moſt ignoble part, and therefore its ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath leſs of hurt, and leſs to ſignifie Gods diſpleaſure. Soul
ſufferings are the ſore ſufferings. And it is the Soul that is the
chief Agent in our Duties, and therefore where it is ſpared we
are leaſt diſabled for Gods work, and our Communion with
him.</p>
            <p>3. And the nearneſs of Body and Soul is ſuch, that God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61124:11"/>
can uſe the Body to keep the Soul in a humble, and a ſafe
Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Miſtake not the Nature and meaning of the Fleſh's
ſufferings. Grudge not at God, if he exerciſe thus his greateſt
Saints: VVonder not if the beſt men have ſharp perſecutions,
pinching wants, and painful ſickneſs, a long and ſharp tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
ſtone, or other ſuch like Thorn in the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>1. It is but the Fleſh, in our Britiſh part; common to
Beaſts: If Fleſh muſt die and rot, why may it not firſt feel the
Thorn.</p>
            <p>2. VVe grudged not at that health and youth and eaſe and
pleaſure of it, which was the danger and temptation to the
Soul, why then ſhould we grudge at the pain which tendeth
to our Cure.</p>
            <p>3. If you feel not the need of ſuffering, you know not your
ſelves: Did you know your Pride, and overmuch Love of
Fleſh and Eaſe, you would ſay that Pain is a Phyſick which
you need, were it but to help on your willingneſs to die.</p>
            <p>4. Pain here depriveth us of none of our true Felicity; it
hindereth not Gods love to us; it keeps us not from Heaven:
<hi>Lazarus</hi> was in a fairer way than <hi>Dives.</hi> It takes nothing
from us, but what we Covenanted to forſake for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>5. Do we not find that we are better when we ſuffer than
when we are high? Were Religious People better when Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
and Succeſſes did lift them up than they have been in
their ſufferings. Did they live then more humbly, peaceably and
heavenly?</p>
            <p>6. The <hi>Thorn</hi> will ſoon be taken out; Fleſh will not endure
long and therefore this pain will not be long; a few more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Nights and Days, and the Porter which we fear, will break
open our Priſon Doors, and end theſe weary grievous ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61124:11"/>
               <hi>Vſe. 2.</hi> And think not the Thorn is a mark that ſuch are
worſe than others. <hi>Paul</hi> was not worſe; and ſhall we Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſuch as he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 3</hi> But let us all know the uſe of ſuffering, what cure
hath this Medicine wrought? Bleſſed be our wiſe and gracious
Phyſician, we find it a powerful though unpleaſant Remedy.
It keepeth <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the ſins of <hi>Dives;</hi> from living a
worldly ſenſual Life; and loving the proſperity of the fleſh
inſtead of heavenly true felicity: It keepeth us from a beaſtly
living to our appetites and luſt; which would divert and
deprave the ſpiritual appetite: It keepeth us from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
by worldly flatteries, and looking for a portion in this
Life, and laying up a Treaſure on Earth, and from growing
ſenſleſs and impenitent in Sin. It awakeneth the Soul to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
expectations of Eternity, and keepeth us as within the
ſight or hearing of another World, and tells us to the quick
that we muſt make ready to Die, and to be judged, and that
we have much more to do with God than with man, and for
Heaven than Earth; It taketh down Pride, and all exceſſive
reſpects to humane approbation, and keeping us ſtill in the
ſight of the Grave, doth tell us what mans body is, <hi>Mors ſolae
fatetur, Quantula ſunt hominum Corpuſcula,</hi> Juv. What faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Soul that hath been bred up in the School of afflictions
doth not by experience ſay that it was good for him? How
Dull, how Proud, how worldly might we elſe have been,
and trifled away our lives in ſloth and vanity.</p>
            <p>And it is not for nothing that our Thorns (or Nailes) in the
Fleſh are kin to the Nailes that pierced our Saviour on the
Croſs, and that we tread in his ſteps, and as Croſs-bearers are
thus far conformable to his ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Be patient than under the Pain, and careful to improve it,
and thankful for the Profit. And let not the Soul too much
condole the fleſh, as if it had not at hand a better Habitation
and Intereſt. It is but this <hi>Vile body, Phil. 3. 19.</hi> lent us for
a little time, as our Clothes till Night, or as our Horſe in a
Journey; when we have done with them, be content of Gods
ſeparation; and till then let us not take our Corrector for our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61124:12"/>
Enemy. I groan too much, Lord, I complain too much, I
fear too much: but my Soul doth acknowledge the Juſtice and
Love and Wiſdom of thy dealings, and looketh that this
Thorn ſhould bring forth ſweet and happy fruit, and that all
the Nailes of my Croſs being ſanctified by the blood of my
Crucified Redeemer ſhould tend to make me partaker of thy
Holineſs.</p>
            <p>But who put this Thorn into <hi>Pauls</hi> Fleſh? It was one of
Satans Meſſengers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 11.</hi> The ſufferings of the holieſt perſons in
the fleſh, may be the buffettings of a Meſſenger of Satan.</p>
            <p>No wonder! He that hath got ſomewhat of his own in us all,
defiling us with ſin, if he alſo may anſwerably be permitted to
afflict us: He poſſeſſed many in Chriſts time, and it was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
that made them dumb, and deaf, and mad; whom Chriſt
at once delivered from Devils and Diſeaſes. He is called the
<hi>Accuſer</hi> and <hi>deſtroyer,</hi> and he that <hi>had the power of Death.</hi>
Heb. 2. 14. whom Chriſt by Death and Reſurrection Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.
Chriſt calleth his healing the Palſie man, the <hi>forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his ſin;</hi> and <hi>James</hi> ſaith, upon Prayer and Anointing,
the ſick ſhould be healed, and <hi>his ſins forgiven.</hi> And for the
<hi>Cauſe</hi> of ſin, <hi>many</hi> Chriſtians were <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> and many
<hi>fallen aſleep.</hi> I cannot ſay that Good Angels may not hurt
men, and execute Gods Judgments; but Scripture maketh
evil ones his ordinary Executioners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Therefore it is no proof that a man is not a Child of
God, though the Devil have permiſſion to Torment his Fleſh,
<hi>Rev. 2. 10.</hi> The <hi>Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into Priſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pleaſe God, and Satan hath no Power; and Chriſt will take
take out the Thorn ere long, which Satan is permitted to
put in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how doth</hi> Paul <hi>endure the</hi> Thorn? <hi>He</hi> prayeth that is
might depart from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. 12.</hi> The beſt men are ſenſible of the ſuffering
of the Fleſh, and may pray God to take it from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61124:12"/>
Grace doth not make the Fleſh inſenſible; Nor ſeparate
the Soul from it, though it ſet us above it; nor make us
deſpiſe it, though it ſhew us a higher Intereſt and better Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
and teach us to bear the Croſs, and reſign the Body
to the Will of God. A Godly man may groan under his
Pain, and take it as a fruit of ſin, and an act of the Chaſtizing
Juſtice of an offended Father, and pray againſt it as hurtful,
though not as a Remedy. They that ignorantly diſpute that
becauſe Chriſt hath ſuffered all our Puniſhment, therefore
there is no Penal hurt in Pain or Death, confute themſelves
if they complain under it, or pray againſt it, or deſire ſuch
Prayers from the Church or any. Yea, one uſe of the <hi>Thorn</hi>
is to awaken and quicken us to Prayer: Like <hi>Jonas</hi>'s Storm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Go then to God in all affliction, but not with carnal
diſcouraged hearts. He maketh you thus feel the need of
his Mercy, that you may with the Prodigal think of home
and cry for Mercy, and abuſe it no more. Chriſt did not
blame the blind and lame for crying out, <hi>Jeſus, thou Son of David
have mercy on us.</hi> Nor the <hi>Canaanite</hi> VVoman for begging
for the Crums; is any afflicted let him pray, and ſend for
the Elders Prayers. The <hi>Thorn</hi> in the Fleſh will make us
feel; and feeling will teach us to repent and pray, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is the means of hope for the deliverance of Body and
Soul. Grace maketh us not ſtupid, yet there are ſome that
think a man behaveth not himſelf like a Believer if he cry and
pray that the Thorn may depart! What think they of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
in <hi>Pſal. 6.</hi> and 17. and 88. And many more? What
think they of Chriſt that prayed, that if poſſible the Cup
might paſſe by him. He did it to ſhew that even <hi>innocent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is averſe to ſuffering, and death through Grace makes us
ſubmit to the Will of God; (we continue men when we are
Beleivers, we muſt mourn with them that mourn, and yet
not love others better than our ſelves; nor feel their Thorns
more ſenſibly than our own. VVe muſt neither deſpiſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenings,
nor faint.</p>
            <p>But how doth <hi>Paul</hi> pray? Doth he make any great matter of
of his thornes, <hi>He beſought the Lord thrice, that it might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61124:13"/>
               <hi>Obſerv. 13.</hi> Even earneſt and oft Prayer is ſuitable
to ſharp Afflictions.</p>
            <p>There is a kind of Devils, and ſo of Satans <hi>thornes,</hi> which go
not out but by faſting and prayer, no not by Chriſts own Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
The ſenſe and means muſt be ſuited to the malady. God
can do it upon one prayer, or upon none, but we are not ſo
eaſily fited to receive it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> in this alſo is conformed to Chriſt, who in his
Agony pray'd thrice againſt his Cup, though with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 1.</hi> You ſee here that the Apoſtles gift of healing,
was not to be uſed at their own will, nor for their own fleſh
that it might not ſuffer; but for the confirmation of the Faith,
when it pleaſed the Holy Spirit. <hi>Troplainus</hi> and <hi>Epaphroditus</hi>
might be ſick, and <hi>Timothy</hi> need a little VVine with his VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though <hi>Paul</hi> had the gift of healing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 2.</hi> O let our pains drive us all to God, who hath not
ſome? Sickneſſes are all abroad, what houſe, how few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
have not ſome; and yet is there a Prayerleſs houſe, or
perſon? If Faith have not taught you to pray as Chriſtians,
methinks feeling ſhould teach you to pray as men? I ſay not
that prayer muſt ſhut out Food and Phyſick, but Food and
Phyſick will not do, if prayer prevail not with the Lord of
all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 3.</hi> And think not <hi>thrice</hi> or <hi>continued praying</hi> to be
too much, or that importunity is in vain, <hi>Luk. 18. 1. Chriſt
ſpake a Parable to this end, that men ought always to pray and not
wax faint.</hi> VVhether God deliver us or not, prayer is not
loſt, it is a good poſture for God to find us in, we may get
better if we get not what we ask. Obey and Pray, and Truſt
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what anſwer doth the Lord give to</hi> Pauls <hi>thrice pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He ſaid,</hi> My grace is ſufficient for thee, and my ſtrength is
manifeſted in weakneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61124:13"/>
1. It was not a promiſe that the <hi>thorn ſhould depart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It ſeems to be rather a denial at the preſent, and that <hi>Paul</hi>
muſt not be yet cured of his thorn; for it is called a <hi>weakneſs</hi>
that muſt continue for the manifeſting of Gods ſtrength: and
what was the ſufficiency of grace and ſtrength for, but to endure
and improve the thorn?</p>
            <p>3. But this promiſed grace and ſtrength is better than that
which was deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ. 14.</hi> Even oft and earneſt prayer of the greateſt Saint, for
deliverance from bodily pains, may not be granted in the kind, or
thing deſired.</p>
            <p>For, 1. we are not Lords, but beggars, and muſt leave the iſſue
to the donor. And God hath higher ends to accompliſh, than
our eaſe or deliverance. It's meet that he ſhould firſt fit all his
actions to his own will and glory, and next to the good of many,
and to his publick works in the World; and then to look at our
intereſt next.</p>
            <p>2. And we are utterly unmeet judges of matter, manner, time
or meaſure what God ſhould give us for the body, and how much,
and how, and when. When ſhould we be ſick, or pained, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
or dye, if all our prayers muſt be abſolutely granted. We
know not how much better God is preparing us for by pain, and
bringing us to by diſmal death. He will not keep us from grace
and glory becauſe our fleſh is loth to ſuffer, and to die.</p>
            <p>3. And in this <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was conformed to Chriſt: He was heard
in the thing that he feared, when in his agony he prayed with
ſtrong cryes: but it was not by the removing of the bitter cup,
but by divine ſtrength and acceptance: And ſo it is with <hi>Paul;
ſufficient grace</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> to <hi>bear,</hi> is the thing promiſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 1.</hi> We ſee then that they are miſtaken that think Chriſts
promiſe of giving believers whatever they ask, will prove him a
breaker of his promiſe, if the ſtrongeſt believer receive not all that
he asketh for the body. Was not <hi>Paul</hi> a ſtrong believer? All that
God hath promiſed, and we are fit to receive, God will be ſure to
give.</p>
            <p>2. Let not unbelief get advantage by Gods not granting ſuch
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61124:14"/>
prayers for the body. Say not, Why then is it my duty to pray?
1. You know not before-hand but God may give it. Poſſibility
bids you beg. 2. Why did Chriſt pray againſt his Cup? 3. You
loſe not prayer: you draw nearer God: you exerciſe repentance
and deſire: you ſignifie your dependance: you are prepared for
much greater gifts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ. 15.</hi> When God will not take the thorn out of our fleſh, and
deliver us when we pray, from bodily ſufferings, he will be ſure to do
better for prepared perſons, even to give them his ſufficient grace, and
manifeſt his ſtrength in their pain and weakneſs.</p>
            <p>It is not for want of <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> that he lets us tumble on our
beds in pain, or lie under ſlanderers or perſecutors rage. He that
with a word could make the World, with a word can ſave us from
all this. But if we ſuffer not, how ſhall ſuffering-graces be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
faith, patience, ſelf-denial, and hope? Is not grace better
than eaſe or life? How ſhall we get the benefit of ſuffering, if we
feel it not? How ſhall grace and divine ſtrength be manifeſted to
our ſelves and others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is it that Grace is ſufficient for?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. 1.</hi> Not to ſet us up above the frailties of humanity and
mortality; nor to raiſe us to the joy that ſouls in heaven have.
2. Not to every one alike, but in our ſeveral meaſures: ſome fear
pain and death more than others: ſome have greater patience and
joy, and long to depart and be with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But to all the faithful it ſhall ſuffice, 1. To keep them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting
from Chriſt, and repenting of their choice and hope. 2. To
ſave them from charging God fooliſhly, as if he did them wrong.
3. It ſhall keep them from damning deſpair. When Satan ſift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them, Chriſts interceſſion ſhall keep their faith from failing:
Grace ſhall humble them, and ſave them from ſin, and the fleſh
and world: they ſhall caſt ſoul and body upon Chriſt, and truſt
him in hope in their ſeveral degrees. And thoſe that have been
more believing, heavenly and fruitful than the reſt, are likeſt to
have the greateſt peace and comfort, eſpecially in their greateſt
need.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> And how is Gods ſtrength manifeſted in our weakneſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. 1.</hi> It is manifeſted to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> by keeping us from ſin,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61124:14"/>
and ſinking into deſpair, and enabling us to bear, and truſt, and
wait, and uſually in the peace or joy of hope: We know we are
inſufficient for this our ſelves: When <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> as natural, fail
us, God is the <hi>ſtrength of our hearts, and our portion for ever,</hi> Pſal.
73. 26. We do not think oft before that ever we can bear and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
as grace enableth us.</p>
            <p>2. And it's manifeſt oft to others, who ſhall ſee that power of
grace in the ſufferings of believers, which they did not ſee in their
proſperity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe. 1.</hi> Let not then our own weakneſs and inſufficiency too,
much diſtreſs us with fears of ſuffering and death; yea, when we
feel the thorn, let us not forget our help and ſtrength. By <hi>Grace</hi>
here is meant, the living and merciful <hi>help</hi> of God, eſpecially giving
us the inward ſtrength by which we may not only bear, but improve
the ſufferings of the fleſh. This body was not made to be here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
or immortal; we were born in ſin, and therefore born
to pain and death. We have lived in ſin, and no wonder if we live
in ſorrow: but the ſufferings of our Redeemer have ſanctified our
ſufferings. The Croſs is not now ſuch a curſed thing, as guilt had
made it. He took our ſuffering fleſh and blood, that he might
deſtroy by death, the devil that had the power of death, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us who by the fear of death, were all our life-time ſubject to
bondage, <hi>Heb. 2. 14.</hi> Our pain prepareth us for endleſs pleaſures,
and our ſorrows for our Maſters joy. When we have ſuffered with
him, we ſhall reign with him: He liveth, and we ſhall live by him:
He is riſen, and we ſhall riſe by him: He is in Glory, and we muſt
be with him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time his Grace is ſufficient for us, not only in health
and eaſe, but in all our pain and ſickneſs: He is not ſo unskilful or
unkind, as to give ſuch phyſick to his own, which ſhall do them
more harm than good. Though it be grievous at the preſent, it
brings forth the quieting-fruit of righteouſneſs: but we muſt firſt
be exerciſed therein. Let us not then be his impatient patients:
Grace can ſupport us and overcome. Men are not ſufficient: Our
wit, our power, our worthineſs are not ſufficient: but God's grace
is ſufficient: If eaſe and life had been better than Grace and Glory,
we might have had them: But God giveth us better than fleſh
would chuſe. Though the body be weak, the head weak, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61124:15"/>
weak, the ſtomack weak, and all weak, yet God is ſtrong,
and his ſtrength will ſupport us, and bring us ſafe to our journeys
end. <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay among dogs in weakneſs at the rich mans doors,
but the Angels convey'd him in ſtrength to <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom. We
muſt lie, and languiſh, and groan in weakneſs, but Omnipotence is
engaged for us: We muſt die in weakneſs, but we ſhall be raiſed in
power, by him who will change theſe vile bodies, and make them
like to his glorious body, by the power by which he can ſubdue all
things to himſelf, <hi>Phil. 3. 20, 21.</hi> Let us therefore <hi>lift up the hands
that hang down, and the feeble knees,</hi> Heb. 12. 12. Looking to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
the Author and finiſher of our ſaith, who for the joy that was
ſet before him, endured the Croſs.</p>
            <p>And let us beg more for divine grace and ſtrength, than for the
departing of the thorn. Grace is better than eaſe and health. If
the ſoul be our nobler part than the body, the health of it is more
deſirable. Bodily eaſe is common to bruits and wicked men:
ſtrength of Grace is proper to Saints: Eaſe and health in this life
are ſhort; but Holineſs will be everlaſting. Health fits us for fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleaſure, but Holineſs for Communion with God. O pray not
carnally, for the fleſh more than for the ſpirit, for earth more
than for heaven. Pray, that while the outward man is periſhing,
the inward man may be renewed day by day; and that our light
afflictions, which are but for a moment, may work for us an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the temporal
things which are ſeen, but at the eternal things, which are unſeen to
us, <hi>2 Cor. 4. 16, 17, 18.</hi> Why ſhould we grudg at any ſufferings,
which are for the glory of Gods grace and ſtrength: As Chriſt
ſaid of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> This ſickneſs is not unto <hi>death</hi> (that is, the end of
it is not to end his life, though he dye) but that the glory of God
may be revealed. So pain and death are not Gods ends, but the
manifeſting of his grace and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>But, alas, it is not only the fleſh that is weak, but Grace it ſelf,
(as it is in us, though not as it is in God and of God); nor is it
fleſh only that hath the <hi>thorn,</hi> but the <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>conſcience</hi> alſo hath
its part. The ſpirit of a man (if ſound and well) will ſuſtain (his
bodily) infirmities: <hi>But a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> If faith
were not <hi>weak,</hi> if <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> were not weak, the
weakneſs of the body might well be born. If ſin and guilt were
no wound or thorn in the ſoul and conſcience, we could be more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61124:15"/>
indifferent as to the fleſh, and almoſt as quietly bear our own pain
and death, as our neighbours. Though it's hard to ſay is <hi>Tertullian
Nihil crus ſentit in nervo, cum animus eſt in coelo;</hi> yet our content
and joy would overcome the evil of our ſuffering. But, alas, when
ſoul and body muſt be both at once lamented, this, this, is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
born! Lord! ſeeing it is thy <hi>ſufficient Grace,</hi> and not my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
eaſe which I muſt truſt to, and my weakneſs muſt manifeſt thy
ſtrength: O let not Grace alſo be in me inſufficient and weak! O
let not Faith be weak, nor Hope, nor Love, nor Heavenly deſires
and foretaſts be weak! Nor Patience and Obedience weak! Head
is weak, and heart is weak; but if Faith alſo be weak, what ſhall
ſupport us: At leaſt let it be <hi>unfeigned</hi> and <hi>effectual,</hi> and attain its
end, and never fail. Fleſh is failing, and health (as to its proper
ſtrength) is failing. But be thou my God, the ſtrength
of my heart, and my portion for ever. And what ever thorn the
fleſh muſt feel, yet let me finiſh my courſe with joy. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have run over many things in a Text ſo ſuitable, that I could
not well ſpare any of them. Thoſe that well knew our Deceaſed
friend, will ſay that except <hi>Pauls</hi> extraordinary rapture, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
priviledges, in <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe I have been deſcribing his.</p>
            <p>I come not to gratifie the intereſt of any of his Relations, to
ſpeak to you according to cuſtom of a ſtranger whom I knew not;
but for the honour of Gods grace, and our own edification, to
tell you what I knew by my moſt faithful and familiar friend. It is
almoſt forty years ſince I heard him preach in the City of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter;</hi>
there was his enterance, and there he lived (under a <hi>Papiſt</hi>
Biſhop of the Proteſtant Church, <hi>Godfry Goodman,</hi> as his laſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
in Print profeſſed) there he abode during the Civil Wars,
and wrote the Hiſtory of what happened there. He was after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to the City of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bramſhot</hi> in
<hi>Hamſhire,</hi> and ſilenced with the reſt, he was caſt out, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
till 1662. He lived peaceably in <hi>London</hi> without gathering
any Aſſembly for publick Preaching. Dwelling in <hi>Totteridg</hi> with
Alderman <hi>Web,</hi> his great love drew him there, to remove to me,
with whom a while he took up his habitation. In all the time that
he was with me, I remember not that ever we differed once in any
point of Doctrine, Worſhip, or Government Eccleſiaſtical or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
or that ever we had one diſpleaſing word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61124:16"/>
The Kings Licenſes encouraged his old flock at <hi>Chiceſtor</hi> to invite
him thither, though they had the help of another <hi>Nonconformist</hi>
before, with whom he joined with love and concord. God many
years afflicted him with the diſeaſe that was his death; while the
pain was tolerable to nature, he endured it, and ceaſed not Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till a fortnight before he was carried up to <hi>London</hi> to have
been cut. But before that could be done, in about a fortnight more
he died. This is the ſhort Hiſtory of his courſe.</p>
            <p>But I will next give you his true Character, and then tell you
how like his caſe was to <hi>Pauls</hi> here in my Text, and then tell you
to what uſe I do all this.</p>
            <p>I. He was a man ſo blameleſs in all his Converſation, that I may
ſay as I did here lately of another (Alderman <hi>Aſhurſt)</hi> that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard one perſon accuſe or blame him, except for Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and that difference from others in theſe divided times, which
his Book expreſſes. Of which more anon.</p>
            <p>II. Were it not that I have ſaid we never differed, and ſo made
my ſelf an incompetent Judg, I ſhould have ſaid that I thought him
a man of great clearneſs and ſoundneſs in Religion, much by the
advantage of the calmneſs and conſiderateneſs of his mind.</p>
            <p>III. He was of ſo great moderation and love of peace, that he
hated all that was againſt it, and would have done any thing for
concord in the Church, except ſinning againſt God, and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Salvation. In the matter of the five Articles, or <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi>
he went the reconciling way, and I have ſeen a <hi>Compendium</hi> of his
thoughts in a Manuſcript, which is but the ſame with what I have
delivered in my <hi>Cath. Theol.</hi> but better fitted to Readers that muſt
have much in a few words.</p>
            <p>He conſtantly at <hi>Totteridg</hi> joined in all the Worſhip with the
Publick Aſſembly, and had no ſinful ſeparating Principles. He was
for Catholick Union, and Communion of Saints, and for going
no further from any Churches or Chriſtians than they force us, or
then they go from Chriſt. He then Preached only to ſuch Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as came into the houſe between the times of the Publick
Worſhip. He was for loving and doing good to all, and living
peaceably with all as far as was in his power. Something in <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61124:16"/>
Presbytery,</hi> and <hi>Independency,</hi> he liked, and ſome things he
diſlikt in all; but with all ſorts lived in love and peace, that did
ſeek the furtherance of mens Salvation. Many parts of Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he could have yielded to, but not to all, nothing leſs than all
would ſatisfie.</p>
            <p>IV. In all he was true to his Conſcience, and warpt not for a
parties intereſt or faction. If all the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> had
refuſed, he would have conformed alone, if the terms had been
reduced to what he thought lawful. And he ſtudied that with
great impartiality.</p>
            <p>V. He managed his Miniſtry with faithfulneſs and prudence:
He took it for heinous Sacriledg to alienate himſelf from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
office to which he was devoted, though men forbad it him.
But he thought not the ſame circumſtances of Miniſtration ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to all times and places: He was not for open preaching to
great numbers, when it was like by accident to do more hurt
than good: Nor yet for forbearing it, when it was like to do more
good than hurt. He ſpared not his fleſh, but held on from year
to year under his great pain of the Stone in the bladder, till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a month before he dyed. Much leſs would the prohibition of
any reſtrain him, to whom God gave no ſuch forbidding-power.</p>
            <p>VI. He ſerved God with ſelf-denial, not with any ſelfiſh or
worldly deſigns: He never lookt after preferment or riches, or
any great matters in the world: He had daily bread, and was
therewith content.</p>
            <p>VII. He ſuffered his part in our common lot 1662. <hi>Aug. 22.</hi>
(ejected and ſilenced with about 2000 more) with as little mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murring
as any man that I knew: I never heard him diſhonour
the King, nor ſpeak much againſt thoſe by whom he ſuffered,
or rip up their faults, unleſs a rare and neceſſary ſelf-defence be
called an accuſing them. I never heard him ſo much as complain
how much Church maintenance he was deprived of, nor of the
difficulties of his low dejected caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61124:17"/>
VIII. He was great hater of that baſe pride and envy, which
poſſeſſeth too many of the ſacred office, who grudg if others be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before them; and if the people go from them to others for
their greater edification, and think themſelves wronged if they be
not followed and applauded, either above, or equal with more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
men: He was very careful to preſerve the reputation of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and rejoyced in the ſucceſs of their labours, as well as of
his own, and a moſt careful avoider of all diviſions, contentions,
or offences. And he was very free in acknowledging by whom
he profited, and preferring others before himſelf.</p>
            <p>IX. He was very much in the ſtudy of his own heart, by ſtrict
examination, as his Cabinet-papers, which may come to light,
make known, as I had alſo occaſion otherwiſe to know.</p>
            <p>X. By this examination he was confidently aſſured of his own
ſincerity in the true love of God, and of holineſs for it ſelf, and
ſuch-like evidences which he wrote down, renewing his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as occaſion required: And though he had known what it was
to be tempted to doubt of the life to come, he was fully ſetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all ſuch doubts and temptations.</p>
            <p>XI. But though he had a ſetled aſſurance both of the truth
of the Goſpel, and the life to come, and of his own ſatisfaction
and ſincerity: yet ſo lively were his apprehenſions of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his approaching change, and the weight of an everlaſting
ſtate, and what it is to enter upon another world, that he was
not without ſuch fears, as in our frail condition here, poor mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
that are near death are lyable to. And indeed <hi>fear</hi> ſignifieth
a belief of the word of God, and the life to come, much more than
dull inſenſibility: But he ſignified his belief both by fear and
hope, and ſtrong aſſurance.</p>
            <p>XII. He had the comfort of ſenſible growth in grace. He eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceived a notable increaſe of his faith, and holineſs, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs,
and humility, and contempt of worldly vanity, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of late years, and under his affliction, as the fruit of Gods
correcting-rod.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61124:17"/>
I have truly given you the deſcription of the man, according
to my familiar knowledge. I ſhall yet review the ſimilitude of
his caſe with this of <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribed in my Text.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Paul</hi> was accuſed by <hi>envious, contentious Teachers:</hi> And ſo
was he; Though I never heard any one perſon elſe ſpeak evil of
him; as is ſaid, They that upbraided not <hi>Paul</hi> with his former
perſecution, nor had any crime to charge him with, yet accuſed
his Miniſtry: As they ſaid of <hi>Daniel, We ſhall find no fault againſt
him, except it be concerning the law of his God.</hi> His <hi>Preaching</hi> and
<hi>Writings,</hi> though all for peace, were the matter of his accuſations:
The Biſhop blamed him for Preaching, even when the King had
licenſed him: And a nameleſs Writer publiſhed a bloody Invective
againſt his <hi>Pacificatory</hi>-book, called <hi>The Intereſt of England,</hi> as if
it had been written to raiſe a War. The enemies of Peace were his
enemies.</p>
            <p>II. He took boaſting to be inexpedient, as <hi>Paul</hi> did: And when
he was ſilenced as unworthy to be ſuffered in the Miniſtry, he once
offered a modeſt defence to the Biſhop, and wrote a ſhort and
peaceable account of his judgment about the ſin of Schiſm, in his
own Vindication.</p>
            <p>III. He had (though not the Extaſie of <hi>Paul,</hi> yet) great
knowledge of things Divine and Heavenly to have been the matter
of his glory.</p>
            <p>IV. The heavenly Paradiſe was the place of his hopes, where
he daily ſtudied to lay up his treaſure, which had his chiefeſt
thoughts and care.</p>
            <p>V. He found by experience that an immortal ſoul is not ſo
tyed to this body of fleſh, but that it can get above it, and all its
intereſt and pleaſure, and live on the hopes of unſeen glory.</p>
            <p>VI. As he knew the incapacity of mortals, to have formal
and adequate conceptions of the ſtate of the heavenly Paradiſe and
ſeparated ſouls; ſo he ſubmitted to Gods-concealing Will, and
lived on the meaſure of Goſpel-revelation.</p>
            <p>VII. He knew the danger of being <hi>exalted above meaſure,</hi> by
occaſion of holy Knowledge; and how apt man is to be ſo puffed
up.</p>
            <p>VIII. God himſelf ſaved him from that danger, by his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
wholeſome ſharper remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61124:18"/>
IX. A <hi>Thorn</hi> in the fleſh was Gods remedy to keep him in a
ſerious humble frame: Three great Stones were found in his blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and one ſmall one in a corrupted Kidney: And how pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a thorn theſe were for many years, it is eaſie to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
            <p>X. Satan was permitted to try him as <hi>Job,</hi> not only by the
pain of his fleſh, but alſo by reproaches, as aforeſaid, and by
caſting him out of his Miniſtry, as unworthy to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Chriſt, unleſs he would ſay, ſwear, and do all that was by
men impoſed, and the reſt of thoſe afflictions which are contained
in ſuch an ejected, impoveriſhed, calumniated ſtate, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
in the late and former experience of may ſuch.</p>
            <p>XI. Though I never heard him pray againſt poverty or reproach,
yet for the liberty of his Miniſtry he did, that he might preach
that Goſpel of Salvation. And pain forced him to have recourſe
to God for deliverance from the <hi>thorn</hi> in his fleſh. And if Chriſt
and <hi>Paul</hi> prayed thrice with <hi>earneſtneſs,</hi> no wonder if continued
pain made him continue his ſuit to God.</p>
            <p>XII. As Chriſt was heard in the thing which he feared, and
yet muſt drink that cup: and <hi>Paul</hi> inſtead of the <hi>departing</hi> of the
one, was promiſed <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> and the <hi>manifeſting of Gods
ſtrength</hi> in his pain and weakneſs; ſo it pleaſed not God to take
away the Thorn from our dear Brothers fleſh, but he did better
for him, and gave him his ſupporting help, and an increaſe of grace,
and ſhewed his own ſtrength in all his weakneſs; and alſo haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his final deliverance, beyond expectation.</p>
            <p>And now he is paſt all, at reſt with Chriſt, and all the bleſſed:
We ſee not them, but they ſee God, and God feeth us, and is
preparing us for the ſame felicity: And if it be by the ſame means,
and we muſt bear the Croſs, and feel the Thorn, it will be whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and ſhort, and good is the will and work of God. Lord,
let me not account eaſe, honour or life dear to me, that I may
finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry received of the Lord,
and come in ſeaſon and peace to thee.</p>
            <p>And is not this Providence of God, and this example of our
deceaſed friend of uſe to us? Yes, no doubt of manifold uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61124:18"/>
I. It is of great uſe to all the Land, to good and bad, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Gods threatning in the removal of his ſervants: O how
many excellent Chriſtians and faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, have
been taken hence within a few months: The ſame week we hear
of four or five more beſides our brother, and ſome of them the
moſt excellent uſeful men. And is it not time, 1. To repent of
our neglect of ſuch helps as God is now removing? 2 And to be
preſently awakened to uſe them better before the reſt be taken
away? Alas, poor Souls, what a caſe are you in, if you dye, or
the word be taken from you, before you are regenerated and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for a better life! It is not ſo much their loſs and hurt as
yours, which Satan endeavoureth in ſilencing ſo many hundred
ſuch: And it is your heavy puniſhment more than theirs, which
God inflicteth by their death. O ſpeedily repent, before that
death have ſtopt the mouths which call'd you to repentance.
And it ſhould awaken the beſt to prepare for death, and for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſuffering: It ſeems there is ſome great evil to come when God
thus takes away the beſt. Yea, if it ſhould be a forerunner of a
better ſtate, yet all ſave two of the old ſtock that diſhonoured
God in the Wilderneſs muſt fall, and it was by bloody Wars (a
dreadful means) that <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the new generation were to
poſſeſs the Land of promiſe.</p>
            <p>II. It is of uſe to us unworthy Miniſters of Chriſt who yet
ſurvive. 1. It calleth loudly to us to work while it is day, for
our night is near when we cannot work: Death will ſhortly
ſilence us all more effectually, than men have done. Do Gods
work prudently, do it patiently, peaceably, and in as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and true obedience as you can: But be ſure you do it, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forbid it, or be againſt it, as long as God or your ſelves have
not rendered you uncapable. Whatever ſilencers ſay againſt it,
Neceſſity is upon you: God calls for it: Souls call for it: The
charge is dreadful, <hi>2 Tim. 4. 1, 2.</hi> your Vows call for it: Satans
malice, and the number of Soul-betrayers and murderers muſt
provoke you: our time is ſhort: Souls are precious: Chriſt the
chief ſhepherd dearly purchaſed them, and will judge you accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your works: It will not juſtifie your neglect to ſay, Men
forbad me: Sufferings were prepared for me: Biſhops and famous
Divines wrote learned Books to prove that preaching was to me a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61124:19"/>
ſin, and that I was bound to forbear it when forbidden.
2. And it telleth us that we as well as others muſt prepare for
the ſharpeſt tryals from God. No thorn in the fleſh ſo ſharp and
painful, which we may not feel. No death ſo violent or ſudden but
we may undergo. Love and hatred are not known by outward
events, proſperity or adverſity. A great difference <hi>Solomon</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
between the good and the bad, the righteous and
wicked, him that ſacrificeth (or worſhippeth God) and him that
doth not; him that ſweareth (perjuriouſly or prophanely), and
him that ſeareth (ſuch) an Oath: ſome are loved of God, and
ſome are hated: And this difference is manifeſt in ſuch diſpoſals,
even of proſperity and adverſity, as tend to their greater holineſs
and happineſs, which ſhall manifeſt the difference fully and for
ever. But outward events manifeſt it not in themſelves: All
ſuch things come alike to all: yea, the Croſs is more laid on the
godly, than the wicked. O therefore away with the two Diſciples
deſires of Church-preferment and worldly dignity, and prepare to
drink of Chriſts Cup, and be baptized with his baptiſm, <hi>Eccleſ.
9. 1, 2, 3. Matth. 20. 22, 23.</hi> Learn daily how to bear ſlanders
and perſecutions from men, even from Chriſtian Teachers; and
how to lie in fleſhly pains night and day, and how to die: and
all this in faith, and peace, and joy, at leaſt in the quiet hope of
everlaſting joy.</p>
            <p>III. And without any diſgracing or provoking deſign, but
meerly in conſcience and compaſſion to the Souls of the people,
and of our Reverend Brethren themſelves; I do humbly intreat
the Right Reverend and Reverend Impoſing Clergy, to lay by a
while, if poſſible, all unrighteous prejudice and partiality, and
worldly intereſts and reſpects, and conſider that they alſo muſt
die, and as they will ſtand to it at laſt, to reſolve theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions:</p>
            <p>I. Whether thoſe Terms of Church-Concord and Peace be
wiſely and juſtly made, which are too narrow to receive ſuch
men as this (for faith, knowledge, peaceableneſs, blameleſneſs,
holineſ, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> into the Miniſtry, Communion of their Church,
or to endure themout of a Jayl? Whether wiſe and good men
could find no better? And whether Chriſt ever directed the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61124:19"/>
Church to exclude ſuch, or did not plainly require the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
And whether the Apoſtles ever excluded ſuch, or made
ſuch Rules?</p>
            <p>II. Whether they think in their hearts that it were better
all the good were undone, which hath been done by Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
theſe 18 years to the Miniſterial furthering of knowledge,
repentance, holineſs and ſalvation, than that ſuch ſhould have
preached the Goſpel when forbidden?</p>
            <p>III. Whether it will be peace to your conſciences at the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſt, that any of you have furthered the ſilencing of
ſuch, and their other ſufferings?</p>
            <p>IV. Whether they that have written and preached againſt
their Preaching, or for their ſilencing, and the execution of the
Laws againſt them, or perſwaded them to give over their work
themſelves, and reproached and accuſed them for doing it, be
not engaged in this frightful Cauſe?</p>
            <p>V. Is it not groſs partiality, if you will cheriſh men of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
vitiouſneſs, or far leſs worth, while ſuch as theſe are thought
intollerable, meerly becauſe the former are more obedient to you,
than fear of ſinning will ſuffer theſe to be.</p>
            <p>VI. Was that Church therein guided by the Spirit of Chriſt,
which made the Canon which <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicateth ſuch?</p>
            <p>VII. If you had known as many of the (about) 2000 ſilenced,
and as well as I have done, how much of the grace of God ſhined
in them, Is it poſſible that any man that hath the true fear and
love of God, and ſenſe of everlaſting things, could ever by any
pretences of Church Government or Order, or upon any byas of
intereſt, have conſented to their ſilencing and ſufferings?</p>
            <p>Some will think that in partiality I over-magnifie men, becauſe
they were of my own mind and party: I have (beſides ſome pious
Women) written the Characters, and publiſhed the praiſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
of Mr. <hi>Rich. Vines,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Janeway,</hi> Mr. <hi>Joſeph Allen,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Henry Stubbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wadſworth,</hi> and now Mr. <hi>John Corbet,</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61124:20"/>
lately one <hi>Layman,</hi> Alderman <hi>Aſhurſt;</hi> and he that hath now
received them, whom ſuch as you caſt out or villified, knoweth that
I have in knowledge of them, and love to Chriſt, whoſe grace
ſhined in them, ſpoken ſimply the truth from my heart; and it is
in a time and place where it is fully known, and feareth no confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And the Hiſtory ſhall live to the ſhame of Church-dividing
tearing principles, and all thorny hurtful diſpoſitions, and
to the encouragement of the faithful, and the imitation of thoſe
that in time to come, ſhall by ſaith, patience, and well-doing,
ſeek for immortality and eternal life, by ſerving our Redeemer,
and pleaſing God.</p>
