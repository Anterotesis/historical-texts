            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF I may be intruſted to make an Abſtract of my own Eſſay, it is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To Aſſert and Prove,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That Free-hold Lands in <hi>England</hi> may be incumbered in divers manners, and in divers places, which renders the Titles thereunto incertain, and therefore is a Deficiency in the Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Conveyances by Leaſe and Releaſe, lately invented upon the Statute of Uſes, being Clandeſtine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances, and now become the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95779:3"/>
Conveyances of the Kingdom, doth occaſion a Neceſſity of a Regiſtry to prevent them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Page</hi> 11. I have Challenged the Inns of Court to ſhew, <hi>That either the Common Law, or Parliaments of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>ever directed any Incumbrances to affect Lands but by ſolemn Livery and Seiſin, or Matter of Record, and that therefore theſe Clandeſtine Conveyances are crept in, contrary to the true Intent and Meaning of Parliaments, and all the avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Laws and Cuſtoms of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this (I know) it was, that gave you Confidence to ſingle your ſelf out, as the <hi>Goliah</hi> of the Law, to anſwer me: In which (Bully like) you Lugg out with a Threat in your Mouth. Promiſing,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſhew that my Arguments are advanced on Suppoſitions and Opinions in the Law, which are in themſelves either falſe or miſtaken, or at leaſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry broken and imperfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>However they may be juſt in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95779:3"/>
themſelves, they conclude nothing to the purpoſe,</hi> viz. <hi>The Neceſſity of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to Charge me with Falſhood in the Matter of my Challenge, you ſay,</p>
            <p>Page 22. <hi>That Lands were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be incumbered than by</hi> Livery <hi>and</hi> Seiſin, <hi>or matter on Record</hi>: And for this you inſtance,</p>

               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>A Surrender.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For Reply to which, in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my <hi>Eſſay,</hi> I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That to a Leaſe for Years at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, the Transferr of the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion by Entry was Neceſſary to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Conveyance, ſo as to make the Leſſee capable of taking a Releaſe, which is directly contrary to a Bargain
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95779:4"/>
and Sale for Years by the Statute, of which I have Complained, as being perfectly executed to this intent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Entry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That to a Grant of a Rent there muſt be an Attornment, which is the Seiſin of the Rent, and all the Poſſeſſion that a Rent is capable of, and by this the Tenant hath the ſame Notice to know to whom to pay his Rent, as he hath by a Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Land. Tho' I Confeſs, that in both theſe Caſes of a Leaſe for Years, and Grant of a Rent, the Deeds themſelves, without any Entry, are the initiating of a Title, ſo as to give the Grantees a Right to have their Title perfected; for the Leſſee by Virtue of his Leaſe may enter, and the Grantee of the Rent may Compel an Attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo may a Man by Articles and a Suit in Chancery compel the making of a Deed: But, 'till theſe things be done, the Title is not perfect. But indeed in your Diſcourſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Bargain and Sale, before the Statute, you ſeem to value a Title to a Suit in Chancery, as much as a Title to an Eſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95779:4"/>3. As to a Releaſe to a Diſſeizor. There is an actual Transfer of the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion by Entry, before the Releaſe can operate, and the Entry is as an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Part of the Conveyance as the Releaſe; for they both make but one Conveyance.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I Obſerve, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I have in my <hi>Eſſay</hi> uſed theſe Words, <hi>Livery and Seiſin,</hi> and ſome other Words, as <hi>Records, Titles, Notices,</hi> &amp;c. in their large ſenſe, according to common intent, you wou'd take Advantage of me, by Commenting upon them, according to their ſtrict Signification in Terms of Law. I'le endeavour to explain this Controverſie about <hi>Livery and Seiſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a Deed is made firſt, and the Poſſeſſion is taken afterwards, this the Lawyers call a <hi>Feofment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the Poſſeſſion is taken firſt, and the Deed made afterwards, this they call a <hi>Releaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe I won't contradict the Lawyers in their Terms of Art, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nor do ſay, that both theſe are Feofments, or that both of them are Releaſes. But I did and do ſay,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95779:5"/>
that according to common Senſe, they are both the ſame ſort of Conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and are both executed by Livery and Seiſin, becauſe there is an actual and viſible Transfer of the Poſſeſſion, in the one as well as the other; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which neither of them can be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. But as in the firſt, the Deed being already made, there needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more but Poſſeſſion; ſo in the latter, the Poſſeſſion being already had, there needs nothing but the Deed: For the Law hates to do any thing twice by Circuity of Action. When a Man is in Cuſtody of the Sheriff by any one Writ executed upon him, he is in his Cuſtody upon all other Writs then delivered, or otherwiſe the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff muſt let him go as faſt as he takes him, in order to take him again. And as <hi>Littleton,</hi> Sect. 460. ſaith, <hi>It is in vain to make an Eſtate by Livery and Seiſin to another, where he hath the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ſame Land by the Leaſe of the ſame Man before.</hi> And therefore did not you and your Admirers value your ſelves, more upon Knowledge of Terms of Art, than the Reaſon of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95779:5"/>
Buſineſs, you would not vaunt ſo much of your Victory over me in this Point.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to a Surrender, I ſay, that a Surrender is not an Incumbrance on Land, but a Diſcharge of an Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; and what I have ſaid in my Eſſay, is of the Manner of creating In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, and not of diſcharging them. For a Judgment, which is an Incumbrance upon Record, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by a Releaſe which is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and ſo ſeveral other Rights may be releaſed without Livery o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Record; and therefore, you might as well have inſtanced in any of them as in a Surrender.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As to a Deviſe by Will, I ſay, That tho' the Makers of the Law, 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. by which Lands are deviſeable, did not thereby particularly direct ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes to be regiſtred, yet they knew that long before the making that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, Wills were uſually regiſtred, whereby all the Deviſes therein might appear. And as to what you ſay, <hi>That Lands being by the Cuſtom of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Boroughs, deviſeable before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95779:6"/>
this Statute, is a ſufficient Anſwer to what I have ſaid of the Cuſtom of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the contrary,</hi> is (by your leave) taking a Point of Law without asking: For <hi>the Cuſtom of the Kingdom</hi> is the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but the Cuſtom of an Hundred particular Boroughs is not, and therefore nothing that you ſay of them, can be an Anſwer to what I ſay of that.</p>
            <p>I think theſe are all the Opinions in Law, in which you would ſeem to charge me with Falſhood.</p>
            <p>Now to follow you in your next Task, which is to ſhew my Notions miſtaken, broken and imperfect.</p>
            <p>Page 3. <hi>You ſay, I have not enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated all the ways, by which Lands may be incumbered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Truly Sir, nor you neither, and (tho' I own you much more Law and Memory than I have) I'le give you 'till the Publication of your next Reflections, to make an Inventory of theſe Incumbrances; for there's as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95779:6"/>
ſeveral ways of incumbring Lands, as there are ſeveral ſpecies of Profits belonging to them, as Herbage, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Eſtovers above Ground, and Mines under, all which may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly granted, and every ſuch Grant is an Incumbrance: However, I thank you, for ſtrengthning my Argument: For if the multiplied ways of Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, are the cauſe of the incertainty of Titles, the more ways the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
            <p>Page 3. <hi>You ſay, my word</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance <hi>doth not comprehend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances of Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> For this I'le put you a Caſe, (which when you have anſwered, I'le anſwer the two you have put me) <hi>A.</hi> conveys his Land to <hi>B.</hi> and then makes a Deed of it to <hi>C.</hi> and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with <hi>C.</hi> that he hath not incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd it; <hi>Query,</hi> Whether the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>B.</hi> be a Breach of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>C?</hi> But I find this Word <hi>Incumbrance</hi> is unlucky to Regiſtries.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95779:7"/>
Major Gen. <hi>Ludlow</hi> in his Memoirs takes Notice, That upon a Bill for a Regiſtry then brought into the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> the Lawyers kept them three Months upon the Word <hi>Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances.</hi> I remember indeed (amongſt the School-Boys) we had a nice Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in Magick, between (two Compounds of <hi>Cumbo) Incubus</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus</hi>; both which we had learnt to be the Poſſeſſion of the Devil: But <hi>Incubus</hi> (it ſeems) is the Devil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Man; and <hi>Succubus</hi> the Devil ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him; which the Country People call a <hi>Night-Mare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 7. <hi>You expoſe my Ignorance of the Nature and Operation of a</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>and</hi> Sale <hi>before the Statute.</hi>

            <p>Page 11. <hi>You Reprove me for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Device of Conveyancing by Leaſe and Releaſe, is an Abuſe of the</hi> Statute of Uſes: <hi>Whereas, ſay you, the Statute hath (notwithſtanding) its full Operation.</hi>

            <p>Page 15. <hi>You fetch me about again, for ſaying that this Statute is avoided by the Leaſe and Releaſe, whereas (ſay you) the firſt Avoidance was by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ſtand ſeized, and that the Leaſe and Releaſe was ſince invented, inſtead of the Covenant to ſtand ſeized.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But then you ſay, It had been more proper for me, to have inſtanced in this Covenant to ſtand ſeized, which was the firſt Evaſion of the Statute, and is now out of uſe; than in the Leaſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95779:8"/>
which was invented afterwards, and is now in uſe.</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95779:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would prove by Logick. For, ſay you if Conveyances by Leaſe or Releaſe be the only Grievances in the incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Titles, and that theſe were made by Eluſion of the Statute for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollments; therefore if a Proviſion were made for inrolling all Bargains and Sales, as well for Years as Free-holds, it would remedy the Miſchief, without regiſtring all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> By this you would confine my Argument to make good your own: For tho' I lay the blame more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon Leaſes and Releaſes, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt us'd) I don't by that quit my other Arguments, or ſay there is no other Miſchief: Nor will any Inroll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remedy the Miſchiefs, without giving a preference to Deeds ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, to Deeds not inrolled, which is all the Regiſtry offered: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be called Regiſtry or Inrollment, doth not alter the Caſe.</p>
            <p>But pray <hi>Sir,</hi> by the way, give me

leave to intrude a little upon your Trade of Reflections, for I dare ſay, no one that has read them, but thinks either that you are concerned in ſome Office, or Fees for Inrollments, or write for ſome one elſe that is. And for what you hint againſt new Officers and new Fees, I only ſay, that I can make no Compariſon between old and new Officers, unleſs I know their Names. But for Fees, I'le undertake, that Deeds may be regiſtred for half the Money they are now inrolled; not that I am underbidding you, but I obſerve you are concerned for the Subject.</p>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> There is no more a Species of a Regiſtry, than (<hi>Selden</hi> ſaith) there is of Kings, who in ſome Countries are Hereditary, ſome Elective, ſome Annual, and ſome for Life, and all theſe inveſted with different Powers.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen ſome Propoſals for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtries calculated for Rebellion.

               <hi>In</hi> page 43. <hi>You give another Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Hint againſt a Regiſtry, by which I know you mean that old Bugg-Bear. That a Regiſtry under a Monarchy is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, by diſcovering Eſtates and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Crown, whereby to make them liable to Attainders.</hi>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> Why pray, as the Caſe now
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95779:13"/>
ſtands; Suppoſe a Man is attainted of Treaſon, ſhall not the King have an Office found for his Land, upon Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence only that he received the Profits, (and I hope a Regiſtry don't furniſh out that Evidence) and this puts the Heirs or Purchaſers to plead and ſhow their Deeds, and ſure thoſe Deeds would not be leſs, but rather more valid (in this Caſe) for being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred. And yet whoever hath a Mind to keep any Settlement ſecret, need not regiſter it, for nothing can defeat it but another Deed regiſter'd, which can't be done, but by the Grantor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>And as to diſcovering the Monies of Mortgagees, whereby to tax 'em, I ſhould not be ſorry to ſee that effected any way in eaſe of Lands, tho' they may effectually regiſter their Mortgages, without diſcovering the Summs ſecured. And I believe, there are not many Examples of forfeiting Monies at Intereſt by Attainders, for Uſurers are generally Old Men or Young Women, who ſeldom are caught in Plots againſt the State, or elſe ſuch others who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>That as the Delay of a General Regiſtry hath hitherto occaſioned the Multiplying of Laws to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Frauds in Titles, ſo the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it is delayed, the more Laws muſt be multiplyed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                  <hi>Proved.</hi> They ſay a Regiſtry ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing 'till forty or fifty Years after 'tis made, and ſo they ſaid fifty Years ago: But if inſtead of that, it had been then ſettled, we had now received the Benefit of it: And ſhould that Objection prevail in other Caſes, we muſt neither plant Oaks nor Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, but leave off Generation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our iſſue arrive not to Manhood 'till One and Twenty.</p>
               <p>It is expected that Frauds in Titles will increaſe, and conſequently Laws muſt be multiplyed to prevent 'em; and

               <head>IV. Aſſertion.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That the Apprehenſion of Frauds in Titles draws a Suſpition upon good Titles as well as bad, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth depreciate the Value of Lands in general.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proved.</hi> One of the firſt Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt a Regiſtry is, That Frauds in Titles are not ſo conſiderable as they are made to be. Suppoſe that true, yet from the preſent impoſſibility of making Titles certain, they are all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be falſe. It may be ſaid, that Robberies and Burglaries are not ſo common, as that Men ſhould always ride armed, or keep their Doors ſhut, and yet they do think themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95779:19"/>
to be on their defence, becauſe they know not when the Thieves will come. Suppoſe there were the like Hazard in the Titles of Stock in the Bank, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in the Titles of Lands, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Stock were transferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at large out of a Regiſtry, and that every ſuch particular Transferr, together with general Incumbrances of Judgments, Statutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were to affect it, as they do Lands, and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances of it were to be made by Lawyers, with recitals, <hi>And whereas's,</hi> &amp;c. ſhewing all the mean Aſſignments through which they came, and a Set of Covenants afterwards for being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſeized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether this very al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Title, without any thing elſe, would not of it ſelf depreciate the Value of Stock 20 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and yet perhaps there might not be one falſe Title in a hundred Transferrs. Why then if it be ſuppoſed, that the Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Title of Lands to the Title of Stock, would depriciate it ſo much, I can't think but the changing the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Stock to the Title of Lands, would much advance the Value of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95779:19"/>
them, and this Title to Stock is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Regiſtry, which doth take away the uſe of</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> All Recitals of main Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe in the very Accounts of the Regiſtry it appears, by whom all Transferrs were made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> All Covenants for a good Title; becauſe the Regiſtry it ſelf ſhows it is a good Title; and therefore in all Conveyances of Coppy holds, and Fen-Lands in their Regiſtry, there's no Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of things paſt, nor Covenants againſt them, becauſe it always appears upon the Roll, and this makes the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of thoſe Lands ſo ſhort, being only the Words of Grant, Parcels and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum, and conſequently the Titles are eaſier peruſed, and leſs hazardous: For the very Length of Deeds doth of it ſelf hazard the Titles, by cauſing Miſtakes in peruſing them.</p>
               <p>Indeed I can't pretend, that a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Settlement, whereby Lands are to be entailed on the Iſſue Male, with proviſion for raiſing Monies on ſeveral Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſhould be as ſhort as a bare Transfer of Stock without any ſuch
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95779:20"/>
Settlement of it, nor can ſuch a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of Stock, be as ſhort as a bare Transferr of Lands. But why all the Words of Grant and <hi>Habendum,</hi> may not be as ſhort in a Transferr of Land as of Stock, I can't apprehend, and then there can be no difference in the Length of them, but in the Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Parcels. And therefore to ſay, that a Regiſtry of Lands may not be made as perfect, and the Title thereof as readily transferrable as Stock, is to ſay, that the ſame thing can't be done within an Inns of Court, as is at <hi>Grocers-Hall,</hi> or the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Houſe.</p>
               <p>To me the Transferr of Titles ſeems to reſemble the Carriage of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which is to be conſidered in the Price, as well as any thing elſe. And if this be doubted, and the Regiſtry be rejected, I could only wiſh, that an Experiment were made, to change the Titles of Stock, Tallies, Bills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (or at leaſt of one Branch of them) into the Titles of Lands, to ſee whether this Clogg on their Transferr would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95779:20"/>
not make them as dead Commodities as Land is now.</p>

               <p>However this Regiſtry don't alter the Execution of Deeds, but leaves that to be done by the Parties, any where, as it was before. So that the

additional trouble by the Regiſtry, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Tranſmitting the Deeds from the Place where they are executed, to the Place of Regiſtry; and were there a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtry in every County, they muſt be tranſmitted to the Place where that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtry is kept, and the Party need carry them no further, in order to regiſter them in <hi>London:</hi> Becauſe the Regiſters in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> will find it their Intereſt to ſettle Deputies in every County, who ſhall tranſmit and receive back all Deeds, without trouble to the Parties. So that the Regiſtry in <hi>London</hi> will be as convenient as the Regiſtry in each County.</p>
               <p>And as it will be as convenient, ſo it will be leſs chargeable.

Office of Regiſtry for Transferring Fen-Lands, is kept in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as this Regiſtry is calculated, it may be firſt ſettled in any one place, and from thence be extended, or elſe ſuppreſſed, according to the Experience and Succeſs of it.</p>
