            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As for the Money which the States owed Her, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched Her Majeſty to conſider the dangers dayly grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, their poverty and diſability to pay, and that by original Agreement with Her Majeſty, no monies were to be paid, till the Wars were ended.</p>

            <p>The Queen having Her Debts ſtated, began to be more friendly to them, and wiſhed them to follow their Trade of fiſhing upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas; (which She gave them leave to do) that they might be the better able to pay Her, and ſupport the charges of their War, which they did effectually.</p>
            <p>But I could never find that they ever paid unto Her Majeſty any of the money they owed Her. For, it's not

(and amongſt men which would be thought to live in a Free State) that ſhould any Prince in Chriſtendom, lay but half ſo much upon their Subjects, it would occaſion a Revolt.</p>

            <p n="2">2. When they have to do with any King or Prince, they order their Affairs ſo, that he muſt perform firſt; and when he hath done, they are States, and ſo are free.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They encourage the Natives upon every ſmall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diſcontent, to Arm againſt their Prince, premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them their aſſiſtance, which they exactly perform. When they have Conquered the King, and taken his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Ports, (which they firſt ſecure, making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Seas and great Rivers) then they ſubdue the Natives: and ſo Veſt in themſelves Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Dominion, and make both King and Natives their Vaſſals.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the Natives take up Arms againſt their Prince, (as many times they do) then they encourage him againſt his Rebellious Subjects, and give him their aſſiſtance: When the Natives are ſubdued, then they conquer the King himſelf, or elſe demand ſo much for their aſſiſtance, that he is not able to pay; and ſo he muſt ſubmit himſelf and his Dominions to their boundleſs ambition.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47909:14"/>
5. If there be any Wars between Prince and Prince, they will be ſure to fall in with one of them, and give him their Aid, and ſo make War in the other Princes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. When that Prince is ſubdued, and themſelves ſetled in his Dominions, then they reduce the other Prince to their Obedience, having ſome Caſtles or Ports in his Dominions, which do command the whole.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If they have any places of concern, and the Subjects of any Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> have any Factories there, (which they cannot fairly diſmiſs) then they lay ſuch great Taxes and Impoſitions upon the Natives, that they are enforced to Arms. When they are ſubdued, then they charge the Subjects of that Prince as Conſpirators and Abetters of the Natives; and ſo ſeize upon all their Goods, Factories, and enforce them to quit the Country, or elſe ſend them into ſome of their Iſlands to be Slaves.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If any Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> make any Treaty or League with the States, concerning any Affairs in <hi>India,</hi> they ſend to the States of <hi>Battavia</hi> private Inſtructions, contrary to their publick Agreement: So that all Treaties and Leagues, as to the Affairs of <hi>India,</hi> are ineffectual.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Where they have footing in any Iſland or Dominion, they claim by Conqueſt, and ſo lay what Taxes they pleaſe upon the Natives. And being in by Conqueſt, they are Proprietaries; and ſo exclude the Subjects of any King or Prince from Trade there.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If the Subjects of any King or Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> have Factories in the Dominions of any Prince there, (if they begin to be conſiderable) they take ſome occaſion to War againſt that Prince; and upon Treaty, charge thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to be the cauſe of the War: ſo if the Prince will have Peace, he muſt ſeize their Factories and Goods, and baniſh them his Country.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They pretend great kindneſs to their Neighbour Princes, and enter into a League Offenſive and Defenſive with them: And by that means get the favour of thoſe Princes to have ſome Ports, or ſtrong Caſtles for Defence
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47909:14"/>
of their Trade, as they pretend in their Territories. When that is done, they either make Wars themſelves, (and ſo thoſe Princes muſt aid them) or elſe perſwade the Princes his Allies to make War upon another Prince; which they do, and ſo fight one Prince againſt another; and when they are ſufficiently enweakned, they Conquer them all.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If they have any difference with any potent King or Prince, they get time: if it be for their advantage, they give good words, but part with no money. That done, they make their Addreſſes to ſome Favorite of that Prince, (which do all in the Court of the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings,) and ſo with ſmall charges they effect great matters.</p>
            <p>By theſe ſteps they have clim'd up to thoſe immenſe Pyramids of Dominion and Power in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that they are become formidable to the greateſt Emperours and Princes there: ever making good in their practice that Lemma of <hi>Loyola,</hi> (the Apoſtle of their State) <hi>Cavete vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The States ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> to Trade in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Principes.</hi> They have excluded the Subjects of all Kings and Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> from Traffick and Commerce, where they have any Territories or Power. And by reaſon of the Dominion they have in the South Seas, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and Fortifications they make upon the North Seas, all their Subjects will finally be debarred from any Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick or Trade there.</p>
            <p>Of what dangerous conſequence this will prove, it's very well beſeeming the Wiſdom of the greateſt Kings and Princes to conſider. For there are a Generation which are born to be the Plague, Diſquiet, and Scourge of <hi>Europe;</hi> and they gladly ſacrifice the Publick Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to their own private Intereſt.</p>

Monarchy, and with that the Glory of the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was now departed; the People model themſelves into a Commonwealth, they take a full proſpect of the Uſurpations, Injuries, and Oppreſſions of the States, which had ſuch a horrid complexion of Injuſtice upon them, that the new Commonwealth denounce War againſt the old States, they obtain many ſignal Victories, and had much diſabled their Naval Forces. Now the States be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not well able to conteſt with the Engliſh Valour, they project how they might deliver themſelves from the fury of theſe men: At laſt, they having by their Emiſſaries firſt diſſeminated Sedition amongſt the People, whereby the Commonwealth became a burthen to the Nation, and wiſe men began to be troubled at the ill face of affairs, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged the beſt expedient was, to ſet up a ſingle Perſon, (the States being now ſenſible of their former errour, in not ſupporting the Engliſh Monarchy, as their beſt ſafety, and greateſt Protection) <hi>O.</hi> as the fitteſt perſon for ſuch a Bold-fac'd Treaſon, (by their underhand practiſe, and paying to him ſome hundred thouſand of pounds) is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to take upon him the Government of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The War is continued againſt them with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: yet by their Intereſt they obtain a Treaty. And thereupon paying a Million of Pounds to <hi>O.</hi> a Peace is concluded; but the moſt diſhonourable and unjuſt that ever was to this Nation. But ſuch as it was, it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till his Majeſties bleſſed Reſtauration.</p>

               <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. there happening ſome difference betwixt his late Majeſty, and his Parliament, they ſent over their Rabbies of Sedition here into <hi>England,</hi> and infus'd their Antimonarchical Principles and dangerous Doctrines into ſome giddy heads of the Engliſh Nation, who thereby became ſo intoxicated, that they were never at reſt till (like men infected with the Plague) they infected others; and thereby a great part of the people became diſobſervant to the Laws of the Nation, and Rebels to their King. An Army of theſe men were raiſed, they having their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47909:16"/>
chief Officers and Commanders, and all Warlike Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of the United Provinces, to bring Deſtruction to the King, and Deſolation to the Kingdom. Thereby that Great King being reduced to ſtreights, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many Obligations of the States to his Majeſty) they could never be induced to contribute any Aid or Aſſiſtance to redeem that Excellent Prince from ſo great Abyſs of Miſery, or to preſerve the Kingdom from Ruine and Confuſion, (which with their Aſſiſtance might have been eaſily prevented.)</p>
            <p>But the States were ſo far from any Act of Charity or Piety, that <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was made the great <hi>Emporium</hi> or Market for the Rebels to ſell thoſe rich and coſtly Goods which they had plundered from his Majeſties beſt Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> (whereas no King or Prince in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> would ſuffer them to make uſe of any of their Ports to that purpoſe) and the beſt Furniture that ſome of the States have in their Houſes at this very day, are many of thoſe ſtollen Goods.</p>
            <p>And by this means they brought Poverty and Miſery to this Nation, Riches and Plenty to themſelves.</p>
            <p>This unfortunate Nation being thus in Combuſtion, and all befry'd, the <hi>Hogan Mogans</hi> with joy, as an ingenious man obſerved, did warm their hands at thoſe unhappy flames, which they themſelves had kindled, tuning their merry Harps, when others were weeping over a Kingdoms Funeral.

His Majeſty, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. being reſtored to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, (forgetting all their former Unkindneſſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitudes) his care was to conclude a ſtrict League with the ſaid States. But no ſooner was it concluded, but they return to their uſual practiſe of breaking of Articles, (who expect an exact obſervance of them from others, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form none themſelves.) Thereupon his Majeſty, 1664. was ſtirred up by the Complaints of his people, and the Unanimous Votes of both Houſes of Parliament, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Rights of his Crown, and the Liberties of his People, which the States had moſt notoriouſly invaded: yet his Majeſty to prevent the effuſion of bloud, <hi>(as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants ſhed bloud for pleaſure, Kings for neceſſity)</hi> ſpent the whole Summer in Negotiations to bring them to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but all his endeavours proved ineffectual.</p>

Wherein his Majeſty obtained ſo many ſignal Victories, that by their humble Supplications and Addreſſes to his Majeſty for Peace, he was induced to a Treaty. And his Majeſty having the Garranty of the moſt Chriſtian King, and of the ſaid States, that no Act of Hoſtility during the ſaid Treaty ſhould be attempted by them againſt his Majeſty, or any of his Dominions; thereupon his Majeſty did forbear to Equip his Fleet. Yet the ſaid States, contrary to their Faith, during the ſaid Treaty, (with their Fleet though not half mann'd or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall'd <note place="margin">The States burn his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Ships.</note>for any time) moſt treacherouſly invaded his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Dominions, burnt and committed Deſtruction upon ſeveral Ships of his Majeſties Navy Royal, in his own Ports and Harbour. Whereas if his Majeſty had ſet forth his Fleet, they had not been able to have put to Sea that year for want of Mariners, and other diſcouragements upon them, having received ſo many memorable defeats by the Valour and Courage of his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was there a Peace concluded, but every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was broken by them. And no wonder, for it's a Maxime of their State, That <hi>all Alliance as to them is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable:</hi>

            <p>Now they invade his Majeſties Fiſhing upon the Britiſh Seas without his Royal Licenſe, they refuſe to ſtrike Sail, and diſpute his Sovereignty of the Britiſh Seas.

And that the common people being in the ſame, be chaſtiſed by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of their bodies, for their Rebellion, <hi>Inter Leges</hi>

            <p>The Hollanders therefore refuſing to ſtrike ſail, do deny His Majeſties Soveraignty in the Seas (one of the moſt precious Jewels of the Crown) and the principal means of the Trade, Wealth and Safety of this Nation; and <note place="margin">
                  <p>The Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sea ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>The Hollanders ſupplant Trade.</p>
               </note>which all true Engliſh men, with the hazard of their lives and fortunes, are obliged to preſerve and maintain, for <hi>Imperator Maris, eſt Dominus Terrae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as they have deny'd His Majeſties Soveraignty, ſo they have by their Artifice ſupplanted the Trade and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick of His Subjects, which are the only Pillars of Riches and Safety to this Nation.</p>
            <p>Conſult the <hi>Muſcovia, Turkey,</hi> &amp;c. Companies, enquire at the Exchange, they will all tell you, It's gone, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I know not, but into <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and the United Provinces.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh are as active and induſtrious a people as any, but (of a more generous and noble Allay) they abhor to have Trade, by thoſe baſe practiſes, or to gain it, by thoſe ſordid means as the Hollanders do. I doubt not but the Engliſh Nation being ſenſible of the Injuries and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions done them by theſe men, will in ſhort time, by their Sword and Valour reduce them to reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The States have ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty by Libels.</note> And as they have ſupplanted the Trade of His Majeſties Subjects; ſo they have endeavoured to make a diminution of His own Glory, by abuſive Pictures and falſe Libels; not only in their own Territories, but in moſt of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the Kings and Princes of of <hi>Europe,</hi> where the name of the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is renown'd. <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation abroad, and Reverence at home, are the Pillars of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Soveraignty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe Arts they have endeavoured, not only to leſſen His Majeſtie, Reputation abroad, but to bring contempt upon Him, even amongſt His own Subjects at home. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt His Majeſties good Subjects have a great Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Indignities, and will not only carry an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47909:19"/>
in their ears, againſt the poyſon of theſe Libels, but with their Swords, Lives and Fortunes will vindicate His Dignity, and bring theſe Ungrateful Miſcreants to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The States having put ſo many ſcorns and indignities upon his Majeſty, and abuſes upon His Subjects in their Trade (for which His Majeſtie was more troubled than for the Indignities done to Himſelf) He was reſolved to have ſatisfaction of them. But they to give His Majeſty diſquiet in His own Dominions, and for a diverſion to Him, made their Addreſſes to ſome perſons of the Scotiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The States make addreſſes to ſome of the Scotiſh Nation to rebel.</note>(with them) for their Brotherly aſſiſtance, promiſing them they ſhould be furniſhed with Men, Arms and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney what they pleaſed. But the Scots (too well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring their late ſufferings and calamities, and) having as great a ſenſe of Loyalty and Duty for their King as any people in the world, with the greateſt ſcorn and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency rejected their moſt impious and rebellious motion.</p>
            <p>Not prevailing there, they ſet upon ſome Factories of Sedition in <hi>England:</hi> and by their Emiſſaries here, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to work upon an honeſt party in this Nation, (though differing in ſome minute Ceremonies from the Church) but they looked upon it, as the greateſt Injury and Indignity could be done them, to tempt them from the Loyalty to ſo good and gracious a King.</p>
            <p>And certainly His Majeſty had a very good eſteem for them, or elſe He would never have granted them that Act of Indulgence: An Act ſo tranſcendent, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bounty and grace of all former Kings, that it could not be obtain'd of them, though there had been many hundred thouſand pounds offered for the purchaſe of it. But as His Majeſty hath granted them Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſo (there's no doubt) they will make conſcience of their Liberty.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the Moſt Chriſtian King, of all Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> have moſt ſtudied and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured (for the good of their Subjects) to advance Trade and Commerce; yet their Subjects cry out they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47909:19"/>
have no Trade, and well they may, when the Hollanders are the great Supplanters of Trade, and obſtructers of Commerce (to all others but themſelves) in the world. And no wonder, for it's a prime principle of their State, <hi>That they muſt not be like the Joc-caul, which provide food for the Lyon; but they muſt imitate the prudent Cat, who mouſes only for it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing can be more becoming the Majeſty of two ſuch Potent Kings, not only out of charity to deliver the diſtreſſed Dutch (an induſtrous and well meaning people of themſelves) from the Tyranny and Oppreſſion of thoſe inſolent States; but out of Piety towards God, to ſettle peace in Chriſtendom (which is only by the power of theſe two Great Kings to be effected); and to which all <note place="margin">The States have made more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in <hi>Europe,</hi> than the Turk theſe <hi>50<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For let it be ſoberly conſidered, if theſe men (if we may ſo call them) ſince the Revolt from their Prince, have not made greater diſtempers and confuſions, and cauſed more effuſion of blood, aud expence of Treaſure in <hi>Europe,</hi> than the Great Turk hath done for theſe 500 years.</p>
            <p>And as they are more powerful by Sea, ſo they are much more dangerous in their practiſe. For, the Turk is a Prince, who with all Potentates doth exactly obſerve his Leagues, and keeps his Faith: But it's an Apophthegm in their State, that <hi>its for Kings and Merchants to keep their word and Faith: But for States, no longer then it's ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how exactly they make this good in their actions, I appeal to all the Kings and Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> if ever they kept one Article, or their Faith in any thing, where <note place="margin">The States will prove a greater plague to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom than the Turk.</note>it was their intereſt to break it. Certainly theſe men live, as if great Sins would merit Heaven by an Antiperiſtaſis.</p>
            <p>And its very well becoming the graveſt Judgements to conſider, if theſe men may not prove in a ſhort time, a greater Terror and Plague to Chriſtendom, than the Turk Himſelf. Inſomuch as his Arms are at a great diſtance, and only Land-forces, but theſe men are ſeated in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47909:20"/>
the Centre of <hi>Europe,</hi> and being ſo Potent at Sea, and rich in Treaſure, may caſt an Army, and with that, blood and confuſion into any Princes Dominion, whom they pleaſe to diſquiet (eſpecially being firſt reduced to poverty, which they labour to effect in all their Territories by obſtructing of Trade) And they can more ſpeedily and powerfully offend any Kingdom by Sea in one month, than the moſt puiſſant Army is able to to march through in a year.</p>
            <p>Well, It's time to reduce theſe men to Juſtice and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <hi>Prudence teacheth us to ſet limits to that Power, which deſervedly may be ſuſpected.</hi> For as they grow in Puiſſance and ſtrength, ſo the more formidable they will render <note place="margin">King of <hi>Spain</hi>
               </note>themſelves to all Kings and Princes. From one great King they have taken ſo much blood, that he is fallen into a deep Conſumption: And it's adjudged by ſome wiſe Phyſicians of State, that he will hardly recover.</p>

               </note> Did they not lately break the heart of one Potent King, and almoſt the back of another? Do they not privately engage Prince againſt Prince? and by that means bring miſery and calamity to them both; and out of their ruine create riches and plenty themſelves? Do they not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Trade of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſend nothing but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, miſery and complaints into all Princes Dominions?</p>
            <p>How dangerous and fatal their Greatneſs will in few years prove to all the Kings and Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to their Subjects (if not timely prevented) a weak Statiſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

Yet there are a People in the World, which contribute their aſſiſtance to them, but let them be aſſured, that if theſe States by their Arts ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themſelves from the deſtruction and calamity which now threaten them, they muſt for all their friendly aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, expect nothing but <hi>Polyphemus</hi> courteſie, to be the laſt that ſhall be ſwallowed up.

Nothing can give a check to their growing Power, but the Naval Forces of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> whoſe Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, Ports, Strength of Shipping, Courage of People, and Experince in Sea-Fights, have always made him very formidable. And that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth underſtood ſo well, that he aſſumed to himſelf that Motto, <hi>Cui adhaereo, Praeeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Naval Power of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> is the <note place="margin">The Naval power of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
               </note>ſecurity and ſafety of <hi>Europe:</hi> For if that were broken, they would look upon all the other as inconſiderable, becauſe they are ſo far ſeparate, that they might be deſtroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could unite; and in caſe they did, the iſſue would be very doubtful.</p>
            <p>Then they would ſacrifice one Prince after another, and bring nothing but confuſion, poverty, and miſery to Prince and People. And whether this be not more than conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural, look into their practices in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Arts and Methods, by which they have reduced ſo many great Kings, with their Subjects, Vaſſals and Slaves, to their vaſt Ambition.</p>
            <p>I have done: Yet I cannot but drop a few Tears for ſome honeſt People amongſt them, who muſt be inwrapt in the Puniſhment, though innocent as to the Guilt.</p>
            <p>Now the moſt formidable and Potent Kings in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are drawing their Forces againſt them, All their Trade is gone by Sea, nothing but horror and confuſion in their Land; none of their Allyes durſt appear for them. A mournful Tragedy. Methinks like wiſe Patriots, they ſhould ſeiſe upon their States (whom they may thank for all their calamities and miſeries) and yield them up to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; ſet up their Prince, whoſe Anceſtors have ſpent ſo much Blood and Treaſure to Vindicate their Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and not to ſerve their ends of him (as all wiſe men think the States do at this juncture of affairs) for its an Adage amongſt them, that <hi>Leo vinciri liber pernegat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the States do as certainly hate a Prince, as a Prince doth a Free-State. <hi>Diſcite Juſtitium moniti,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
