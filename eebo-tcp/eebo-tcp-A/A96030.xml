         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Your evill Councellours have tempted your Majeſty in all they could to divide your individuall Perſon from your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Authority; and we have vowed in the preſence of God, with all the power, and induſtry we have, to keep them unſeperable: which being inconſiſtent with the Malignity of that

            <p>We would not accuſe your Majeſty, our hearts abhorre it; nor will our Lawes ſuffer it, unleſſe they ſpeak, and proceed to extremities: although your Majeſty endeavour much to be thought the ſole Agent: But (as our Laws inſtruct us) we accuſe ſuch Counſellors, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Regall commands, without which the Regall Office cannot ſtand: though we doe not inſtance in all the particular Authors, the cauſes of all things being found, but with difficulty: for ſuch, as dare do ill, will not want ſo much ſelfe-love, as to conceale it, having the lives and livelyhood of them and theirs at ſtake to bribe their ſecrecie; untill ſuch time, as they grow bold in wickedneſſe, and diſcover themſelves, or that <hi>He that ſeeth in ſecret, brings them forth to be rewarded openly.</hi>

the imbraces of a Catholicke, before a Proteſtant, to be the Conſort of your Royall bed, and boſome; from thé increaſe of Papiſts, Prieſts, Jeſuites, and a Papiſticall Clergy, and Ceremonies throughout the Land: and the generall decreaſe, and ſeverall perſecutions of Proteſtants, and faithfull Preachers; from the common boaſt even of Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that you were of their Religion, and all your Majeſties moſt ſecret Counſels were firſt known to them: from the ſharp &amp; eagre proceedings againſt Scottiſh Proteſtants, and ſlow proceedings againſt Iriſh Papiſts, and Rebells: And laſtly, from the earneſt Reprieve of Prieſts or Jeſuites at firſt; and afterwards of 6.

            <p>But what is Councell, if not followed? And what are your Majeſties Acts without Councell? Surely if your Majeſties Acts out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are guided, and are not authenticke, but by advice of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Attourney, Judges, or Privie Councellors, and they have power to Declare ſo; ſhall the Great Councell of Parliament goe leſſe, that gives to all them being, and includes them? Or ſhall the Orders of any of their Courts be Legall, and ſhall not thoſe of the Parliament be much more?</p>
            <p>In this adviſe therfore, and reſolution of the <hi>Militia</hi> (which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie uſed, when there was no need) we yet moſt humbly and earneſtly in this extreame need and neceſſity of the Subject perſiſt, untill your Majeſtie remove the juſt occaſions of feares, and accord to a ſufficient cure of Jealouſies, by putting the Peoples ſafety into the Peoples own hands: whoſe Jealouſies are no whit abated by your Majeſties abſence from Parliament, and raiſing of contrary Forces, and ſending of ſeverall Menaces, and returning to your old Councells; and the Papiſts cheerfull intereſſing themſelves in; and rejoycing at all your proceedings, they all appearing like ſo many ſeverall <hi>Omens</hi> of the peoples returne to their old Ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to their old Grievances, or worſe: Nor can we ſuffer thoſe who by the Councell of the Nation have done faithfull ſervice to the Nation to periſh for their faithfull ſervice.</p>
            <p>The Acts of Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> and the reſt employed for the <hi>Militia,</hi> and for the Navie, had generall commands and inſtructions to authorize them, and have had particular approbations to confirme them: they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112788:4"/>
muſt not ſuffer, and we live; nor ſhall ſo great a ſinne make our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion odious to God and man, if we can help it. It is not the allegation of a <hi>minor</hi> part of <hi>Parliament</hi> can abuſe the wiſer, and more Religious ſort of your Subjects, ſince all men know, that each mans Vote is of equall power, and freedome in Parliament, and the voyces of a few cannot out eccho a great many; whatſoever therefore is there concluded, cannot but by plurality of voyces, which truly makes the Parliament, and the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting party makes up the faction, if they perſiſt: or, if it ſhould ſo fall out, that the <hi>major</hi> part (through neglect, or confidence in them remaining) abſent themſelves, then are their Votes no leſſe included in the perſons remaining then the Votes of the whole kingdome in the fulneſſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: If any be deterred from this freedome, it argues guilt, or cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, either of which ſhould pronounce ſuch a one unworthy a truſt of ſo great importance, none being called to the barre, but ſuch, as ſpeake directly oppoſite to the publiſhed or concluded orders of the Houſe, or willfully to move ſedition by diſtrrcting the ſenſe of the Houſe, to the great hindrance and dangerous delay of more neceſſary affaires: or elſe the conſciences of men (convinced with their reaſons and propoſitions) would ſoone engage the <hi>major</hi> part in their behalfe, and not againſt them: which thing likewiſe may be ſaid of thoſe multidudes comming with congratulations to confirme ſuch, as freely diſcharge their duties; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duty of all to ſpeake the ſenſe of the <hi>major</hi> part of the people, and ſuch confirmations but the tokens of it; and if this were not ſo, we run the greater hazard in your Majeſties diſpleaſure, then the diſſenting party in the diſaſſenting of their equalls.</p>
            <p>We doe avow all our proceedings to be by the Law of God, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of our owne conſciences, and the Law of the Land, the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation whereof, whether it be ſitting to be delivered up unto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Arbitrament, and ſuch as your Majeſtie will advance thereunto, or to remaine in Parliament (wherein the liberty and votes of Subjects are preſerved) your Majeſtie may judge, or which of theſe your people will conſent to.</p>
            <p>As for Arbytrarie power (which only is incident to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> who ſetting up their will for Law, forſake the benefit of Counſell) it cannot poſſibly in any kind be a juſt aſperſion on a Parliament, which is it ſelfe a Councell, the greateſt Councell, and the very proper founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Lawes of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>We doe confeſſe in this your Majeſties abſence and diſſent, we find a want of that harmony, which ſhould make all our Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightfull, as good and profitable; and wee grieve no leſſe for your Majeſtie, who in this remoteneſſe deveſt your Royall Perſon of all that glory and authority, which ſhould accompany your Royall actions.</p>
            <p>What ſhould your Majeſty pretend any feare, when your undaunted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112788:4"/>
courage left ſuch a teſtimony to the contrary, in your paſſing with ſo ſmall attendance through the City, and dined there, even then, when the newes of <hi>Ireland</hi> had galled the memory afreſh of former plots, and the zeale of people ſtroke into flame for the dangers of Parliament, and were imbittered with the remembrance of hardly eſcaped burthens of Monopolies and ſhip-monies, Court of Honour, Starchamber, High Commiſſion, and the Canons? Or what could leſſe partake of feare, then ſuch a deſperate aſſault of the priviledges of Parliament in your owne moſt Royall Perſon, with ſuch an uncouth ſort of attendants, the very day before?</p>
            <p>And as there was no ſigne of feare in your Majeſtie, ſo was there no cauſe of feare from us, or from any your Majeſties Subjects, to whom (had wee entertained the leaſt diſaffection or diſloyalty) there wanted not opportunity in any of thoſe times to have endeavoured our owne ends; but ſo farre were wee from any ſuch attempt (as the malignant perſons doe falſly belch upon us) that we not onely calmed the minds of people but brought them to undergoe thoſe charges towards the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Armies, which thoſe malignant perſons had brought upon your Majeſty: Having therefore theſe great teſtimonies of love and loyaltie, what can your Majeſty feare or ſuſpect? unleſſe you could yet retaine a reſolution to conſent, or be an actor in ſome more horrid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that could provoke your people beyond all what is paſt, to forget their reſolutions of affections and allegiance to your Majeſty; but ſure your Royall preſence will diſcuſſe all feares and jealouſies, which your continued abſence cannot but foment.</p>
            <p>We all have ſworne Allegiance to your Sacred Perſon as King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we did not the ſame, when you were Prince, nor is it longer of force unto your Royall father, that then was King: when your Majeſty recedes from your Kingly Office, you are ſo farre abſent from the object of our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; there is no difference of benefit to him that hath eyes, and to him that hath none, if light be wanting. All our oaths depend upon the oath your Majeſty hath taken; O, then returne unto your Parliament, and ſo unto your people; Returne unto your Parliament, and ſo unto your lawfull power; Returne unto your Parliament, and ſo unto your State and Glory; where when your Royall aſſent hath confirmed thoſe neceſſary priviledges, which may keepe whole the conſciences and eſtates of your moſt Loyall Subjects, all this our body falls into <hi>Atomes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and your Majeſtie alone remaines in glory, to be beheld the preſerver of thoſe priviledges, which all our long and faithfull endeavours have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with your Majeſty.</p>
