            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that at least with Divines they
are no younger then St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
and that Charity and Candor
are as cold as were the nights
in which most of them were
composed; it was deemed rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

there were imitated two famous
Preachers, <hi>viz. Solomon</hi> and

much with plainnesse, as to conclude nothing such,
but when both Charity and Divinity must be strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yea rack'd, and vehemently squeezed, to strain
the position, and offer it for usefulnesse.</p>
            <p>With the second, the people is not spoken unto
without a parable, not to darken, but enlighten
the discourse; and indeed since I knew the right
hand from the left in Pulpit-affairs, such methods
of explication were approved, yea much improved,
by that comparison of a reverend Divine,<note place="margin">Full. Holy State lib. 2. c. 9</note> and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian,
lately fallen asleep, attesting that <hi>reasons
are the Pillars of the Fabrick of a Sermon, but

            <p>With St. <hi>Matthew</hi> als, for the most part, I
shew where it is written, for if I but light my
Candle at anothers Torch, or borrow one beam
from anothers Wood, or a rough Stone from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

my Benefactor, his name is insculped, yea, if
from a teeming word, my fancy be so raised, that
with the Lark it soar, may be, higher then my
<hi>Author</hi> attempted, yet as far as my small notes
could allow me, I go not out of sight, untill it be
known whence that word came: Toilsome I confess
was this search unto me, but if it prove profitable
to any one, I have sufficiency of reward.</p>
            <p>To shew that importunity of friends, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of my Hearers, occasioned the <hi>Pressing</hi> of these

            <p>The true cause of my publishing was this, <hi>viz.</hi>
that I found no Act of Parliament discharging me
to scrible, and that my solitary life created some
hours of Melancholy, especially in long nights, the
tediousnesse whereof I comfortably evited, in black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

(which came not to my hands, untill I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

who, it may be, was of my mind, and we agreed;

that there may be lodging found for the too

he being concerned in the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

               <p>THe Precept being to pray after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
we must eye our copy, and he hath
no eyes that seeth not, or covers them, that
perceiveth not by this rule, that we are to
pray pertinently, modestly, briefly, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Pertinently for matter.</hi> Observe this
Prayer, and there is not only no superfluous
word, but each syllable beautifies, and every
Petition depends upon another. First, we
ask for our Fathers glory, in <hi>Hallowed be thy
Name,</hi> and then for our own salvation, in <hi>Thy
Kingdom come;</hi> which shall come to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
when we <hi>do his will on earth, as it is in
heaven,</hi> which we shall have strength to do,
when we have <hi>our daily bread;</hi> and having been
refreshed thereby, there is a necessity of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against sin past, in <hi>Forgive us our trespasses;</hi>
and in regard the vessels of uncleanness will,
or may fill, as soon as any other, it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to pray against sin to come, in <hi>Lead us not
into temptation,</hi> which may avail much <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us from much evil;</hi> and all this is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
service, because it is <hi>the Father</hi> we
pray unto, whose prerogative is, <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
that should come, and <hi>the power</hi> by which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44486:25"/>
we must expect it, shall come for our delivery;
and therefore <hi>the glory</hi> should be his, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
all these things unto us.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>hath he shewed thee, O man, what is
good;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mic. 6. 8</note> nothing lawful, nothing needful, nothing
honourable, is here comitted. More then
these we should not ask, and less then these
we ought not to ask, being to pray after this
manner.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Modestly for expression.</hi> The word, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
the phrase, <hi>Kingdom,</hi> have couched in
them great mysteries; the small expression,
<hi>bread,</hi> comprehends many different things,
according to the supplicants place, station,
and calling; With a Souldier, it will sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
victory; with a Traveller, safety; with
the weary, rest; with the feeble, strength;
with a King, Majesty; with a Counsellour, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
with the fruitful, it will signify good
children; and with the barren, it imports a
fruitful womb.</p>
               <p>Study then the meaning of the words first,
and the application of them unto thy case next;
and in the enlargements of thy soul, let thy
words be alwayes modest and moderat, lest in
asking abundance,<note place="margin">Luke 21 34</note> thou be overcharged <hi>with
surfeiting and drunkenness:</hi> Neither limit
the Holy One of Israel, by asking thus much,
or thus much, now and then, but be content
with the portion given, and satisfied with the
quantity and quality thereof.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Briefly for time.</hi> Our Saviour in this
form adviseth against two faults,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 6</note> espied in the

to its <hi>Amen,</hi> there is nothing as earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suggested; <hi>Our daily bread</hi> not being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

and the Virgin-like apparel of <hi>Tamar</hi>
the Princess, whom <hi>Ammon</hi> ravished: It is
the only Hebrew word in this Prayer, and not

                  <hi>nec Graecus interpres,</hi> neither durst the

it should be contemned by being made naked,
since no Language can express its full sense,
whereof almost all Nations, as they say Jesus
Christ, though Originally Greek and Hebrew,
sayes <hi>Amen,</hi> as sufficiently understood.</p>
               <p>Is is an oath, that what you pray for is your
hearts desire; it is a wish, that what you pray
for may be your portion; it is your assent,
that what you hear prayed for, it your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44486:26"/>
and therefore in <hi>Amen,</hi> we wish, swear,
believe, that the Prayer for <hi>forgiving sins,</hi> of
<hi>deliverance from evil,</hi> of <hi>giving daily bread,</hi> is
from the power and goodness of your Father,
and that the Kingdom of his glory and grace
is to be advanced by the same power; and
when by it, you are brought to do his will,
you resolve to <hi>hallow his Name</hi> in the first, and
give him <hi>the glory in all for ever, through Christ,
who is the Amen;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3 14</note> and therefore when you pray,

it not in that plain, full, and comfortable
sense wherein we dare, and ought to understand
it: The Temple wall being broken, and its

Father, not only from their Fathers, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

best of all known, and speaks to us

be reverenc'd for his large proffer, and we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to stand the more in aw, because of
his gracious condescendency.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>This tearm,</hi> Father, <hi>is a fastning, and a

in his favour, and to return home, to prevent
his anger: It binds us in respect of Christ, of
Obedience, Chastisement, Resignment.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>In respect of Christ our Brother.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Joh. 12 &amp; 18</note> He is

but if we would be happy, we must <hi>die
in Christ,</hi> and afterward rise with him.</p>
                        <p>This made the Church call,<note place="margin">Cant. 8 14</note> 
                           <hi>Make haste, my

                        </p>
                        <p>Touching the influence this description hath
upon Prayer, to repeat the same things, being
profitable, this account may be rendred.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>That prayer is immediatly to be directed
to God in Heaven, in opposition to all upon
Earth:</hi> The best Father, is but <hi>Pater pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psa. 84. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be for us, either a <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Shield.</hi>
It is also a direction to pray to none but such
whom we are sure are in Heaven; At <hi>Rome,</hi>
they are sainted, whom yet, save in common
charity, we know not but they may be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
However it be,<note place="margin">K. Jam. Med. on L. P.</note> let us be put in mind to
lift up our hearts, to our Father, <hi>Sursum
corda,</hi> who is in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Have a care,<note place="margin">Mel. A. dam. in vit. Oecol:</note> said a dying Reformer of the

Little children,</hi> saith <hi>Iohn, keep your
selves from idols;</hi> Have a care that you pray
to your Father, saith Christ to all his Sons,
<hi>After this manner, therefore pray ye.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>That Prayer is to be offered up with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and spiritual thoughts, not likening God to
any Creature upon Earth.</hi> As we know not what
is the likaness, shape, or form, of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Heaven, so are we utterly ignorant
of the nature of God in it; and therefore, in
Prayer, to conceit him a man, as some athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istically
do with us, or paint him like an old
man, as some superstitiously do, who are of
<hi>Rome,</hi> is a discredit to his spiritual being:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44486:65"/>
To desire to see,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 12</note> and then to worship, is to
worship without faith: Abhor therefore, such
idolizing,<note place="margin">Chrys. Hom. 3. de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hens. Dei naturae.</note> and pray against the impress of
such absurd vanity, the more absurd, that there
was no <hi>manner of similitude seen on the day the
Lord spake in Horeb;</hi> and though we see heaven
daily, yet can we give no account of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
how much lesse of God, who is within it.</p>

                           <hi>I am ignorant of these things,
but this I know, that the gods have indignation
at such curious searchers.</hi> Sure we are, those
that confine the illimited God, in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
space of any thing visible, or form his
spirituality in the likenesse of what can be
sancyed, creat a god which cannot hear them,
and slight a God will be revenged upon them.</p>

                           <q>Besides these,<note place="margin">Church Mis. 154</note> men make God an idol,
when they prepare not their hearts, nor fit
their affections for his service; and again,
when all their religion is in the Temple,
and again, when they invent wayes to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, and follow their own imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
To speak of committing, or loving
sin in secret, or of hoording up wealth, with
trust, or for-swearing themselves in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were large subjects, yet by these, God
is made an idol.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>That Prayer is to be presented with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and pure affections,</hi>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44486:66"/>
to be looking to Heaven, and pointing to the
Earth, with the Roman Senator, is to become
sharers of his deserved scorn: and yet, how
many are there, while Heaven is in their
mouth, flesh, fish, or ships, are in their heart:
Acting too truly, what in the Fable is said of
the Wolf,<note place="margin">Brom. de Oratione</note> when at School, for learning to
spel <hi>Pa-ter,</hi> Father; but being by his Master,
ordered to put them together, in stead of
Father, said, <hi>Agnus,</hi> Lamb, thinking on his
prey. An userer at the same time, made the
like proficiency, and in place of Fa-ther, said,
<hi>Pecunia,</hi> Money. But let not this be among
you, he is in Heaven, and hath <hi>his eye-lids
trying the children of men;</hi> not but that he
is every where,<note place="margin">Psal 11 4.</note> but in Prayer, he is by design
said to be in Heaven,<note place="margin">Cajet. in Mat. 6. 9</note> that our hearts and
minds may be lifted up to the excellency of
his dignity and greatness, having <hi>all things
naked and open before him,</hi> and therefore, thy
hypocrisie is apparent,<note place="margin">Heb 4. 13</note> thy in-side, being
naked.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>That Prayer is to be quickned, by confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the All- sufficiency of God, to give what is
asked, whether things of Heaven, or of Earth.</hi>
By the Heavens, and influences therefrom,
is Earth and Sea sustained; he is in Heaven,
therefore in the Air, upon the great Waters:
And because, he can order all for his peoples
good,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 10</note> we are not to despond, and doubt of his
soveraignty, but let our necessities be known,
whether for the Wine-press, or for the light

for his Son,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16 23</note> we need not doubt redressing.</p>
                        <p>He is in Heaven, and thence, he gave horns
to the Bull, hoofs to the Horse, teeth to the
Lyon, finns to the Fish, wings to the Bird,
scent to the Dog, motion to the Air, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Water, heat to the Fire, light to
the Sun, chain to the Devils,<note place="margin">Iud. 6</note> strength to the
Angels, his Image and his Son to man: what
therefore, should make the humble Orator
to pray sorrowing,<note place="margin">Matth. 14 31</note> as those without hope? <hi>O
thou of little faith, wherefore dost thou doubt?
He is Almighty God,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>5. <hi>That Prayer is continually to be qualified
with earnest considerations, tending to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, while we are upon Earth.</hi> It is a
dishonour for a Prince to have suits made in
his presence-Chamber, not adequat to the
dignity of that room: To ask of thy Father

in glory?</p>
                        <p>The old <hi>Pollanders</hi> gave names to their
children,<note place="margin">Camb. ut supra.</note> at the first cutting of their hair, but
the most Christian Nations have followed the

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44486:69"/>
yea, the old <hi>Romanes</hi> gave it to their Femals,

                           <hi>Samaria</hi> from
<hi>Ierusalem;</hi> some had it, because of some
property, as <hi>Esau</hi> from his being hairy: Some
from an atchievment; <hi>Iacob</hi> was called <hi>Israel</hi>
for his prevailing with God. Others gave
names from a desire of continuating their
own names upon earth; and because it is a
kind of judgement, to want a name, as did
<hi>Davids</hi> adulterous infant, and the rich Churle
in the Gospel, for this they intended to call
<hi>Iohn, Zacharias,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 59</note> after the name of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
some give them, in imitation of some
vertue, as <hi>Iob,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> as a spur for the
bearer, to follow the vertues of those Saints.
Hence it is thought <hi>Iacobs</hi> sons were never
named <hi>Iacobites</hi> but <hi>Israelites,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Aret. Prob. Theol. loc: 79</note> to animate the
whole race for strugling with God untill they
got a blessing. Lastly, Names have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
from some sudden emergency, as <hi>Isaac</hi>
from <hi>Sarahs,</hi>

                        <p>Most of these wayes have God taken to
himself, and recevied names from others,
yea, we may say, firnames; he is often called
the Lord, Jehovah, God; and frequently,

                        <p>In order to which, let us descant upon,
1. What may be understood by his Name.
2. How that Name is to be hallowed. 3. Why
the speciality of that Name is expressed, all
other names being secluded, as is implyed
in that Pronoun, <hi>Thy Name.</hi>

                        <p>By name, in general, understand his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable

                           <hi>Iehovah,</hi> is so peculiarly his, that it
was never, and is never to be communicated
to any creature; not that the letters of his
Name, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> is to be adored with the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Jews, as those of <hi>Iesus</hi> are, with
the idolatrous Papists, but his nature expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in, and by, those letters, including both
the Spirit and the Son; for all that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

should not the Name, <hi>Iehovah</hi> be likewise,

                        <p>By name, understand also his wonderfull and
inseparable properties, as Wisdom, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency;
as also, his beautiful, and admirable
acts and workings;<note place="margin">Ps. 19. 1</note> all which are called upon

to glorifie the Lord;<note place="margin">Ps. 148. 3</note> such as his work of

The doctrine whereof,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1</note> is not to be blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

the names of the holy Trinity, being taken
not so much from nature, as from holy works;
we shall observe some letters of this Name,
that we may be careful of giving him in it,
that due respect, which belongs unto his
greatnesse, since the secrecy and mystery of
his being, dischargeth our srailty and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

of comsorts, of veracity: the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
the miserable, the second the despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
the third the scornful, the fourth the
mournful, the fifth the doubtful.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>One great letter in his Name, is mercy
promised to the miserable,</hi> and may be as
clearly seen as <hi>Pilats</hi> inscription over Jesus;

relate to Heaven, are first to be demanded,

we are directed next to the good things of

in the three last Petitions, whereof the last is
against present evil, in <hi>Deliver us from evil;</hi>

and those few again have their souls so
entangled, that though they have no love to

themselves out of sins snare, or force to drive
it from exercising dominion over them.</p>

Justice, to be angry at a harmless jest, and

that rather eyes the supposed saults
or infirmities of others, then the real vices in
a mans self, whereas zeal, rather respects its
own short-comings, or over-runnings in duty

curious a structure,<note place="margin">Exod. 2. 2</note> that it were impiety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

                        <p>It is the souls Cabinet, therefore not to
be broke; <hi>Christ</hi> died for it, and therefore
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44486:151"/>
it is not to be slighted; the earth is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it, and therefore is not to be strip'd; yea,
Heaven is ordained for it, and therefore it is
to be honoured.</p>
                        <p>The soul indeed is to be the main, not our
only care; but the body hath here Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,

                        <p>It must be also our own money; to pay one
debt with what we borrow from another, is
no release from the burthen, and here is a
pinch,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 7</note> that we can give God nothing but what
we have from himself, for our selves being
not our own, how shall we pay our debts:
Observe, we say <hi>Forgive us our trespasses,</hi> for
except these, nothing is our own, and our <hi>own</hi>
indeed, none but our selves being concerned
in them. Yet here is liberty, that this <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us,</hi> is accounted so full a discharge, that
we are assoiled for ever from future pleas.</p>

broad as the sore; is it a <hi>debt?</hi> It must be
ballanced, and the sum deposited, equivalent

and our grief for so doing must have the same
rise, and yet herein we fail, the infinity as it
were of sin, being beyond the reach of our
finit, and interrupted sorrow, which stil
hightens the debt, causing an impossibility in
its defraying, and in us an ardency for its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

commanding and exacting obedience from
beasts,<note place="margin">Tert. de Patient.</note> as our due, yet not only doubting,
but resolving against obsequiousnesse unto
that Lord, whose are all things we possesse.</p>
                        <p>We owe unto God, the keeping of his
image in our selves,<note place="margin">Chrys. Hom. de Orat. Dom.</note> undefaced. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of one another before him; but
<hi>sunt alia debita,</hi> there are other debts, for
we have sinned grievously, lived unjustly, and
loved iniquity, all which will be accounted
for.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> hated, and of sins accounted,
a loving to lie, and contracting of debt, the

and quitting to our brother,
whatever upon the account of injury he is

so principal a point, and so material,
that it is the only Petition in this Prayer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by St. <hi>Mark</hi> in his Gospel, he, <hi>suo more
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:44486:195"/>
comprehendit,</hi> abridging, after his usuall way
of writing,<note place="margin">Jerom in Mar. c. 11 25</note> the whole Prayer into this one, in

                        <p>Our meditations shall eye such as go to
Law; towards Magistrats that put malefactors
to death; towards Creditors that do trust
and lend; and touching dying Malefactors,
who do ordinarily forgive.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the first, it may be questioned
whether such as pursue by legal decreets or
executions,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 1</note> the reparation of damnages, losses,
hurt they have received from the frowardness
or untowardness of their neighbours, can say
in such pursuits and claims, <hi>Forgive us as we
forgive,</hi> or, <hi>for we forgive;</hi> the whole process
bearing a contradiction to this Petition;
hence it is, that <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
revived this old condemned Doctrine
in our dayes, that no Christian ought to go
to Law, and that none ought to be a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat.</p>
                        <p>To which it may both truly and briefly be
replyed,<note place="margin">Ezra 7 25</note> that it is not only lawful, but abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary (since the fall) for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
of mankind in orderly society, for to
have Laws and Government, whereunto the
oppressed may run for shelter and protection.</p>

As for those abused Texts, <hi>Iudge not that
you be not judged: Resist not evil: My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is not of this world,</hi> &amp;c. They strike not in
the least against Magistracy,<note place="margin">Featleys Dippers dipt, pag. 142.</note> but privat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
malice, ambition, which were sins also
under the Law, under which they approve of
Magistracy, and now under the Gospel
there is a necessity of Officers and Judges,
the old abominations, enormities, disorders
through natural corruption, being even under
the Gospel daily breaking forth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Christ</hi> himself payed tribute to <hi>Cesar,</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> appealed to him, and complained to <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
of a conspiracy against him,<note place="margin">Act. 23. 17</note> yea, pleaded
his cause and innocency without reflecting or
exclaiming against Courts of Judicature.
Good Kings in the Old Testament are famed
for their Judgment, and our Saviour in the

Prisons,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 25</note> even while he is establishing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel, and gives no hint to their

                        <p>In short, the Magistrat being appointed to

and contrary to the very principles of
carnal self, like that story of a certain Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
who being delivered of a child, could
not get it baptized untill she discovered the

killed her child, and then hang'd her self, and
this coming to the ears of a Scholler who was
the father, he stob'd himself to death; which

made him hang himself also. Now

                        <p>THe danger of temptation being so great,
it is time to appear for caveating against
harsh conceits of God, and touching that, it
is fit to inquire whether he be the Author, or
cause of the sin committed, since he is the

surmise is founded upon those Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing

as evident, that if he willed not the same, it
should not be, he being able to reduce both
Devils and men to order, that he permitts
sin,<note place="margin">Iob 1. 10</note> is by few denyed; and its permission is
consistent with his Law, he beholding it, as a

commanded sin, were to deny his <hi>holinesse,</hi> to
