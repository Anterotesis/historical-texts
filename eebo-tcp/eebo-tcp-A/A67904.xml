            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in the main and most materiall questions debated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Papists ever since the reformation: for such as professe themselves our enemies, and are most busie to stirre up our gracious Prince to armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, do wilfully dissemble their knowledg of any other controversie betweene them and us, but that which properly concerneth us, and rubbeth not upon any other Church. In this their doing the Judicious may perceive their manifold deceit, whereby they would delude the simple, and many wittie worldlings do deceive themselves: First, they would have the world to think that wee obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuse to obey the Magistrate, in the point of things indifferent, And therefore unnecessarily, and in a foolish precisenesse draw upon ourselves the wrath of the King. Secondly, when in our late Assemblies, the order of our Church is made known, and the seeds of superstition, heresie, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and antichristian tyranny are discovered in the service Booke and Canons, they wipe their mouth, they say, No such thing is meant; and that wee may upon the like occasion blame the service Booke of England. Thirdly, when by the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former quarrellings, their palpable Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Arminianisme are set before their eyes, and their perverse intentions, desires, and endeavours, of the change of Religion and lawes are upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grounds then upon the service Booke and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons objected against them; they stop their eares, or at least shut their mouths, and answer nothing. This challenge they still decline and misken; they will not let it be heard, let bee to answer to it; And

for to make out their tergiversation, for to dash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way allutterly this our processe, they have bin long plying their great engine; and at last have wrought their yondmost <hi>myne</hi> to that perfection, that it is now ready to spring under our wals. By their flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring calumnies they have drawne the Prince againe to arms, for the overthrow of us their challengers, and for the affrighting by the terrour of armies on foot all others elswhere, from commencing any such action against them.</p>
            <p>As for us, truly it were the greatest happinesse <note place="margin">The scope of the treatise.</note> we do wish for out of Heaven, to live peaceably in all submission and obedience, under the wings of our gracious Soveraigne, and it is to us a bitternesse as gall, as wormwood, as death to be necessitate to any contest, to any contradictory tearms, let be an armed defence, against any whom hee is pleased to defend: Yea certainly, it were the great joy of our hearts, to receive these very men, our mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, into the arms of our affection, upon any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable signes in them, of their sincere griefe, for the huge wrongs they have intended, and done to their Mother church and Country.

Doth not this encrease his guiltinesse, that hee and his followers are become so wicked and irrespective, as to make it an ordinary pranke, to cast their owne misdeeds upon the broad back of the Prince? Dare hee say, that the King commanded any such thing <hi>motu proprio?</hi> Did hee command that expunction without any information, without any mans advise? Did any King of <hi>England</hi> ever assay to expurge the publike Bookes of the Church, without the advise of his Clergie? Did ever King <hi>Charles</hi> meddle in any Church matter of far lesse importance without Doctour <hi>Lads</hi> counsell? The third excuse, That the King then had no seed: How is this pertinent? May not a childlesse man say in his prayers, that God is the Father of the Elect, and of their seed, though himselfe as yet have no seed? But the true cause of his anger against this passage of the Liturgie, seemeth to have been none other then this <hi>Arminian</hi> conclusion; that all faith of election in particular, of personall adoption or sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is nought but presumption. That this is his Graces faith, may appear by his Chaplains hand, at that base and false story of <hi>Ap-Evan</hi> by <hi>Studley,</hi>

               </note> long time, that the innovating faction did minde no more nor <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> but at once, those who touched their pulse neerer, did finde a more high humour working in their veines. With <hi>Arminius</hi> errours they began incontinent to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish other Tenets, which to all meere <hi>Arminians</hi> were ridiculous follies. The elements of the Lords Supper began by them to bee magnified, above the common phrase of protestant Divines, a corporall presence of Christs humanitie in and about the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bee glanced at, a kind of omnipresence of Christs flesh to bee preached, a number of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before those elements, and all that was neere them, both the altar, bason, chalice, and chancell to bee urged; many new ceremonies, which for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares had beene out of use, to bee taken in, a great bitternesse of spirit, against all who ran not after these new guises to appeare. This made us thinke they intended to step over from <hi>Arminius</hi> to <hi>Luther.</hi> In this conception wee were somewhat
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:130835:28"/>
confirmed, considering their earnest recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the reading of young Students the late <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Divines, such as <hi>Hutter, Meisner, Gerard,</hi> with their crying down, both in private and publike, of <hi>Calvine, Beza, Martyr, Bucer,</hi> and the rest of the famous Writers both ancient and late of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Belgicke</hi> Churches. Their giving it out also that their martyred Reformers, <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer,</hi> were of <hi>Luthers</hi> Schoole, and from him had learned those things, wherein the <hi>English</hi> Church did differ from the other Reformed of <hi>Calvines</hi> framing. But most of all, by my Lord of <hi>Canterburies</hi> great diligence under-hand, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and reward that late negotiation of Master <hi>Duries</hi> with the Churches over Sea, for the extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> errours, and procuring with their Churches, not only a syncretisme, which all good men did ever pant for, but also a full peace in tearms so generall, so ambiguous, so slippery, that are very suspitious to many, other wayes very peaceable mindes.</p>
            <p>This I speak without any intention of putting the least note of blame either upon the person or pains of Master <hi>Durie,</hi> or any of the Divines of either side, who have been ready to declare their inclination, and employ their labours towards that more desired then hoped for union of the Protestant Churches, whom evill instruments have keeped too too long asunder in a lamentable, dangerous, and disgracefull distraction. Master <hi>Duries</hi> labours in this kind were ever by mee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:130835:28"/>
esteemed worthy of great prayse, honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: I wished alwayes in my heart to them a most happy successe ever rejoycing when in any of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, I did perceive the lest step of advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>My remarke only is upon the malice of the <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burians,</hi> who to their wicked designe of re-uniting to <hi>Rome,</hi> and so overthrowing all the Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, doe most perversly abuse as all, whatsoever at any time hath falne from the pen of any Reformed Writer, tending towards mutuall peace or modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so especially the negotiations which of old or late, hath beene in hand for the drawing of us and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> into one body: These Treaties whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a full agreement, or a friendly toleration, are laid by them as the principall ground-stones of their negotiation with <hi>Rome,</hi> for to them both the persons and doctrine of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are more odious than these of the Papists, as you will see it hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate from the Writs of <hi>Forbes</hi> and <hi>Kellet;</hi> so that all the countenance they have showne hitherto towards the negotiations of our peace with the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> did not proceed from any true affection, they carried either to the men or to their negotiation in it selfe: but their ayme mainly was to have these Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties abused as plausible means to advance their own greater designe. This for a time, while their mysteries lay vailed, was not well perceived: the most of men did suspect no more in all their seeming favours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Lutheran</hi> party, then that a kind of <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranisme</hi> had beene there uttermost intension, hoping

Their adoration before the altar is done as they confesse unto the altar, much more their ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before the elements, without the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving must bee unto the elements: For I hope they will bee loath to affirme, that there is in the altar any worthinesse or aptitude, or any other cause imaginable, which can make it capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, but the same causes are in the elements in a farre higher degree: The relation to Christs Body and Person, which they make the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of those worships being much more true, more neare, more cleare in the elements, then in the altar, howsoever the Popish prostrations, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, before the hostie, which to all Protestants are so abominable idolatries, are absolved by these men; not onely by the clearing of Papists of all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry every where, but particularly by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, to have the adoration of the elements to be called Popish.

It cannot be denied, but that the Church of England did ever allow the private confession of sinnes to the Priest, it were very strange, if our Church ordaining Priests and giving them power of absolution, and prescribing the forme to be used for the exercise of that power upon confession, should not allow of the private confession. M. <hi>Sp.</hi> Sermon page. 16. Since the Priest can in the name of God forgive us our sinnes, good reason we should make our confession to him: Surely God never give the Priest this power in vaine, he expects we should make the best use of it we can.

            <p>IN the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Canterburians</hi> use to professe corruptions of two kinds, errours and <note place="margin">Few of all <hi>Romes</hi> superstitions are against their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</note> superstitions; as for heresies or Idolatries, they are loath that any such crimes should be laid to the charge of their mother church, how many, and how grievous errors they finde <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of, they had need to declare; for in the most of those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the protestants place the chief of the Romish er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, you have heard them plainly take their part, readily it will prove no otherwise when wee come downe to trie them in the particular heads, wherein papists are reputed most superstitious.</p>
            <p>The superstitions which in papists are most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked in their private carriage are these four: In their frequent saining of themselves with the signe of the crosse: In wearing about their neck a crucifix or some such toy of an image or relique: In saying their praiers on their beads: In abstaining from flesh on friday, wednesday, lent, or some great festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls <hi>Eave;</hi> Our men are farre from disproving of any of these practises. For the first, they avow that saining with the signe of the crosse at rising or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, at going out or comming in, at lighting of candles, closing of windowes, or any such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not only a pious and profitable ceremony, but a very Apostolicke tradition. <note n="a" place="margin">

to the Masse, to make this their impudent fraud so palpable that hereafter they may blush (if it bee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for such foreheads to blush at any thing) ever againe before our King to make any such allegeance passing all the rest of that booke for shortnesse, wee shall consider some few lines in some three or foure leafes of it at most, wherein the world may see their malapart changing of the <hi>English</hi> liturgy in twentie particulars and above, every one whereof drawes us beyond all that ever was allowed in <hi>England,</hi> and diverse of them lead to those parts of the Masse which all protestants this day count most wicked.

Their mutation of the most of those things to a plaine popish sence, which in the best sence that ever was put upon them, did occasion alwayes to <hi>England</hi> much trouble. 3.

In the very forefront of this their Offertory, they set up unto us whole five passages of Scripture, whereof the English hath none, all directly in the literall sence carrying to a Jewish oblation. 3. For the waking of the Priests appetite (which of it selfe uses to be sharpe enough) Upon the hope of present gaine to sing his Masses with the better will, they set up a Rubrick, seasing and infefting the officiating Priest in the halfe of all the oblations, which hee can move the people to offer, and giving a liberty to him with his Church-warden, to dispose on the other halfe also as he thinks good, expresly contrary to the English, which commands all the almes of the people to bee put up in the poores boxe. 4. They will not have us to want the very formality of a Jewish offering, for they ordaine the Deacon to put the bason with the peoples devotions in the hands of the Priest, that hee may present it before the Lord upon the Altar, just as the papists in this place ordaine to bring the paten with their oblations unto the Priest; that hee may set it before their altar. <note n="q" place="margin">Durand. lib. <hi>4</hi>

The first English prayer which stood before the consecration, where the passages of eating Christs bodie, and drinking Christs blood, could not possibly, by the very papists themselves, be detorted to a corporall presence, yet now in our book, it must change the place, and bee brought to its owne old stance, after the consecration and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, immediately before the communion, as a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of humble accesse.</p>

Our men being nothing afraid for the peoples beliefe of a corporall presence, have pulled out of their hands and scraped out of our booke both these an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes. 2.

may take extraordinary notice of these phrases, there are two Rubricks set up to their backs, obliging every Communicant with their owne mouth to say their <hi>Amen</hi> to them. 3. The English enjoynes the Minister to give the people the elements in their owne hand; ours scrapes out that clause, and bid communicate the people in their owne order, which imports not onely their removall from the Altar, their standing without the Rail, as prophane Laicks farre from the place, and communion of the Priests, but also openeth a faire doore to the popish practice, of putting the elements not in the prophane hands, but in the mouthes of the people; this as the report goes, they have well neer practised; and no marvaile, since already they professe that the people ought not with their fingers to touch these holy mysteries: See in the Supplement, D. <hi>Kellets</hi> Tenets. 4. The English permit the Curate to carry home the reliques of the bread and wine for his private use, but such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanity by our booke is discharged: The consecrate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements are injoyned to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Our Booke will have the elements after the consecration covered with a <hi>Corporall,</hi> the Church Linnings were never called <hi>Corporalls</hi> any where, till Transubstantiation was borne, neither carryed they that name in England, till of late his Grace was pleased by the pen of his man <hi>Pockling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonne</hi> and the like, to disgrace them with that stile.

6 The English will have the Ministers and people to communicate in both kinds; our booke enjoynes the Priest to receive in both kindes, but the people onely in due order: This due order of the people, opposite to the communion of the Priest in both kindes, may import the removall of one kinde from the people, so much the more may wee feare this sacriledge from their hands, since they tell us, that our onely ground for communicating of the people in both kindes is stark naught, that for this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice there may well be tradition, but Scripture there is none. <note n="d" place="margin">
