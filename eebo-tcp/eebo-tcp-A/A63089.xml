            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He malignant disposition of some ill affected persons to the Common wealth, like some Diseases in mans body, which by a kind familiarity, and consent with nature, fasten and get the possession of the body, and by degrees doth subvert and ruine the whole structure in man. None are of a more dangerous nature then those which seeme to comply with our constitution, and which by a pleasing sympathy work themselves into custome and consent. Of our enemies, the Civill enemy is most dangerous, and as his practice hath the least suspicion, so have they the most danger, by this means working his designs from all means of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Since the last desire sent over unto the Lady <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi> for the prevention of the accesse unto the Queens Majesty, of all such persons, which may be by any means suspected to be evill Counsellors, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visers unto her Royall Person, and therby strive to divert the good opinion of the proceedings of this Kingdome; wherby much danger and hazard hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued unto this Kingdome: Religion hath bin in its power perverted, the passage of the Gospell much
<pb facs="tcp:63894:3"/>
hindred, the Lawes of the Kingdome in many points subverted, the execution of justice upon many Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors prohibited, and the small peace of this Realme drawn into many most strange distractions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, and His Majesties good opinion of his most Loyall Subjects good intentions hath bin much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; so that the proceedings concerning the affairs of this Realm have taken very small or none effect. The Catholique Faction, perceiving their malicious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises to be hindered, did well hope that now her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esty being in those remote Parts, that they might have the more reall accesse unto her privacy, and by that means, the better opportunity to execute their divellish counsels, and malicious intentions, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attempted their accesse unto her Majesty: but by the care and vigilancy of that most religious and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Princesse, complying with the desires of this Realm now to be hindred, have endeavoured by most execrable, and irreligious attempts to remove all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles, which they apprehend, did hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and execution of their wills and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, upon the 5. of March last, two Priests, and some others of that Hellish Confederacy, having often attempted accesse unto her Maj. (without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, their aym not being ingenuous, or faithfull) but being often prevented, now did begin to expresse their venome, in the removall of all hinderances that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and hinder their ayms, and came unto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse Court, now being at the Hague, their persons were vailed in a strange disguise, and their pretence
<pb facs="tcp:63894:3"/>
was to prefer a Petition unto her Highnesse, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the distresses of themselves, and their Families, which they have suffered by the long and tedious wars in those parts; and for which they did suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate unto Her Highnesse for some relief. Thus no Cheat never wants a fair dissimulation, to cloak and cover their base intentions, and Vice as yet could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want any excuse for its deformity.</p>
            <p>Being thus come to the Court, without a very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious stay, her goodnesse not being jealous of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill intentions, as vertue is not suspitious; gave them admittance unto her person, after which admittance they delivered unto her hands and consideration a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which while her Grace was perusing one of the disguised persons, drew forth from under his Coat a Pistoll, charged with a brace of ballets, and with the cock drawn up, and withall endeavoured to discharge it: but by the mercy of God who doth still preserve his elected, &amp; doth bring to naught the naughty coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and attempts of the wicked; the Pistoll would not go off, another of the Conspiracy drew out a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and when he saw that, the Pistoll did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what they intended, with the Ponyard hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to finish, what the Pistoll did not execute; but Her Highnesse did escape away into her private Chamber, and so by the mercy of Her Creator, and Her flight escaped the intended danger and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Immediately, being forced in by Her Highnesse cryes, for which there was just occasion many of her Attendants, who waited not far off, issued in, and did lay hands upon those base and Trayterous

villany, and incontinently conveyed them away into safe Custody, which were the next day put upon the Rack, and enforced to confesse as followeth. That they having oftentimes essayed their accesse unto the Qs. Majesty, for what end they would not confesse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the strict Guard alwayes kept about her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, prohibited and forbidden, that they now made this attempt upon her sacred Person, supposing by her Removall to accomplish their ends, and one of them <hi>Tho. Earnie</hi> did make confession, that he was sorry he did misse his opportunity, and wished a Curse upon himself, for failing in his enterprise. This was the sum that they would at the first confesse, and so for that present they were released from the wrack, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the prison again, where now they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Dungeon, and will ere long, be cal'd again into a second <hi>Confession,</hi> where untill then, let them rest, untill that Iustice shall further determine of them. I thought it also fit for the satisfaction of the <hi>Reader,</hi> and the credit of the Relation, to set down the Names of these Traitors, which might otherwise nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gain belief, nor give the Buyer any content.</p>
            <p>The Names of the two Iesuits, were <hi>Iohn Brown, Anthony Taylor,</hi> both English-men, and born in Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byshire, by their own Confession.</p>
            <p>The Names of the other three, were, <hi>Patrick Orny</hi> an Irish man, <hi>Lewes Antony,</hi> an Italian, and <hi>Tho. Earny</hi> an Italian also, who have discontinued their Country, and lived in <hi>Holland</hi> this eight years, during the time of those warres.</p>
