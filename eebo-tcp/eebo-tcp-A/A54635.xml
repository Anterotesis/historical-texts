            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is a Truth beyond all Dispute and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, sad Experience having too evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out the Proof and Certainty of it, that the Trade of <hi>England</hi> for many Years last past, hath been so impolitickly and ill manag'd for the Nations Good and Benefit, that it hath been the true Cause of the fall of the value of Lands, the decay of Farmers, and Graziers, and almost the utter ruin and destruction of the choisest and best Manufactories of this Kingdom; and the more the Trade of the Nation shall be enlarged in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods we now Traffick in, the more mischievous and ruinous it must prove to the Nation; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less some speedy Care be taken by wise and prudent Laws, to prevent this growing Destruction upon us, we shall most insensibly fall to the greatest Penury and Want perhaps of any Nation in <hi>Europe;</hi> tho this Kingdom otherways by its Scituation, and the fruitfulness of its Soil, and by its brave Harbours for Shipping, the choisest and cheapest Materials for the stanchest Manufactories that are used through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:34974:4"/>
               <hi>Europe;</hi> This Kingdom might be improv'd not only to doubling the value of Lands, but by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing our Manufactory so, as to command the Trade of the Known World; and the Design of the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author of this Book is, to demonstrate the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Assertions, by shewing most unanswerably the fatal Mischief that attends this Nation, by the Methods of Trade, that it is at present ingaged in, and giving also the true Notions of Trade, as to Interest and Advantage of their Majesties, and all their Subjects, and that with so much Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Clearness, that the Author would not have probably toiled in so ingenious Inquiries, but that he believed, could he intelligibly make out the Truths above, whenever the great Assembly of Parliament should meet, they would take it into their Wise Consideration.

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>IT hath been the Common Design and Business of Individual Men in <hi>England,</hi> as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to obtain sufficient <hi>Revenues</hi> in Money to the end they may secure themselves from <hi>Necessities</hi> and <hi>Shifting,</hi> and live <hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully</hi>; And yet it may be undeniably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortably observed, That whilst every one hath eagerly pursued his <hi>private Interest,</hi> a kind of <hi>Common Consumption</hi> hath <hi>crawled</hi> upon us; Since our <hi>Land-Rents</hi> are generally much <hi>fallen,</hi> and our <hi>Home-Commodities sunk</hi> from their late Price and Value; Our <hi>Poor</hi> are vastly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,</hi> and the rest of our People generally more and more feel the <hi>Want of Money;</hi> This Disease having grown upon us in times of Peace, when no Forreigners have <hi>Exhausted</hi> us by War-like
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34974:5"/>
Depredations, may very justly amuse us; and the more, when at the same time, we observe that some of our <hi>Neighbour-Nations,</hi> lately our <hi>Equals,</hi> or much our Inferiors, are become so <hi>prodigiously Rich and Powerful</hi> on a sudden, (I mean the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch:)</hi> Certainly these mighty <hi>Productions</hi> must have some great and vigorous <hi>Causes,</hi> which have been very furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously working of <hi>later years,</hi> and such as have not fallen under Common Observation: The Nations and Races of People are the same, and the Countries of <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> stand where they did, they are not removed an Inch; nor do the <hi>English</hi> seem to have lost their Vnderstandings; they are as <hi>cunning</hi> in their private Contracts as ever, and appear nothing inferior to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in most parts of <hi>Literature</hi>; I question not but that they know all the <hi>Ancient Languages</hi> and <hi>Histories</hi> as well, that our <hi>Academicks</hi> are as subtile in all the <hi>Criticismes</hi> of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that they have travelled as far into the most abstruse parts of his <hi>Logick, Physicks</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicks</hi>; and yet have we still grown poorer and poorer; So have we excelled in divers <hi>necessary parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> We have had as Able, Eloquent and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Clergy-men</hi> as ever, and as Notable <hi>Physitians,</hi> and the Nation seems to have grown more <hi>Learned,</hi> and therefore <hi>Wiser</hi> than before, by the late vast increase of these Ranks of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34974:5"/>The present Disadvantages we are under, are therefore commonly attributed to <hi>Accidents</hi> of divers kinds, as mens present particular <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> dictate, in which the greatest part are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to rest satisfied without farther enquiry, whilst they have some Prospects of <hi>Gain</hi> in the <hi>Imployments</hi> they are severally Educated to; Some ascribe the <hi>fall of Rents</hi> to an over-great increase of Corn, by the <hi>ploughing up of Parks</hi>; Others to the modern <hi>Parsimony in House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping,</hi> the lessening of Gentlemens <hi>Retinues,</hi> and leaving off the old laudable Custom of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Suppers,</hi> which they suppose occasions a less Consumption of Victuals; others attribute this, and the want of Money in the Country, to the great resort of People to <hi>London,</hi> and quarrel at the <hi>New Buildings,</hi> as the Hires and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles which draw them thither; others to the <hi>banking up of Treasures</hi> in the Coffers of some unknown Grandees, <hi>Church-men, Lawyers</hi> or <hi>Citizens,</hi> of which they are highly confident, for else, they say, what is become of the money? then for the late Progress and Trophies of the <hi>French,</hi> many look upon them as the meer effects of the <hi>Despotick or Arbitrary Power</hi> of that <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or of the personal <hi>cunning</hi> of some men now living in <hi>France</hi>; I remember I heard one Gentleman say, that the <hi>French Genius was up,</hi> wherewith he gave himself and others good satisfaction: Others will have it, that the late
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34974:6"/>
Enemies of the <hi>French</hi> wanted <hi>Valor</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> but that if the <hi>French</hi> had the <hi>English</hi> to contend with, their Glory would soon be laid in the Dust: For the <hi>Dutch,</hi> there are those who will argue their <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Populacy</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to proceed from the <hi>peculiar Industry</hi> of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that such an Eternal Toil is not suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by any other; Others, to their small Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in <hi>Diet</hi> and <hi>Habit,</hi> others to particular Circumstances in the time and manner of their <hi>Defection</hi> from <hi>Spain;</hi> to their <hi>Register of Titles</hi> and <hi>Contracts,</hi> and their <hi>cheap</hi> and easie decision of <hi>Law-Suits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all other things we seem to be most <hi>secure</hi> in the matter of <hi>Trade;</hi> we have many who taking themselves to be <hi>born or intitled to so much a year in Land,</hi> do consider <hi>Trade</hi> as no otherwise necessary in a Nation, than to <hi>support younger Brothers,</hi> and are ready to thrust all <hi>Publique Taxes upon Trade,</hi> that they may ease the Land; Others who pretend to enquire into it, hear the Customs are much risen of late years, and then rest satisfied that we have a mightier <hi>Trade</hi> than ever: We have also some <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Shopkeepers</hi> who get Estates, and buy Land on a suddain, which is lookt upon as an Argument of a good <hi>Trade;</hi> We find their mighty and numerous <hi>Shops</hi> and <hi>Warehouses,</hi> full of goods, and do not hear them complain of <hi>Trade,</hi> Or that Land is brought <hi>to 14 or 16
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34974:6"/>
years</hi> purchase, or that they buy at a much <hi>abated yearly value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some, indeed, justly apprehending a <hi>Disease</hi> in our <hi>Trade,</hi> by the decay of our Home <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,</hi> and an excess of Forreign <hi>Importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> have judiciously expressed themselves in it; these Nations whilst in <hi>Embrio,</hi> have been <hi>ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leured</hi> by our Modern <hi>Drolls,</hi> in their new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of <hi>Plays.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are others, who with more <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Gravity,</hi> tell us, That the Notions of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Trade,</hi> are of a <hi>dangerous tendency,</hi> because they threaten part of the present Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of our <hi>Spiritual Courts,</hi> and the gain of many <hi>Offices,</hi> by some requisite Toleration of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and other mittigations relating to <hi>Trade,</hi> and upon this Occasion the same Objectors proceed to argue the Improvements of Trade to be of as bad Consequence to the <hi>State,</hi> by filling the Nation with Trading-Religious Dissenters, or by a necessary moderating of the present <hi>Custom Rates:</hi> They also insinuate, that we ought not to look for such a perfection of Trade under a <hi>Monarchical Government,</hi> but to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of our selves otherwise as we can; We have others that say, Trade is a <hi>misterious thing,</hi> and not intelligible in any part of it, without a long Apprentiship, and therefore wholly refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>private Traders;</hi> Others that 'tis <hi>Mechanical,</hi> and not Gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34974:7"/>But if it fall out that these are all mistaken Opinions, if <hi>Trade</hi> alone hath produced the afore-mentioned Effects in <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> If the rise and fall of <hi>Rents</hi> absolutely depend upon it; If <hi>Liberty and Property</hi> be made valuable by Trade only, and are not valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or safe without it; If a <hi>Nation</hi> may be made <hi>strong or weak</hi> by the meer different Operations of <hi>Trade;</hi> If the <hi>Taxing</hi> or burthening of <hi>Trade</hi> must reduce all Land-Revenues, if the <hi>easing</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> either in the particular Custom-Rates, or otherwise, will make the whole Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the <hi>Customs</hi> greater, or else much enhance all other publick as well as private Revenues; If a mighty Trade be consistent with a <hi>Monarchical Government?</hi> (where there is <hi>Property and Liberty:</hi>) If it be a false and officious <hi>Scandal</hi> to this form of Government, to affirm the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if <hi>England</hi> of all other Nations, be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally most capable of the Advantages of <hi>Trade,</hi> but yet the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>England</hi> of late years hath been <hi>Consumptive;</hi> If the late Policies of our Neighbour-Nations have rendred our <hi>old esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished</hi> Methods of <hi>Trade</hi> insufficient, If we have divers late <hi>innovated Obstructions</hi> in our <hi>Trade,</hi> if this hath caused an <hi>over-ballance of Forreign Importations,</hi> If our National Industry hath been imployed to enrich <hi>Forreigners,</hi> if our own Treasures have been <hi>exhausted</hi> by our own Trade, and will soon be swept away in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34974:7"/>
the present course of it, Nay, even notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our <hi>late Prohibition of French Goods,</hi> if the Objections against the enlarging and better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Trade arise from <hi>private Interests,</hi> in contradiction to the Publique, or from <hi>Passion</hi> or <hi>Humour,</hi> and if this be intelligible to every man of sense, that will take the pains to enquire into it. Then certainly it must follow,</p>
            <p>That it does much import all <hi>English Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Owners of Land,</hi> and others, who take themselves to be sharers in the <hi>National Interest</hi> to examine the past and present State of our <hi>Trade,</hi> and to seek for a <hi>legal Regulation</hi> of it; And that all <hi>private Interests</hi> destructive to our Trade ought to be relaxed, and given up for the future.</p>

               <hi>Private Interest</hi> is that many headed. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> I am chiefly to encounter with, in which if any particular person shall take himself to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, I shall desire him to consider, whether his own Condition would not be more truly <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and <hi>safe</hi> under more open Methods of <hi>Trade?</hi> I shall pray him to look into the nature of <hi>meer private Interest,</hi> which if he do, he must confess it the same Principle that leads men into <hi>Cheats, Thefts,</hi> and all those other base, mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and execrable <hi>Villanies,</hi> which render the Actors Criminous, and odious by the Sufferings and Injuries they bring upon others.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:34974:8"/>Then if any mans particular way of Gain be so prejudicial to Trade, as to occasion the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>Beggery</hi> of <hi>Thousands</hi> of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is not this more then equally mischievous to so many <hi>thousand</hi> Thefts? But what if this Beggery must unavoidably cause many thousand <hi>actual</hi> Thefts, nay <hi>Murders</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities</hi> of all kinds, and as it grows more Vniversal, must bring the Nation into an <hi>impotent</hi> and indefenseable <hi>weakness?</hi> Have we any amongst us that will be yet <hi>tenacious</hi> of such ways of Gain? Will they tell us that they are not punishable by any <hi>Laws</hi> in force? 'tis pity they are not.

            <argument>
               <p> Trade National or Private, Home or Forreign Treasures Imported by Trade, thence Land-Rents, Popularly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the Revenues of all Ranks of men depend upon Trade, People and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure make National Strength, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Advantages in Treasure, the difference between Ancient and Modern Wars, Navigation supported by Trade, this necessary for the Security of an Island, and therein the farther scope of the whole.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>TRade</hi> is either <hi>National or Private:</hi> The <hi>National Trade</hi> doth influence the Wealth and Strength of a <hi>whole Nation,</hi> and therefore is not the only Concern of <hi>Merchants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Private Trade</hi> hath regard to the particular Wealth of the Trader, and doth so far differ
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34974:9"/>
in the scope and design of it from the <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> that a private Trade may be very benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the private Trader, but of hurtful, nay of very ruinous Consequence to the whole Nation; as will appear.</p>
            <p>I shall speak of National Trade, which is properly divided into <hi>Home</hi> Trade, and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>The Home Trade in every Nation hath dependance on the Forreign Trade, if a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath no Gold or Silver-Mines within its own Territory, there is no practicable way of bringing <hi>Treasure</hi> into it (in times of Peace) but by Forreign Trade: And if such a Nation be not enriched by Imported Treasure, its Home Trade can only be managed by <hi>Exchange of Goods for Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if Treasure be Imported, then may its Home Trade be managed by buying and sell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from hence may the <hi>Lands</hi> in such a Nation come to yield a <hi>money Rent,</hi> which is the produce or profits of Land sold for <hi>money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Case the <hi>price of Home Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and consequently the yearly <hi>Rent of Lands</hi> in a Nation which hath <hi>populacy</hi> and <hi>property,</hi> will hold proportion with the quantity of the National Treasure; and will rise or fall as the Treasure does increase or diminish.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:34974:10"/>For where there is an increase of <hi>Treasure</hi> in a Nation which hath <hi>property,</hi> this will ordinarily diffuse amongst the people by the necessity and succession of <hi>Contracts</hi>; and then the people having universally more money than before, the <hi>Seller</hi> will not be so <hi>necessitous</hi> for money as before, and will have a greater <hi>choice of Chapmen,</hi> who will be more able and ready to buy.</p>
            <p>These numbers of Chapmen will inevitably raise the Market one upon the other, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable by common and undeniable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Fact; And therefore I shall lay it as a ground in Commerce, That the <hi>plenty of Chapmen,</hi> who have <hi>plenty of money,</hi> will cause a higher and quicker Market for any desireable Commodity, especially if the <hi>Seller</hi> be not so <hi>necessitous</hi> for money as to be forced to <hi>snap</hi> at the first offer.</p>
            <p>And that on the other side, where there be fewer Chapmen, who have less money, and the Sellers themselves are more necessitous, they must and will sell lower; This must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably happen in a Nation where there is little money.</p>
            <p>For instance, If there were but 500 <hi>l.</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>England,</hi> an Ox could hardly be worth a peny, nor could the Revenue of all <hi>England</hi> be 500 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> or not above;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:34974:10"/>It follows then, that a Forreign Trade (by increasing the National Treasure) will advance <hi>home Markets,</hi> and the value of <hi>Lands</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall admit that if a Nation can be <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in War,</hi> and can plunder the Conquered, some Treasures may happen to be Imported this way; But certainly those who consider it, will rather desire to be enriched by Trade than by War, since in the Course of Trade, far mightier Treasures may be gotten with <hi>Peace, Innocence, Security, and Happiness to the People,</hi> who cannot be Victorious in War without Bloodsheds, Rapines, Violences, and Perpetrations of all kinds; they also must be subject to perpetual difficulties and hazards in the hardships and event of War, which will disturb or subvert the Home Trade, nor can the Treasure of a People so imployed circulate in the Markets to any advantagious degree; or should we have any such <hi>Bravoes</hi> or <hi>Knights Errant</hi> as would rather purchase Wealth by Fighting than by Industry, yet are these imaginary Conquests absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable at this day without the assistance of Forreign Trade; as will be shewn.</p>
            <p>But first upon the former grounds I shall add, that a Forreign Trade (if managed to the best advantage) will yet further advance the values of Lands, by necessitating a vast
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34974:11"/>
               <hi>increase of people,</hi> since it must maintain great multitudes of people in the very business of Trade, which could not otherwise be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, (as will also further appear): All which having the Rewards of their Labours in their hands, will still enlarge the choice of Chapmen to the Sellers, and there being so many more persons to be fed and cloathed, there must be a far greater home Consumption of all the products of Land.</p>
            <p>And hence must arise a kind of Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongst the people who shall farm or purchase Land, when the Revenue of Land is certain, and grows higher daily, as the Treasure and People increase, which must cause Land to rise as well in the years purchase, as in the years value; nay, the very Earth must receive an inevitable <hi>Improvement</hi> by their Industrious numbers, whilst every one will be able and willing to possess and manure a greater or lesser part, according to his occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; there is hardly any Land in <hi>England</hi> but may be improved to double the value, and very much to treble and more.</p>
            <p>This necessary Improvement of Rent and Land is verified in the Forreign instance of <hi>Holland,</hi> and in such of our <hi>English</hi> Lands as lie near great and populous <hi>Corporations</hi>; And on the other side, we see that in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Turky,</hi> and also in such parts of <hi>England</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34974:11"/>
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> where there is little Trade, and fewer people, there lie great quantities of Land which yield little or no profit; and hence I conclude, That the Revenue and Value of Land will simpathize with the National Trade.</p>
            <p>There are indeed certain Ranks of Men of honourable and necessary Imployments and Professions in every Nation, whose Revenues do not so immediately arise from Trade; such are <hi>Officers</hi> greater and less, <hi>Lawyers, Physicians,</hi> and such like.</p>
            <p>But though these are not placed in the direct Channel of Trade, yet 'tis very plain they derive their Revenues from it; being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in their Grandure and Gains at the cost of the Land-Holders and Traders; who will be more capable and willing to give them greater Gratuities and Fees, when their own pockets are fuller; and as the People, Trade and Contracts do increase, there will be more Law-Suits and Diseases, and ordinarily more Fees and Gratuities, so will there be more Houses built, more Apparel made, and more Imployment of all sorts for <hi>Masons, Carpenters, Taylors,</hi> and men of all other middle and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Callings.</p>
            <p>And from hence it also follows, That a Forreign Trade managed to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, will make a <hi>Nation vastly stronger than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34974:12"/>
naturally it was,</hi> because money and people do ordinarily make National strength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Money</hi> is necessary for the purchasing of many Provisions for War by Land or Sea, as Arms, Victuals, Ammunition, materials for Shipping, and many others, which being got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet neither Souldiers nor Sea-men will now adventure themselves at the mouths of Cannon and Musket without pay, whereof the further Consequence is that the Prince and Nation which hath the greatest Treasure, will finally have the Victory, and probably with little or no fighting.</p>
            <p>For being enabled by their Treasure to keep themselves in <hi>a posture of War,</hi> they will oblige their Enemies to the like Expence, till their Enemies Treasures are exhausted, and then their <hi>Armies</hi> and also their <hi>Councils</hi> will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate.</p>
            <p>This shews the difference between the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> and <hi>present</hi> Course of <hi>War,</hi> for anciently the event of War was tried by frequent Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and generally succeeded as one Nation was Superior to the other in personal Strength and Roughness; But since the Wealth of the <hi>Indies</hi> came to be discovered and dispersed more and more, Wars are managed <hi>by much Treasure and little Fighting,</hi> and therefore with little hazard to the richer Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:34974:12"/>And hence also doth it appear that in the present condition of the World, it is in a manner impossible for a Nation to gain Riches by Conquest and Plunder, unless it hath first store of Treasure at Home, which cannot otherwise be gotten than by Forreign Trade.</p>
            <p>Also <hi>money</hi> will command the <hi>Service and Lives</hi> of any <hi>poorer and rougher Nation,</hi> It will purchase the <hi>Assistance</hi> of Forreign <hi>Princes,</hi> it will <hi>indear</hi> their great <hi>Ministers,</hi> open their <hi>Cabinets,</hi> engage true and close Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and <hi>poison</hi> their <hi>Councils:</hi> It will pass unseen through Rampiers, Fortifications, and Guards into Cities and Forts, and will sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them without the tedious hazards of Seiges; It will purchase Governors and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and like Lightning will consume the <hi>Heart</hi> of a poorer Nation, whilst its <hi>Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Outside</hi> shall remain fresh.</p>
            <p>So are <hi>people</hi> necessary to Guard the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and defend the Nation, who will be more or less true and serviceable to the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interest, as they have a greater or lesser <hi>share in it</hi>; he that hath somewhat of his own, and lives Comfortably, will stoutly defend the Nation against Invaders; But if a People be poor and miserable, their Condition being uneasie, it will be indifferent to them who is Conqueror; nay they will hope for a better Condition by turning the Tables; so is it of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34974:13"/>
dangerous Consequence that the People should become <hi>vitious,</hi> because it generally weakens their Bodies, Courages, or Faiths: In all which the excellency of a great and well regulated Forreign Trade may be discerned, since it will render the People Rich, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Virtuous; as will also appear.</p>
            <p>But Forreign Trade may bring a particular advantage to an <hi>Island</hi> by a great <hi>Navigation,</hi> without which its impossible for any Island long to defend it self against a Forreign Enemy potent in Shipping, for the <hi>Invaders</hi> circling an Island with their Ships, may sail from Place to Place, and Rob, Spoil and Kill, before the Natives can, by long Land-Marches, apply their Courage and Land-Forces to resist them; which must necessarily distract and weary out the most valiant People on the Earth: this hath been evident by many Demonstrations in <hi>England,</hi> which hath been often Conquered by Forreigners for want of a sufficient <hi>Naval Force,</hi> particularly by the <hi>Romans,</hi> nay by the <hi>Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi>; but hath more often repulsed Forreigners, whilst we have been most <hi>powerful at Sea</hi>; and therefore the constant Policies of this Kingdom have long aspired too, and enjoyed a <hi>Soveraignty of the Sea,</hi> and kept a narrow and jealous watch on Neighbour-Nations, least they should aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize their Naval Strengths.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The several kinds of Forreign Trade, of trading with Home or Forreign Navigation, some general Application.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT will be then proper to consider how a Forreign Trade may be driven to most Advantage for the increase of <hi>National Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, People, and Navigation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Forreign Trade may be driven by a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Forreign Navigation,</hi> or with <hi>Home Navigation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Forreign Trade driven with <hi>Forreign Navigation,</hi> is when a Nation sells its Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities at Home to such Forreigners as come thither to Buy and Export them.</p>
            <p>This sort of Forreign-Trade may enrich a Nation with Treasure more or less, as the Commodities so sold are of greater or lesser quantity and value.</p>
            <p>But it is very plain, that if the Natives had <hi>Exported</hi> the same Commodities to the same Forreigners in <hi>Shipping of their own,</hi> the same Commodities would have yielded a greater Rate in the Forreign Ports, because the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives must have been also paid for the <hi>Carriage</hi>; which by so much would have increased the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34974:14"/>
National Gain; wherefore it is more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for a Nation to Export its own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities by Navigation of its own.</p>
            <p>But it will not follow; that 'tis therefore necessary or fit to confine all Exportations to Home Navigation by Penal Laws, especially in <hi>England,</hi> as will be shewn.</p>
            <p>Nor does it follow that a Nation which doth Export its own Commodities, shall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes richer than another that sells at home; for the Commodities of one Nation sold at home may yield ten times more money at home, than the Commodities exported by the other shall yield abroad, and therefore must make it ten times richer.</p>
            <p>This may be verified in the Trade of <hi>France</hi>; whose Commodies sold at home to the <hi>Dutch, English,</hi> and others, for many years past, have brought vast quantities of money into <hi>France,</hi> perhaps more than all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations have gotten by their exported Commodities, by which means, and no other, <hi>France</hi> is become the Terrour of the World, as I shall more particularly and fully shew.</p>
            <p>A beneficial Forreign Trade, with home Navigation, may be said to be of two sorts:</p>
            <p>The one consists in the meer <hi>Exportation</hi> of home Commodities into Forreign Nations where they may be vended, of which I have spoken before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:34974:14"/>The other, in Trading and Huxtering <hi>from Port to Port.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The benefit of Trading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Huxtering from Port to Port consists in buying Commodities cheaper in one Forreign Port, and selling them dearer in some others; in which case the Nation Trading ordinarily gets more or less, in proportion, as the Merchants buy for less and sell for more, and as the Stock and Navigation imployed in this sort of Trade is more or less.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> being to buy much of their Victuals, Cloaths, and other necessaries from abroad, and having little Commodities of their own to Export, put themselves upon this Trading <hi>from Port to Port</hi>; which Trade they have improved to that degree, that they are become, as it were, the Common Carriers of the World, imploying near 30000 Trading-Vessels, (including those which belong to their Fishery.) In this way of Trade have this Industrious People yearly bought up vast quantities of <hi>French</hi> Manufactures and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and uttered them again for present profit in other parts of the World, not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing those dangers they have been bringing upon themselves and all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> have never attained to near so Universal Manufacture as the <hi>French,</hi> or so general a huxtering Trade as the <hi>Dutch</hi>; But
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34974:15"/>
yet until this last Age had a greater proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of each then the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>French</hi>; their Trade hath chiefly consisted in the Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own Commodities, and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures made of their own home Materials; of which that of our <hi>Wooll</hi> being the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, was long thought and really still is, or might be, the greatest and richest in the World; This, with our exported <hi>Tin, Lead, Iron, Allome, Fish,</hi> and other valuable things, brought in a sufficient quantity of Forreign Commodities to serve our National Occasions, Pomp and Ornament, and left an Annual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Imported Treasure, which in length of time had much enriched the Nation, though our neat Annual Gain by Forreign Trade did never bring in much above 250000 <hi>l.</hi> or 300000 <hi>per annum</hi> increase of Treasure, one year with another (taking any number of 20 years together) as may be reasonably collected by what will follow; nor was that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Gain (as the Trade of this part of the World formerly stood) since it had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred this Kingdom as Rich and Happy at home, and as formidable abroad, as any in <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>Of Forreign Trade consisting in Exportation, of the advantages of home Manufactures, and Manufactures, incidently other home Trades and Imployments are considered; and which of them enrich a Nation; of the Fishing-Trade, and the annual exporting of Corn.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe National Gain, by Forreign Trade, consisting either in vending home Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modies to Forreigners, or in Trading from Port to Port; It may be fit to be considered how these branches of Trade may be improved to the utmost.</p>
            <p>Home Commodities vendible and exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Forreigners, are either such as are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of little or no <hi>Manufacture,</hi> as Coals, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Or else such as may be manufactured, which may be called the <hi>Principals or Materials</hi> of Manufacture; such are Wooll, Silk, Flax, Hemp, Tin, Iron, Skins, Corn, and others.</p>
            <p>Most materials of Manufacture are of small value whilst raw and unwrought, at least in Comparison of the Manufacture, since by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture they may be made of five, ten, or twenty times their first value, according to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34974:16"/>
the <hi>Workmanship</hi>; which is proved by the Woollen, Silk and Linnen Manufactures, and almost infinite others; wherefore if a Nation hath naturally any Materials of Manufacture, it is far more advantagious to Export them in Manufacture, rather than the raw Materials, because the Manufacture is so much more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, and will make a return of five, ten, or twenty times more <hi>Treasure</hi> to the Nation than the raw Materials.</p>
            <p>Besides, it is most dangerous to Export the Materials of Manufacture, since it may transfer the Manufacture it self into some Neighbour Nation, and with it the incident Riches and Populacy; by which means a Neighbour-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may become five ten, or twenty times richer and stronger than that Nation which doth Export its Materials, and those innocent Materials may in a short time return in the shape of <hi>armed Men and Ships,</hi> to the Terror and Confusion of an unwise and lazy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>But if Forreigners will vend their <hi>raw</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of Manufacture, it is necessary, or highly convenient for a Nation to Import them, and put them into Manufacture at home; after which, this Manufacture may be either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and sold for much more than the Materals cost, or being used at home, will prevent the necessity of <hi>Importing</hi> the like
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34974:16"/>
from abroad, by which the Nation will <hi>save</hi> to the value of the Manufacture: Thus do the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> manufacture Forreign Silk, <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Wooll, and many other Forreign Materials, which they Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and sell again with prodigious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>sorts</hi> of Manufacture are so various, and almost infinite, that there is no People so great or numerous but may be universally imployed by it; There are many which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to <hi>Eating and Drinking,</hi> many more to <hi>Apparel</hi> of all sorts, Furniture of <hi>Houses, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, Navigation, War, Literature</hi> and <hi>Science,</hi> unnecessary, but acceptable <hi>Toyes,</hi> to gratifie the humors and follies of Men, Women, and Children, under all which generals, there are so many <hi>species</hi> of Manufactures, that the very naming of them would make a Volume, some are of <hi>simple</hi> Materials, some of <hi>mixt.</hi>

            <p>The Labours of the People bestowed this way, must necessarily glomerate the Riches of the World, and must render any Nation a prodigy of Wealth; for whilst vast numbers of Manufacturers are thus continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the value of some Commodities or other, they work for the <hi>Nation</hi> where they live as well as for themselves; If 100000 Manufacturers get 6 <hi>l. per annum</hi> a piece, the Nation must gain or save 600000 <hi>l. per annum</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:34974:17"/>
by their Labours, (supposing the Materials to be meliorated only to the value of their <hi>Wages</hi>;) If the number of the Manufacturers be greater, or if the same number gain more a piece, then is the National gain still greater and greater in proportion: All which is too evident in the present instance of <hi>France,</hi> and the contrary in that of <hi>Spain,</hi> which although supplied with the Wealth of the <hi>Indies,</hi> is, for want of home Manufactures, the poorest and weakest of all Nations, and the most <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For by Manufactures, a Nation may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port many hundred thousands of Families, besides the meer Tillers of Lands and Keepers of Cattel, with increase of <hi>people</hi> shall live well, without being a clog and vexation to the Landholders, and shall be highly beneficial to the rest of the Natives in times of Peace, as otherwise they will not be; and as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple increase, so may the kinds and quantities of Manufacture; the very <hi>Women and Children</hi> may ordinarily get good Livelihoods in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture.</p>
            <p>Hence must follow a sweet Harmony in a Nation which hath property, when every ones Hand and Head is imployed, and when there comes a reciprocation of advantage to the Landholders, and all others, as necessarily there must; And as Manufacture seems a kind
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34974:17"/>
of <hi>debt</hi> to the <hi>laborious</hi> part of the people, who by nature are intitled to live; so it is the highest of all <hi>Charities</hi>; as it is most substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and universal; What signifies the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of a little <hi>broken meat</hi> amongst a few Wretches, in Comparison of the support of hundreds of thousands of Families? And lastly, it is attended with the promised Rewards of Charity, <hi>viz. Plenty, Glory, and Prosperity to a whole Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, and what hath been said in the last Section, may administer occasion to consider what sorts of Trades, Imployments, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions do <hi>add to the Riches of a Nation, and what not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident that all sorts of home Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures must advance or save the National Wealth, the like may be said of those who are imployed in the <hi>Fishing-Trade,</hi> so may the Trade and Profession of a <hi>Merchant</hi> add to the National Riches.</p>
            <p>There are another sort of home-Traders, who live meerly by <hi>buying cheaper and selling dearer at home,</hi> such are <hi>Retailers</hi> of all sorts in the City and Country, whom we call <hi>Shopkeepers</hi>; of which a convenient number are necessary in every Nation to keep open <hi>Marts and Markets</hi> for the vending of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; These may advance their private Stocks and Estates by buying cheaper and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34974:18"/>
selling dearer, but cannot (meerly by this way of Trade) add a peny to the National Riches, so that it may truly be said of one poor Manufacturer, that he adds more in a year to the Wealth of the Nation than all such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailers and Shop-keepers in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if these Shop-keepers deal over-much in <hi>Consumptive Forreign Wares,</hi> they may assist in the <hi>beggary</hi> of the Nation; so may the Trade of a Merchant <hi>export and exhaust</hi> the National Riches, if he trade over-much in meer <hi>Consumptive Importations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore though the <hi>gain</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons imployed be one main end and design of all Trades and Imployments, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect they are all alike; Yet they differ in this; That in some of them the persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed do immediately or ultimately gain money from <hi>Forreigners</hi>; But in the other, they gain from the <hi>people,</hi> and from <hi>one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the last sort, are all Imployments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>Law and Physick,</hi> so are <hi>Offices</hi> of all kinds (which I do not say to insinuate any of these Imployments to be <hi>useless</hi> in a Nation, or to diminish from that due respect which ought to be given to Men of Place.) There is no question but they are highly necessary for the Regulation of the Body-Politick, and the Body-Natural; so are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34974:18"/>
the <hi>Clergy</hi> for the Information of Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; and therefore in every Nation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient numbers of the people ought to be set apart for these purposes; But as far as they are <hi>Imployments,</hi> and intended for <hi>private gain,</hi> 'tis plain they add no Treasure to the Nation, but only enable the persons so imployed to share and heap up the Treasures already Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; The like may be said of all other ways of living by meer <hi>Literature and the Pen,</hi> and some inferior In-land Imployments mentioned before; It must therefore be of dangerous Consequence if the Trade of a Nation run into over-much <hi>Shop-keeping,</hi> or if too many of the people withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from Manufactures, and the beneficial parts of Trade, should throng themselves into the <hi>Clergy, Law, Physick, Literature,</hi> and such other Professions as bring no <hi>increase</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Riches; And the rather, because these Imployments and Professions are <hi>narrow,</hi> and can support but a <hi>few</hi> Families in a Nation with convenience; so that it may endanger <hi>Depopulation,</hi> and by their numbers will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice one another; Whereas Manufacture and a great Forreign Trade, will admit of and oblige an increase of people even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity: And the more the Manufacturers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, they will the more enrich one another, and the rest of the people; It may then be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34974:19"/>
proper to inquire how the <hi>Manufactures</hi> of a Nation may be <hi>increased and improved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may be done either by enlarging for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Manufactures, or by introducing new ones.</p>
            <p>New Manufactures must be first taught, and then encouraged, and if made of Forreign Materials, the Materials must be Imported, after which, as the people find the sweet of their Labours, it is not to be questioned but that they will throng into the Imployment; they that want Bread, Cloathes, and other necessary Comforts, will be glad to obtain them honestly; Thus our King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third (a Wise and Victorious Prince) invited over the <hi>Flemmings</hi> to teach his Subjects the Woollen Manufacture; And thus have the <hi>French</hi> Policies invited over the most Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Manufacturers into <hi>France</hi> from all parts of the World; these with their Schollars were first imployed at the Charge of the Government; But the Manufactures soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diffused into the gross Body of the people.</p>
            <p>Without these primary Encouragements and Superintendence of the Government, it will be hard to nourish up any new Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, or to enlarge any old ones, at least, suddenly, to any great degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34974:19"/>Amongst the Exportations, the <hi>Fishing-Trade</hi> ought not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, since,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, <hi>pa.</hi> 268, 269, 270. computes the whole profit of this Fishery to be ten millions sterling: <hi>per annum,</hi> in a manner, all gained by other Nations.</note> according to modern Calculations, the meer Fishing-Trade for <hi>Herring and Cod</hi> on the Coasts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> imploys above 8000 <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships or Vessels, 200000 of their Sea-men, and Fishers; And the Herrings and Cod sold by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in Forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, do bring an Annual profit of about 5000000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Sterling to that Nation: besides which, 'tis accounted that there are at least 25000 people more imployed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at Home about this particular Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, making of Fishing-Nets, and the curing, ordering, and preparing of the Fish, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>Island, Newfound-Land,</hi> and <hi>Green-land,</hi> fishings of very great advantage.</p>
            <p>But the ordinary Exportation of <hi>Corn</hi> out of the <hi>Annual increase,</hi> hath been accounted most dangerous, and of all others the most unprofitable, because of the possibility of a dearth; which besides the hardships of it, will give opportunity to Forreigners of drawing away vast Treasures in a trice.</p>
            <p>But if a Nation doth <hi>store</hi> up Corn in cheap years, the people will be secure against a Dearth, and yet when Corn is excessive dear

in Neighbour-Nations, may then take their time to furnish them, and by that means will make much greater Advantages than by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Exportation; And for this reason have the modern Policies of some wise Nations in Trade, contrived and erected <hi>publick Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses or Conservatories for Corn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall conclude with the words of Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rawleigh,</hi> in his excellent Observations upon Trade, presented to King <hi>James.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>Of Forreign Trade from Port to Port, the Nature and Advantage of it, differs from meer Carriage, and meer Importation; the necessity of a Home Storehouse: The ordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of Money or Bullion, of dangerous Consequence; how to be avoided: The Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Trade, and Trade from Port to Port are the Nursery and Support of Sea-men, and Sea-Towns; The Condition of Ours; The National Advantages of <hi>England</hi> for all sorts of Trade, yet hath the least share.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>SInce the Trade from <hi>Port to Port</hi> will cause a great <hi>Navigation,</hi> and also bring in very much <hi>Treasure,</hi> and therefore if it be added to the Trade of <hi>Exportation,</hi> must render a Nation the Miracle of Riches and Power; I shall next consider what this Trade from Port to Port really consists in, and by what methods it may be driven most advantagiously to a Nation.</p>
            <p>A Trade from <hi>Port to Port</hi> may be most properly so called, when a Merchant of one Nation buying Goods in another, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty becomes his, and he carries them to a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34974:21"/>
third Forreign Market on his own account; thus the <hi>Dutch</hi> buy up, Export and sell the <hi>French</hi> Manufactures and Commodities; But if a <hi>Dutch</hi>-man carry <hi>French</hi> Goods to be sold in a Forreign Market, on a <hi>French mans account,</hi> taking a certain Rate for the Hire of his Ship; this is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Trade from Port to Port, but is <hi>meer Carriage</hi>; which sort of Imployment (though it may seem least Reputable) may increase the National Treasure, as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation used in it is more or less, and may imploy many Sea-men.</p>
            <p>A Trade from Port to Port doth also differ from <hi>meer Importation,</hi> which is, when the Merchant does Import Consumptive Commodities, which are spent at Home, in which case, if the Importations are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive,</hi> it may truly be called <hi>The Disease of Trade,</hi> since it must cause an Exportation of the National Stock of Treasure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may soon ruine a Nation, as will be shewn; But so cannot a Trade from Port to Port, truly so called, because the Goods bought being sold or bartered off, at other Forreign Ports, must be ultimately converted into more and more money, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the home Treasure.</p>
            <p>This Trading from Port to Port, does not wholly consist in the Carriage of a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34974:22"/>
Commodity from one Port directly to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor can be so driven to any great, or ordinary Advantage; for the Merchants thus Imployed, must either Trade <hi>little,</hi> or else must <hi>glut</hi> the Ports they go to with an over-great quantity of Goods of the same kind; and therefore for the full Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Trade from Port to Port, it is generally necessary, That the Merchants should first unlade at Home, which will inevitably render a Nation so Trading a compleat and mighty <hi>Storehouse</hi> of all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Manufactures and Commodities; and then from this infinite Miscellany of Goods (as the Merchants observe their time for a Market and the Ports they go to) they may freight their Ships with such <hi>sortible Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Cargoes,</hi> as are proper and vendible to advantage; Thus are the <hi>Dutch</hi> Provinces become the mighty <hi>Storehouse</hi> of the World;<note place="margin">See Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s Book of the <hi>Dutch Cap. of Trade,</hi> pag. 210.232.</note> the Plenties of the World do grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in other Countries, but there are the Stores, and thence do their Merchants furnish themselves for all sorts of Voyages;
<q>Thus they Transport the Merchandizes of <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Turky,</hi> the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies</hi> to the East and North-East Countries of <hi>Pomerland, Sprusland, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34974:22"/>
Poland, Denmark, Norway, Liefland, Swedeland, Germany</hi>; and the Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of the last mentioned Kingdoms they transport into the Southern and Western Nations,</q> as Sir <hi>Walter Raileigh</hi> long since noted, nor is a Trade from Port to Port practicable, or can be improved to any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable or valuable degree, unless the Nation be made an universal Storehouse.</p>
            <p>In the Trade from Port to Port there must be some kinds of <hi>Original Exportation,</hi> because the Merchant cannot purchase Forreign Goods in a Forreign Port for nothing.</p>
            <p>And one would think it should hardly be a question, whether in this way of Trade it be most profitable to a Nation <hi>to Export Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, or other home Commodities, or Money, or Bullion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of late years many of our Merchants very much contend for a Liberty to Export Money or Bullion as advantagious to the Trade of the Nation,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
               </note> and have gotten an Act of Parliament to Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the exporting of Bullion, contrary to many other former Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and now Bullion and Money also are become our usual exportable Commodities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:34974:23"/>But I shall oppose the ordinary Exporting of Money or Bullion in Trade, especially as the Constitution of our Trade now is, for the Reasons following:</p>
            <p>First, I shall admit that the exporting of Treasure in the Trade from Port to Port may increase Treasure, provided that the Merchant makes wise Bargains, and his Ships return safe, neither of which is altogether certain; But supposing the Merchant be both so wise and fortunate, yet 'tis very plain that in this way of Trade the Merchant cannot bring more new Treasure to the <hi>Nation</hi> than the Merchant by his judicious and prosperous dealing and Voyage can <hi>Add</hi> to the Original Sum he <hi>carried out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But had the <hi>Merchant</hi> taken off and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the same value in home <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture or Commodity,</hi> 'tis as plain that the very vending or bartering of that Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture or Commodity, would have been a farther Gain to the <hi>Nation,</hi> to the full value of the Manufacture or Commodity exported; since the Manufacture or home Commodity sold would finally resolve into Treasure, nay, though the <hi>Merchant</hi> gain but little or nothing in this case, yet the <hi>Nation</hi> must be a Gainer to the value of the Manufacture or other Commodity exported.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:34974:23"/>As suppose a <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>English</hi> Ship go with exported Treasure to <hi>France,</hi> where the Merchant buys <hi>French</hi> Wine for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> which afterwards he carries into the <hi>Sound,</hi> and there sells it for 1300 <hi>l.</hi> the Merchant hath brought but 300 <hi>l.</hi> new Treasure or Credit to the <hi>Nation</hi>; But had the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Exported Herrings or home Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, and by Sale or Barter of his Fish or Manufacture had purchased the same quantity of Wines, which afterwards he sold for 1300 <hi>l.</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> must presently have a new Addition of Treasure or Credit for the whole 1300 <hi>l.</hi> In which last Case the <hi>Nation</hi> gets a new 1000 <hi>l.</hi> by the labours of the Fishers or Manufacturers, besides the 300 <hi>l.</hi> got by the Merchant; if the Merchant had got nothing, yet the <hi>Nation</hi> had gained 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In this last Case great numbers of Manufacturers, Fishers, &amp;c. are kept and well maintained at Home, whereas the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Exportation of Money must make them idle and useless; whereof the further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is, that the ordinary Exportation of Money must inevitably <hi>depopulate</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it be of any great extent of Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; so must the Exportation of Bullion be attended with the same mischiefs for the same reasons: The Exportation of Bullion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34974:24"/>
does also open a way for the Exporting of Coined Treasure, without any hazards of Seizure, by <hi>melting</hi> down the most valuable Coin into Bullion.</p>
            <p>But I expect to be told that <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Holland, &amp;c.</hi> do allow of and use the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Treasure.</p>
            <p>To which I Answer, That there is no parallel between such Countries as these and <hi>England</hi>; For these are little Territories, much consisting of Merchants, their Agents, Factors, and Dependents, who live by meer Merchandize, that the rest of the people being but few (in Comparison of what are necessary to people so great and fertile a Nation as <hi>England</hi>) may be supported with much fewer and lesser Manufactures and home Employments; and therefore that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of Treasure must be less dangerous, and perhaps may be the more necessary there, because by the fewness of people, and consequential restraint of Manufactures, their Merchants may be confined in the bulk and variety of home Commodities to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>If it be said that no Nation can be so stored with home Commodities, as to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all Forreign Ports and Markets, and therefore that it may be sometimes necessary to Export Treasure in every trading Nation;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34974:24"/>
This perhaps may be true in some degree; But this is another question; and in the mean time it remains that it is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to a Nation to Export home Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities (where it may be done) rather than Money or Bullion, and therefore that the Merchants ought to be restrained from it as much as it is possible.</p>
            <p>Then as to the other question, how far it may be <hi>necessary</hi> in a Nation to Export Money in Trade, It must depend upon the greater or lesser Improvement of the National Trade.</p>
            <p>For as a Nation hath a more universal Manufacture and Fishery, more Drinks, Fruits, Curiosities, and Delicacies of its own, its Merchants will be more and more enabled to Fraight themselves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with home Commodities; These mighty Stores of home Commodities can only be had in great fertile and populous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But suppose a Nation be not, or cannot be so fully stored with home Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities as to Answer all Forreign Markets, yet its Merchants first Exporting home Commodities to Ports where they are Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, may by a Barter, Sale, or Exchange of these, and an eternal Succession of Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and Contracts make the Nation where
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34974:25"/>
they live a <hi>Storehouse</hi> to Perfection; and will then have the choice of all Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes on the Earth to Export; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may ordinarily and beneficially Trade to any Forreign Port without exporting Treasure; And if they may, they will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause else they will loose the benefit of the Market for the goods they may Export; Thus even the <hi>Dutch</hi> originally Exporting Herring, Cod, Earthen Wares, Woollen Cloth, Linnen, and of late Silks, and other home Commodities, and having by the Barter or Sale of these compleated their home Storehouse, can ordinarily buy at Foreign Markets, without Exporting Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; By this means are the <hi>Dutch</hi> enabled to Trade as they do to <hi>Swedeland, Liefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> where by selling or bartering of their own and Forreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, they provide themselves with the materials of Pitch, Tar, Hemp and Flax, necessary for Navigation, and with Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and other Commodities, for their use at Home, and Trade abroad, whilst the same Commodities cost the <hi>English</hi> some 100000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> since the decay of our Cloth-Trade into those Ports; which kind of Trade is doubtless advantagious to some Merchants (else they would not continue it;) But does help to drain the Nation of its Treasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:34974:25"/>I do not say they <hi>Dutch</hi> never Export Treasure, but that by reason of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Storehouse they are under no such ordinary necessity to do it; and in fact Export little or none to many other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where the <hi>English</hi> Trade with much: whereof I shall have occasion to say more.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude, that where the Home and Forreign Trade of a great and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Nation is duly Regulated, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Improved, there will be little necessity to <hi>Export Treasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I shall add, That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of Treasure in a Nation, having ill methods of Trade, must be yet more dangerous, because it facilitates <hi>meer Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> is chiefly serviceable to it, as will appear.</p>
            <p>If a Trade from Port to Port be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to any great degree, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily very much increase the National Treasure, and numbers of people, especially <hi>Sea-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If 20000 Trading Vessels add 300 <hi>l. per annum</hi> a piece to the National Stock yearly, the yearly National Gain must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 6000000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and so in any greater or lesser proportion, as the Navigation or Gain is greater or less; of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34974:26"/>
which we have a plain Example in the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who in about Ninety years time have arrived to a wonderful Wealth and Strength by it, though they have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways forced to buy much of their Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Materials of Clothing, all their Materials of Shipping, and many other chargeable Necessaries from Forreigners, which must be a prodigious Annual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Fishing-Trade</hi> is one great and certain <hi>Nursery of Sea-men,</hi> and brings Wealth and Comfort to <hi>Sea-Towns</hi>; But a Flourishing Trade from Port to Port will make better and more Sea-men, inrich Sea-Towns more, and will Imploy very considerable numbers of people at Land, in Building, Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing, Repairing; and other ordering of the Shipping, Tackle, and Goods Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and Exported, besides the Merchants and their more immediate Dependants; Thus do we see the Towns upon our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Shores abound in Riches and People, whilst our own Sea-Towns languish more and more.</p>
            <p>And from hence it may appear, that for the utmost advance of this Trade, it is necessary there should be very much Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in a Nation, multitudes of Sea-men, great Stocks continually imployed in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34974:26"/>
great numbers of Merchants, and lastly safe Ports and Harbours.</p>
            <p>I shall end this with some retrospect to the last Section, by observing, that no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World is naturally so adapted for a mighty Trade of all sorts as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Because it hath more excellent <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commodities</hi> than any one Nation in the World, as Copper, Lead, Iron, Tin, Allome, Copperas, Saffron, Fell, the mighty Commodity of Wooll, Corn, convertible into Beer, and Transportable, besides near 100 others, which are capable of near 1000 sorts of Manufactures, as Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> observes.</p>
            <p>That it is one of the most <hi>Fertile</hi> of Kingdoms, and therefore out of its own Stores might support almost infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people both for Manufactures at home, and Trade abroad, especially as the Island might be improved.</p>
            <p>That it hath more and safer <hi>Ports</hi> and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours than almost all the Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> put together.</p>
            <p>That it is <hi>better scituated</hi> for the Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western Trades than any other Nation.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Herring and Cod,</hi> with which the <hi>Dutch</hi> drive so mighty a Trade, are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34974:27"/>
caught in our <hi>English</hi> Seas, upon our own Coasts and Shores, and may be managed with more ease and advantage by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> than by any other Nation.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, That our <hi>People</hi> are strong and able for Work at Home, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and adventurous abroad, and such as all the rest of the World <hi>have</hi> most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted to commerce with, and naturally as ingenious, industrious, and willing to labour as any part of Mankind, so long as they can have a reasonable fruit of their Labours, which hath been evidenced by many former undeniable Experiences.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all which Advantages, <hi>England</hi> hath had very few considerable Manufactures, some of which are lost, and the rest decaying; nor have we any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable remaining Trade from Port to Port, or Fishing-Trade, of which there are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less some Reasons and Causes very fit to be understood and regulated, since the <hi>Wealth, Strength, Happiness and Safety of England</hi> immediately depend upon it; I shall therefore in the three next ensuing Sections give an Account of such particular <hi>Obstructions in our Trade,</hi> as have fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my notice.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="section">
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:34974:27"/>
            <head>SECT. V. </head>
            <argument>
               <p>That our Home and Forreign Market is Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and prejudiced by extraordinary and unequal Charges, and Cloggs in our Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize above what are in our Neighbour-Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> In the building and furniture of our Ships, Victuals, Sea-mens Wages, Customs, Interest-Money, &amp;c. with the Consequences in our Manufactures and Forreign Trade; more particularly of the decay of our Woollen Manufacture: our Exportations now confined to our Importations and Imported Treasure, how to be enlarged, our casual dependence on the Trade of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>SUpposing this or any other Nation had all the aforesaid Grounds of Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> All sorts of Home and Forreign Materials of Manufacture, sufficient numbers of People, and those instructed in Manufacture, supposing them never so industrious, that there were no want of Ships, Sea-men, or Stocks of Money, Ports or Plenties at home, yet there is another thing necessary, which is a <hi>good and quick Vent and Market</hi> for Commodities; without which all Manufactures will decay and expire, all other Exportations must fail, and the Trade
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34974:28"/>
from Port to Port can be no longer practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or valuable.</p>
            <p>For if the Manufacturer cannot sell his Manufacture, he hath laboured to his great loss; so if a Merchant buy Goods at one For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Port which he cannot sell at another Forreign Port, he hath at least lost his Voyage, and the Charge of it; so if the Market be not absolutely closed up, yet if it be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced and spoiled to any great degree, the Merchant or Manufacturer will either dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue presently, or will Trade less and less, and will fling up speedily if the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket doth not mend; for if men of Trade cannot sell for reasonable profit, but will be forced to live much worse and poorer than other men of the like degree and estate in the same Nation, they will not continue long in so unprofitable a Toil.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Home</hi> and <hi>Forreign Market</hi> bear such a Simpathy one with the other, that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions in the Market at home, may arise from Obstructions in the Forreign Market, as well as immediately from Causes at home.</p>
            <p>For if the Forreign Market for Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commodities fail in any degree, there must be a less and worse Vent and Market at home for these Commodities; if the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Market come to take off a <hi>lesser quantity</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:34974:28"/>
yearly than before, or at a <hi>lesser price,</hi> the Natives must sell a lesser quantity, and at a lesser price, to their Exporters and Merchants, who will not buy more than they can Vend again, nor so dear that they cannot vend them with sufficient profit.</p>
            <p>Now the course of our <hi>English</hi> Forreign Merchandize hath begotten an Obstruction in the Forreign Market, because our Merchants are liable to <hi>greater Charges</hi> in their way of Trade than the Merchants of our Neighbour Nations.</p>
            <p>For all necessary Charge of the Merchant in his course of Trade is super-added to the Original Cost of his Commodity, so that the Merchant, upon sale of the Commodity Exported, is under an Obligation to pay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self his Charge, and yet to sell so, that he may make himself a reasonable gainer besides.</p>
            <p>Then if a Forreign Merchant bring the same Manufacture or Commodity to the same Forreign Port with less charge, he will be able to under-sell the <hi>English</hi>-Merchant as much as his charge is less, and yet shall get rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable profit.</p>
            <p>And if the Merchants of other Nations be able to sell for less, they will, nay perhaps must, (supposing that they drive an open Trade, and upon their distinct Stock) for then being incapable of <hi>combining</hi> to Impose prizes,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34974:29"/>
and desiring a quick Market (which is the life of Trade,) they will be worked down by the Forreign Buyers to take as moderate profit for their Goods as they can afford then at.</p>
            <p>The Consequence of this is, that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Merchant must either forbear Exporting, or else must sink his prizes on the <hi>English</hi> Manuactures, whereby the <hi>English</hi> Manufactures must be stifled or discouraged.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, That if Nation hath some rich and necessary Material and Manufacture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it self, exclusive to other Nations, it hath the <hi>Monopoly</hi> of this Manufacture to the rest of the World, and therefore cannot be under-sold, but may vend it so as to pay all extraordinary Charges with sufficient gain to the Manufacturer and Merchant; which was heretofore the Case of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Woollen Manufacture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if a Manufacture or Commodity be common to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> or <hi>French</hi> can bring this Manufacture or Commodity cheaper to a third Forreign Port than the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> or <hi>French</hi> under-selling the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> will beat the <hi>English</hi> out of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture; It is accompted that the odds of two <hi>per cent.</hi> nay of one <hi>per cent.</hi> will produce this advantage.</p>
            <p>An inequality of Charge on Merchandize
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34974:29"/>
must also influence the Trade from Port to Port; For if the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant coming to the same Port with the same For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commodity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Dutch</hi> can ordinarily under-sell the <hi>English</hi>; it must also be of the same Consequence in this sort of Trade.</p>
            <p>This happens to be the Case between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> being upon their defection from <hi>Spain,</hi> driven into great Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, and therefore becoming studious and emulous how to advance their Trade, have contrived all imaginable ways how to <hi>Trade cheap,</hi> whose Example other Neighbouring-States and Kingdoms have followed in a great degree, and the <hi>French</hi> amongst the rest, whilst the <hi>English</hi> do not only proceed in their former more chargeable methods of Trade, but have clogged their Navigation and Merchants more and more, whereof I shall give some Instances, and shall leave the Computation of the odds to the Reader.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Dutch</hi> have found and long used such a way of <hi>building</hi> their ordinary Trading <hi>Ships</hi> and <hi>Vessels,</hi> that they will sail with eight or ten men, when an <hi>English</hi> built Ship of about the same Burthen shall not sail without near thirty men, so that the <hi>English</hi> Merchant must ordinarily be at more Charge for <hi>Wages</hi> and <hi>Victuals</hi> by two Thirds than the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>English Customs</hi> for Forreign
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34974:30"/>
Goods Imported and Re-exported (though half the Customs paid are returned upon Re-exportation) are near twenty times greater than the <hi>Dutch</hi> Customs, and for home Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities Exported, if not for all, are greater than the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Customs, which does work a further Charge on the <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. For,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By this means our <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are ordinarily forced to keep near a fourth part of their Stocks dead at home to answer Customs, so that a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant may drive the same Trade with a much less Stock.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The late <hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> and the Act of 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. confining the <hi>English</hi> Trade to Shipping built with <hi>English Timber</hi> (which is now exceeding scarce and dear.) The <hi>Dutch, French, Danes, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers, &amp;c.</hi> can have Ship-Timber in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, France</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> for less than half the price of ours. So by means of the same Acts of Navigation, have the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> their Cordage, Masts, Sails, Tackle, Pitch and Tar, (being all necessary and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ingredients of Navigation) very much cheaper than the <hi>English,</hi> so that the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Danes,</hi> nay, almost any other of our Neighbours, can build and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel a Ship, or fit up and repair, at a less charge by half than the <hi>English</hi> can do; the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34974:30"/>
reason of this is more at large Discoursed by Mr. <hi>Roger Cooke</hi> in his late Ingenious Treatises <hi>Of Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Fifthly, By means of the late <hi>Irish Acts</hi> against Importation of Cattel,<note place="margin">18 Car. 2. Cap. 2. &amp; 20 Car. 2. Cap.</note> the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> can and do <hi>Victual</hi> their Ships cheaper with <hi>Irish</hi> Victuals than the <hi>English</hi> can do in <hi>England,</hi> whereas before, <hi>England</hi> could Victual cheaper than any Nation in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, The <hi>English</hi> pay 6 <hi>per Cent. Interest for Money,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> but 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> or less,<note place="margin">Note, no Interest is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> which is to our <hi>English</hi> Merchants of a strange ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if we consider our extraordinary Charges in Victuals, Wages, Shipping, and the money kept dead to answer Customs, besides the Interest of the Stock actually imployed in Merchandize and Wars; for the Interest, with Interest upon Interest running up continually, does still increase the Charge and Clogg upon our Merchants, but especially must disable us to make <hi>England</hi> a Storehouse of Forreign Goods, since although they should be bought and Imported as cheap as in <hi>Holland,</hi> they must yet become dearer for Re-exportation by the odds in the Interest; if the Annual Interest <hi>per Cent.</hi> were the same, yet the odds
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34974:31"/>
in the Stock imployed would produce a vast odds in the Interest.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Act of Navigation obliging us to sail with ¾ of our <hi>English Sea-men</hi> (of which we have but a few in Comparison of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have at least ten times more than we) hath given occasion to our Sea-men to raise their Wages: To all which may be added our present Charge of Passes, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that any Forreign Nation can Trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Passes,</hi> or procure them for less money; the like may be said of our late Charge of <hi>Ballastage, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay the <hi>Dutch</hi> are so curious, that for more cheapness and convenience, they build Ships of <hi>divers makes, sorts of Timber, and manner of Tackling,</hi> for almost every Trade: whereas the <hi>English</hi> build or use but one sort, and that the most chargeable.</p>
            <p>Suppose then, that the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> should both Manufacture Silk, Linnen, Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, &amp;c. and that an <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant buying up these <hi>Manufactures</hi> at the same Rate at Home, should Export them to a third Port where they are Vendible, 'tis plain that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant being at less charge by at least two thirds for Wages and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, at less charge for Customs or Port-Duties, at a less charge by half in building and fitting up his Ship, and being so much eased in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34974:31"/>
Interest of money, and other the said particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars', may under-sell the <hi>English</hi> Merchant a great many times 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But much more will he be able to under-sell the <hi>English</hi> Merchant in the Trade from <hi>Port to Port,</hi> because of the excessive height of our Customs for Goods Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and Re-export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> in his time, observes, That if an <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Ship of 200 Tun a piece be at <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick,</hi> the <hi>Hollander</hi> should serve the Merchant cheaper by 100 <hi>l.</hi> than the <hi>English,</hi> being sailed with nine or ten Mariners, but ours with thirty, yet our <hi>English</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters keep their old way of building to this day, and know no other.</note> or if an <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant go directly from one Port to another, he will still lie under the other in equalities of Charge.</p>
            <p>Nor are the <hi>English</hi> for the same Reason capable of any Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>meer Carriage</hi> for any Forreigners, unless, perhaps, during the Convulsions of a War amongst other Nat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons.</p>
            <p>And for the same Reasons the <hi>English</hi> can never drive any considerable <hi>Fishing-Trade,</hi> though we pay no Custom for Fish.</p>
            <p>This cheapness of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and other Forreign Navigation and Trading, doth not only give advantage and preference to their own Manufactures, but to the Manufactures of all other Nations where there is an open, free and reasonable Market; as suppose the <hi>Dutch</hi> buy <hi>French, German,</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34974:32"/>
as cheap as the <hi>English</hi> Merchant can buy the like Manufactures in <hi>England,</hi> he may be able to under-sell the <hi>English</hi> Merchant and Manufacture in a third Port, with gain to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>And hence it is that the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and other Forreign <hi>cheap</hi> Navigation, hath given rise and growth to the <hi>French, Dutch, German, Italian,</hi> and other Forreign Manufactures; which, with the difficulties on our Trade at home, hath worked us out of near all our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, except what remains to us of our Cloathing-Trade.</p>
            <p>So the cheapness of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and other Forreign Navigation and Trading, hath in a manner beaten us out of all the Trade from Port to Port, and Fishing-Trade; the <hi>English</hi> retaining little from Port to Port, but the <hi>East-India Trade,</hi> for Callicoes, Pepper, &amp;c. a Trade which continues upon a particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, distinct from all the rest, as I shall also shew in the next Section.</p>
            <p>And upon the former Reasons, and others mentioned in this and the two next Sections, we must expect that the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> may in a short time destroy our remaining <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi>; the <hi>Dutch</hi> taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our mis-management of our Cloth-Trade, of which I shall give a further account, found ways of getting our fine Wooll, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34974:32"/>
mixing with fine <hi>Spanish,</hi> and by that mixture making a cheaper and more serviceable fine Cloth than with all <hi>Spanish,</hi> have been long high Competitors in the Trade of fine Cloth, and have actually beaten us out in the <hi>Northern Eastland and German Trades,</hi> and share with us in the <hi>Turky-Trade,</hi> both <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> getting what quantities they please of our long and middling-Wooll out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (which they now have cheaper than the <hi>English</hi> Clothiers from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) do mix it with <hi>French, Polonia,</hi> or other Forreign Woolls, (which are two thirds cheaper than ours) and therewith make vast quantities of course Cloths, Druggets and Stuffs, which being acceptable and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizable, they Export to <hi>Spain, Portugal, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and most other Parts.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Competition</hi> in the Cloathing-Trade, joined with some <hi>Polonian, Silesian, German,</hi> and other later Manufactures of course Woolls, have already sunk our Forreign <hi>Market</hi> and Vent; this hath sunk the <hi>price</hi> of our raw Wooll, as necessarily it must, and as their Manufactures increase, and ours does expire, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> must have our Wooll for what they please; and if they cannot have it at their own Rate at one of our Ports, they will go to another, and our necessitous People having their Wooll in their hands,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34974:33"/>
will sell almost at any Rate; which is so far the Case in <hi>Ireland</hi> already, that is there open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exported at 6 or 7 <hi>s.</hi> the Tod; and then if we compute what a Tod of Wooll may stand the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> in, considering their cheap mixtures of <hi>French, Polonish,</hi> and other course Woolls, we may very suddenly expect to have our <hi>English</hi> Woolls at about 4 <hi>s.</hi> the Tod; for if the <hi>English</hi> Clothier gives more for his <hi>Materials</hi> than the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> he cannot live: It is now in most parts of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> at about 12 <hi>s.</hi> or 13 <hi>s.</hi> the Tod, in some places at 10 <hi>s.</hi> where of late years it was 30 and 40 <hi>s.</hi> the Tod.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have long maligned this <hi>English</hi> Manufacture, and have now made a mighty progress towards its extirpation, and therein of the great support of our <hi>English</hi> Nation; (doubtless the Wooll-Sacks were placed in our House of Parliament to give us a precaution of it:) The <hi>Dutch</hi> of late have been somewhat checked in the <hi>Turky-Trade</hi> by the War; but the <hi>French</hi> are more vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and vigorous in the increase and vent of their Woollen Manufacture than ever; and the <hi>Dutch are now at Peace again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know some alledge, that these Nations may support their present Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture without our Wooll, which our own <hi>English Clothiers,</hi> on their own experience,

deny; They say that a mixture of fine <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> and fine <hi>Spanish,</hi> makes Cloth so much cheaper and more serviceable then of all fine <hi>Spanish,</hi> That it must needs beat out any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Manufacture made of all fine <hi>Spanish,</hi> (which is always near twice as dear as our finest <hi>English</hi> Wooll) and therefore have the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> near subverted the <hi>Venetian</hi> Cloth-Trade in <hi>Turkey</hi>; On the other side, They say that the <hi>German, Polonia, Silesian,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> are so course of themselves, that although they may be wrought into an ill sort of Composition, perhaps fit for Sails, or such like; yet it is not <hi>Merchandizable</hi>; but in mixture with <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi>; good dressing and dying will make very vendible and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable Stuffs, Druggets, and course Cloths.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any shadow of reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve otherwise, considering how Ravenous the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have been after our Wooll, since they set up their Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; why have they and their Agents been lurking on our Coasts and in our Creeks to fish it away for so many years? why have they given <hi>treble</hi> as much for it as for <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>French?</hi> shall we think the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> such Fools and mad-men as to make so <hi>laborious</hi> and <hi>dear</hi> a Purchase of an unnecessary Commodity? We are told of some fine <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Woolls which the <hi>Dutch</hi> make use of, but withall that they are not comparable to ours; nor of any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34974:34"/>
               <hi>bulk</hi>; and are assured by those who should best understand it, that no Nation but <hi>England</hi> hath a sufficient store of Wooll to drive a Forreign Trade of any Consequence.</p>
            <p>There is no question, but that if we did manufacture all our Wooll, we might again near Monopolize the Merchandize and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade of Woollen-Cloathing, though perhaps some Forreign Manufactures of course Woolls might be kept up for the use of the ordinary poorer people at Home; at least it must be admitted, that if we did manufacture all our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish Wooll,</hi> it would find vent in the World, since it is now all manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured in <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and doth find vent in the aforesaid <hi>mixtures</hi>; by which the bulk of the Manufacture must be much increased.</p>
            <p>Then if the question be how we shall arrive to the sole Manufacture of our own <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Wooll, it must appear upon what hath been said, that the only safe Expedient must be by <hi>easing</hi> our Navigation and Trade equally with Forreigners, in which Case having so much advantage in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, we could not fail of an answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able success in the Manufacture; long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath demonstrated that the <hi>meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting</hi> of the Exportation of Wooll is but a Cobweb, the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> being
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34974:34"/>
constantly supplied with what quantities they please to have, and ever will be, as long as their advantages in Trade will enable them to give more for our Woolls than our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Natives: for so long the Interests of our People will teach them ways to Elude or Baffle the Prohibition; For this reason our late Act of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 22. which makes it Felony to Export Wooll, hath nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied the mischief. Upon what hath been said, I may further add, That those who think to better our Trade in general by the force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able subversion of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, are as much mistaken; since the <hi>Hamburgers,</hi> and other Trading States, the <hi>French,</hi> and other Kingdoms, who have eased their Merchandize and Navigation, would then take the place of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and would share the Trade, and exclude the <hi>English,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less our Trade were equally eased.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude this Section with this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Observation, That for the opening of a sufficient Forreign Vent and Market for our Home Commodities, whether Manufactures, Fish, or others; it is not only necessary to remove all unequal cloggs on meer Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but also those on Imported Goods; because that whilst the <hi>English</hi> Merchant, by the Charges on Imported Goods, is ordinarily disabled to Trade from Port to Port, the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34974:35"/>
value of our <hi>English</hi> Exportations must be in a manner <hi>confined</hi> to the value of the <hi>Goods Imported,</hi> and consumed at Home, and the Treasure we Import <hi>in specie</hi> yearly.</p>
            <p>Whereas were the cloggs on our Imported Goods taken off, we might yearly vend of our own Home Commodities to the value of all the Forreign Goods we should then Import and Re-export, to serve the Occasions of all other Nations, (for these we might purchase by Barter or Sale of our own) whereby our Exported Home Commodities would then amount to much more, probably to more than ten times the value they now do yearly; All which in the course of Trade from Port to Port would resolve into more and more Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Riches of all sorts.</p>
            <p>And therefore, let the Treasure now Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>in specie</hi> be more or less, 'tis evident, that were our Merchants enabled to Trade from Port, as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and others, can and do, as our Manufactures, and other Home Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Exported yearly would be vastly more in quantity and value, so would the Treasure Imported yearly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Exportation of <hi>English</hi> home Commodity is yet farther confined, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of home Commodity to answer the Imported Goods and Treasure, we Export so much Treasure as we do; In which Case if
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34974:35"/>
the Treasure Exported be more than is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported yearly, this Kingdom must insensibly be beggered by meer Trade.</p>
            <p>This may be feared to be our Case, because there are very few Forreign Nations (I think none worth the naming but <hi>Spain</hi>) where our Merchants can ordinarily sell our Commodity for ready money, or with so much advantage, that they can afford to return with the price received, but will be obliged to better their Adventures by laying out the money again on Consumptive Forreign Goods, or else apply it to satisfie Forreign Debts by Bills of Exchange; This many of our <hi>Spanish</hi> Traders do, so that our Merchants Import much less Treasure than they receive; and it may not be improper to be added here, that whilst the virtue of our whole Trade (as now managed) does still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend so much on that with <hi>Spain,</hi> our Support is very <hi>single</hi> and <hi>casual,</hi> and the Consequence must be fatal, should the <hi>Spaniard</hi> be rendred either <hi>unable</hi> or <hi>unwilling</hi> to Trade longer with us; our Case is already thus, far worse than it was, that <hi>Spain</hi> is grown poor and weak, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> share and grow upon us in this Trade.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>IT being natural, That the continuance of one inconvenience should beget many others, it hath so fallen out in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Natives discerning the odds of Charge between our own and Forreign Navigation, and being therefore tempted to Trade in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Ships, or to deal with Forreign Importers, (which threatned the subversion of our <hi>English</hi> Navigation, and the <hi>Importing Trade</hi> of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Merchants) instead of Regulating our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34974:36"/>
the late Act of Navigation was made, whereby, and by other Acts,<note place="margin">12 Car. 2. ca. 18. 13 Car. 2. c. 14. 14 Car. 2. ca. 11. 15 Car. 2. c. 7.</note> our <hi>English</hi> Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are expresly or virtually confined to our own <hi>English</hi> built Shipping, so is the Importation of Forreign Goods, or else to the Forreign Natives of whose growths or productions they are; which restraint hath <hi>begotten,</hi> or (jointly with the other cloggs on our Forreign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize) hath <hi>heightned,</hi> these farther Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.</p>
            <p>First, It hath given a <hi>Monopoly to our own Merchants,</hi> upon our Manufacturers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for our own exportable Manufactures and Commodities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It hath given a <hi>Monopoly to our own Merchants</hi> upon all the people of <hi>England,</hi> for Goods Imported.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The said Act of Navigation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging the <hi>English</hi> to buy Imported Goods only at those Ports, or of those Natives, of whose growths and productions they are, hath given <hi>Monopolies to all Forreigners</hi> on the <hi>English</hi> for Goods of their respective growths and producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Coke</hi>'s Third Treatise <hi>Of Trade.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Danes</hi> (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) taking advantage of it, very much raised their Prizes and Customs upon us, for Pitch, Tar, and Timber, forcing us to pay near double what we did, and to pay them in money, where
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34974:37"/>
we used to barter with them for Commodity; the like may be said of the <hi>French,</hi> those of the <hi>Canary</hi>-Islands, and others, particularly the <hi>Leif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> for raw Hemp and Flax; at the best we are but at mercy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This Act hath made our Navigation yet <hi>more chargeable</hi> than before, because the aforesaid Forreign Materials of Pitch, Tar, raw Hemp and Flax are thereby made very much the dearer; It doth also render <hi>English</hi> Ship-Timber still dearer and dearer, which must more and more disable and discourage us in the building of Ships for Trade, and gives a great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous advantage to our Neighbours in the building of <hi>Ships of War</hi> so much cheaper than we.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This dearness of Shipping must the more prejudice the vent of our Manufactures made of our <hi>own Materials,</hi> and disable us in the Trade from Port to Port, for the Reasons in the last Section.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The same <hi>dearness of Shipping, with the other unequal charges on our Forreign Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,</hi> must render all <hi>Forreign materials of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture</hi> imported much dearer in <hi>England</hi> than in other Neighbour-Nations, (such are Hemp, Flax, Silk, and many others of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) and then our Manufacturers buying the Materials dearer, are obliged to sell their Manufactures dearer, which must hinder their vent at home as well as their Exportation abroad,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34974:37"/>
and consequently the rise and growth of all our Manufactures made of Forreign Materials, and accordingly we see our Manufactures of Linnen, Cables, Sails, Sea-Nets, and Silk of all sorts, are some of them in a manner lost, the rest much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed; which I the rather mention, that this, and what I say elsewhere, may take off some ignorant and unreasonable Reproaches against the <hi>English</hi> Manufacturers, for not selling some Manufactures so cheap as in other Nations, since they are necessitated to it by these and some other difficulties upon them, which I shall take notice of in this and the next Section, as I shall have occasion.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, This restraint to our dear <hi>English</hi> Navigation, <hi>and Charges on our Merchandize,</hi> does by Consequence tend to introduce the <hi>Disease of Trade,</hi> consisting in <hi>meer Importation</hi>; for as our Manufactures expire, there is a farther occasion of Importing Forreign Manufactures, especially if on this, and other Accounts, they may be sold cheaper here than our own: And hence it is, that we have a prodigious increase of Imported Linnens, Silks, &amp;c. and that we are of late forced to buy much more of our Cables, Cordage, Sails, and divers other Manufactures from the <hi>Dutch, French, Germans, &amp;c.</hi> than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly we did; in all which our Merchants must be greater gainers <hi>for a time,</hi> because our occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Forreign Goods being greater, they Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and sell the more at home; and from more
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34974:38"/>
and greater Sales must get the more money of <hi>our Natives,</hi> and the rather, because of their <hi>Monopoly</hi> on the rest of the people for Imported Goods, which does enable them to sell so at home, as to reimburse themselves all their Charges, with extraordinary profit.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, The said Restraint excluding great numbers of Forreign Ships from our Ports must hinder the vending of great proportions of our Beef, Pork, Corn, Beer, Clothing, and other Necessaries.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, The dearness of the <hi>English</hi> Timber, arising from the scarcity of it, the said Act doth oblige us to a kind of impossibility, there being not Timber enough in <hi>England</hi> to support any considerable Navigation, at least for any conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of time; which small remnant of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we are forced to spend so fast in the building or repairing of ordinary Vessels, that we shall soon see the end of it, and then in any great Exigence we must seek out for Forreign Timber to build Ships of War, for which the Timber now remaining might be reserved.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Whereas the increase and support of Navigation depends on the ordinary Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ships and Sea-men in Trade, of which far the greatest numbers are to be maintained in the Fishing-Trade, and Trade from Port to Port, the <hi>English</hi> being, by the Acts of Navigation, and <hi>other difficulties,</hi> disabled from those Trades, can never increase their Navigation, and upon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34974:38"/>
a small increase of Shipping must be <hi>over-clogg'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eleventhly, The Act of Navigation giving <hi>Forreigners election</hi> either to sell their Goods to the <hi>English</hi> at home, or to Import them into <hi>England,</hi> is so far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging our Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Coke</hi>'s Treatises <hi>Of Trade,</hi> this largely and most rationally discoursed.</note> that it hath put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the choice of Forreigners, whether theirs or our Shipping shall be imployed, which, with the dearness of ours, hath already increased the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of our Neighbours, but hath reduced ours.</p>
            <p>And lastly, As the dearness of our Navigation and course of Merchandize established by this Act does run us into an <hi>Excess of Importations,</hi> our Treasures must be exhausted, and then the remnant of our Shipping must be becalmed, and our Sea-men will leave us, as they already do, which I shall more particularly observe in the following Sections.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it must be apparent, that if we had disposed our selves to a cheaper way of building and sailing, our Trading-Ships (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as practicable here as in <hi>Holland</hi>) and had eased our Merchandize and Trade to an equal degree, these, and all other the aforesaid Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, had been prevented, and we might have supported a more swelling and beneficial Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation than that of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi>; who are so far from making use of any Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of this Nature, that they allow <hi>Free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:34974:39"/>
to all Forreigners, and their Ships; nor can the like Expedient be found in any Nation on the Earth, who have or aspire to a great Navigation or Trade; 'Tis confessed the like Act was made by the <hi>Rump,</hi> but 'twas on the occasion of their <hi>Dutch War,</hi> and intended (as 'tis said) to exclude the <hi>Dutch</hi> from the benefit of our Trade and Ports; however it were, we are not to learn the <hi>Rump</hi> might be mistaken in their Calculations.</p>
            <p>If the people of a Nation have free Liberty to sell at home to all Merchants, they must necessarily have the utmost choice of Chapmen for Manufactures and home Commodities, and by consequence the <hi>best and utmost Market and Vent</hi> as far as the Stocks, Treasures, Industry, Navigations and Occasions of the <hi>World</hi> will bear, and it is known that the most <hi>thrifty</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and <hi>near Livers,</hi> and those that Trade most <hi>universally,</hi> and with the <hi>greatest Stocks,</hi> and <hi>cheapest,</hi> are ordinarily able to buy dearest, and sell cheapest; and if our Natives were un-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, they would have Liberty to deal with any Forreigners on the Earth thus qualified; But our Natives being restrained to our own Merchants, and their own National Stock in Merchandize; let the particular Stocks of our Merchants be never so <hi>small,</hi> let them Trade never so <hi>dear,</hi> or so <hi>little,</hi> let them live never so <hi>high and costly,</hi> yet our Natives Manufactures and others must <hi>pay for all,</hi> by selling cheaper to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34974:39"/>
our Merchants, and buying of them dearer; for the Merchants are in a capacity to buy so and sell so at home, as to satisfie themselves, and maintain the Equipage they live in, with much overplus.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Clothiers,</hi> and some others, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that they are yet farther confined in their <hi>choice</hi> of Chapmen, since the <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are confined to the <hi>Trading Companies</hi> and their stocks; which does first give me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to consider the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of our <hi>English</hi> Forreign Trading-Companies, and of what <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence</hi> they are in Trade.</p>
            <p>This I shall do (as I think it will appear) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any partiality, protesting that I bear no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or personal ill will against any Company, or Member of any Company in <hi>England,</hi> but on the contrary, have an high esteem for as many of these and other Merchants as I am acquainted with, having found them very worthy men, and such as much desire the general Good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hope they will close with the Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in what relates to themselves.</p>
            <p>Particular men have too long flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a corrupt opinion, that they may gain by the common loss, and that it will <hi>hold out their times,</hi> which I do not say with any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reflection on these, or any other Traders; being the ordinary <hi>maxim</hi> or <hi>prudential</hi> of our <hi>cunning men</hi> of all kinds.</p>
            <p>Of the first and more ancient sort are our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34974:40"/>
               <hi>Regulated Companies,</hi> or such as are so called, such as are the <hi>Turky, Hamburgh, Muscovy,</hi> and <hi>Eastland</hi> Companies, whose Incorporations have been always accompted <hi>Legal,</hi> being <hi>intended</hi> for the better Regulation of some particular Forreign Trades, and for the raising and support of Common Charges, and for those purposes are enabled to <hi>act by Committees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Members of these Companies trading on their <hi>distinct stocks,</hi> seem to leave the same choice of Chapmen to our Manufacturers, wherefore I cannot observe but that such Companies might consist with a Flourishing Trade, if according to their Appellations they be <hi>really Regulated,</hi> (that is) provided all <hi>English</hi>-men (according to their Right) be left at liberty <hi>to become Members,</hi> and Trade, upon Terms that are not <hi>oppressive.</hi> Secondly, That these Companies be not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make such <hi>By-Laws</hi> for their private ends, as may prove advantagious to the Members of the Company, but prejudicial to the Nation; a thing very practicable, as suppose they should prolong their times of buying our home Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, or confine the Market to some such particular <hi>places</hi> at home as may be convenient for themselves, but injurious to our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers, or other Natives, or should Trade to few Ports where they can have extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Rates and Terms, when they might Trade to more, and consequently vend more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity; or should endeavour to set the Dice on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34974:40"/>
Foreigners, by Arbitrary prizes or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, whereby Forreigners may be disaffected with our Commerce; experience hath shown that private interest hath carryed some of them into such or the like irregularities, it would be too long to instance in particulars, I shall only say, that those of the last sort made Forreigners the more Impatient till they had set up their woollen Manufactures.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>East-India</hi> and <hi>Affrican Companies</hi> are of another kind,<note place="margin">The present <hi>East-India</hi> Pattent granted 13 <hi>July</hi> 1660. That to the <hi>Affrican</hi> Company since.</note> and of a latter creation, having gotten <hi>Pattents</hi> of the Sole Trade of great part of the World <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> to the rest of his Majesties Subjects, which they manage upon <hi>Joynt-stocks</hi>; of which I shall shew the generall ordinary consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and then examine how far they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the particular Cases of these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>
            <p>First, in the <hi>nature</hi> of such Companies they must be as injurious as may be to all home-Manufactures made of our own materialls, and the vent of our other exports, because by trading on a <hi>Joynt-stock</hi> they make but <hi>one buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and therefore have a <hi>Monopoly</hi> for all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable goods proper <hi>only</hi> for the Forreign Nations within their pattents, and must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the choice of Chapmen <hi>for all other goods</hi> proper for these and other Countrys; now
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34974:41"/>
the confining of the Market and choice of Chapmen in any degree is dangerous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to Trade, and in a larger sence may be called a Monopoly, but it is far more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous when the Election is totally lost, for then those who have the Monopoly <hi>may,</hi> and therefore <hi>will,</hi> buy at their own prizes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the same reason they must be yet more injurious to home-Manufactures made of forreign materialls; for first, they will sell the materialls as <hi>dear,</hi> and then buy the Manufacture as <hi>cheap as they please</hi>; which must subvert any Manufacture in a trice, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if made of forreign materials bought cheaper by forreign Manufacturers; suppose then the <hi>East-India Company</hi> by their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Money, should so far divert the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket as to beat out the <hi>Turky Company</hi> in the trade of <hi>Raw-Silks,</hi> at what rates would our <hi>Silk-weavers</hi> buy raw-silks? or will it be said a Company on a Joynt-stock, will so much value the National interest as to sell as low as the Commodity is sold for in other Nations? or if it will be said, who will believe it? was ever any such thing done either by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, Dutch, or <hi>East-India Companies</hi>? did they ever yet endeavour to beat out one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in trade by low selling? No, this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the effect of choice; were a third <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> Company in <hi>France</hi> on a Joynt-stock, they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34974:41"/>
would hold up the prizes; the advantage got to a Nation by underselling is the effect of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, or high convenience; when the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers being infinite, some of them are ready, and all long for dispatch and a new adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby they work down one another to as low a prize as the Commodity can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded at; of all which we have an undenya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example in the present <hi>Affrican Company,</hi> who were no sooner Constituted, but they raised the price of imported <hi>red-wood,</hi> which before was sold at 26. and 28<hi>l. per</hi> Tun, to 80<hi>l. per</hi> Tun, which must make our exported dyed Cloaths of all sorts so much the dearer; and being an intolerable rate, put our Dyers upon finding out the use of <hi>Saunders,</hi> which they still continue; and as a farther confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, and what I said before, I shall add, that after the Election of this Company, all goods proper for that Trade only sunk at least 15<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> nor would the 10<hi>th.</hi> part of the same goods be vended to the said Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as there was before, to our Merchants dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>open Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the same reason such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany must be as injurious to the Trade from <hi>port to port</hi>; For having also a Monopoly in selling, they may and will impose Arbitrary prizes on the buyers, and then the Merchants or Re-exporters who buy goods so dear, must
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34974:42"/>
be undersold by any other Nation which drives a <hi>free and open Trade</hi> to the same place from whence they are Imported; this is self-evident, and therefore I should not instance in Fact, but that I have it on good Authority; that even in the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, which is <hi>Alledged</hi> to be out of the common Rules of Trade, whilst the Trade was open, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Years 54, 55, and 56. our Merchants sold the <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities so low, that they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished more parts of <hi>Europe</hi> then since we have done, nay, <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> it self; and that this very much sunk the Actions of the <hi>Dutch East-India Company:</hi> a thing which stands with reason; and which therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends an <hi>open Trade</hi> to India, <hi>if it may be so driven with long continuance,</hi> whereof I shall farther consider.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, These Companies having also <hi>Monopolies on these Forreign Natives</hi> with whom they Trade, may set Arbitrary prizes upon them, for our home-Manufactures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; and will get more, by selling a little very dear, then by selling much more at mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate profit: and though the Joynt-stock im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <hi>be not sufficient</hi> to manage the Trade any thing near the full advantage, yet those interested in it, will have reason to be satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the returns they make, since in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Stock, they may be very
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34974:42"/>
great; and for the same reason, may be well contented to Trade to a <hi>few Ports</hi> where they can have <hi>great rates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>ly,</hi> The industry, courage and ingenuity of all the rest of the Natives (by which as much as by stock all Trade is improved) are shut out, which must not only be a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Trade in general, but is a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship put on the rest, <hi>who by their birth rights are equally intituled to all Trade</hi>; upon all which accompts, the <hi>Legality</hi> of sole importing, sole buying, and sole vending, hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly brought in question, and denyed in our greatest Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;<note place="margin">Stat. 21. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. cap. 6th. 3. <hi>Jac.</hi> cap. 6th.</note> and should it be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted, by the same reason, the rest of our Forreign Trade might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed to two or three more Companys, and then we should have but three or four Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Shops for all Exported and Imported Commodities; nay the whole might be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or reserved to <hi>one Company,</hi> or <hi>one man:</hi> in any of which Cases what would become of <hi>property?</hi> Such is the Case of <hi>the general body</hi> of our <hi>Merchants</hi> already, that having in a manner lost the <hi>Eastland</hi> and <hi>Northern</hi> Trades, they are shut out of the <hi>Affrican, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and <hi>Persian, Chinese,</hi> and other mighty Trades within those <hi>Patents</hi>: since this out of the <hi>French</hi> trade, and therefore are thronged
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34974:43"/>
into the <hi>Streights,</hi> and other narrow remnants, and yet is this the usual preferment of most of the younger Sons of the <hi>Gentry of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Though our other Merchants on their single accompts export much treasure, yet cannot it so easily be done, or not in so great Quality, as by such a Company; whose Joint stock having a great credit, can take up as much ready money as they want; whereas those who will not trust a single trader with a 100<hi>l.</hi> in <hi>mony</hi> will trust him with 500<hi>l.</hi> worth of Commodity, as common exerience shews: and 'tis affirmed, that during our trade in 54. and 55. we exported more Commodities, <hi>viz.</hi> cloth, &amp; other things, then since we have done</p>
            <p>To this is Objected, that the <hi>East-India</hi> trade so far differs from others, that it cannot be supported, <hi>or not with so much advantage and security, (which I admit to be all one)</hi> without a Joint stock, which if true, there is no doubt but it ought to be so managed. This then is one great Question, in the mean time I hear nothing of this so much as alledged for the <hi>Affrican</hi> Company: the reasons given, depend upon pretended <hi>Facts</hi> in <hi>India, viz.</hi> the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of great common charges in gratifying and corresponding with the <hi>Indian Princes,</hi> and keeping <hi>Forts and Forces</hi> for the defence of our Factories there, which they say could never be supported but out of a Joint stock in Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:34974:43"/>To which others answer, 1<hi>st.</hi> that it may be true, great common charges are necesssary, <hi>&amp; much greater then our Company are at,</hi> but that <hi>common charges</hi> may be rais'd by a <hi>regulated com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> on <hi>Goods</hi> imploy'd in Trade, or on other parts of the Traders Estates, if the Company are Impower'd to make Levies, which is no more then every Parish are enabled to do for Church-Poor and other things: and that 'tis the same thing for a man to be assubjected to Levies out of that part of his distinct stock which is not in trade, as 'tis to make good any publick charge or loss out of his Joint-stock.</p>
            <p>Or Secondly, they say, that if this Trade be taken into the protection of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it will have the Joint stock of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to secure it, the same by which we are all secured: they offer what we were able to do in our open Trade in 1654.55. and 56. But as a demonstration, urge the example of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> who in an open Trade (I do not mean in an <hi>Anarchy</hi> nor without <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>order</hi>) made near or full as great a progress in this Trade as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whilest their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gave sufficient assistance, which they say, also answers what hath been objected from the <hi>supposed disorder of our Trade in those parts, should it lye open, and the capacity the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives would be then in, of setting the dice upon the English</hi>: and as a further answer to this they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34974:44"/>
say, the same thing may be objected against all other open Trade in the World.</p>
            <p>But then those for our Company, object the Example of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who being a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so wise in Trade, successfully manage the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade by a Company on a Joint stock; which being matter of fact, is beyond all the Argument in the World.</p>
            <p>To which is answered, that this Example proves that a Company in a Joint stock may make a great progress in it, but does not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the like, or a greater progress under a regulated or open Trade.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> That on the first custom of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ever since, the <hi>Dutch</hi> had most of the Trade from Port to Port, and carriage throughout the rest of the World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might with less disadvantage to the rest of the Dutch Merchants inclose this to a Company.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> That that Company was occasioned by the distinct Bands or voluntary Associations of Merchants in the several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,<note place="margin">See the present state of the low Countrys, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in 69. Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>M. A.</hi> Fellow of the Royal Society, p. 154.5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> who first undertook this Trade, which being soon after the Union, and the Provinces having Originally seperate rights, the said Associations had not so good a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as was necessary, which could never
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34974:44"/>
fall out under a regulated Company of one Nation.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>ly,</hi> That the constitution of this Company being intended for a present Reconciliation of these interests,<note place="margin">See <hi>Mandelsloes</hi> Travells, p. 285.</note> was Originally but for 21. Years, and was afterwards continued, because the Company growing so rich and powerfull both abroad and at home, the Members were generally <hi>chosen States,</hi> and therefore above any attacque at home from the rest.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>ly,</hi> That as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company is consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and have managed this Trade, it hath redownded to almost, if not fully to as <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> an advantage, as if managed by an open or regulated Trade: in which they say our Company is much defective; &amp; that supposing a Joint stock necessary, or highly convenient, yet if we might manage ours to more National advantage, it were but fit it should be done.</p>
            <p>To prove this might be done, those for a more open Trade urge, that our now <hi>East-India patent</hi> contains near or fully <hi>one third part of the World,</hi> and therefore must have many hundreds, if not thousands of parts,<note place="margin">Note the <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Companys Patent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains from the <hi>Streights</hi> Mouth to the <hi>Cape of good Hope.</hi>
               </note> that whereas their <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> begins at the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> it is from thence above 4000 Miles, upon the Coast of <hi>Affrick</hi> to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> in all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34974:45"/>
which they do not Trade to one Port, and very little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if any thing, in the <hi>Red Sea</hi>: which they say might be done to considerable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and much more to <hi>Persia,</hi> then we now do;
That in <hi>India</hi> our Company do not Trade to above 20. or 30. Ports, nor vend our Woollen Manufactures at above 3. or 4. Ports, and there <hi>very dear,</hi> who sell again much dearer, and to <hi>Ingrossers,</hi> which hinders the vent:<note place="margin">Printed in (77.) pag. 21.</note> that in <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>Japan,</hi> they have no Trade at all,<q> where (to use these words of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) of the Book in defence of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,) in all likelyhood more considerable quantities of our Woollen Manufactures might be vended, and from thence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thereof <hi>Gold, Silver, and Copper</hi> might be brought to supply at least, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the Trade in other parts of <hi>India,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carrying so much out of <hi>Europe</hi>: But these Trades (he says) are not so easily gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as some fancy, great hazards of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable stocks must be run, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas, they say were a greater share of the industry and vigour of the Nation now pent up, and greater stocks now worse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, or idle, let into this Trade, we might hope for a great Trade to the Ports now of no use to the Company, for that in fact the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company Trade to all Ports in <hi>India, China,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34974:45"/>
Japan, &amp;c.</hi> and drive a mighty Trade to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> with the Commodities of those Countreys, <hi>viz.</hi> Spice of all sorts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> They say by this our want of a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Commerce in <hi>India</hi> there is a very <hi>small Navigation</hi> imployed in this mighty Trade, of what might be, being not above 20, or 30. Ships <hi>to and from India</hi> in a direct course, and <hi>in India</hi> so inconsiderable that it is not worth the noting: That for this reason, and because we there vend so little Commodity, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany does Trade with vast quantlties of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>Treasuri,</hi> insomuch that upon search of the Custome books of the Port of <hi>London</hi> only, it appeared by the Entrys, that the Gold and Silver exported for <hi>India</hi> by the said Company from the 2d. of <hi>March</hi> 1673, to the 11th. of <hi>March</hi> 1674, amounted to 500. sixty odd thousand pounds Sterling; besides what might be entred in the out-ports, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entry privately exported, which those that understand this Trade will not think a little: the Author of the aforesaid Pamphlet confesses, that from the end of the Year 1674, to the beginning of the Year 1675, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>India</hi> about 400000 <hi>l.</hi> more, in which perhaps we have reason to be suspitious of his <hi>modesty:</hi> (It were a Nationall work to search the entrys for this and the other Years suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding) that 'tis the exporting of this Money
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34974:46"/>
that endears our Company to the <hi>Indian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and buys their protection, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might destroy them if they would, our Company, having not above 2 or 300 people in it, their sort St. <hi>George,</hi> including Factors and Agents of all sorts, and at <hi>Bombey</hi> fewer.</p>
            <p>Whereas, that on the other side the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese</hi> whilst they had the Trade of the <hi>Indys,</hi> though under no Company, supported a <hi>vast Navigation</hi> there to serve the occasions of those mighty Empires and their own; that since the <hi>Dutch</hi> have supplanted the <hi>Portuguese</hi>; they have yet a greater, having there thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Ships Trading from Port to Port in the <hi>Indies, Persia,</hi> &amp;c. Besides 50, or 60, (if need be) more <hi>Men of War,</hi> and keep great <hi>Armies</hi> in pay: That they have gotten many spacious <hi>Countrys, Islands,</hi> and <hi>Populous Citys</hi> of their own, whereof <hi>Batavia</hi> is near as big and rich as <hi>Amsterdam</hi>; besides divers <hi>Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kingdoms,</hi> whom they have forced into a profitable complyance, and were it not for fear of the English power at home, could day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruin us at their pleasure: that by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Trade in these parts, they gain so considerably, that they can fraight home their great Fleets with the most valuable Commodities in the <hi>Indies</hi>; being the result of their industry in those parts, not of their exported Money.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:34974:46"/>3<hi>ly.</hi> That the <hi>Subscribers</hi> to our <hi>East-India</hi> Stock were originally but few, and the Stock but small, that divers of the shares being now bought in and consolidated into particular hands, there are not above 60. or 80. persons or thereabouts considerably concerned in the Joynt-stock; that although the Stock be not near sufficient to manage even the present Trade, and therefore could admit of more <hi>Depositums</hi> of Money, which would let in a greater number of our people, the Company to prevent the necessity of it, do take up 4 or 500000<hi>l.</hi> at Interest at 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which by their dear Sales at home yields them 20 or 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> or more; that as the Trade redounds to the benefit of few at home, so to as few in <hi>India,</hi> the Companies, Factories and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being few, and most lye divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men of mean condition, who will depend solely on the Company, being origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>Hospitall Boys</hi> or such like, and all others restrained to <hi>Traffick, Frequent</hi> or <hi>haunt</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> or places within their Pattent, by a Clause therein, under penaltys of <hi>Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Seizures</hi> and <hi>Confiscations,</hi> frequently and severely exempted by the Company, <hi>how le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally</hi> I leave to be examined: That upon this accompt, even those few Seamen or others whom they permit to deal for themselves, can make little profit, being charged with great

               <hi>Mulcts,</hi> made payable to the Company at their discretion for all the Commodities they export or import.</p>
            <p>Whereas the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Stock</hi> of the <hi>Dutch</hi> company was 600000<hi>l</hi> and this in the year 1602. and the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of the Sharers in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company of all sorts,<note place="margin">See <hi>Mandelsloes Travils</hi> 285.

            <p>I have been the more copious on this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Subject, first, because of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or pretences of some, that our stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34974:47"/>
advantage in this Trade gives us a kinde of National security, so that no sooner can others mention any defect in our Trade, but they are presently told of our Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> the wealth of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation to and in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet I shall admit, though with little reputation to the rest, that our <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, such as it is, seems the most flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing branch of the whole, and therefore that the Gentlemen concerned in this Company have evidenced their conduct in the <hi>present way of Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> I shall not much contest but that the Indian Commodities consumed at home, and re-exported, may (as the rest of our Trade is now managed) <hi>prevent</hi> the exportation of near as much money to our Neighbouring Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> by the use of Callicoes instead of other Linnens, by a Barter of these and the rest of our <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities in <hi>France</hi> and other parts <hi>for other Consumptive goods</hi>; in which there is an advantage, because the less money we part with to our Neighbours, they will be in the less capacity to hurt us, but this does not prove the <hi>Indian</hi> goods re-exported bring in the Treasure exported to <hi>India,</hi> since the whole, or a great share of it may be, and is by the circulation of forreign contracts <hi>finally resolved</hi> into other consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34974:48"/>
Importations, of so dangerous a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is to export money.</p>
            <p>But suppose the <hi>Indian</hi> goods, re-exported bring us in more Treasure, yet is it evident from such Facts as I have mentioned before as are admitted by the Company, and such as are indisputable, that this part of our Trade (which before 1654. was managed by the like Company) was never improved to any great or considerable degree, in comparison of the progress made by all other Nations which have undertaken it: whereof there must be causes and reasons highly necessary to be examined and regulated; I shall add, that for those other Facts relating to the present debate which seem of less notority, they are such, as to my knowledge were affirmed by many credible witnesses, and by them inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be proved before a Committee of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> upon the occasion of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition there formerly exhibited by the <hi>Clothy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> but having attended several days, were never heard, because the Parliament was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in other things, and afterwards Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued: but I doubt not they are all ready to attest the same and more before that Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which I say, that it may not be thought that I have highly or officiously reported any of the aforesaid allegations to the same Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, I shall leave it to be determined by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34974:48"/>
what expedients to enlarge this Trade, being in a matter of this Importance contented to have opened some questions and Facts rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it: I am so free from any malice to the Company, or any man so much as concerned in it or envying their gains, that for a more easy Composure of things, I hartily wish there may be found some more beneficiall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and comprehensive way of Managing this Trade by a Joynt stock, that thereby the present Interests of the <hi>Gent.</hi> of this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may be secured, nay and improved; if this cannot be done, then submit it to farther consideration how just and reasonable it is that these Gent. should have compensation for what they shall really lose by the Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Company.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude this with remarking, First, that the <hi>Dutch East-India</hi> Company Trading on a Joynt-stock, and therefore with as much disadvantage to their re-exporting Merchants as the English, hath been a means to preserve us this Limb of Trade from Port to Port in <hi>Callicoes, Pepper,</hi> &amp;c. and probably the rather because our Trading in Money hath so far debosh'd the <hi>Indian</hi> Market, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> are not over-ready to deal for these Commodities, and therefore principally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to their richer <hi>Spice Trade</hi> whereof they have the Monopoly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:34974:49"/>This restraint of our Market to our own Merchants and Companies, hath yet brought a farther mischief upon our Manufactures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Companies being seated in <hi>London,</hi> our Natives are forced to bring their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures thither by <hi>Land Carriages,</hi> some of of which are so long that they are as charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as a Voyage to <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Turky,</hi> Quantity for Quantity; all which is superadded to the originall charge of the Manufacture; our Clothiers have also complained, that when they have brought their Cloaths to <hi>London,</hi> they have been frequently and long <hi>delayed</hi> before they have been able to vend them; which whether it hath proceeded from any correspondence or Intelligence between the Companies, their Committees or Agents their want of Stocks or universall Trade, or from the dearness of our course of Merchandize, and the consequentiall obstructions in the forreign Market, or from all together, I shall not positively undertake to say: But certain it is that in this case our Clothiers for want of a quick Market lose the Interest of so much of their Stocks as lyes dead, which also is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the first cost of their Manufacture; but yet being made necessitous by delay, and confined to the <hi>London</hi> Market, are forced to sell cheap: and then are the poor Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers most miserable, when on the one
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34974:49"/>
hand the charges they are at oblige them to sell dear, but yet are confined in their just demands.</p>
            <p>It may be remembred here that the odds in <hi>Interest of Money</hi> between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> (where none is allowed to be taken under the highest pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltys) must as much prejudice our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures as our forreign Trade, by the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall charge it brings on our Manufacturers, which charge is still increased as they are lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger delayed.</p>
            <p>The freedom of the Market being of so great importance; it must also follow, that the like Cloggs and incumbrances put upon the Trades of Ware-house keeping and Shop-keeping, must have ill effects on the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Trade, because these Trades make up the publick Marts and Markets, as hath been said.</p>
            <p>From the Contents of this and the last Section it may be observed, that it is not only necessary to ease the <hi>course of Merchandise,</hi> but to remove all other Cloggs and restraints on the <hi>home Market</hi>; for though our Merchants should be able to Trade as cheap as forreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet if it should lye in their disposition to impose on the rest of the people, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manufacturers, Shop-keepers or others) the Merchants might gain much more then
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34974:50"/>
now they do, but our Manufacturers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natives might be still sufferers in some degree; 'tis too apparent that our English Clothiers have made so ill Markets at <hi>London,</hi> that they have lived poorly and got little or nothing, whilst the Merchants have lived splendidly and laid up money, the like may be said of others.</p>
            <p>And here it may be farther observed how predominant private interest hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, and how finely it hath spun the thread; our <hi>Land-holders</hi> have thought to ease themselves by thrusting great part of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Charges, upon Trade, the Merchants in Exchange have gotten <hi>Monopolies on the Land-holders,</hi> and people for all goods expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and imported; and of these some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies trading on Joint Stocks have got <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies exclusive to the rest</hi>; but at the same time we have given all forreign Nations <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noplies on the English,</hi> in all which we have been eagerly seeking to get advantages on one another, but have laid our selves open to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; who (whilst we scrable for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent wealth in the Nation) take it out of our fingers at their pleasure.</p>
            <p>To which may be added as a farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to the growth of our Manufactures, that our people have gotten a vain and imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>affectation and use of forreign Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34974:50"/>
and Comodities</hi>; which must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sink the Market at home for our own of the same kind; for the same quantity of home Commodity wanting of its former rent, must stagnate and lye on the owners hands, who either will not be able to sell it at any rate, or must sell it much the cheaper.</p>
            <p>This <hi>deadness and cheapness</hi> of any Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, on this or any other occasion, will have a very ill Consequence; for it must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sink the Manufacturers <hi>wages</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Master of the Work; and then in case the Market doth not mend in some reasonable time, they will withdraw both their labour and Stock.</p>
            <p>Nay this, or little better, must be the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fate of all our Manufactures, by the meer want of a Forreign vent; for as any of our Manufactures which supply our National use, draws in more and more of our people till the Manufactures becomes too bulkey to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a full vent at home, it must then equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stagnate on the hands of all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it; at least render them necessitous, and endanger the Manufacture: the increase of imported raw-silk from <hi>Turky</hi> in barter for our Cloath, occasioned the increase of our Silk Manufacture; what is now like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it may be seen.</p>
            <p>Before I go to the next Section, I shall yet
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34974:51"/>
observe these farther inconveniences from the aforesaid constitutions and course of our Forreign Merchandize.</p>
            <p>First, That our Manufactures being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to buy of our own Merchants and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies are not only subject to buy Forreign materials of Manufacture at such prizes as they can and will please to afford them, but must be contented to buy <hi>worse materials</hi> then other Nations make use of, in case our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants for their own gain, or by negligence of their Factors, import worse.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That Forreign materials of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture being thus straitly Imported into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> gives our Traders frequent opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>ingrosse Imported Commodities,</hi> (both materialls of Munufacture and others,) and thereby to impose 3 times the currant prize in other Nations upon our Manufacturers or other buyers, which must not only disable our Manufactures, but hinder re exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this ingrossing Trade is the daily design of a sort of <hi>Cunning men</hi> amongst us; which with <hi>stealing Customes,</hi> and importing and vending <hi>Prohibited goods,</hi> are the ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of getting <hi>an Estate on a suddain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The seeming ease we have by a <hi>resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of half Customes upon re-exportation,</hi> is so far from being really such, that it not only leav<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the great disproportion and charge
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34974:51"/>
mentioned in the last Section, but in Cases where our imported materials of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture are re-exported, being a further une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall charge on our English Manufacturers; because that when re-exported and sold, the Forreign buyers are eased of about half the duties paid, especially if sold so near as <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>France</hi>; of what consequence then must this be in the Silk-Manufacture? (Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>France</hi> could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise provided of Raw Silk) and so in others, but more particularly in our Imported <hi>Dying Stuffs, and Raw Sugars from the West Indyes,</hi> which are materialls peculiar to the English; but by this disadvantage in re-exportation are now mostly Manufactured by Forreigners; of which I shall have occasion to say more, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Consideration of our present Plantation-Trade, in the mean time, upon what hath been already said, and what I shall adde in the next Section, let any man Judge how cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely our poor people are taxed with dear Selling their Manufactures, with Sloath and other inconsiderable Reproaches by such as <hi>live at ease.</hi>

               <p>Forreigners eased in Trade; Other clogs of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon ours; Want of populacy, incidently of extream prizes of victuals, and how the duration of Land-Rents may be secured, our people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from Manufactures; the Abuse of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>43.</hi> Eliz. <hi>2.

Monopolyes of New Manufactures: delay and charge in some Law-Suits. Tyths of Hemp, Flax, and Fish, more of Customes, and incidently of Taxes.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FRom the foregoing Sections, it appears how dangerous it is to clog Trade. It is like putting a pound weight at the end of a pole, which is heavier then 20. times so much placed at the hand, for so a small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post or difficulty on Trade shall work down all <hi>Land revenues</hi> more then the sums actually paid; Nay Land-Rents will rise under great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Taxes, where home and Forreign Trade is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34974:52"/>
left open and free, as experience hath shown in <hi>Holland</hi> and elsewhere.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. That the charges and Clogs on Trade are to be estimated tolerable or inconvenient <hi>by Comparison,</hi> as they are more or less then the charges on Trade in other Nations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That it is of high importance to watch the pollicies of other Nations in Trade; if other Nations Trade with as much disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to their Natives as the English, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out-strip us; But if they ease and facilitate their Trade at home and abroad, So must we, else they will beat us out.</p>
            <p>What then are we to expect whilest our neighbouring Forreigners continue to have the aforesaid advantages upon us in course of Forreign Merchandize, when also the home-vent of their Manufactures is not confined to the Merchants of one Nation, nor Compnyes of one Town, when their Manstfacturers are not obliged to the charge of long Land-carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, nor opprest with delays, but can sell when and where they please, and to all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Aliens, aswell as to their own, and therefore have an unlimitted and most profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table market.</p>
            <p>The <hi>odds in Populacy</hi> must also produce the like odds in Manufacture; plenty of people must also cause <hi>cheapnesse of wages</hi>; which will cause the cheapnesse of the Manufacture; in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34974:53"/>
a scarcity of people wages must be dearer, which must cause the dearnesse of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture; But this populacy I speak of, must not be understood of those people which the <hi>Extent of Territory</hi> makes necessary for the meer tilling of the ground, keeping of Cattle <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for in this sence there is no doubt, but the grand Seigniors or Spanish Dominions are more populous then <hi>Holland</hi>; The popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy I intend and which only can be servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Manufacture, are those exuberant num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which cannot find Imployment in hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandry, nor otherwise but in Trade; in which sence <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> are most Populous; their Trade and people have grown up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">See Sir <hi>William Temples</hi> Book of the <hi>Vnited provinces</hi> Ch. 6.</note> having nourished one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the like may be said of some parts of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other side <hi>England</hi> never was so populous as it might have been,<note place="margin">The peopling of <hi>Ireland</hi> here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he was to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the losse by the Irish Massacre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing computed at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 250000. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons besides what the growing plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys of <hi>Ireland</hi> have invited over dayly.</note> and undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably must now be far lesse po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous then ever, having so lately peopled our vast <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Plantations</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; the decay of our Manufactures hath much depopulated our Inland Corporations of the Villages Adjacent; the decay of our Fishing Trade our Sea-Towns; I
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34974:53"/>
know this want of people is hardly credible with many who see no farther then their own ease and gain; they will tell us, we have so many people already that we know not what to do with them; which is true, and so they have in <hi>Spain,</hi> where their Villages are in a manner forsaken, and many of their great Cities and Towns lie half empty; most of their ordinary people having no employment at home, are gone to <hi>America,</hi> those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main chiefly consisting in Gentlemen, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Officers and Shopkeepers, with their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary men of husbandry and servants: I must not omit Priests and beggars, since to the honour and comfort of <hi>Spain</hi> they make about a fourth or fifth part of the whole; there is little or no support for other ranks of men: how near this we are in <hi>England</hi> let any man judge, or how soon we shall come to it through the decay of our Manufactures; What an uproar have we already in an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Parish if a poor young couple happen to marry, or a man with Children chance to get into a house? how they are tossed from Justice to Justice, and from pillar to post,<note place="margin">Stat. 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 4th 7. <hi>Jacob.</hi> 4.14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.12.</note> by vertue of the several Acts for settlement of poor?

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34974:54"/>
many out of the Nation, and in effect <hi>banish them by Act of Parliament</hi>; 'Tis like, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Inquisition, the proud <hi>Spaniards</hi> had some such expedients as these to be rid of this kinde of lumber; they would be now glad of those laborious drudges to encounter the populous <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being upon this Subject I cannot omit to observe the bad consequences of some others of our late Laws, made to raise <hi>the prizes of Victualls,</hi> which doubtless were projected for the raising <hi>Land Rents,</hi> viz. the <hi>Acts for Transportation of Corn,</hi> and the Acts against <hi>the Importing</hi> Irish <hi>and</hi> Scotch <hi>Cattle,</hi> which had they the full effects intended, must much assist both in depopulating the Nation, and Subverting our remaining Manufactures; For if the Manufacturers buy his Victualls at excessive rates, at what rates must he sell his Manufacture, or how shall he live? especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a time when his Manufactures fall upon his hands daily? but this will mainly dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy some, who will have no Manufacture or Trade, if the price of the Victualls must not be excessive, for then say they, how can the vallue of Lands be raised? to which I answer, First, that the products of Lands do not wholly consist in Victualls, and that much Land is to be applied to many other as profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and (perhaps more profitable ways) then
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34974:54"/>
for meer Victualls, <hi>especially in a Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in Trade and People</hi>; for this I shall refer to our Copious Books of Husbandry, which then may do us much good, but little or none before.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That though Victualls be not at a very excessive price, yet if there be a <hi>quick and great market</hi> at a midling price, it will raise and hold up the vallue of Lands, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath proved of late years.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, It is impossible the vallue of Lands can be much raised by the meer raising of the price of Victualls, especially in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but thin of people; nor would such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue endure or be tollerable; perhaps the Spanish Dons did once raise the prizes of Victualls, or suppose they should do it now, what weighty effect would it have, unless to drive all the rest of the Spaniards into <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica?</hi> But that which will most <hi>certainly and durably</hi> raise the Revenue of Land must be the <hi>encrease of Treasure and Trading people</hi>; suppose the people of <hi>England</hi> were trebled, 'tis plain that the Land must yield treble the produce in meer Victualls, else the people must starve; but these people will not starve, especially <hi>trading people,</hi> nor will they live needily, or scarcely if they can help it, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set themselves and others to the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of all corners of Land in the Nation,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34974:55"/>
till our Lands produce more then treble the Victualls they now do, a thing very practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and then supposing Victualls as cheap and cheaper then now, Land will ordinarily be treble it's present vallue, especially if we consider how much may be then applyed to raise Hemp, Flax, and other necessary and profitable things, with the increase of Wool, Hides, Tallow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as the people increase,<note place="margin">By the Maps of <hi>England</hi> it is found to contain 29568000. Acres besides that which is allowed for High-ways, all the United Provinces are hardly so big as <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
               </note> so will the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Land; there is no doubt but <hi>England</hi> upon the utmost improvement might maintain 6 times its present number of people, nay 10 times with an indifferent use of that mighty plenty of Fish our own Sea affords us; there is as little doubt but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great increase of people and mony, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls will be rather too dear, and that Laws may be then requisite to restrain the price.</p>
            <p>Such was the ancient populacy of <hi>England,</hi> that we had formerly Statutes made in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of the exportation of Corn, our Flesh also found vent, though our people kept Lents, Ember-weeks, and Fasting days; wherein they fed on Fish and white meats, and yet we read of Famines in those days; whereas now we finde it necessary to export all the Corn we can, we eat very little Fish,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34974:55"/>
and have made Acts against the importation of Forreign Cattle (which by the way gave a <hi>Monopoly</hi> to a few English and Welch breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Counties on all the rest of the Nation,) and yet we thought our markets over-clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>But <hi>England</hi> is not only prejudiced by the paucity of people, but we have another rank of Statutes which hinder very many of those we have from applying themselves to Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture: one is the Stat. of 43<hi>th. Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. which according to the intention of it seems necessary now when we have such a vast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of poor; but such is the Arbitrary lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude given by the Act to Over-seers and Justices, that many of our Laborious people well able to work, by clamour or favour get Parish maintenances, choosing rather to live lazily by this means, assisted with some pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
            <p>Then we have the Stat. of 5<hi>th. Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. which (though it gratifies the blinde avarice of some of our Corporation men) is more prejudicial, by restraining our people to work in Manufacture, unless they have served an <hi>Apprentiship full seaven years,</hi> which is so long a term of drudgery and slavery before they can reap any fruit of their labors, that Parents are deterred from putting their Children Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices to Manufacture; nor will many of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34974:56"/>
our Youths or young men be brought to it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the most apt and docile, and those of ripeness of years, of which many would be more perfect in 3 or 4 years then others in 10, and therefore they betake themselves to other more easy and ready Imployments, or else live Idle.</p>
            <p>The same Act does very strangely provide that no man shall take an <hi>Apprentice</hi> for Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufacture in any Town Corporate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse such <hi>Apprentice</hi> be his Son, or the Father or Mother of such <hi>Apprentice</hi> have the clear yearly vallue of 40<hi>s.</hi> Inheritance, nor in any Market-Town or Village unlesse he be his Son, or his Father or Mother have the clear yearly value of 3<hi>l.</hi> Inheritance, which clause apparently shuts out at least 5 parts of the people in 6, from the Woollen Manufacture; and by consequence tends to the <hi>depopulation</hi> of our Inland Towns, the increase of Rogues, Vagabonds and poor; These difficulties on Trade begot the Act of the 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of the like nature, and thereby much work for our Justices.</p>
            <p>Which by the way may give occasion to observe how vain it is to make Acts against Rogues, Vagabonds, or Poor, nay against thefts or Murthers, how little the Houses of Correction, Whipping-posts, Pillories, or Gallows can prevail, whilst our other Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34974:56"/>
drive our People into necessities, nor any <hi>prohibitory or penal Law,</hi> ever have the intended effect, unless the <hi>Grounds and Causes</hi> of the mischiefs be removed; of which I shall say more when I come to speak of our late Prohibition of <hi>French</hi> Goods. Amongst the restraints on our <hi>English</hi> Trade, the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Trade to <hi>the Freemen of Corporations, and Guilds,</hi> may be deservedly mentioned as one.</p>
            <p>This Priviledge is claimed by most, or all of our <hi>ancient Corporations,</hi> and might be well intended at first by the Donors, but as now u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is very prejudicial; for the Power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Free-men being generally lodged in a Councel or Committee of <hi>a few Free-men,</hi> any Forreigner (and such they call all those who are not Sons or Apprentices of seven years standing to a Free-man in the same Town) must <hi>buy</hi> his Freedom before he can exercise any open Trade there; for which these Free-men are left at liberty to demand as great and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Price as they please, or if they will, may wholly refuse; whence it commonly follows, that Beginners in Manufacture, and other Trades, being Forreigners, and having but small Stocks, can never obtain Freedom, and without it are burthened and plagued with by-Laws, Penalties, Distresses, and Seizures; nay, if a Man be exquisite in his Trade, he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34974:57"/>
shall hardly get a Freedom for Money, in a Corporation where there are more free of the same Trade; for then he is lookt on as <hi>a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person,</hi> and likely to <hi>eat the bread out of their mouths,</hi> (as they phrase it) in which they will gratifie, and influence one another, being the common cause, and can easily do it: The fewer Free-men there are in a Trade, they think the rest may get the more; and thus are most of our ancient Corporations and Guilds become <hi>oppressive Oligarchies,</hi> excluding or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the <hi>English</hi> Subjects from Trading in our greatest and best situated Towns, where the <hi>Markets</hi> are; and which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the most proper and ready <hi>Seats</hi> for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, and other Commerce: For this, and the Act of the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> our Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-men have only this to say, That care ought to be taken, that none but persons <hi>skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> should exercise any Trade, which is true; but the Law of necessity, common sence, and experience, provides sufficiently for this, since an unskilful Artificer or Trader will not find imployment, and therefore must receive due punishment by his own <hi>Ignorance</hi>: 'Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, Manufactures may be made <hi>deceitfully,</hi> which may disgrace and prejudice our vent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; but this fraud is an Act of Skill, which cannot be discovered or prevented, without the daily scrutinies of Judicious Persons; for

which our other former Statutes have already made <hi>some provision,</hi> but <hi>defective</hi>; it were to be wished, there was a constant Judicature of Men knowing in Trade in every County to supervise the sufficiency of Manufactures: In the mean time this Argument for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Act of the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms must appear very fallacious, since both the Act and the Freedoms serve only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>English</hi> Subjects, and of those many of the most skilful, from Trade, and by inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Manufactures to a few, hinder their growth, and make them far dearer.</p>
            <p>A farther inconvenience of these Freedoms is, That <hi>the pre-emption of our Manufactures, and Imported Goods,</hi> in most of our inferiour Corporations and Cities, as well as in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> is in a manner inclosed to the <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Stocks</hi> of the Free-men, and is very much subject to their pleasures, by reason of their union and correspondence in Counsels: So that he who would escape the long Land-Carriages to <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>London</hi> Companies, must fall into the hands of these other Free-men; these Free-men have generally so brave a time of it, that they can live in ease and plenty, (every Shop resembling an Office) whilst the laborious part of our Traders are ready to perish; which Priviledges could not have survived the Statute of 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> against
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34974:58"/>
Monopolies, but that they are <hi>saved by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Proviso in that Statute; so civil were the Burgesses of Corporations at that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Trade being thus clogged, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Avenues to Manufactures so much narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and choaked up, it doth not a little help to the subverting of our Manufactures, and other Trade, that the Passages to other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments are made so open and easie, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I mean all those that depend <hi>upon Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> in which our Youth are led from step to step by all manner of Incouragements; First, by the multitude of our late endowed <hi>Free-Schools,</hi> where every ordinary Man's Son is taught <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for a small matter; and then is above Manufacture: Then we have two mighty endowed Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, where there will, at least, be hope of preferment, let the throng be never so thick; and thence they have farther and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable prospects; and in the mean time live easie, at little or no charge, as Servitors, or on small Stipends, till they become Scholars of Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others of these Free-Sehool-Boys grow Pen-men of all sorts; and all these are a sort of <hi>Gentlemen-like</hi> ways of living, which intitle them to be called <hi>Masters,</hi> which gives a main temptation both to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Children; who on the other hand, see the <hi>contemptible</hi> and <hi>miserable</hi> condition of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34974:58"/>
our poor Clothworkers, and other ordinary Artificers, who at the best are called <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Fellows</hi>; and what is yet farther mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous is, that our Youth thus educated, never reading any thing of Manufacture, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, or Importation, in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> or their Colledge Notes, and being from thence carried to other Studies, which have no cognation with Trade, can ordinarily have no sensation of the advantages of it; like a Bowl which hath a rub at hand, the farther they go, the more they are divided from it; whence it hath unfortunately ensued, that our <hi>Men of Learning</hi> are either generally si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in this matter, or else, being inclin'd to think it the sole concern of the <hi>dirty</hi> and <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> part of the People, speak of it with contempt, and some with reflection; by whom most others being influenced, we are still pretending to be more accurate in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and Philosophy, (which howsoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise useful, do not add two-pence a year to the Riches of the Nation) we continue to squeeze all the sapless Papers and Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Antiquity</hi>; we grow mighty well acquainted with the old <hi>Heathen-gods, Towns,</hi> and <hi>People</hi>; we prize our selves in fruitless Curiosities; we turn our Lice and Fleas into Bulls and Pigs by our <hi>Magnifying-glasses</hi>; we are searching for the World in the Moon with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34974:59"/>
our <hi>Telescopes</hi>; we send to weigh the Air on the top of <hi>Teneriffe</hi>; we invent <hi>Pacing Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,</hi> and Gimcracks of all sorts; all which are voted Ingenuities, whilst the Notions of Trade are turned into Ridicule, or much out of fashion.</p>
            <p>In all which we are very short of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies of our Neighbours, the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> and other trading and wise Nations; who on the one hand have no Laws or Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to restrain or exclude their People from Manufacture, nor to Ferret them away; and on the other, do consider <hi>Trade</hi> as an <hi>Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and almost <hi>Sacred</hi> thing, and do highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and cherish their Manufacturers, as well as their other necessary Traders.</p>
            <p>Now should these restraints and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements ono ur own People and Trade be removed, it would doubtless much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage our Trade in some time; but would not bring us so sudden an increase of People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers, Ships, and Riches, as is highly requisite for the carrying on of a mighty Trade, or perhaps for our National security; nor can these so suddenly be had, but from other parts of the World, where they are moving; Men, Ships, or Riches, do not grow on the Trees, nor yet drop out of the Clouds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:34974:59"/>But we have such another rank of Laws against <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,</hi>

               </note> since they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34974:60"/>
allow free Ports, free Trade, and all other National Freedoms to Forreigners; whereby their People of all sorts, their Navigation and Stocks in Trade, have increased conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>

            <p>There are yet others of our Laws, which must prejudice our Trade of all sorts, and give a farther advantage to the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> I mean those which inflict Penalties on <hi>Protestant Dissenters</hi>; not only because they may hinder the transplanting of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Protestant Artificers, or Merchants, but because they disable many of those we have in <hi>England</hi> already, from carrying on any manner of Trades; and if so, then in effect they are not People, since they cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the ends of People, but are rather the <hi>Trunks and Signs of Men in a Nation,</hi> their Industries and ingenuities being lock'd up; Suppose two or 300000 of our own People disabled, it may be presumed more than a Million <hi>per Annum</hi> loss to the Nation; what
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34974:60"/>
then may be our loss by the shutting out a far greater number? perhaps ten times the number of Forreign <hi>Protestants,</hi> and those of the richest the most mercantile, and the best Manufacturers of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is the Case of dissenting Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in <hi>England,</hi> must be very plain to those who shall consider the Statute of 20 <hi>l.</hi> a month, and those Volumes of other Statutes made before and since the King came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>; most of which were intended against Papists, and occasioned by former Popish Treasons, but reach all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Dissenters, who, besides the bare Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, are liable to the daily charge and trouble of <hi>Informations, Actions,</hi> and <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in our Courts of <hi>Law,</hi> and as many or more <hi>Libels and Presentments</hi> in our <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi>; our <hi>Constables, Church-wardens,</hi> and <hi>Grand-Juries</hi> are upon their Oaths constantly bound to accuse them; if they omit, 'tis at <hi>every other Mans pleasure</hi> to inform, and some or other will not fail of it; thus are Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters brought into the hands of the <hi>Officers</hi> of both Courts, whose duty it is to prosecute; these may delay for a time, whilst they are <hi>paid for their favours,</hi> or until <hi>notice</hi> be taken of it, but no longer, and then must follow a Seizure of Dissenters <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Estates,</hi> or both: Besides all which, particular <hi>Justices
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34974:61"/>
of the Peace</hi> are by several late Statutes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and obliged to <hi>Convent, Convict, and make Levies</hi>; which sufferings being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a continual <hi>Anxiety of mind,</hi> our <hi>Protestant</hi> Dissenters cannot possibly apply themselves or their Stocks to Manufacture or other Trade.</p>
            <p>Whilst, on the other hand,<note place="margin">See Sir <hi>William Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Chap.</hi> of Religion.</note> both the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and most other of our neighbouring Nations, any thing famous for Trade, allow Liberty of Conscience to <hi>Protestant</hi> Dissenters, at least to such a degree, <hi>as to enable them to trade:</hi> Which is all that the Interest of Trade requires; 'tis true, that now of late we have heard the <hi>French King</hi> hath given some greater discountenance to Protestants than heretofore, (whether to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy, who may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise very useful to his present designs, and whom he daily and visibly endears by all sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal demonstrations of favour, (if we may believe our Gazets) or for what other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I shall not undertake to say) however not so, as <hi>to disable</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Protestants from Trade.</p>
            <p>What farther hardships he may put upon <hi>French</hi> Protestants, or other his Trading Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in case they shall have no other <hi>Asylum</hi> or <hi>Shelter</hi> to repair to, time may shew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:34974:61"/>This being the Case in the matter of Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between us and these our subtile and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Neighbours, the Question is, what is to be done? A long <hi>Surfeit</hi> of experience hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, that the Penal Laws, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated and imbittered to as great a degree as hath been desired, are not a sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to reduce Protestant Dissenters. To purpose any thing which shall subvert our present Church of <hi>England,</hi> is that which I shall not do; conceiving it for the honour and safety of the Nation to support a <hi>flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing</hi> National Church, and that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Protestant Church of</hi> England hath in all respects the best Title to it.</p>
            <p>On the other side, to rest under our present Disadvantages by the want of a convenient Toleration of Dissenting Protestants, must disable us from making that sudden, and full improvement of our Trade, as otherwise we might, and as perhaps may be found necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for our support against those Forreigners who already do, and daily will more exceed us in <hi>Treasures and People,</hi> if they shall let in, and we continue to shut out, so mighty a share of each.</p>
            <p>Here then there seems a difficulty, which deserves and requires our utmost prudentials to clear, by a <hi>Toleration of Protestant Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> consistent with the preservation of our

present <hi>Church of England</hi> in all its Rights; I am perswaded none of the <hi>Generous Dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> or Members of our Church, would oppose such a Toleration; some there have been, who could never think themselves happy, unless o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were miserable, and have loved Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for Cruelty's sake; the most infamous for this was <hi>Phalaris,</hi> who was at last brought to roar in his own <hi>Brazen Bull</hi>; nor is this a time for Men to gratifie their humors or passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this way, if it may prove perilous towards the whole; rather let our Hearts melt with a tender and charitable Commiseration to these our Fellow-Country-men, who by their Birth-right are intitled to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with our selves, but are incapacitated to enjoy the advantages of it, meerly for <hi>Conscience,</hi> when by no other overt Act they have forfeited their Hereditary Claims, when their sufferings undeniably demonstrate they are no <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and therefore that they suffer for what they <hi>cannot help</hi>; let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that <hi>God</hi> never planted or propagated his Truth by <hi>Temporal Power,</hi> that he was in the <hi>small Voice,</hi> not in the <hi>Thunder,</hi> or the <hi>Whirl-wind:</hi> Let us consider the <hi>original meekness</hi> of Christians, whose <hi>Anathema's</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Dissenters were only accompanied with <hi>Admonishments,</hi> and meer <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> without any <hi>Writ</hi> to take the <hi>Body,</hi>

               </note> as the chief <hi>Gemms</hi> which truly beautifie our <hi>present Church:</hi> Let it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be said, that the <hi>Interests</hi> or <hi>Temperaments</hi> of our present Church are <hi>inconsistent</hi> with our National <hi>Wealth, Happiness,</hi> and <hi>Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or <hi>obstruct our progress</hi> towards them; this would give too great an advantage to her publick and private Enemies: Let us indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously amass all the just Considerations we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34974:63"/>
can to facilitate <hi>these great ends,</hi> by some Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Protestant</hi> Dissenters, being it is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, I say of <hi>Protestant</hi> Dissenters, because these having no forreign dependance on the <hi>Pope,</hi> have reason to be endeared and knit up to the National Interest by the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and security of their Estates and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, equally with the rest: As for the <hi>Popish Party,</hi> I am confident that after so many late accurate Treatises, and Authentick Narratives, of the dangerous Principles, and horrid treasonable Practises, of the Priests, and others of the same Party, none will think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, or possible, that I should add one sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prove that Party unfit for a Toleration.</p>
            <p>Such being the high Motives to make us wish for a Toleration of <hi>Protestant</hi> Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I shall, with all deference to Authority, and without any of those passionate reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which usually incumber this debate, brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to examine the dangers object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are,</p>
            <p>First, an apprehension of a necessary great <hi>increase of Dissenters,</hi> and this (as <hi>some</hi> will have it) to such a degree, as to swallow up the present Church; a very strange <hi>suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for those who have <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> on their side: On the contrary, it may be justly hoped, that the <hi>Church of</hi> England may then reconcile all those whom <hi>Penalties</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34974:63"/>
reduce; and the rather, because when the <hi>Penalties</hi> are gone, all Parties must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to <hi>reasoning</hi> and <hi>sanctity,</hi> which are the proper and only means of making Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Mens <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> and <hi>Consciences; Penalties</hi> may bring in <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> but can never work a real change in any Mans <hi>opinion,</hi> unless when the sufferings of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters proselyte others, (being a kind of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the truth of what is so asserted, at least amongst the vulgar or middle sort;) our present Protestant <hi>Church of</hi> England must therefore have an advantage this way; and yet on the other side, will retain that of being vindicated by the Government, in as much as all publick <hi>Divine Service</hi> in the Parish Churches will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the form now used in our <hi>present Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> observes, that after the Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> the other Party in Religion having the <hi>countenance of the State,</hi> and the Prescription and Possession of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years to confirm the same, is in as prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a condition, both for Power and Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as any that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the Authority of the Popes of <hi>Rome. Geogr.</hi> 176.</note> and all <hi>Church preferments</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed to the Clergy of the same Church; which Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, being consistent with a Toleration, may continue secured to our Church by our present Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws in force for that purpose, with an addition of such others as may be thought necessary; whence it will follow;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34974:64"/>
first, that it will be more for the <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,</hi> nay and Interest of the Laicks to conform, rather than to seek farther for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Conventicles, whose Ministers they must help to maintain; which <hi>Convenience,</hi> with the <hi>Countenance</hi> of <hi>Authority</hi> given to the National Church, is a great matter, since it will bring in all those, who being good Christians in the main, are yet little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Points in difference, which are the <hi>generality,</hi> as may be seen by their equal resort to the Parish Churches before and since His Majesties Restoration. But se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it will then be yet more the interest and advantage of all Clergy-men to conform, by the great and <hi>Honourable preferments</hi> they may this way hope for, which they cannot otherwise obtain.</p>
            <p>The other grand Objection against a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of <hi>Protestants,</hi> is the danger of the Temporal Government; which seems yet stranger than the other, if we consult our <hi>Reasons,</hi> which must tell us, that Men at <hi>ease</hi> will be better satisfied than when in <hi>pain</hi>; that Men who are kept innocently and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably <hi>busie,</hi> who by their Industry can live well, support their Families, and gain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, will be less apt to study, or do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Publick, than those, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disabled from all such Imployments, are
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34974:64"/>
daily goaded with penal Laws, a condition which perhaps may be thought more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in <hi>England</hi> than the like hardships in <hi>Turky</hi> and <hi>Muscovy,</hi> where all suffer alike, when in <hi>England</hi> our Protestant Dissenters hear much of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and see others enjoy the full fruit of it, but are precluded themselves, and this for meer differings in Religions belief. But why should I labour to evince that which <hi>Experience</hi> hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated; we have the great Instance of <hi>France,</hi> and the like in the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> in <hi>Holland, Switzerland, Hamburg,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Germany</hi>; All which Nations have been at peace, at least about Religion ever since the Tolerations given, as some of them could never be before, particularly <hi>France</hi>; which must appear to proceed from the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifique virtue</hi> of Toleration, not from the <hi>coercive</hi> power of <hi>Standing Forces,</hi> or <hi>despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Monarchy,</hi> as some would have it, because <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> is <hi>regulated,</hi> and the rest are <hi>Republicks.</hi> 'Tis notorious that before the <hi>French</hi> Toleration many of that National Church had or pretended to have as fearful Apprehensions of the effects of it; but we see what Councils did prevail even amongst the <hi>Popish Party,</hi> and what hath followed? We find <hi>France</hi> the most powerful of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the <hi>French</hi> King so confident of his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34974:65"/>
               <hi>Protestants,</hi> that he long intrusted his mighty Armies, in the hands of <hi>Monsieur Turenne,</hi> a <hi>Protestant</hi> till near his death: On the other side we have the Example of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose execrable and inexorable Cruelties towards dissenters hath mainly Assisted in the present poverty and weakness of that Nation: We may then conclude that Persecution is a stale piece of policy, which perhaps might have born a debate in <hi>Harry the</hi> 8<hi>th's time,</hi> but is now tryed to our hands: And let any man judg whether the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spanish Church</hi> be now most flourishing, or most likely to continue; the <hi>French Church</hi> and Church-men will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly get ground with the <hi>French Victories,</hi> for which they are as much beholding to the French <hi>Protestants</hi> as to the rest. Let us not therefore be wholly insensible that the Church of <hi>England</hi> may fall under the worst circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of danger, otherwise than from <hi>Protestant</hi> Dissenters; as suppose <hi>England</hi> should ever be reduced to such a condition as to be no longer able to bear up against foreign Powers, what then would become of our <hi>present Church?</hi> what sort of men would then push into our <hi>Bishopricks, Deaneries,</hi> and other Church-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments? a Fatality which we ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to provide against by a Union of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant interests and affections and increase of Traders, as far as safely we may; in which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34974:65"/>
Foreigners are grown so nicely vigilant, that not long ago we might observe the policies of the great <hi>French King</hi> and the great <hi>Duke of Tuscany</hi> curiously Angling for the <hi>Jews</hi>; for when the <hi>French King</hi> had made <hi>Marseilles</hi> a free Port (which was about 12 years since) the <hi>Jews</hi> planted at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> induced by an offer of protection at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and a sweeter situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on of that place, resolved to transplant, which the Great <hi>Duke</hi> discovering, applyed his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavours to prevent it; which he did by making an Edict, That if any Christian bought a Jews house, it should be forfeit. In <hi>England</hi> a Jew cannot buy a house. I am no Advocate for Dissenters or Jews, but for the <hi>Common Interest</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by which that of the Church of <hi>England</hi> must stand or fall. And being now speaking of somewhat that concerns Religion, there occur to my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry two plain Texts of Scripture, one is, <hi>that of two evils we are to choose the least,</hi> and another that a <hi>Kingdom divided cannot stand.</hi> I shall desire the Reader to couple these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with what I shall say in the following Sections concerning the present posture of this and our Neighbour Nations, and then he will not accuse me of having made an unnecessary digression.</p>
            <p>Whilst we are calculating the best expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bring in <hi>forreign</hi> Protestant Artificers,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34974:66"/>
and <hi>forreign</hi> Manufacture, it is fit that notice should be taken of that Clause in the Act of 21 of King <hi>James chap.</hi> 3. which leaves the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venters of new Manufactures at liberty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Patents</hi> for <hi>Monopolies</hi> for one and twenty years, which Statute being in <hi>construction</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all Manufactures already used by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners that are not used here, hinders the introducing, or growth and perfection of any new forreign Manufactures, and makes it the business of our more observant Travellers to hauk after Monopolies.</p>
            <p>This is no question but several other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions to the Trade of <hi>England</hi> might be observed, particularly that the carrying on of <hi>Elections</hi> in Corporations of latter years with so much drinking, is very prejudicial to our Manufactures; for men (upon this or any other occasion) being once <hi>debauched,</hi> hardly ever retrieve themselves, and therefore lost to Manufacture and the Nation.</p>
            <p>Our Fishers have complained that in several parts they are forced to pay <hi>Tyth</hi> for the <hi>Fish</hi> they catch on their own Coasts, in which the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and other Fishermen have the advantage to the value of the Fish, and must therefore disable our Trade of Fishery in those parts.</p>
            <p>It hath also been noted that the payment of <hi>Tyth</hi> out of our <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> does as much disable the increase of Hemp and Flax in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:34974:66"/>
the rest being made so much the dearer to the owner, that it is not vendible, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would be; and thereby prevent our great forreign Importation of Hemp and Flax. These being things of so great Importance to the Nation, may deserve a full Examination and remedy, whatsoever the particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of some Incumbents of Churches may sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we have a farther complaint from the Traders of all sorts, of the tedious and chargeable proceedings in some Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, occasioned by <hi>Writs of Error,</hi> and <hi>Suits in Chancery,</hi> in which last Court many are hung up for seven years and more, and are forced to expend much more than the money they justly sue for: <hi>Our little Courts,</hi> especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London,</hi> are as destructive to poor Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Manufacturers and other laborious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where in a Suit for a disputable Groat, or meer malice, they are easily lead in, or forced to spend three or four pound; if but thirty or forty shillings 'tis enough to ruine such poor wretches and their Families, which hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many thousands to perish in Goal, or fly from their Habitations and Countrey, since the erection of several new inferior Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>Here again we may look back and observe the mischievous effects of private and mistaken
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34974:67"/>
Interests, pride and humor; which I shall not recapitulate, but should here conclude this Section; but that having mentioned the <hi>greatness</hi> of our <hi>Customs</hi> amongst the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances on our Trade, I am willing to clear my self from insinuating or wishing any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of His Majesties Revenue; nor would the moderation of the Customs work any such effect, (at least in the Judgments of wise men who have considered it) were the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions on our Trade regulated; of this Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> took notice of very early in his Observations upon Trade, presented to <hi>King James,</hi> in these words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Of this their smallness of Custom, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Holland, Hamburgh,</hi> &amp;c.) inwards and outwards, we have daily experience; for if two <hi>English</hi> Ships, or two of any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> both laden with Wine of 300 Tun apiece, the one bound for <hi>Holland,</hi> or any other the Petit States, the other for <hi>England</hi>; the Merchant shall pay above 900 <hi>l.</hi> here, and other duties, when the other in <hi>Holland,</hi> or any other Petit State shall be cleared for 50 <hi>l. and so in all other Wares and Merchandizes accordingly</hi>; which draws all Nations to traffick with them; and although it seems but small duties which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, yet the multitudes of all kind of Commodities and Coin that is brought
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34974:67"/>
there, and carryed out by themselves and others, is so great, that they receive more Customs and Duties to the State by the greatness of their Commerce in one year, than <hi>England</hi> doth in two years; for the 100<hi>th</hi> part of the Commodities are not spent in <hi>Holland,</hi> but vented into other Countries; which make all the Country-Merchants to buy and sell, and increase Ships and Mariners to transport them.</p>
               <p>My travels and meaning is not, neither hath been, to diminish your Majesties Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, but exceedingly to increase them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Nations may buy and sell freely in <hi>France,</hi> and there is free Custome outwards twice a year; at which times our Merchants do there make their Sales of <hi>English</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and do buy and lade their Bulk with <hi>French</hi> Commodities to serve for the whole year; and in <hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>Brittain,</hi> free Custom all the year long; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept some small Toll, which makes free Traffick, and makes them flourish.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To this he adds an Instance in <hi>Genoua,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Store-house of <hi>Italy:</hi> But after they had set a Custom of 16 <hi>per Cent.</hi> all Nations left trading with them; but that on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the <hi>Duke of</hi> Florence, by setting a <hi>small Custom</hi> at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> had brought all the Trade thither: Thus did this great Man of his time express himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:34974:68"/>But admitting, that by the moderation of our Customs Rates, our present publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue in Customs should be somewhat sunk; yet how easily might this Revenue be made good by a Land-Tax, or by some <hi>Excise</hi> upon Extravagancies, and Forreign consumptive Commodities spent at home, without the least prejudice to Trade? Thus do the <hi>Dutch</hi> raise far more than the Revenue of our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms; and if by this means the private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of our Land must universally rise, and the People better be enabled to pay any other Taxes, why should the Land-holders, or any on pretence of Service to His Majesty, oppose it? Suppose His Majesty had a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of 5 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound on all the <hi>English</hi> Treasure exported, would any Man for the sake of the Custom, and out of zeal to His Majesties Interest, promote the Exportation of all the <hi>English</hi> Treasure? How much this is the Case of the present <hi>English</hi> Customs, doth, and more largely will appear.</p>
            <p>Certainly it was very unfortunate for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> That when Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> wrote these and other his excellent Observations on Trade, our Councels were under an earnest pursuit of the <hi>Plantation-Trade,</hi> on which great Customs were projected; for so it hath hapned, that whilst our Neighbour Nations have been vigilant to ease and facilitate their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34974:68"/>
ways of Trade, the Trade of <hi>England</hi> hath continued under the former disadvantage, and is incumbred with new charges and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of later years; all which in Conjunction have worked us out in all the Particulars mentioned before, and in divers others; and in recompence of these losses, our <hi>Plantation-Trade</hi> hath robbed and prevented us of some Millions of our People; amongst which very many being, or might have been Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers, the Nation hath also lost many more Millions of Pounds in the loss of their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> That a Nation may grow poor by Forreign Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> by an excess of meer Importations, illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some Observations; this facilitated by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Money or Bullion; the fatal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and Symptoms of a Consumptive Trade, decay of Manufactures, other ways of living over-stocked, fall of Rents, general Poverty, an increase of Criminals of all sorts, Depopulation; some Application to the present Case of <hi>England,</hi> and amongst others the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the new Buildings about <hi>London;</hi> of Incontinency, Cunning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>AS a <hi>Nation</hi> may grow <hi>Rich and Populous,</hi> and consequently <hi>strong</hi> by Forreign Trade; so may a Nation grow <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:34974:69"/>
and consequently <hi>weak</hi> by Forreign Trade; nor is there any possible or practicable way for the Treasure of a Nation in peace, to be exhausted and exported into another Nation to any considerable and sensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but by Forreign Trade.</p>
            <p>This must necessarily happen by the excess of <hi>meer Importation,</hi> viz. when the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities imported from abroad, and spent at home, do cost more than the National gain by Trade amounts to; as suppose such yearly Importations into <hi>England</hi> should cost two Millions, and the National gain by Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or otherwise should amount but to 1500000 <hi>l.</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> of <hi>England</hi> must year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lose 500000 <hi>l</hi> of its Treasure by Trade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so much must yearly be exported by the <hi>English</hi> Merchants to satisfie the over-ballance.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>English</hi> Trade might fall into such a Consumption, is easily and highly credible.</p>
            <p>For suppose the utmost neat gain of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>English</hi> Trade amounted to but 300000 <hi>l. per An'</hi> one year with another; then if the Exportations and beneficial Merchandize of <hi>England</hi> should become worse by 400000 <hi>l. per An'</hi> one year with another than before, the <hi>Nation</hi> of <hi>England</hi> must lose 100000 <hi>l. per An'</hi> of its National Treasure, though our yearly Importations be no more in value than before; whence it appears, that by this
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34974:69"/>
means the <hi>same Importations</hi> may become <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So though our Exportations, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial part of our Merchandize, continue as valuable as before, yet if our yearly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Importations grow to be more in value by 400000 <hi>l. per An'</hi> than before, the Nation must also in this case lose 100000 <hi>l. per An'</hi> by Trade.</p>
            <p>But what if both the beneficial part of the Trade grow worse, and also the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations increase? Certainly this must cut deepest on the National Stock, and must soonest grind it out; for then if the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part grow worse by 400000 <hi>l.</hi> and the Importing part be increased 400000 <hi>l. per An'</hi> value, the Nation must then lose 500000 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> or suppose but to half those values in each, the Nation must lose 100000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To accommodate these Hypotheses to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> first, we may conclude, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial part of our Trade hath grown much less and worse yearly, by reason of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal cloggs and difficulties on our Home and Forreign Trade.</p>
            <p>And that on the other side our Importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must as necessarily be increased, both by the decay of our own former Manufactures at home, and by our modern gawd'ry and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34974:70"/>
of foreign Goods; and as our Trade from Port to Port hath become more impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable to any advantage, the Exporters of our remaining Manufactures and other home-Commodities, must either come back empty, or else must freight themselves homewards with such consumptive foreign Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as for Gawdry, Novelty, Cheapness, or Lyquorishness, will dazle, tempt and bewitch our People to buy them; in which course of Trade our Merchants may gain considerable proportions of our remaining Treasures as long as there is any in the Nation.</p>
            <p>Nay, rather than sit idle, they will, and do freight themselves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with meer Ballast and <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> (by which the Importation of foreign Bullion or money is prevented:<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mun</hi> of Foreign Trade, Chap. 12. <hi>p.</hi> 83, to 92. and that the over ballance of Trade in any particular Country; causes the Exchange to be high, so that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of money shall save the Merchant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> or more, as the exchange is.</note>) or if Bills of Exchange cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be had (as they usually cannot to those Countries where we are overballanced in Trade) then they export Mony and Bullion, and buy and import Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Goods which are spent at home; which kind of Trade deserves rather to be called <hi>Foreign Pedling,</hi> than Merchandise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:34974:70"/>It may partly be remembred here, how much the beneficial part of our Trade may be prejudiced by the loss of 100000 of our Manufactures, and what odds the same loss may produce in our Importations, since if they get but 6 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> a peice, it must sink the former gain by Trade no less than 600000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the other side, that if a <hi>Million</hi> of Families or Persons in a Nation, do one with the other consume to the value of 20 <hi>s. a piece</hi> more, yearly in foreign Manufactures, Drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than before, this must increase our Importations to the value of a Million <hi>per Ann.</hi> which I observe here to shew how imperceptibly an over-ballance of Importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may creep upon a Nation; and that the Reader may with the less difficulty conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture at the late and present ballance of Trade in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must also much assist this Importing Trade, if the Merchants shall export Mony, or Bullion; especially in such a Nation as <hi>England,</hi> where a Trade from Port to Port is not ordinarily practicable to any advantage: for in that Case the Goods Imported being spent at home, the Treasure Exported must be lost to the Nation; and as long as the English Merchant can have Bullion or Mony to Export, and can have a vent for his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34974:71"/>
at home, his private gain will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver oblige him to complain of the want of Exportable home-Manufactures, or the Clogs upon Trade, especially in <hi>England,</hi> where our Merchants have such a <hi>Monopoly</hi> of their Importations on the rest of the People.</p>
            <p>This Consumptive Importing Trade must be of very fatal Consequence in its Nature; for first, whilest the National Stock is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will exhaust the Treasure almost <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly</hi>; but as the Treasure grows less and less, it will work more <hi>palpably and grievou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly,</hi> because it will consume more and more of that little which remains.</p>
            <p>And as the National Treasure comes to be more and more diminished, the People must generally have less and less, which must cause the price of all home-Commodities, and consequently <hi>Land-Rents</hi> to fall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, the home Manufactures must be choaked and stifled by Importations, so that both the Farmers and Manufacturers must fling up; the values of their Stocks must be contracted, and will be eaten out by Rent, Wages and other standing charges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are aware; men cannot provide against misfortunes which have unseen Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and as home trade grows worse and worse, Industry it self must be tired and foil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the great amazement, as well as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:34974:71"/>For at the same time <hi>Liberty and Property</hi> may remain inviolated, many <hi>Merchants</hi> shall grow rich and shall be well satisfied as long as there is <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> at home; so shall their <hi>Retailers</hi> and <hi>Salesmen</hi> of foreign Wares, such are Mercers, Lacemen, Linnen-Drapers, Exchange-men, Grocers, Vintners and most others; there may seem to be the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation for a time, the <hi>Customs</hi> must also necessarily much increase as the Importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons increase (especially in <hi>England</hi> where the Customs on Importations are so high) and by that means may cause a reputation and <hi>sound</hi> of Trade amongst many, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed such a swelling of the Customs does on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denounce their growing poverty and ruine.</p>
            <p>It may be these ranks of men, who stand not in the direct Channel of Trade, may seem to flourish for a time, as <hi>Officers, Lawyers, Physitians,</hi> and others; nay perhaps some <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers</hi> may have greater opportunities of gain during the first Convulsions of a growing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; since the necessities of men obliging them to be more Criminous, it may for a while occasion greater and more frequent gratuities, and a more absolute subservience; so may many Lawyers get more than ever whilst mens Estates are rending to pieces, (<hi>as doubless did some Bricklayers get Estates by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34974:72"/>
the burning of the City</hi>) So perhaps sickly men whilst they can, may strain hard to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> of their <hi>Physitians</hi> with as good Fees as before, so some <hi>Clergy-men Scriveners</hi> and <hi>Pen-men</hi> of all sorts, Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and such others may seem to stem the torrent better than the <hi>Landholders</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers,</hi> whose Revenues immediately depend on the home-market, and who make up the gross body and strength of a Nation, many of these former rankes of men (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ease themselves) may seem insensible of the Common Afflictions, but must be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually involved with the rest.</p>
            <p>And the sooner, because as men fling up their Farms and Manufactures, and others are discouraged, multitudes of those that want Imployments, observing what other sorts of men continue to live at some ease, will naturally and inevitably throng them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the like, <hi>viz. importing Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, Retayling, Shop-keeping, the Law, Clergy, and Priesthood of all sorts, Offices, Scrivening, Solliciting, and Physick</hi>: by which these Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments must be so over-clogged, that they will be hardly able to live by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; vast numbers of others must betake themselves to <hi>Inn-keeping, Ale-keeping, Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aling, &amp;c.</hi> and those who have little or no stocks or literature, and therefore cannot
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34974:72"/>
crowd themselves into some of these ways of Livelihood must lye on the Parish, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing higher or worse minded must fall to <hi>Cheating, Canting, Shifting, Perjury, Forgery, Whoredom, Sherking, Chipping, Coyning, Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooning, Tumbling, Pimping, Pilfering, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, &amp;c.</hi> for their ordinary maintenances; the more honest or industrious will transport themselves into <hi>foreign parts,</hi> as soon as they have opportunity, rather than live misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at home, especially if they have an <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Plantations</hi> to go to; nor is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible (as I conceive) for any Laws or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties effectually to restrain the swelling numbers of any of the former professions, but by opening the beneficial and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Imployments of Manufactures, Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor can the daily increase of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, or of Frauds, Perjuries and Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of all sorts be otherwise corrected; <hi>no Statutes,</hi> nay, or <hi>Preaching,</hi> though never so <hi>learned</hi> or <hi>florid,</hi> can prevail with necessitous men.</p>
            <p>But the increase of these former more Gentleman-like, Scholar-like, Retailing and Shopkeeping-Imployments, must yet bring a farther inconvenience, <hi>viz.</hi> a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>affectation of Finery and Gawdery</hi> than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for these being sedentary and easie professions, will not only admit of, but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34974:73"/>
greater curiosity in Apparel, Modes, and dresses than the active and laborious ways of living by Farming or Manufactures. And as this Gawdery grows more in use it will spread amongst the rest, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple emulating one another, will be gawdy as long as they can, though never <hi>so poor</hi>; which must support and increase Foreign Importations, whilst every one is contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who shall have the <hi>finest Foreign Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> so will People thus at leisure most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fall into the habits of <hi>drinking</hi> and other ill Courses.</p>
            <p>Too many of these symptoms of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Trade may be generally observed in <hi>England</hi>; of late years any man who had but an indifferent Stock might have set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Tillage, Grazing, Daiery, Cloathing, Fulling, &amp;c.</hi> in almost any part of <hi>England,</hi> and might not only have maintained his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily plentifully, but as his Sock and Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity were more or less, might have left a fair Estate behind him; it was not extraordinary for a man thus employed to get an Estate of 3, or 4000 <hi>l.</hi> some 10, some 20, some 30000 <hi>l.</hi> whereas now, and of these later years these home-imployments have been the usual Shipwracks of mens Stocks and Estates in most parts of <hi>England,</hi> or so dull and cold that men can hardly endure to live so meanly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:34974:73"/>Our <hi>late Wealthy Yeomanry</hi> are impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, or much reduced in their stocks, a man shall hardly find three in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty able to rent 3, or 400 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> they are forced to <hi>sink their Rents</hi> on the Gentry continually, or else to fling up their Farms; much Land is fallen a fifth part, some a fourth part, some a third part, some to half of the late Rent, (unless in some few Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys in whose benefit the <hi>Irish</hi> Acts were made, and there Rents are not risen and are now like to fall low enough:) by which continual contracting of Rents the very earth seems to shrink and consume under us, and whilst many of our <hi>late opulent and mighty Gentry</hi> since the general decay of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues have been striving to support the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient honour and dignity of their Families, they are become immerged and fettered in inextricable debts and securities; great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our <hi>Clothiers</hi> and other Manufacturers are undone, or have given up; the rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under a languishing hope of better Markets: and multitudes of those people, whose Labours brought Mony, Trade and Comfort to our Corporations, are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come chargeable burthens: it being compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that our <hi>Poor</hi> are increased to near ten times their late number within this last twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, and that their maintenance doth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34974:74"/>
cost the Nation 400000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> constant Tax.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the increase of those sorts of men, whose Imployments either may prejudice, or else can add no increase of Treasure to the Nation, is very visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; by which increase the inconveniencies must be still the greater: for where the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade of a Nation is so much driven in importations, the increase of <hi>Merchants</hi> will oblige an increase of Importation; so an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of <hi>Retailers</hi> dealing in foreign Goods, will open a greater vent for Importations; suppose such a Retailer sells for 10 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> profit, the <hi>Nation</hi> must lose about nine pence for every peny he gets, what then shall the Nation lose by the Trade of a Merchant or Retailer, who by <hi>vending Foreign Wares</hi> shall get an Estate of 10, or 2000 <hi>l.</hi> over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a profuse maintenance? Or what will it signifie to the Wealth or Glory of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or City, to have many such 10000 <hi>l. men</hi> as these? Have we any reason to rejoyce in such a flourishing Trade? These Retailers and Shop-keepers, gleaning the Mony from the People, hand it up to the <hi>Importers,</hi> who export this <hi>Commodity in Trade</hi> as occasion does require; and as our Manufactures have decayed, so have <hi>Shop-keepers</hi> of all sorts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased; our Cities and Corporations are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34974:74"/>
stuffed with them more and more; there being at least ten times more in the Nation than were 20, or 30 years since.</p>
            <p>Thus also have we multitudes of more <hi>Lawyers, Attorneys, Solicitors, Scriviners, and Pen-men of all sorts,</hi> than of late years we had; which occasions more Querks, Tricks, and Cheats in the Law. We have vastly more <hi>Scholars and Clergy-men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Author of the grounds and reasons of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the English Clergy. <hi>pag.</hi> 141.</note> which a Late Author observing, thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to export <hi>Tunns of Divines</hi> instead of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: This does cause an universal compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for Benefices; of which the needy Laity taking advantage, make Simonaical presentations, and thence must follow perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Institutions, and thence seared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; but of all other Imployments we have the greatest questing after <hi>Offices</hi>; Men will almost give any thing, say any thing, or do any thing for an Office; so that some <hi>Offices</hi> which were thought hardly worth the medling with of late years, will now yeild near ten years purchase for one life, which competition hath also in a manner virtually repealed the Statute against buying and selling of Offices, and obliges those who buy trusts to sell trusts. We have also far more Physitians, men of Medicine and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34974:75"/>
Quacks, especially <hi>Pox-Doctors</hi> than ever, so have we (with our poverty) far more <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery and Gawdery,</hi> more <hi>Daintyness, Delicacy</hi> and <hi>Luxury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So have we a vast increase of <hi>Inn-keepers and Ale-keepers</hi> both in City and Country, by which the common-people are debauched, made impious, poor and effeminate: all which mischiefs do in union cause the vast increase of <hi>new Buildings</hi> in and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; for most of the Offices are in <hi>London,</hi> or there to be gotten, there is also the ready ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to Church-preferment, and the best and most easie Imployments for Lawyers, Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Scriviners, Physitians, and such others, and the rather, because the publick Taxes and Importing-trade drawing the mony up to <hi>London,</hi> it will there be stirring as long as we have any in the Nation; whilst the Country is left poorer and barer every day; and therefore besides these higher ranks of men, the ordinary People who used heretofore to begin upon Farming or Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, hearing of <hi>mony</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> do post from the starving Country, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the selling of Ale, Brandy, Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, Coffee, Brokery of all sorts, letting of Lodgings in or about <hi>London,</hi> and such like Imployments, which too commonly end in Bawdery and the Gallows, by which there
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34974:75"/>
is room made for new Comers and Tenants; I have heard it said, that <hi>Madrid</hi> is grown much bigger and more Populous of late years.</p>
            <p>From these and other sorts of People, both in City and Country, we have more and more <hi>Criminals</hi> of all the sorts and species mentioned before; our Goals are fuller and fuller, great numbers of which are yearly executed or transported; vast numbers of others have betaken themselves to voluntary exile from this their Native Country, in hopes of a better condition, rather than to endure certain poverty or persecution for Conscience at home; besides those gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Plantations,</hi> there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands of Protestants gone from us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and into <hi>Poland,</hi> where being Woollen Manufacturers, they have taught, and set up this Manufacture, and thereby helped to work our ruine. These being of the most strong and able part of our People, leave their Wives and Children, and other impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and lazy People at home.</p>
            <p>And thus shall a Nation be inevitably <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled,</hi> as well as impoverished by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Trade; Nay, it shall hinder the ordinary increase of People by procreation, especially in a Nation where <hi>venereal sins</hi> are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34974:76"/>
become general, habitual and shameless; for the People being poor, or vicious, or both, dare not, or care not to engage in the charge or virtuous Obligations of <hi>Marriage,</hi> (unless here and there where a man gets a Catch with a Wise which shall be equal to an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,) but will rather use unlawful <hi>promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Copulation,</hi> which breeds no Children, but infinite <hi>Claps and Poxes</hi> to the common weakning of Posterity, and present scandal of a Nation: (thus have our Women also lost their choice of Chapmen for Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands:) how many of our most beautiful Women (which might have made good and vertuous Wives, and brought forth num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of as beautiful Children,) are for want of convenient Matches tempted, or forced for a little mony, to sell their souls to the Devil, and their delicate bodies to lust and rottenness, nay to the Gallows, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with Child, the remains of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral modesty, will not in their extremities permit them to call Witnesses of their, shame whilst the <hi>Gallants</hi> which beget them go free, and glory in their great performance.</p>
            <p>All which mischiefs of a consumptive Trade are yet more fatal, because the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vice and poverty which attends it, will generally bring a languor and difficulty on mens understandings; as men sink in their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34974:76"/>
Estates, their Spirits and Thoughts will be lower and narrower, and their Minds cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with anxieties and cares, this (with the common disability of making advantages up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Forreigners in the course of Trade) leads them into a kind of unhappy <hi>Cunning,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the over-reaching of one another at home; and he will be accounted wise, who by any means can shift himself out of the common wants, nor will he think his own happiness small, (<hi>especially if his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings were low</hi>) when (like one standing on the Sands) he can behold the Shipwrack of others.</p>

            <head>SECT. IX. </head>
            <argument>
               <p>That a Consumptive Trade must render a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on still weaker and weaker: How far the meer establishment of Absolute Power, or meer Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property, may alter the Case.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FRom what hath been said in the first Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and since, it must also follow, that a <hi>Consumptive Trade</hi> must render a <hi>Nation</hi> still weaker and weaker.</p>
            <p>First, because it must still exhaust more and more of the National Riches, and sink the value of Mens Estates.</p>
            <p>If the value of private Stocks or Revenues are contracted, Men will be less and less able to pay publick <hi>Taxes</hi>; it is impossible for these
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34974:77"/>
that have no Money to pay Money, or for those that have less to pay as much as those that have more; and less Taxes must then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be more grievous than greater were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; if a Man having 100 <hi>l. per An'</hi> or 100 <hi>l.</hi> Stock, sink 40 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> of his Revenue or Stock, it is equal to any direct Tax of 40 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and then if a Tax or publick Charge of 5 or 10 <hi>l.</hi> be super-added, it is equal to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tax of 45 or 50 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must also disable a Nation to continue the <hi>Charge of a War,</hi> because the quantity of Money diffused amongst the People will soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be drawn out of the Home-Markets; and then they can no longer raise Taxes, and when the Taxes fail, what hope or dependance can there be in the courage of Officers, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, or Sea-men? or how shall the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Supplies of Warlike Provisions of all sorts be purchased at home or abroad?</p>
            <p>There are yet other Concomitants of a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poverty, which must render any Nation much the weaker, <hi>viz. discontents, uneasiness,</hi> and <hi>heart-burnings,</hi> which when begun, are easily fermented into <hi>Convulsions,</hi> by which a Nation may be disabled to exert even its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining strength.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Perfidy</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi> amongst all sorts; needy Men are readily tempted to make a Merchandize of their own Souls and other
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34974:77"/>
Mens Lives and Estates, and those who will betray one another for Money at home, will be equally wrought upon by forreign Money, and then may be brought to barter of both Princes and Countries; for being once cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, they must, <hi>like Women,</hi> for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main slavishly true to the Intrigue, lest the <hi>Gallant</hi> should tell, of which Histories give us many sad Examples.</p>
            <p>But in a Nation where the value of Land, or Home-Commodities, are risen 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> he that had 100 <hi>l.</hi> Revenue or Stock, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 40 <hi>l.</hi> Tax, retains what he had; and if the National Treasure be much greater, it will support the charge of a War much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and can hardly ever be totally exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where there is a considerable Annual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Treasure by Forreign Trade: This exuberance of a National Treasure will also generally support and secure the Spirit and Fidelity of all sorts of Men.</p>
            <p>It must therefore be of most dangerous consequence to a Nation impoverished by Trade, if any other neighbour-Nation hath at the same time grown much richer in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, since in the case of a War it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the like inequality of Power; nay if any such richer Nation shall think fit to keep great Armies and Navies in pay, (though in times of Peace) so must the poorer Nation,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34974:78"/>
or else be devoured at pleasure; and thus may a Nation, drained by the over-ballance of Trade, be beggered, and consequently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome without fighting, as hath been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated before.</p>
            <p>So if a Nation grow generally more viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, soft, effeminate, debauched, dispeopled, and undisciplined than before, it must be much weaker than before, wherein the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger must be much greater if any neighbour Nation grow far more warlike, more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and better disciplined than before.</p>
            <p>In which case the better situated, more useful, strong, plentiful, and blessed the Country so impoverished naturally is, and the more it doth abound in beautiful Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Women, or other delicacies, it will the more forcibly provoke the Appetite of a stronger Nation to its Conquest, the mighty <hi>Hunters</hi> of the World are for the most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prey; so if a Nation thus weakned hath formerly been famous and redoubled for Arms and War; those who affect glory by Conquest, must have the greater Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vassalize its People.</p>
            <p>From what hath been said it must appear; first, That a Nation must be estimated <hi>weak or strong by comparison,</hi> with the strength or weakness of Neighbour Nations; if a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nation grow ten times as strong as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34974:78"/>
the Nation which only retains its usual and former strength is <hi>weak</hi>; but the Case must be yet worse, if whilst the one hath grown <hi>ten times stronger, the other hath grown much weaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That in the present state of the World a Nation cannot grow poor by a consumptive Trade with any Security.</p>
            <p>In such a Case the <hi>meer absoluteness of a Monarchy</hi> would not prevent the approaching fatality, (which I add because <hi>Hobbs</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers call it a strong Government) absolute Power may suddenly force away that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which the People have, but cannot <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> any, nor can it carry on a War, or even <hi>support it self</hi> without continual <hi>vast expences</hi>; and then when the Treasure is drawn off into the hands of Officers and Soldiers, (who pay no Taxes) it will be found, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (who have it not) can no more make Brick without Straw in this Age, than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; and will be naturally desirous to change their Masters upon hope to be treated with less rigor.</p>
            <p>Nor on the other side will the meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of a <hi>legal Liberty and Property</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Nation thus impoverished, without a concurrent improvement of Trade, for the Reasons before given; the Blessings which usually attend these Freedoms wholly, or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34974:79"/>
very much depend upon the Riches the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are possessed of.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed these Freedoms make a necessary step towards the improvement of Trade; where an absolute Power is exerted, the conditions of Men are little better than that of Brutes, being continually lyable to Imprisonments, Death, and Confiscations, at the Pleasure of others; nay perhaps are worse, by the fears and terrors Men must be always under, even whilst they do not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally suffer; which will take away the edge and life of Industry, and will ruine or drive away the Merchants, and those who have Stocks in Manufacture, who neither will, nor can labour all their lives for Wealth under daily expectations of losing what they pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully get, which in this last Age hath obliged the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy to permit divers Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to their Manufacturers, and of late to their Fishers and other Maritime. Traders, which have now gotten the reputation of established Laws; at least they are such as are satisfactory <hi>to the French Natives,</hi> who cannot have, nor are acquainted with better terms, and who are of themselves so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that they stand in no need of Supplies of People from abroad; and therefore of no greater invitations of this nature to bring in Forreigners, and the rather, because their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34974:79"/>
Trade is otherwise so much eased and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, (of which I shall have occasion to say more;) so have the <hi>great Dukes of Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi> in this last Age been curiously vigilant to provide for the Freedom of Traders, both Domestick and Forreign: The <hi>Dutch, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Hamburghers,</hi> and other Trading States do yet farther secure the Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of their Natives, and others, under their several Jurisdictions, by fundamental and unalterable Constitutions</p>
            <p>Which being admitted, it doth not follow that a Nation which hath meer Liberty and Property, without other requisite incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, shall drive any great Trade; we have an Example in <hi>Genoa,</hi> at this day, a <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> where, because they set a Custom of 16 <hi>per Cent.</hi> on Goods Imported, they lost their Trade of Forreign Merchandize to <hi>Leghorne,</hi> made a free Port by the <hi>Duke of Tuscany</hi>; what then may we hope for from the meer Liberty and Property of the <hi>English,</hi> when in <hi>England</hi> the Customs are generally higher, and our other difficulties on Trade are yet more grievous than the Customs? by the Accompt we have from our first Discoverers and Planters in <hi>America,</hi> most of these poor Nations had a Home-Liberty and Property.</p>

            <p>This prodigious decrease of Coin in the last eighteen years, does undeniably evidence a vast decay in our Trade: but since, even in these latter years, there hath been somewhat above 120000 <hi>l. per An'</hi> Coined, as appears by the Account, it doth seem to administer an Objection, that still there hath been some National gain by Trade, though much less than before.</p>
            <p>But this does not follow, for if more Money hath been exported yearly during these last eighteen years than hath been Coined, the National Treasure must be diminished: Now if we have been over-ballanced, more Money must be exported; so that it will resolve into the former Question.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:34974:82"/>It is a vain thing to say, that the exportation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in <hi>specie</hi> stands still <hi>prohibited</hi>; so is the exporting of Treasure prohibited in <hi>Spain</hi> under the highest Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties; and yet because <hi>Spain</hi> is over-ballanced by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Importations, Forreigners continually carry it away; so that were it not for their Mines, there would not have been the value of a Peny left in <hi>Spain</hi> many years since; nor can their <hi>Mines</hi> so answer this mighty <hi>drain</hi> by a consumptive Trade, but that the Treasures of <hi>Spain</hi> are drawn lower than in any Nation in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore though the ordinary Trading with exported Money is condemnable, as that which tends to the subversion of Manufacture and People, and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litates meer Importation; yet I cannot recommend pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitory Laws as a means to stop the exportation of Money, unless at the same time the Methods of Trade be regulated.</p>
            <p>'Tis now become more practicable by the Liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Exportation of Bullion; for upon any great emergency for Bullion, (as for instance) upon the going out of <hi>an East-India Fleet,</hi> Standard-Silver hath risen from 5 <hi>s.</hi> the Ounce to 5 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> the Ounce; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> must not only hinder the Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bullion, but must cause our weighty Coin to be melted into Bullion, and so exported as it hath been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before.</p>
            <p>And upon the like occasions 'tis observable, that Guinnies rise to 22 <hi>s.</hi> apiece, &amp; broad <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>old to 24 <hi>s.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, which does evince, that those who use that Trade do not confine themselves to Bullion.</p>
            <p>So 'tis notorious to those who understand our <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ries, Turkey,</hi> &amp;c. that we yearly export great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Treasure to those and other Countries, and that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34974:83"/>
we do not stick at <hi>Coined Money,</hi> being closely put up in Packs of Goods or Barrels, or however may be made lawful and laudable Merchandize by melting; whence it is come to be so commonly asserted a Commodity; and then if we look back and observe how little hath been Coined in the 18 years since (57) being but 121026 <hi>l. per An',</hi> it must be highly credible, that we have exported much more Money yearly than we have Coined.</p>
            <p>But to make the over-ballance yet more evident, it will be necessary to find out, if possible, what was the yearly Treasure the Nation gained by Forreign Trade, at any time in this last Age; and in the next place, how much our Exportations and beneficial part of our Trade have since failed, and our Importations increased in quantity and value.</p>
            <p>The increase of Home-Treasure must either be in Coined Money, or in Plate, made up for Home-uses; for all Bullion imported must either be converted into one of these at home, or else be re-exported, and then 'tis not superadded to the National Home-Treasure.</p>
            <p>Now if we look back to the Accompt from the Mint, we may conclude, that during those 76 years, our Trade did never add more to our Coin yearly than 407027 <hi>l.</hi> 9 <hi>s.</hi> 1 <hi>d.</hi> ½ for any number of 20 years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this being the utmost Medium comprized in the Accompt.</p>
            <p>And this being in the 18 years before (57,<note place="margin">Plate Coined by the King at <hi>Oxon,</hi> and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>London.</hi>
               </note>) was not all the meer product of the Trade of these very years, for 'tis well known that during those years we had good quantities of our own Plate Coined into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Money, 'tis not possible for me to ascertain how much; but if it were a Million, it ought to be deducted out of the Medium of those years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:34974:83"/>So during those 18 years, our Trade might yet add less to our Coined Money, <hi>viz.</hi> in case our Forreign Trade did then export any of our Coined Money, the like may be said of any other of the said 18 years or Mediums in the Accompt; and then must all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney so exported be also deducted out of the Annual Gain of those years.</p>
            <p>I believe none will expect that I should adjust the yearly quantity of Money exported by stealth in our Forreign Trade before (57,) I shall leave it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the indifferent Reader upon what I shall add; but 'tis evident, that our Merchants did formerly use to export Money, by the prohibitory Statutes made on that occasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>It may be also further evident, that the yearly quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Money so exported before 57 was considerable; for before the 76 years mentioned in the Accompt, we must have had some stock of Money in the Nation, which supposing to be but six Millions, then adding what more was Coined during the said 76 years, we must have had near 30 Millions of Coin in the Nation before 57, had none been exported; whereas no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Man will say we had then half that Sum; which if doubted I shall have occasion to enforce fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if this be admitted, the Consequence must be, that our Forreign Trade and occasions did even before 57 carry off near half as much Money as was yearly Coined; and then our National yearly Gain in Coined Treasure would not be near to the aforesaid full Mediums Coined, nor to above half the Mediums, (taking any number of years together.)</p>
            <p>Nor can we reckon or allow of above 50000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for increase of <hi>Home-Plate,</hi> during any of the said 18 years, considering that much Plate is always
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34974:84"/>

            <p>Upon the whole the Reader may observe what our utmost National Gain in increase of Treasure possibly might be, and upon the aforesaid grounds may deduct from any of the Mediums as he shall think reasonable, wherein I shall not pretend to confine him, though in my private Judgment I cannot estimate our utmost National increase of Treasure by Trade during any of the said 76 years to be above 250000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> or thereabouts for any twenty years together.</p>
            <p>Considering which, if the indifferent Reader shall reflect on what hath been said in the 5<hi>th,</hi> 6<hi>th,</hi> 7<hi>th</hi> and 8<hi>th</hi> Sections, if he there find that our Trade hath been under such difficulties, as must necessarily work us out of all the parts of it, whilst our Neighbours are enabled to snatch it from us: If he there find undeniable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it in some Particulars, he may for the same Reasons conclude the like in all others; and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that our National Trade long before this, became less beneficial than it was by 250000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>; it hath been always found most safe to be governed by the Causes and Reasons of things, but the concurrent impoverishment of our People, and other the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, Plague-sores, and Spots of a consumptive Trade do further evidence it.</p>
            <p>It is confessed it would be of great use, if the odds in our past and present National Forreign Trade might be certainly stated; a difficult, if not impossible task: Since it requires an antient, as well as modern expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in Forreign Trade, and not of any one Trader only, but of so many as have traded into all Parts;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34974:84"/>
of those that are curious, intelligent, and impartial, and have minded the <hi>publick Interest</hi> as well as their <hi>own</hi>; perhaps if a sufficient number of such as these did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, they might, upon debate, and with reference to their Books, bring the Compute very near the truth; but nothing of this hath been done of late; and whosoever shall promiscuously consult our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders apart, will find them various: Then for our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom-Books old or new, though they might be useful for some things, yet they cannot ascertain us in the odds of the Forreign values of any Exported or Imported Goods, nor of the quantity of Imported prohibited or smuggled Goods, nor (as I conceive) of our former or present Fishing-Trade, (Fish paying no Custom) nor of the gain of Carriage, nor of the Trade from Port to Port; without which the certain odds in the Ballance cannot be calculated; and therefore for my own part I rest chiefly on what hath been said; believing my self secure whilst I keep my self to the <hi>rational part,</hi> which cannot be refuted but by Reason: Whereas I am apprehensive that should I descend to examine our Ballance of Trade by the particular <hi>effects</hi> of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Causes,</hi> these being matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> and very many, and most of them Forreign, and of less Notorie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be liable to Exceptions or Cavils of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men, as their different Sentiments or Interests may dictate; it being as easie to deny as affirm, and as hard for many Readers to determine the truth in th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se matters; whereby the sincerity of the Relator may be drawn into question; and at such times, when he shall have no opportunity to defend himself: and I am not insensible, that amongst so many Facts as the nature of this Subject hath forced me to mention, (whereof I must speak much upon the credit I give to others)
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34974:85"/>
'tis impossible there may be some slips, even by the transcribing of Papers: Upon these Considerations, I had thoughts of laying aside part of the three next Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as needless, and neglected somewhat of that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity I intended, but being perused and approved by some Friends amongst the rest of these Papers, they have perswaded me to publish them as they are, upon apprehension that they will enforce what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said, though left so general, and will give the Reader a further useful light into the past and present nature and condition of our Trade and Nation: and since they do not bind up the Reader to precise Quantities and Values, can admit of little alteration; in which I have been the more ready to comply, upon hopes that I may awaken and spur on the <hi>virtuous emulation</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to a more compleat disquisition into the several branches of our Trade, and that the Reader will think me the more excusable in this and the rest I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n he shall observe the present Subject so <hi>Copious,</hi> and so little laboured by other Writers, that I have no common Places or beaten Tracks to follow, as in other Studies.</p>
            <p>This I assure the Reader, that amongst the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instances, or elsewhere, there are no wilfull or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected errors, and that I have not affirmed any thing which I do not know, but upon such Authority as I have reason to believe <hi>highly</hi> credible, and am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that whatsoever mistakes in Fact the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous may find out in what I have already said, or shall say, there are none such as do in the least impeach the <hi>force</hi> or <hi>reason</hi> of this Discourse, and then must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted immaterial.</p>
            <p>To which I shall add, that by the following Essay, I do not pretend to that difficult work of adjusting the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34974:85"/>
present Ballance of our Trade, but to evince, that the former Ballance of our Trade (as it may be compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the aforesaid Accompt, from the Mint or otherwise) is grown consumptive in <hi>some degree</hi>; which I think will appear to the indifferent Readers satisfaction, upon consideration of some late decays and defalcations in our Trade, wherein I shall confine my self to such as have happened long after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 76 years mentioned in the Accompt, from the Mint, many of them within 20 years last.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>I Shall begin with our Exportations, and as I shall pass from one particular to another, in this and the next Section, shall desire the indifferent Reader to put such an estimation on our losses in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34974:86"/>
Trade, as he shall think reasonable; and shall first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in our Woollen Manufactures, as being our principal Commodity, and certainly of the most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and necessary use, (and therefore in its nature the best) in the World.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Edward the thirds</hi> time the <hi>Flemings</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured our Wooll, and had the Merchandize of it, which gave the original Foundation to the former Wealth and Popularity of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. observing the great advantages the <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> made of our Wooll, brought over some Flemish Manufacturers, who by degrees taught the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Cloaths</hi> of all sorts, <hi>Worsted</hi> and divers others, particularly mentioned in our <hi>Statutes</hi> of former times: and as the <hi>English</hi> more applied themselves to it, and increased ours (as soon they did) so did that of the <hi>Flemings</hi> decay.</p>
            <p>For first, the <hi>English</hi> had the materials cheaper than the <hi>Flemings,</hi> not only by the odds in the carriage out of <hi>England,</hi> but because the raw Woolls afterwards exported were charged with great <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> to the King, as appears by the Acts and Writings of those times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the Manufacture was continually incouraged, and taken care of by Laws for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as also appears by our <hi>Statute-Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> At that time we had none of the present Clogs on our Manufactures, which have either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so by the better Methods of Trade first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by the <hi>Dutch</hi> States, or have been grafted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by private or mistaken interests long since <hi>Edw.</hi> 3<hi>ds</hi> time. I do not find that there was any absolute <hi>Prohibition</hi> of exporting Wooll till the Statute of the 12th of His now Majesty, chap. 32. yet the example
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34974:86"/>
of our cunning Neighbours now tell us, that <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> accompanied with a due Improvement of Trade at home, are not to be condemned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Flemish</hi> Cloath-trade was long since so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, that we had the sole Merchandise of it, yet it cannot be denyed but the <hi>Flemings</hi> kept up a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of a sort of <hi>Stuffs</hi> and <hi>Sayes,</hi> (but of no great bulk) the make whereof the <hi>English</hi> had not been taught, till the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi> about 100 years since by his Tyranny and Persecution for Conscience, drove away their Manufacturers, whom <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> like her wise Predecessor <hi>Edward the third</hi> entertained, seating them in <hi>Norwich, Colchester,</hi> and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whereby these Manufactures became incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>English,</hi> to the great advantage of those parts, and of the Nation in general: they also taught us the art of making <hi>Tapestry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before this the <hi>English</hi> exported great quantities of our Manufacture into <hi>Flanders,</hi> but doubtless more afterwards, for which we kept a rich Staple at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> long after they became States were ignorant of this Manufacture, whom we therefore wholly supplied, exporting vast quantities of our Cloaths thither, most Whites, which were there dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dressed, and from these parts transmitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>South-east</hi> Countries of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and many other Nations: we had also the sole trade up the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and thereby to the <hi>North</hi> parts of <hi>Germany, Jutland</hi> and <hi>Holsteyne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had the sole Trade into <hi>Denmark, Norway, Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Liefland,</hi> and to the great Territory of <hi>Poland</hi> (through <hi>Dantzick</hi>) by our <hi>Eastland Company,</hi> formerly very flourishing, and called the <hi>Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:34974:87"/>We had also the sole Trade to the vast Empire of <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which Trades are sunk to a small matter, the <hi>Dutch</hi> having set up mighty Woollen Manufactures of all sorts, and the <hi>Flemings</hi> renewed or enlarged theirs, our exports to <hi>those</hi> parts are very much reduced.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Hamburgh Company,</hi> by whom the <hi>North</hi> parts of <hi>Germany, Jutland</hi> and <hi>Holsteyne</hi> were supplied, do not vend near half what they did, the <hi>Dutch</hi> and other Manufactures having prevailed upon us in those parts, both for the Finest and Coursest Cloaths: what we now export to <hi>Hamburgh</hi> are a sort of Cloaths of between 3, and 7 <hi>s.</hi> a Yard, and of those not near the former quantity.</p>
            <p>Then for our <hi>Eastland Trade</hi> it is sunk more, I have heard several Estimates, all near concurring with what I find in Mr. <hi>Cokes</hi> third Treatise of Trade,<note place="margin">Pag. 33, 34.</note> dedicated to <hi>Prince Rupert, viz.</hi> That this Company only heretofore usually exported above 20000 Broad Cloaths, 60000 Kerseys and 40000 Doubles yearly; but of late years not above 4000 Broad Cloaths, 5000 Kerseys, and 2000 Doubles. To give this worthy Gentleman his due, he hath written more materially on the present subject than any man in this Age, in which he hath not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated his deep Judgement, but his great seduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and sincerity in the discovery of the truth,<note place="margin">Pag. 112.</note> professing himself ready to make out whatsoever he hath reported, before any Judicature. There is too much reason and fact to warrant the great decay of this <hi>Eastland Trade,</hi> when the <hi>Dutch</hi> Manufacture is arrived to such a degree, besides which the <hi>Silesian</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:34974:87"/>
and <hi>Polonian</hi> Manufactures of Coarse Woolls are mightily increased, so that at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> our late great staple, we now sell so little that 'tis not worth the naming; we now trade <hi>thither</hi> with Treasure, whence we used to Import much; the like may be said of other Ports this Company formerly traded to.</p>
            <p>Then for <hi>Swedeland,</hi> the Natives have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set up a Manufacture there of their Coarse Woolls, as well as <hi>Denmark, Liefland</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> are very much supplied by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> imposing greater Prices and Customs upon us for what they vend, and insisting to have Treasure of us, where before they bartered for Commodity.</p>
            <p>To which I may add, That our late great <hi>Muscovy</hi> Trade is in a manner lost; the same Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> takes notice that the <hi>Dutch</hi> send 1500 Sail of Ships into the <hi>Sound</hi> in a year, and 40 to <hi>Muscovy,</hi> we do not send above seven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sound</hi> in a year, of which two are laden with woollen Manufactures, the other five with Ballast, (and are therefore to buy their foreign lading) and to <hi>Muscovy</hi> we hardly send two in three years; during the late War we have sent somewhat more.</p>
            <list>
               <label>We had also the sole trading for woollen Cloathing into <hi>France,</hi> of which we vended thereto the value of 600000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly; but the <hi>French</hi>

having for these later years set up this Manufacture at home, do now supply themselves; and as their own hath increased, so have they laid greater Impositions upon ours, till in (67) the <hi>French</hi> King set an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Tax of about 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> on all our Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imported into <hi>France,</hi>

furnish the rest with <hi>Flower, Bisket, Salt, Flesh, Fish,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Having given this Accompt of our direct and Consequential Losses by <hi>the Irish Acts,</hi> I expect to be Answered by some, That howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever these Acts may have prejudiced us for the time past, they are <hi>now expired,</hi> and that by Consequence we shall now be let into all the advantages we had before the Acts made. This I shall examine before I go further, and with that Impartiality as I think becomes an <hi>English-man,</hi> without being byassed by the Situation of my Lands: which if any man does, this Consequence must appear mistaken.</p>
            <p>For first, The Manufactures set up in <hi>Ireland,</hi> will still Continue to the same prejudice of ours; and 'tis highly probable (if not certain) that they will Improve, by the cheapness of their Provision and Wages.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Having now long used to fatt their Cattle (with which they do not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Victual all sorts of Ships, but Forreign Towns, Armies and Nations, particularly the <hi>French,</hi> and those of the United Provinces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Return they make by the Vent of their Hides and Tallowes) it is not to be Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that they will be so mad as to give up this far more profitable Trade.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They will breed, manufacture, and Export as much Wooll, Butter, Cheese, &amp;c. as before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:34974:92"/>Fourthly, These Exportations obliging them to Commerce with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> as before, it must be expected that they will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally still buy such Commodities as they want of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi>; and much the rather, because the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> for Reasons before mentioned, can and will afford them much cheaper than the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Advantages shall we then have by the expiring of the <hi>Irish Acts?</hi> 'tis confessed, that their Territory being large, most Fruitful, and now plentifully stored with Cattle, they may carry on their other Trades, and yet furnish us with abundant Stores of Cattle for our Money; which they already do, sending many of their Cattle near or altogether <hi>fatt:</hi> supposing them <hi>lean,</hi> yet will not this Nation get 3 <hi rend="sup">d.</hi> a year by it, but will be a yearly loser.

                  <label>For the meer Importing of <hi>Irish</hi> Cattle, did never advantage this Nation otherwise, than as it secured the <hi>Irish</hi> in that base way of Trade, and from turning their National Industry into a Competition with the <hi>English</hi> in other Trades; during which time, what Money they received for their Cattle, they generally laid out in <hi>London,</hi> or elsewhere in <hi>England,</hi> for the Commodities I mentioned before, and others, by which <hi>Ireland</hi> was stored; But now I do not see how it can be avoided, but that they will carry out all or the greatest part of the

Lastly, I shall add, That should we suppose a Compleat restitution of our losses in and by the <hi>Irish Trade,</hi> Yet Considering our other defalcations in Trade, and our present Poverty, it would not restore the Ballance of our Trade, or not to any such degree, as to secure the Nation.</p>

               <label>Amongst many other Excellent

Materials, we have in <hi>England</hi> great store of <hi>Tyn and Lead,</hi> capable of rich and mighty Manufactures in mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and otherwise, as appears by our Imported <hi>Tynned Plates</hi> from <hi>Germany,</hi> which are computed to cost <hi>England</hi> near 100000 l. <hi>per Annum</hi>; and then what does that Manufacture bring into <hi>Germany</hi> from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys?

            <p>Perhaps more instances might be given of decayes in our Exportations of late Years, though it may be considered that we never had many Exportable Manufactures of very great bulk and value, nor in truth any but that of our Wooll; so that if we so much fail of our former gain in this Commodity, it must strike deep on our former Ballance; But much more if we also fail in so many other Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Beneficial Trades.</p>
            <p>And after these losses in our Exporting Trade, a further Estimate ought to be made of the decay in our Trade from <hi>Port to Port</hi>; for though the <hi>English</hi> never were, nor since the <hi>Dutch</hi> began to trade could be, considerably Masters of this kind of Trade; Yet may it be presumed, that whilst we kept the <hi>Monopoly of Cloth,</hi> our Merchants by the Barter and Vent of this Commodity had then more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opportunities of Buying and Selling For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign goods in Forreign Ports; and the rather, because it not only gave the <hi>English</hi> an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Reputation, but a real preference in those Parts they then principally Traded to; besides, the former <hi>Privileges</hi> the <hi>English</hi> long enjoyed in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> enabled them to so much of this kind of Trade as related to that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which advantage we have lost by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34974:95"/>
of those Priviledges, whereof I shall say more.</p>
            <p>But perhaps I may be told, That all our before mentioned Defalcations in the beneficial parts of our Trade, have been made good by the Accession of the <hi>Plantation-Trade</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> (being within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the 76 Years mentioned in the Accompt from the Mint) and by the Increase of it since; and I the rather expect this Objection, because this Trade remaining inclosed to the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> who for Want of other Trade are <hi>thrust</hi> into it, it makes a great <hi>noise</hi> amongst us; I shall therefore speak more particularly to it, than yet I have, that I may leave no Holes for Starters.</p>
            <p>It may be Alledged, and must be Confessed, That this Trade hath imployed a good number of Ships, and hath brought in great Customs; but nothing of this is to the present question, being only, Whether it hath advantaged the Nation in its Annual gain of Treasure; which I conceive this Trade hath not, if ballanced with the losses the Nation hath received by it.</p>
            <p>All the Gain <hi>England</hi> can or ever could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by this Trade, must be in the Return and Result of those Commodities we import from the <hi>Plantations, (viz.</hi> Sugars, Tobaccoes, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stuffs, &amp;c.) in Exchange for so much of our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34974:95"/>
Butter, Cheese, Beer, Woollen Cloaths, Hats, Shoes, Iron-work, and other home-Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as we Export thither.</p>
            <p>Now that the Labours of the same People in Fishing or Manufactures <hi>at home</hi> did, and would have produced a greater Profit to the Nation than these <hi>Plantation-Commodities,</hi> I think no man, considering what hath been said before, can so much as make a question. In fact our Fishing for White Herring and Cod was deserted for this Trade, and the Continual transplanting of multitudes of our Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers and other people, hath inevitably more and more <hi>sunk</hi> and <hi>disabled</hi> us in all Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures and home-Employments.</p>
            <p>Then for the supposed advantage we have in the Vent of our home-Commodities to the Plantations, 'tis plain they are but our own People; and it must be undeniable, that had the same People stayed in <hi>England,</hi> they would have taken off a far greater Quantity; for whereas we now furnish them with some small part of their Victuals, we should then have supplyed them with All, <hi>viz.</hi> with Bread, Flesh, Fish, Roots, &amp;c. which now we do not; and they would have taken off far more of our Butter, Cheese, Cloathing, Drink, and other home Commodities, when they had them at hand, and had been put to no other shifts.</p>
            <p>But our infelicity is yet greater; for our
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34974:96"/>
Plantation-Trade (though at the best far less valuable to the Nation than the same People and their Labours at home) is yet grown much worse than it was 20 or 30 Years since, and must grow worse and worse Continually.</p>
            <p>This must notoriously appear by what hath been said in this Section, when by means of the late <hi>Irish</hi> Acts,<note place="margin">See before.</note> and for other Reasons there mentioned, we are forced to Export unto, and furnish these our Plantations with so much less quantities of our own, and so much greater quantities of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Goods than formerly and lately we did.</p>
            <p>Besides which, by a further Improvidence we have lost other advantages in this Trade: Our Re-exporters being to receive back half the Customs (which in this Trade are very migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) it hath followed, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> coming to be furnished with our <hi>Sugars and Dying Stuffs</hi> much cheaper than the <hi>English,</hi> (as being charged not with half the Customs) have been by that means able to set up and beat us out of the Forreign Trade of <hi>baked Sugars,</hi> of which they bake and vend above 20 times the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity the <hi>English</hi> do; so do they now use far the greatest part of our <hi>Dying Stuffs,</hi> gaining near as much, if not more, by these Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures than the raw materials yield the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:34974:96"/>
               <label>Then, if this Trade did originally subvert or weaken several better Trades, and besides is now less valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than it was, instead of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, it ought to be reckoned amongst the defalcations in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Trade.</label>
               <item>000000</item>
            </list>
            <p>And though it be not so direct to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent question, I shall adde, That we have little reason to boast of our <hi>Navigation</hi> in this Trade, when it was the occasion of the loss of a more certain and beneficial Nursery of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Shipping in our Fishery, when at the same time the Strength and Business of the Nation have been so much contracted by the loss of our People, when our Planters of <hi>New England</hi> having gotten a Considerable Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own, do Trade from <hi>Port to Port</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and have in a manner beaten us out of that kind of Imployment in those Parts; and when the <hi>Irish Shipping,</hi> together with the growing Plenties of <hi>Ireland and New-England,</hi> threaten the like in the Trade of <hi>Exportation and Importation.</hi> To all which may be added, what we ought to expect in case the <hi>Dutch</hi> may retain and Cultivate <hi>Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> as far as 'tis capable, since it will produce as good <hi>Sugars and Tobaccoes</hi> as any part of <hi>America,</hi> and as much as will serve the greatest part of the World, if not all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:34974:97"/>Nay, these <hi>Plantations</hi> may be Considered as the true Grounds and Causes of all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Mischiefs; for, had our Fishers been put on no other Employment, had those Millions of People which we have lost or been prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the <hi>Plantations,</hi> continued in <hi>England,</hi> the Government would long since have been under a necessity of Easing and regulating our Trade; the common Wants and Cryes of our People would infallibly have obliged it; but much of the Industry of the Nation being turned this way, and the <hi>Plantations</hi> affording room and hopes for Men of <hi>necessitous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie Conditions,</hi> and our Lawes mentioned in the Seventh Section, posting them away, they have deserted the Nation Continually, and left us intricated and fettered in private Interests and destructive Constitutions of Trade. And thus, whilest we have been projecting the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Customs,</hi> we have fed our selves with the <hi>Shadows</hi> of Trade, and suffered other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to run away with the <hi>Substance.</hi> I am assured, that the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Jamaica</hi> are now near, if not fully treble what they were when Sir <hi>Thomas Muddiford</hi> was Governour there, and then they were at least 20000; whence some Conjecture may be made at the rest.</p>

               <p> Instances in late Increases and Excesses of our Forreign Importations, and therein of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of some other of our own Manufactures which supplyed our Home-Vses, <hi>viz.</hi> in Linnens of all sorts, more dear fine Linnens used; incident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the late and present Huswifery of <hi>English</hi> Women: In Ticking, in Imported Woollen Manufactures from <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> In Cordage, Cables, Sayls and Sea-Nets; in Iron, in Brandy, in Wines of all sorts, these risen in price; the particular odds in our former and present Canary-Trade; in Coffee, in Earthen Ware, Pitch, Tarre, Hemp, Flax, and Forreign Timber bought dearer, and far more Timber Imported: In Imported Silks of all sorts; in Laces, and many other things, and thereupon our late <hi>French</hi> Overballance Considered. To which Added, our late losses by the <hi>French Capers,</hi> and Money Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>France</hi> by our Travellers, &amp;c. The National Overballance inferred, this cleared by a Deduction of our Trade, with Relation to the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and therein of their gradual Increase, and our Decay in Trade; Whence the Growth of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Revenues and Strengths observed; a farther Calculation of our late and present Overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance;

incidently of some farther Advantages in Trade Forreigners have upon us.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN order to take a right Measure of the <hi>Overballance,</hi> it is observed in the Eighth Section, That if the beneficial part of our Trade become worse, &amp; the Consumptive Importations increase, it will sooner induce an Overballance, and will cut deepest on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Stock of Treasure.</p>
            <p>Now it will much evidence the Increase of our Importations, if any of our own Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures which are of necessary Use at home, are lost, or impaired in any Considerable degree of later Years, because, the People must be then supplyed by the like Forreign Goods, to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degree than before.</p>
            <p>I shall first instance in <hi>Linnen,</hi> lately a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Manufacture in <hi>Cheshire, Lancashire,</hi> and the Parts adjacent; it was also the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery of our <hi>English Ladies, Gentlewomen</hi> and other <hi>Women</hi>; which general Employment of our <hi>Women,</hi> (although most designed for the private Uses of Families) did keep very many Thousands of Linnen Looms at work in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and did supply the greatest part of our National occasion for Houshold and Course Linnens of all sorts.</p>
            <p>But all this Manufacture of <hi>Linnen</hi> in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, Lancashire,</hi> and elsewhere, is now in a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34974:98"/>
manner expired; and the Huswifely Women of <hi>England</hi> now employ themselves in making an ill sort of Lace, which serves no National or Natural Necessity; most of the rest spend their times much worse, or are <hi>idle,</hi> bringing a Scandal on themselves and their Families; so that there is hardly a working Linnen Loom left in a County: which Idleness and Unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable living of our <hi>Women,</hi> gives the <hi>Dutch</hi> a farther great Advantage upon us, whose <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> are mainly serviceable in Trade.

            <p>But that the Commodities <hi>Imported</hi> out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> consisting chiefly of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Cloathes, Serges, Knit Stockings, Lead, Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Allom, Coals, and all else did not amount to above a Million yearly, which left the over-ballance 1600000 l.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that since this there was an Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the <hi>French</hi> Overballance taken in <hi>England</hi> by some <hi>English</hi> Merchants, from the Entries of the Port of <hi>London,</hi> by which it was computed, that the <hi>French</hi> Overballance amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to about a Million; This was presented by our Merchants to our Lords Commissioners upon a Treaty of Commerce with <hi>France</hi> in (74.)

               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:34974:104"/>This I need not contend, since if the <hi>French</hi> Overballance had been no more than a Million, it was enough to impoverish us, considering our Importations from other Forreign Nations; But that I may not totally desert Mr. <hi>Fortrey,</hi> I shall take notice, that this <hi>English</hi> Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was taken from the Entries of the Port of <hi>London</hi> only, from whence there may not be any so Just a calculation for all the rest of our Ports; and that the Entries do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any of those <hi>French</hi> Commodities which were prohibited by our former Laws, and are therefore Imported without Entry, which are accompted to amount to some Hundreds of thousand pounds yearly, perhaps near to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Million. But on the other side, that the <hi>French</hi> Entries must be certain as to the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from <hi>France</hi>; that Mr. <hi>Fortrey</hi> would not be willing to falsify with <hi>His Majestie</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> nor the <hi>French</hi> Ministers with the <hi>French King,</hi> in a matter so important.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be thought that our Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from <hi>France</hi> decreased in quantity or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue since Mr. <hi>Fortrey</hi> wrote, to the time of the Prohibition, but rather increased; whereof our Merchants then gave an instance in <hi>Wines and Brandies,</hi> from the Entries of the Port of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as followeth:</p>
            <q>
               <p>From <hi>Mich.</hi> 1663. to <hi>Mich.</hi> 1664. There was Imported into the Port of <hi>London</hi> 6828
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34974:105"/>
Tuns of French Wine, and then the quantity of Brandy was so small and inconsiderable, that it deserves not to be noted.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Mich.</hi> (67) to <hi>Mich.</hi> (69). There was Imported into the Port of <hi>London</hi> in the said two years, 17000 Tuns of French Wine, and of Brandy about 3000 Tun.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Mich.</hi> (72) to <hi>Mich.</hi> (74) Was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the Port of <hi>London</hi> 22500 Tuns of French Wine.</p>

               <p>From <hi>Mich.</hi> (73) to <hi>Mich.</hi> (74) Was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>London,</hi> as near as can be computed 5000 Tuns of Brandy, and every Tun of Brandy consuming about 5 Tuns of Wine, makes the quantity of 25000 Tuns of Wine.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This I the rather take notice of here, because from hence it doth also appear, that the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Impositions on French Wines and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by our Parliament in (67) did not make the Importation of them less tolerable or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable than before, and therefore were only Impositions on the English Subject.</p>
            <p>Nay, the <hi>French</hi> have been able to <hi>raise</hi> the Prices of <hi>their Wines</hi> and <hi>Brandies</hi> upon us, even since (67) as the same Merchants repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. For,</p>

            <p>So said the Merchants in the year (74) and whosoever will take the pains to look into the Custom-Books, will find a mighty Increase of Imported French Wine and Brandy since (74) to the time of the Prohibition; and that, for several years last past, our Importation of French Linnen, Silks, and other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have also continually grown upon us, whereof we have an infallible Evidence in the continual Rising of our Customs.</p>
            <p>I have heard that the quantity of French Wines Imported in 1676. made about 36000 Tuns of Wine, and that about the years (50) (51) and (52) the quantity yearly Imported was about 3000 Tuns of Wine.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, the <hi>French Policies</hi> have been as industrious to suppress our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Trade,</hi> upon which they have gradually imposed more and more Taxes, and at last so great, that it amounts to a Prohibition; as may be Instanced in our Woollen Manufacture.</p>

In the year 1632, the Duty on an English Broad Cloth Imported into <hi>France,</hi> was 6 <hi>Livres.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:34974:106"/>It is now about five years since that our Merchants, observing the <hi>Dutch</hi> &amp; other Neighbour Nations to be in War,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mun</hi> of Forreign Trade <hi>pag.</hi> 149. Notes,
<q>That all the great Losses we receive at Sea in our Shipping, either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or homeward bound, ought to be considered in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; for the value of the one is to be Deducted from our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations; and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the other from our Importations.</q>
               </note> but ours in Peace; they had now golden hopes of driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mightier Forreign Trade than ever; for which purpose they thought it convenient to buy many <hi>Dutch-built</hi> Ships, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the rather because they had lost many Ships in the late War: But the Act of Navigation standing in their way, they obtained His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties License for it.</p>
            <p>But thereupon, there presently came out a <hi>French Edict</hi> for the seizing of all <hi>Ships bought in any Enemie's Country,</hi> which did discourage many of our Merchants from buying any Ships, yet many were bought and escaped safe to our Ports; these and many <hi>English</hi> Ships our Merchants forthwith freighted and sent out, in prospect of a swelling Trade, and vast Returns of Treasure.</p>
            <p>But immediately there came out swarms of <hi>French Capers,</hi> who seized on those Dutch-built Ships, though they had all necessary Passes; and from thence, finding the sweetness of it, they fell to taking of our <hi>English built Ships,</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:34974:107"/>
on pretence they carried Enemies Goods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they themselves would be the Judges, and did actually seize all sorts of <hi>English</hi> built Ships, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den meerly on the account of <hi>English</hi> Merchants, they took meer <hi>English Coasters</hi>; nay, they <hi>retook</hi> many of our Ships which had been actually <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged</hi> in <hi>France</hi>; they plunder'd our Ships, and grievously beat and wounded our generous Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (who never before dream't of any thing but the Sovereignty of the Sea) and killed many.</p>
            <p>Then were our Ships carried into the <hi>French</hi> Ports, and our Merchants put to prove the property of their own Ships and Goods before <hi>French Judges,</hi> in the new erected <hi>French</hi> Admiralties, by a long and tedious proceeding; by which, and also in the <hi>French</hi> Court, and by the <hi>Treachery of their own Agents,</hi> they were put to vast Expences.</p>
            <p>There were about 400 Sail of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships seized in this manner, many of which the <hi>French</hi> thought fit absolutely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn; and such as were released were kept, some three Months, some six Months, some twelve Months, and some longer, and then were Discharged with great Damage, by Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Expence in <hi>France,</hi> besides the first Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences; and after all, lost the intended Fruit of their Voyages, of which, doubtless the <hi>French</hi> were very sensible: And what is yet worse, the <hi>French King</hi> making the utmost advantages of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34974:107"/>
every thing, got Thousands of our Seamen by extraordinary Pay, to engage in his Service, to which he doth still indear them by Money, and all imaginable encouragements.</p>
            <p>All which being done in times of Peace, could only be intended to impoverish and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our Merchants Trade and Nation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their pretence of carrying Enemies Goods; this is evident as well from the <hi>said Edict,</hi> and from the Nature of the whole Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, as by another <hi>Edict</hi> set forth by the <hi>French</hi> King about the same time, giving Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Trade to any Nation (without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that would take <hi>French</hi> Passes; for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreseen that the <hi>English</hi> would not take any, because of the <hi>English</hi> Claim to the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the Seas,</hi> it left other Nations then at enmity with <hi>France,</hi> at Liberty to take Passes, and by Consequence to Trade; who accordingly did, and traded without controul, particularly the <hi>Dutch</hi>: So did the <hi>Swedish</hi> Ships at the same time openly Trade <hi>to and from Holland,</hi> and other Countries then at <hi>enmity with France</hi>; without any Disturbance from the <hi>French</hi> Capers.</p>
            <p>This might administer further Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I shall only at present accommodate it to the Matter in question, being the <hi>Over-ballance of Trade</hi>; which must needs have been the higher upon us, as our Merchants
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34974:108"/>
received more Injuries and Losses of this Nature.</p>
            <p>To this I shall add, that it is an incredible Sum of Money which our English <hi>Gentlemen and Travellers</hi> of all sorts spend yearly in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Here may be added the vast Sums and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which already are, and Annually will be Transported by Papists to <hi>France,</hi> and other Parts; but principally to <hi>France.</hi>

               <label>I believe other instances may be given of the late Increase of our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations, our National Luxury and folly being such, that our Merchants

find a home-Vent for almost all sorts of Foreign Goods and trifles in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse: These I leave to be added by the observation of others.</label>

            <p>In the mean time, considering what the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most gain of our Trade might be, during the 76 years mentioned in the Accompt from the Mint, it must be evident from what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said, that we have been <hi>Overballanced</hi> many 100000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> of later years. The Particulars I have mentioned in this, and the last Section, being such as have happened, or worked more signally and vigorously upon us during the years mentioned in the said Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; which (that I may prevent Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) I shall endeavour to clear, by a brief <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> of our Trade during the same 76 years, which I cannot do without some Relation to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Trades; of whose <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Growth,</hi> and their Consequential Increase of <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> I shall therefore also give some Accompt.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with that of the <hi>English:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the <hi>Dutch</hi> were cemented into States, the <hi>English</hi> had far greater Advantages in Trade than any Neighbour Nation, by <hi>the greater Plenty of our more excellent Oak-Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Victuals, Numbers of Seamen, home-Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of Manufacture, our great Woollen-Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, our Fishery, and other our valuable
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34974:109"/>
Commodities mentioned before:</hi> Besides the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Flemish,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Trades. That of the <hi>Sound,</hi> and <hi>Streights,</hi> our Adventurous Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Mariners in <hi>Edw.</hi> the Sixth's time Discovered the North-East Passage by Sea to <hi>Muscovy,</hi> which Trade was before driven by the Merchants of the <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> a-cross the <hi>Baltick</hi>: Such was our good success, that by the great Commerce our Merchants brought, and by the Embassies and Applications of our succeeding Princes, especially Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Czar</hi> granted them a <hi>Free Trade</hi> at his Port <hi>Archangel,</hi> (that is) without paying any <hi>Impost</hi>; which he would not grant to others: whereby the <hi>English</hi> became possessed of the whole Trade of a great Advantage; besides which, our Woollen-Manufactures were not a little improved in Bulk and Value, by means of those <hi>Flemmings</hi> or <hi>Walloons</hi> driven out by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and entertained by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; spoken of before.</p>
            <p>In this Condition was our Trade when the <hi>Dutch</hi> United Provinces came to a Settlement, being about 90 Years since; the <hi>Dutch</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon found themselves obliged to study all Imaginable wayes of Gain by Trade; For the People driven into these Provinces by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Tyranny and Persecution for Religion,</hi> were very <hi>Numerous,</hi> the Countrey very <hi>narrow,</hi> and yielding little of the <hi>Necessaries of life,</hi> and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34974:109"/>
the Long and Continual Charge of their War with <hi>Spain</hi> very great; from which <hi>Necessity</hi> followed much <hi>Contrivance</hi> and <hi>Industry,</hi> and thence those <hi>Arts and easie Methods of Trade</hi> which have wrought so great Changes in most Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> if not throughout the World.</p>
            <p>First there followed these Alterations in the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi>; the <hi>Dutch</hi> fell into a mighty Trade or Employment of <hi>carrying and dealing from Port to Port,</hi> far beyond what was ever used in these Parts before; which Trade they engrossed, beating out the <hi>Antwerpians, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> and all others, Except in what related to <hi>Muscovy,</hi> (secured to the <hi>English</hi> by our Privileges there) and what related to <hi>Spain</hi> during their Wars with that Crown; the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese,</hi> having before found out the way by Sea to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and having by that cheaper passage beat the <hi>Venetians</hi> out of that Trade, and planted mighty Factories and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the <hi>Indies</hi>; the <hi>Dutch</hi> before, the Year 1600, being informed of the Riches of that Commerce by one <hi>Cornelius Hou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>man</hi> a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> eng<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ged in a Trade thither, and in the Year 1602, by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Union, established their <hi>East-India</hi> Company; who upon their original Fund, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 600000 l. <hi>Sterling,</hi> made so great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in that Trade, that besides several Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Dividends before made, upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34974:110"/>
in the Year 1608, their Stock was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Three <hi>Millions Sterling</hi>: and in this great Carriere very speedily supplanted the <hi>Portuguese</hi> in this Trade; their success was little less in the Fishing Trade for <hi>White Herrings, Ling and Codfish</hi> on the Coasts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which they extended beyond what we ever did, incroaching daily on the <hi>English,</hi> being enabled thereto by their more easie Methods of Trade; and the <hi>English</hi> the more disabled by our Application to the Plantation-Trade in the time of King <hi>James,</hi> whereof the Wife Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh,</hi> by the <hi>occasion</hi> of his Travels, taking notice, about 60 years since gave a Caution of it to King <hi>James,</hi> shewing the Reasons, and proving that the <hi>Dutch</hi> then got 1372000 l. <hi>per Annum</hi> Sterling by this Trade, by the Accompts he took at several Ports, (and yet he mentions not their Trade in the <hi>Streights,</hi> and but one Port in <hi>France,</hi> viz. <hi>Roan</hi>:) notwithstanding which, the <hi>Dutch</hi> still getting advantages upon us, had near beaten us out before the end of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign; and soon after became Compleat Masters of it.</p>
            <p>Thus was this our <hi>Fishing-Trade,</hi> of great and certain Profit, and of high Importance for the Support of our Navigation and Coasts, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted; in the place of this, we had our <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation-Trade,</hi> of which having spoken so much
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34974:110"/>
before, I shall say no more, than that it brought <hi>in great Customes</hi>: Yet, not forgetting, that <hi>King James</hi> succeeding Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (who to reduce the late portentous greatness of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Family, had supported the <hi>Dutch</hi>) made a Peace <hi>with Spain,</hi> which gave the <hi>English</hi> a particular Advantage in the Trade of <hi>Spain</hi> for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> till the <hi>Dutch</hi> made a Peace with that Crown; and since that hath continued a very beneficial Market for many of our Commodities, being there vended for ready-money: Our Trade to <hi>Muscovy</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed secured to us by our Privilege there, and our Clothing Trade by our Wooll, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of other Nations in that Manufacture. We had a remaining Fishery at <hi>Groenland, Ise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Newfoundland</hi>; we continued some other Exports of lesser Note mentioned before; but the Woollen-Manufacture being our chief Jewel, we kept the Monopoly of it during the Reign of <hi>King James,</hi> and for the greatest part of the Reign of <hi>King Charles</hi> the First, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally raised the prices; by all which, and for that our <hi>Imports</hi> were less than of late they have been, the Ballance of our Trade, during the Reigns of these Princes, was kept up to the degree, we may Compute it by the Accompt from the Mint, which though somewhat, was but a <hi>narrow scantling,</hi> considering how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Trades were
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34974:111"/>
improved and grew up <hi>by us</hi> continually; yet have we since lost, or much Impaired all these principal Advantages in Trade, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shewn.</p>
            <p>Before I shew how these Limbs of our Trade became so much disabled, it will be necessary to observe <hi>what Influence</hi> the <hi>Dutch Trade</hi> had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Exportable Commodities</hi> of any Note the <hi>French</hi> formerly, and till this last Age pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, were <hi>Corn, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi>: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that of Corn was as Considerable as any; the other two being but sparingly Exported, at least in Comparison of what have been Vended of late Years: besides these, they had <hi>Skins, Tallow, and Woad,</hi> and some Fruits of little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; which whole Trade could bring in no great matter.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Dutch</hi> being ravenous after Trade, and like Bees thrusting themselves into every Creek and Corner for Commodities to sell again, and barter away for Profit, presently gave a far mightier Vent to the <hi>French Wines,</hi> with which they not only plentifully supplyed most other Nations, but drank good store themselves, being their principal Home-<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi>; of <hi>Salt</hi> they took off yet greater quantities, not only for present Merchandize, but to use in their prodigious Fishery. As the Vent of these grew greater, more were provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34974:111"/>
in <hi>France</hi>; hence also did their <hi>Infant</hi>-Manufactures of Linnen, Silk, Paper, Brandy, and those Numbers of others enumerated by Mr. <hi>Fortrey,</hi> and doubtless many more, grow up to <hi>Gyants</hi>; the hungry <hi>French</hi> tasting the sweet of the Gain, did not fail to supply this busie People, though doubtless not without the Conduct of an extraordinary Wisdom; Since 'tis apparent, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> manner of Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the same Overtures to other Neighbour Nations;<note place="margin">See before in Section the 7<hi>th. Pag.</hi>
               </note> the wise Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> observed how free and easie they had made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce by lowering their Customes and Duties: they let in the <hi>French</hi> Protestants by a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and carefully Superintended the Increase of their Manufactures. Thus as the <hi>French</hi> Shop came to have more things of <hi>Delicacy and Variety,</hi> it drew in more Customers, and the <hi>English</hi> amongst the rest; and as a great part of Trade is driven in <hi>Fantastical Dresses,</hi> and Toys of many sorts, the <hi>French</hi> took care to provide an Abundance, with which they <hi>gulled</hi> the rest of the World: Hence were their <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> at first called <hi>Fashion-mongers</hi>; but they did not rest there, they soon became <hi>Portentous Tradesmen</hi> in the most solid and valuable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in the World, and thence <hi>Lord Mayors</hi> of the Continent; doubtless the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>French King</hi> thinks it his high Concern,

and values himself upon it, of which we have an Evidence in his nice and early looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his great <hi>Shop-Books</hi> or Entries, to find out the <hi>Ballance</hi> of his Trade with <hi>England,</hi> and by making his Shop <hi>easie</hi> in the Approach, <hi>viz.</hi> by his increasing his <hi>free Ports,</hi> (for in truth, it would be a very strange Project of Gain, for a Tradesman to set a Toll on every man that comes in at his Door) the same ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by an hundred other instances.</p>
            <p>Thus have the <hi>Dutch</hi> in a <hi>blind</hi> pursuit of their particular Interests, built up a <hi>Prodigie of Power,</hi> which (having of late propagated a great Navigation of its own, as I shall more particularly shew) is now so swelling, and of so <hi>Serpentine</hi> a Nature, that it is ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour those who first gave it life.</p>
            <p>The yearly value of the late and present <hi>Exports</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> may be computed by what the <hi>English</hi> only took off, which suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be more moderate than Mr. <hi>Fortrey</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, (which yet I do not admit) <hi>viz.</hi> but <hi>two Millions Sterling,</hi> what a vast yearly Sum must it amount to? Since there is great reason to think, and I speak upon the best Authority I can meet with, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have taken off <hi>seven or eight times</hi> more yearly than the <hi>English</hi>; For besides the mighty quantities of <hi>Salt, Wine, and Brandy</hi> which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Consume, they Export vastly more of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34974:113"/>

            <p>Besides the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Hamburghers, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beckers, Swedes, Danes,</hi> and most or all other Mercantile Nations in this Part of the World, do yearly Freight themselves at the <hi>French</hi> Ports, (which must be one reason, and perhaps <hi>as yet</hi> the principal, why the <hi>French Language</hi> is become so <hi>Vniversal:</hi>) whilest the <hi>French</hi> take very little Consumptive Commodity from these, nor yet from the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> but <hi>East-India</hi> Spice, Callicoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Trade which the <hi>French</hi> King hath also manifestly designed to engage in, by an Association and Contribution of Stock in <hi>France,</hi> and his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to get footing in divers places of the <hi>East-Indies</hi>; some time will shew what his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess may be, or whether <hi>at a Lump,</hi> he hopes to Unite the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade and Strengths in those Parts to himself, by an Union of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Provinces and their Navigation to his present Empire; and whether then our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Factories there, will be able to preserve themselves against daily Violations, and utter Extirpation. In the mean time upon what hath been said, let the Reader compute, how many Millions Sterling must already yearly enter into <hi>France,</hi> by the Annual Vent of so
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34974:114"/>
Prodigious a Store of Commodities; it must be much the better part of <hi>Twenty Millions.</hi> I find it affirmed by a small Piece lately Printed, Intituled, <hi>An Accompt of the</hi> French <hi>Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon</hi> England; which seems Written by a man of good Judgment, That from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countries only, the <hi>French Wines</hi> now bring in 25 Millions of <hi>Florens</hi>; their <hi>Salt,</hi> 10 Millions of <hi>Florens; Brandy,</hi> 5 Millions; their Silks, Stuffs, Toyes, and Fripperies, 40 Millions of <hi>Florens</hi> more. What then do the <hi>French</hi> receive from all the other Regions of the World, for these, and other things?</p>
            <p>All which hath been visible in the <hi>gradual Increase</hi> of the <hi>French Power,</hi> from the time the <hi>Dutch</hi> Provinces began to Trade. It must be admitted that both before and since the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy became Absolute (this being a great and populous Nation) was able to bring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Armies into the Field; but they could get little or no ground by Arms on any of their Neighbours, or soon lost what they got: The People were abject and recreant; and more the Ridicule, than the terror of their Neighbours, the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Treasures and Strengths were notoriously too big for them; the <hi>English</hi> Conquered them several times; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more lately beat them out of <hi>Navarre, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Millan,</hi> and by their Faction in <hi>France,</hi> drove <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d.

I shall refer the particular Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it till the last Section.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I shall only add what I find in Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Book of <hi>Geography,</hi> p. 238, (who being to give an Accompt of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of that Countrey) tells us,
<q>That <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11<hi>th,</hi> gathered one Million, and an half of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:34974:115"/>
Crowns, <hi>Francis</hi> the 1<hi>st.</hi> brought them to three Millions; his Successor <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> to six; <hi>Charles</hi> the 9<hi>th.</hi> to seven; <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> to ten; <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> from two to five Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, Sterling.</q>
This he attributes meerly to the more <hi>Despotical Power,</hi> and greater Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the later Princes; and might be so in some measure: For in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi> whilst in War with the <hi>English,</hi> there was an Act by the Three <hi>French</hi> Estates, that the King might raise Money in case of Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which Power, 'tis likely was not at first used so moderately as it was after: However we cannot think <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> could <hi>leap</hi> from two Millions to five Millions Sterling, without a great Importation of Treasure, which does not grow on the Peoples backs like Wooll; the advance of the <hi>French</hi> Trade and Treasure, being the true Reason, we may believe the Revenue of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13<hi>th.</hi> was raised to more than double this, <hi>viz.</hi> Ten Millions Sterling; and that since it is doubled again, <hi>viz.</hi> Twenty Millions, (as good Judges of it as I can meet with say, 'tis now above Twenty Millions Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) For the Treasures of the World being drawn into <hi>France,</hi> as into a <hi>Gulf,</hi> must answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably advance that King's Revenue, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Treasures of other Nations; which 'tis probable is partly the Cause that the Price of most Commodities in <hi>Europe</hi> are sunk; since
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34974:116"/>
according to the former Maxims, if there be less Money in the hands of other Trading Nations than before, they must and will buy for less.</p>
            <p>Having thus far pursued the Growth of the <hi>French Trade,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>; I shall now return to the <hi>English,</hi> as they were invested with the several Trades before mentioned in the time of our two last Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and shall endeavour to shew, First, how we come to lose the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of the <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi>; which was the Effect of many Concurring Causes; the <hi>Dutch</hi> were generally vigilant after all Trade, and particularly this, so much they shared with us long before, that they Dyed, Dressed, and Vended vast quantities of our white Cloaths Exported thither, by which they made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Gain. Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> about 60 years since, in his Observations on Trade pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to King <hi>James,</hi> proves, <hi>England</hi> in 55 years, had lost 55 Millions of Pounds by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Dyeing and Dressing our white Cloaths; But withal, the <hi>Dutch</hi> by their vast Navigation and Universal Trading, gave them a greater <hi>vent</hi> than we otherwise could do, unless by an equal Regulation of our Trade, the <hi>English</hi> had been made as Capable; without any thing of that, this course was taken; one Sir <hi>William Kokayne,</hi> and other Merchants, hoping to make
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34974:116"/>
an advantage to <hi>themselves,</hi> got a <hi>Patent</hi> for the Dyeing and Dressing of our Cloaths, with Power to hinder the Exportation of our white Cloaths; wherein we have our two usual Expedients in Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Restraint to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> and a <hi>Prohibition</hi>; by which our Vent was lessened, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> the more provoked to attempt this Manufacture at home; to which they had great encouragement by their <hi>Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for the Trade of <hi>Germany</hi>; and the rather because our <hi>Hamburgh Company,</hi> who by their Patent have the sole Trade on that Coast, for about six or seven hundred Miles, kept but two Staples, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Dort,</hi> remote from each other, and from many of those Countries which they supplied: So as many of those who come to our Markets, must pass and repass, through several Principalities with much Danger, and Payments of Tolls and Taxes; and besides, we raised our Prices, and set such terms on the Buyers, that others as well as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> were much <hi>disaffected</hi>; whereupon an Opportunity was offered: For about the year 1636. Two hundred Families of our Manufacturers being about to forsake <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Transport themselves to our Plantations, <hi>by reason of the then Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Dissenters,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> invited them into <hi>Holland,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> did not only entertain them, but in <hi>Leyden, Alkmaer,</hi> and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:34974:117"/>
other places, planted them Rent-free, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise-free, seven years. After these went more and more <hi>Colonies,</hi> which setled at <hi>Rotterdam, Middleburgh,</hi> and <hi>Flushing,</hi> where a fourth part of the Inhabitants are <hi>English,</hi> or of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Extraction: Besides vast numbers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> dispersed elsewhere in those Provinces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> having gotten the Manufacturers, had half done their work; they wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Wool,</hi> which if they might have on any tolerable Terms, their Advantages in the way of Trade, must enable them to out-doe us, this they Imported from <hi>Spain, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and elsewhere, falling a main upon the Woollen Manufactures of all sorts; so that about the year 1640. they pretended to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Cloth Trade in <hi>Germany,</hi> and soon afterwards took occasion to supply our <hi>Eastland and Northern</hi> Markets more and more; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with <hi>fine Cloth</hi>; getting ground upon us continually, they bought our Woolls dearer at first, but have gradually sunk the Prices; our Vigilant Neighbours, <hi>the French,</hi> started with them, or soon followed their Example, as did the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> the <hi>Silesians, Polanders,</hi> and some others mentioned before; by all which, these and other Parts of the World were as much supplied with coarse <hi>Cloths, Druggets, and Stuffs</hi>; but the <hi>Dutch</hi> would not rest here; Trade was their business, and they observed,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34974:117"/>
the virtue of ours (such as we had) depended wholly on <hi>Accidents,</hi> and particularly that of <hi>Muscovy</hi> on our <hi>Privilege</hi>; which therefore they found ways to evacuate, by bestowing Money amongst the Grandees of that Court, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing them with an Objection against our Merchants, as being <hi>Londoners,</hi> and therefore (as they insinuated) must be concerned as Actors in the <hi>horrid</hi> Murther of His late <hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi> which it was in vain for our Merchants to dispute, when the Judges were Fee'd on the other side; this powerful Metal (whereof the <hi>Dutch</hi> are never sparing on such occasions, and therein have a farther advantage upon us) had so radicated their Interests with the <hi>Boyars,</hi> that notwithstanding all Applications in an Honourable Embassy to the <hi>Great Czar</hi> from his <hi>now Sacred Majesty,</hi> by the <hi>Earl of Carlisle,</hi> our Privilege could never be regained.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, there followed two things convenient to be taken notice of for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of misapprehensions on either side; one was, that between the year (50) and (60) we had an Accidental Opportunity of increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our Treasure with the loss of our People, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Stocking <hi>Ireland</hi> with Inhabitants, and Cattle, after the Reduction of the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, and by furnishing it with all sorts of Goods and Necessaries, then much consumed or spoiled by the Wars and Disorders there;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34974:118"/>
which on a sudden, brought us almost all the Treasures of <hi>Ireland</hi>; which supposing but a Million and an half, or but a Million, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>
            <p>Another, which prevented us of as much Money as we thus got, if not of more, and doubtless exhausted us of some; In the year 1654. the late Usurper <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> (whose guilty fears made him Jealous of the <hi>English,</hi> and seek a support from <hi>France</hi>) did in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with <hi>France</hi> make a fatal War upon <hi>Spain</hi>; which, besides the seisure of our <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> effects, and our vast Losses at Sea in that War, interrupted our Trade <hi>with Spain,</hi> and gave the <hi>Dutch</hi> better footing, but <hi>opened</hi> our <hi>French Trade</hi>; at once weakning the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of our Trade, and the <hi>Ballance of all</hi> Europe.</p>
            <p>Thus it was before the year 1660. But in regard our Imports were then of far less quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and value than they were after, 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeable that our Trade might be yet bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, especially considering our then <hi>Irish</hi> Trade; but our Importations increasing, we find what Mr. <hi>Mun,</hi> a <hi>Principal English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> thought of it, by what he saith in his Book of Trade, Printed in (63.) But, as appears by the Preface,<note place="margin">Pag. 61.</note> was Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten some time before; the words are these,
<q>The whole Trade of the Realm for Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34974:118"/>
and Importations is now found to be about the yearly value of four Millions and a half of Pounds;<note place="margin">As for Mr. <hi>Mun</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal to Export Money in Trade, I have spoken to it before; and besides, he recommends the Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Customs, and easing of Trade, which (if fully done) it might be then convenient.</note> It may be yet increased 200000 <hi>l.</hi> more by the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Consumption of Foreign Wares, by this means we know the King shall be a Gainer near 20000 <hi>l.

By which words, I take it as very plain, that before he wrote, our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations and Importations were computed to stand even; which is the more enforced by the latter words, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Our Overballance appears to me to be so much of late years, that it might be wondred how any of our late Treasures could yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main amongst us, did we not also Consider that our Trade by degrees, in length of time, had before the year (60) brought a great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure into <hi>England,</hi> and that these our latest Prejudices and Losses have not been working upon us many years. But if the Overballance continue, it must soon sweep away what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; which Mr. <hi>Fortrey</hi> Prophetically fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in these words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Hereby it may appear how insensibly our Treasures must be exhausted, and our Nation Beggared, whilst we carelesly neglect our own Interests, and Strangers abroad are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to make their advantages upon us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> in his excellent Treatise of the <hi>Dutch</hi> does presage the like.</p>
            <p>Having laid it as a Ground, That</p>
            <q>
               <p>Whatever the Exportation wants in value, to Ballance,<note place="margin">Pag. 231, 232, 234.</note> the Importation must of necessity be made up with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money; he tells us, That by this we find out the Foundation of the Riches of <hi>Holland,</hi> as of their Trade, by Circumstances already rehearsed; for never any Countrey Traded so much, and consumed so little; they buy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, but 'tis to sell again, either upon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34974:120"/>
of the Commodity (<hi>viz.</hi> by Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture) or at a better Market: (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Trade from Port to Port).</p>
               <p>By all this Accompt of their Trade and Riches, it will appear that some of our Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims are not so certain, as they are Currant in our Common Politicks: As first, That the example and <hi>encouragement of Excess and Luxury,</hi> if employed in the Consumption of Native Commodities, is of advantage to Trade; the Custom or humour of Luxury, and Expence cannot stop at certain bounds; what begins in Native, will proceed in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commodities; and though the <hi>example rise among idle Persons, yet the Imitation will run into all degrees,</hi> even of those, by <hi>whose Industry the Nation subsists:</hi> and besides, the more of our own we spend, the less we shall have to send abroad; <hi>and so it will come to pass that while we drive a vast Trade, yet by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much more than we sell, we shall come to be poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas, when we drive a very smal Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick abroad, yet by selling so much more than we bought, we were very Rich in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our Neighbours.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This appeared in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time, when he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained so mighty Wars in <hi>France,</hi> and carried our Victorious Arms into the heart of <hi>Spain,</hi> Whereas in the 28<hi>th</hi> year of that King's Reign,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34974:120"/>
the Value and Custom of all our Exported Commodities, amounted to 294184 <hi>l.</hi> 17 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> and that of our Imported, but 38970 <hi>l.</hi> 03 <hi>s.</hi> 06 <hi>d</hi>; so as there must have entred that year into the Kingdom, in Coin or Bullion, or else have grown a Debt to the Nation, 255214 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 08 <hi>d.</hi> and yet we then carried out our Woolls unwrought, and brought in a great part of our Cloaths from <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence Two things may be remarked: First, That 'tis much in vain to increase the value of our Exports, if at the same time we increase our Imports to a yet greater value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now (perhaps) an 100 times more than value.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That although <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, revived the Order of the <hi>Round Table,</hi> he did not perform his great Atchievements by the meer virtue of Knight Errantry; there is no doubt but our succeeding Princes were enabled to make their Conquests in <hi>France,</hi> by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of our former Trade, then far more considerable than the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall only add, that this Consumption by our Importations, will not be prevented, but rather augmented by our <hi>late Prohibition of</hi> French <hi>Goods</hi>; as I shall demonstrate in the last Section.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>That a Considerable part of our late Treasure is exhausted: Application to our Publick and Private Revenues: Objections Answered, <hi>viz.</hi> The Plenty of Money to be let on Securities, Stores of Money in <hi>London,</hi> Stocks in Merchandize, the Over-weightiness of our Coin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>AFter what hath been said, it may seem little requisite to enquire whether Mr. <hi>Fortrey</hi> Prophesied a-right, when he foretold the Exhausting of our Treasure.</p>
            <p>If the Diffusive Body of the People be much Poorer than before, they have much less Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure than before; For Poverty is but the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Treasure. Now if the Question be whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Nation be Poorer, it must be undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from all those Badges of Poverty I have mentioned before, if any of those particular Men who find themselves <hi>at ease,</hi> are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to believe it, they may be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from the universal Cries of the People, (at least from the Land-holders, remaining Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers, and their Dependants who make up the gross and stanch Body of the Nation) they remember when it was otherwise, when
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34974:121"/>
there was a far greater plenty of Money in all our inferiour Cities, Corporations, and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; when our Farmers had their Rents before hand, and had Stocks for every Farm; when they and our Manufacturers got Estates, and when vast Taxes could be readily raised; and therefore are the most proper Judges of the odds, who feel the present Scarcity, and want of Money; they cannot conspire in a Falsity of this Nature, but in so general and near a Concern, The Voice of the People hath been taken to be like the <hi>Speech of God.</hi> Those that find their Stocks wasted, or much Contracted, their late Revenues sunk, their home-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities yield much less value, their labours in Manufactures turn to less Profit, or to none at all, the poor and their Maintenances vastly increased, the Nation involved in Debts, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney very hard to be gotten or raised in the way of home-Trade, with other Common hardships, cannot be argued out of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; <hi>Crede quod habes &amp; habes,</hi> is no Logick in matters of Interest, but amongst Fools and Madmen; or let Men be never so good at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading or believing, yet when their Estates and Stocks are thus sunk, they cannot answer the Publick Emergencies by Payment of as great Taxes as before.</p>
            <p>I should not say more to prove our Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Treasure is much diminished, (taking it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34974:122"/>
to be indisputable; and being sensible, that the over-labouring a Truth, may bring it in question) but having something to offer, by which (as it seems to me) some nearer Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may be made of the Quantity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thus exhausted, I shall present it to the Reader, desiring his Excuse, if he think it unnecessary.</p>
            <p>So great was the Quantity of our late <hi>Harp and Cross Money,</hi> before the year (60) that according to the best Estimate I can make or meet with, it made about 10 or 15 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of our Common Money in tale in the <hi>Countrey,</hi> and more in <hi>London,</hi> which I do not take to be the meer Effect of our extraordinary Exports in Trade, for the years then last preceding, but partly of the Plate then lately Coined, and our Stocking <hi>Ireland</hi>; but more than either, from our far less yearly Imports of all kinds se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years before 1660.</p>
            <p>I must refer it to the Memory, or other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Reader, whether he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with me in the aforesaid late quantity of <hi>our Harp and Cross Money</hi>; whatsoever it were, this Money being taken in to be recoined in the year (60) must, when recoined, produce the like Quantity of His <hi>Majestie's Coin</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which, according to the said Accompt in <hi>November</hi> (75) there had then been 2238997 <hi>l.</hi> more Coined since His Majestie's Restoration,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:34974:122"/>
and since the said Accompt, there hath been yet <hi>more</hi> Coyned; which supposing to be but 600000 <hi>l.</hi> had the Money so Recoyned, and since Coyned with His now Majestie's Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, continued in the Nation, and the new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney under His Majestie's Impression, must have been much above Three Millions, I conceive near Four Millions; and then supposing we had Twelve Millions in the Nation, it would have been above 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of our currant Money in Tale; of more, were our whole Treasure less than Twelve Millions.</p>
            <p>Whereas we see at this day, that the new Money of His now Majestie's Impression, does not amount to above 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of the currant Money in <hi>the Countrey,</hi> taking one Payment with another, (especially in such Counties as lye any thing remote from <hi>London</hi>) I think not so much.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that in <hi>London,</hi> where the Mint and Merchants are, there is some greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of new Money, and perhaps somewhat more of late than usually; because that by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the <hi>late Forreign Wars,</hi> we have had somewhat a better Vent for our <hi>English</hi> Cloths, and a greater Exportation of our <hi>Annual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi> of Corn: But yet in <hi>London</hi> it does not make near 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> taking one Payment with another; nor I conceive, more than equal the quantity of our late Harp and Cross Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:34974:123"/>Now if the Money <hi>in His now Majesties Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> be <hi>less</hi> in quantity than the <hi>Harp and Cross Money,</hi> it must follow, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the Money since Coyned, we have less Money in the Nation than we had in (59;) if our present new Coyn but equal the Harp and Cross Money, it follows, that we have now no more Money than in (59). And in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Case, that as much of our new Coyn as amounts to the said whole 2238997 <hi>l.</hi> and all the other Money Coyned since <hi>November</hi> (75) is also Exported: For though we may still have some Coyn of each of the succeeding years since (59;) yet if all of it put together amounts to no more than the quantity of the Harp and Cross Money we had in (59,) our Stock of Treasure cannot be more than it was in (59:) if less, then our present Stock is less.</p>
            <p>And if Millions of our <hi>new Money,</hi> Coyned since (59) be gone, as, I take it, 'tis evident they are; we may reasonably Collect that as much or more of <hi>our old Coyn,</hi> is also Exported (by the old Coyn, I mean such as was Coyned in the Reigns of King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and before) of which we had lately a mighty Store, almost all of it valuable and unclipped, especially <hi>the Gold,</hi> whereof we had an abundance commonly passing in home-Trade and Payments, there is no reason why these Coyns, being as valuable or more,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34974:123"/>
should not be as good a Commodity in Trade as the new.</p>
            <p>And accordingly we may to our Comforts observe, that this late mighty Store <hi>of old Gold,</hi> is in a manner totally vanished, those few pieces which remain, being almost taken as Medals, never to be parted with.</p>
            <p>If it be said that part of our old Gold is Coyned into Guinnies, this will not alter the Case, since our whole new Coyn is no more in proportion to the old, than before is noted.</p>
            <p>So of our old Silver Coyn, there is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle remaining, but what is much Clipped, or worn; and therefore not valuable for Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. We have those yet alive who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what a flowing Treasure we had in all Parts of <hi>England,</hi> before we had any Harp and Cross Money, and are now sensible of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral scarcity and Want of it.</p>
            <p>This does let in a further Presumption, that our new Coyn is diminished to a much greater degree, than it appears to be: For, suppose we have now but a moiety of all the old Coyn we had in the year (59), 'Tis plain, that a moiety of the Harp and Cross Money (had it remained) would now hold the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the old, as the whole did in (59), and so will a moiety of our new Coyned Money; and thus will it be in any lesser proportions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:34974:124"/>If the new Coyn come to be <hi>less in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the old, than it was before, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible evidence of the <hi>Diminution</hi> of our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, because the old Coyn <hi>could not increase</hi>; But if the new Coyn come to be <hi>more in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> to the old Coyn than before, this is no manner of Demonstration of the increase of Treasure, since the decrease of the old Coyn may produce this Odds.</p>
            <p>Thus after the Consumption of our old Gold, we have more than Twenty Guinneys to one Broad Piece; but I think no body will press it as an Argument of more Gold in the Nation than we lately had; so having lost so great a part of our valuable old Silver Coyn, 'tis no Wonder if our new Silver Coyn seems so much as it doth, especially about <hi>London</hi>; perhaps it hath been a kind of Providence that we have had so much Clipt and worn Money; since otherwise we might have had as little old Silver, as we have old Gold; and might have been reduced to our present Store of new Silver Coyn, as we are to our Guinneys, which might have afforded a weighty Argument of the Increase of our Treasure.</p>
            <p>Upon these Grounds, and upon the common Wants, Necessities, and Decays mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it may reasonably be concluded, That besides the loss of most of those Millions Coyned since His Majestie's Restauration,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:34974:124"/>
we have lost many more Millions of the old Coyn in Silver and Gold; I shall leave the quantity to be computed by the indifferent Reader: Those who set out the said Accompt from the Mint, taking notice of the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of our Treasure by reason of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exported, did by the same Paper, then estimate it to be reduced to about four or five Millions, and by the Nature of that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, they seem no unfit Persons to make some competent Judgment of this Matter.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever our Coyned Treasure was when this Accompt was made, 'twas plainly much less then, than it would have been, had none been Exported; and though it must be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that our late Exportation of our Annual Corn, and what other advantages we had dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late War, may have somewhat helped us, yet we have reason to think it farther dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished now, especially considering our losses at Sea by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and others, before we dis-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from the late War, and since by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Algiers</hi> Pirates, and the mony late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and daily exported by <hi>Papists</hi> departed hence; to which may be added what we must now further export by the expiration of the <hi>Irish</hi> Acts, and the <hi>dear buying</hi> of these goods we imported from <hi>France,</hi> already added to the former Overballance of our Importations.</p>
            <p>Then let the Reader judg what we are to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34974:125"/>
hope for in our <hi>private and publick Revenues,</hi> I shall only endeavour to put him into a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of conjecturing, leaving the compute to his greater ingenuity and leisure. Suppose we have now 5, 6, or 7 Millions of Treasure in the Nation; let him consider how much of this must constantly lye in the <hi>hands of Traders</hi> to attend the payment of Customs, and the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of our vast importations; how much always is, and must be <hi>actually collected</hi> in <hi>Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> and either lies in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or in the hands of Officers; and how much does, and always will lye dead in <hi>Banks</hi> and other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate hands; and then, how much will at the same time (<hi>I say at the same time</hi>) be employed in the home-Markets to buy of the annual <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of Lands</hi>; perhaps it will not be half of the Whole: Then recollecting that we have 29568000 Acres of Land in <hi>England,</hi> what <hi>Rent</hi> can they yield, one with the other. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this whole Treasure at the same time stirring in the home-Markets, our whole Land-Revenues could not be much; all the help we have is, that we have many <hi>great wasts,</hi> which yielding little or nothing, a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of this floating money is applicable to the rest; and yet to our sorrow we have found that our Rents are mightily sunk, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not abated so much or speedily as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, our Yeomanry are generally impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish't.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:34974:125"/>Then for our <hi>publick Revenue,</hi> 'tis as plain, it must be confined to the stock of Treasure be it greater or less. We have many who seem to resent the narrowness of his Majestie's Revenue and Supplies, and are ready to expostulate why they should not be equal to the <hi>French King's</hi>; let them consider what may possibly be paid out of our Land Revenues thus contracted, and constantly charged with the maintenance of our numerous poor; and besides, that the <hi>English</hi> having by the constitutions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment an undoubted <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>property,</hi> are accustomed to live well, and their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives, being a part of themselves, in whose disposition it lies to give supplies or not, will have regard to their own and the peoples abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: should they give extravagantly it would be like <hi>Diego</hi>'s Will, and must induce many of those sad consequences mentioned before; what then if we should be involved in any long Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign War, or obliged to any great extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry publick Charge in time of Peace, whilst we remain under a consumptive Trade? which I intimate once more to shew the necessity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving our Trade.</p>
            <p>I shall now answer some common Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>The most usual is, That there is now <hi>as much money to be let on good Securities in</hi> England, <hi>as there are Securities,</hi> or rather more; from
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34974:126"/>
whence some infer that there is as much, or more money than ever in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, That on the contrary, it only proves the scarcity of Securities, and therein the poverty of the Nation; for <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Security</hi> for money being in a manner <hi>lost</hi>; all the floating money to be let out at interest is thrust upon Land-Securities; which (were they all good) would take off much less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney than was let out at interest when both Land and Personal Securities stood: But, as the National Poverty hath subverted Personal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, so hath it crept into the Land; for mens estates are already so entangled with Debts, that there is not one Land-Security in twenty that is good, as dear experience hath now taught us, Then, the Securities being grown so scarce and narrow, 'tis no wonder that there is now as much money to be let out as there are Securities, and more. Thus if a man had 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Shetland,</hi> he would there hardly find any Security for it; which at this rate of arguing would prove the Isle of <hi>Shetland</hi> richer than the Isle of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon this occasion I shall add, That there is no possible way for restoring the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities and Credits of <hi>England,</hi> but by restoring its Riches; no <hi>Register</hi> can do it, at least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the other; we may Register our
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34974:126"/>
common Poverty, but nothing will make an ill man value his credit, or able to satisfie for a Cheat, but his own private wealth; nothing can make a man who is honestly inclined to do a foul thing, but Poverty and Necessity.</p>
            <p>Another Objection, partly answered before, is, That <hi>there is still as much money in and about</hi> London, <hi>as ever</hi>; from whence they would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue as much money in the Nation as before.</p>
            <p>I cannot admit this fact; if I did, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is lame and frivolous; however, because there hath been such a pother made about the money in <hi>London,</hi> I shall give some further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</p>
            <p>I agree that there are considerable quantities of money always lodging in and about <hi>London,</hi> in some particular hands: But the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the King's Revenue is paid in, and issued out, in and about <hi>London.</hi> There is also the <hi>Mint,</hi> and there do our <hi>principal Merchants</hi> live, who Trade with so much exported money or bullion, and keep money dead for the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms. This is also the great Port for Forreign Importations; and the Country Retailers, who buy them there and vend them to the people, must send up their money to <hi>London</hi>: Upon which and the like occasions, 'tis thought near half the money in <hi>England</hi> is in <hi>London</hi>: The more is the pity; it were much better for the Nation that there were more <hi>home-Manufacture,</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:34974:127"/>
with Forreign <hi>Stores</hi> of re-exportable Goods, and a less proportion of our money; and the rather because it stagnates for a time in the hands of Merchants, Banquers, and Scriveners; and facilitates the culling, melting, and expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. This being the great <hi>Sluce</hi> of our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure will necessarily draw it from all parts, as long as we have any in the Nation.</p>
            <p>These Stores of money in <hi>London</hi> must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence the poverty of the people, who being over ballanced by the money drawn out for Importations and Taxes, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of answering those payments by Bills or Returns to <hi>London</hi>; very much of our Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have been sent up in <hi>Carts and Waggons,</hi> and our Country Retailers continually send up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in specie <hi>by the Carriers</hi>; which must drein away that which remains, in a little time: Nor do those Stores of money much spread, or benefit the general body of Traders, even in <hi>London</hi>; who were never so poor or broke so fast (tho never so fine) as now. It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that the occasions, vanities, or the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stock of the Kingdom can ever support such a prodigious Increase of Retailers and Shop-keepers as are in and about <hi>London,</hi> being near 100000 in number, when in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> there are not 5000.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be objected, That I have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>our present Stores of Merchandize</hi> or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34974:127"/>
Effects as part of the National wealth.</p>
            <p>First, because the present question is about the actual <hi>fruit and produce</hi> of a National Trade in new Treasure; and not about the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Stores of Merchandize or Forreign Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, That if a Nation whose Trade is truly regulated, hath a great <hi>Store-house</hi> of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Goods, as in</hi> Holland, <hi>or great Forreign ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> 'tis very possible and likely that these may produce new Treasure; and if they do, then is the National gain in Treasure to be computed, and not before.</p>
            <p>For on the other side 'tis impossible (even in a Nation that hath a due ballance of Trade) that such Stores and Effects may produce no Treasure; for the Forreign Stores being re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported may be lost by the perils of the Sea, or Seisures of Princes or Pirates: we may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the late seisures of the <hi>English,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Capers; the like casualties do attend Forreign Effects, for which we may also remember when our Effects were seized in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly, Supposing none of those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualties, yet (as a National Trade may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged) these stores and Effects shall produce no new Treasure to the Nation; as when these Forreign Goods and Stores are, and must be spent at home; and the Forreign Effects are continually by Bills of Exchange, applied to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34974:128"/>
pay for those Forreign Goods; so if the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are sometimes forced to Import and Coyn some Forreign Bullion yearly, but yet Export it, or the like quantity of Money or Bullion, the Nation gets nothing; and if more Treasure be Exported than is yearly Imported, the Nation loses; in which Case the stock so imployed in Trade doth prejudice the wealth of the Nation; since in the Whole it makes up a monstrous Engin for the Bulgeing out of its Treasure; and that this hath been the Case of our <hi>English</hi> Trade, is plain enough.</p>
            <p>Nor can the <hi>Forreign Stock</hi> in such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Trade be of any great value, since as some Effects are gotten by our Merchants in one Forreign Countrey, so are debts contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in another, as long as our Merchants can have credit; and then perhaps our Forreign debts may be near the value of our Forreign Effects, and probably more; or however, cannot be thought equal to our former stock in Trade, when we were not over ballanced.</p>
            <p>There are yet other objectors, who admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting much of our Treasure Exported, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse our Trade, and assign the cause of it in the <hi>over weightiness of our Coyn,</hi> and the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing</hi> it in our <hi>Forreign Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are old inconsiderate fancies, sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuted before, yet I should be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:34974:128"/>
in it, had not Mr. <hi>Mun</hi> in his Book of Trade taken the pains to clear this and the like obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by evident reason and instances, in six several Chapters, beginning at <hi>pa.</hi> 62. proving withal, that nothing but the Overballance of Trade can exhaust the National Treasure; to which therefore I refer the Reader.</p>

            <p>FRom what hath been said, it is evident that <hi>National power</hi> is not Chimerical, but is founded on <hi>People and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>; and that, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent condition of these its true Pillars, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately grows more vigorous or languid: that sufficient stores of Treasure cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be gotten, than by the industry of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and, That till they have it, they cannot pay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>People</hi> are therefore in truth the chiefest, most fundamental, and pretious commodity, out of which may be derived all sorts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, Navigation, Riches, Conquests, and solid Dominion: This <hi>capital material,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it self <hi>raw</hi> and indigested, is committed into the hands of the Supreme Authority; in whose prudence and disposition it is, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, manage, and fashion it to more or less ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; if any individual Manufacturer should permit his <hi>raw materials</hi> to be Exported into Forreign Countreys, or should himself make great store of knots of felters in his Yarn, he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34974:129"/>
would soon have a very slender, or difficult business of it: so great an odds there is in the different disposition of the ordinary industry of the people, that on the one hand, they may be thrust on in the pursuit of private interest, destructive to the publick, and be obliged like <hi>Cannibals</hi> to live by devouring one another, (by which they must continually and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wound and weaken the publick:) when on the other, their ordinary labours, more apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and industriously methodized, shall as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably aggrandize that Government which protects them; and this without the Midwife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of those Arts, Shifts, and Projections, which otherwise may be found necessary for its more present Support.</p>
            <p>More particularly it appears, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>French power,</hi> which is now the admiration and terror of the World, hath no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and therefore is not derived from the meer <hi>despotick Form</hi> of that Government, as some would insinuate, but from a prudent <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the Rigor of it towards the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Stocks of the Trading part of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this Form of Government being in its nature the most incompatible with Trade, of all others; nor probably had Trade ever recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any encouragement in <hi>France,</hi> but upon a <hi>necessity</hi>; this Monarchy being become abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, was yet low, poor, and despicable; beset
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34974:130"/>
round about with <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, Territories, and Allies, and poisoned with <hi>Spanish</hi> Pensions within, and therefore ready to become a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Province: It was then that this Monarchy found <hi>absoluteness</hi> without sufficient Treasure was but a trifle: That Arbitrary power might force store of <hi>Blood and Tears</hi> from the people, but not of <hi>Money,</hi> unless they had it: It was then that the opening and growth of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade presented an expedient of drawing in greater quantities of the diffused Treasures of the World into <hi>France</hi> by a Machine of home-Manufactures, than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their Mines; which therefore was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the <hi>dying hands</hi> of this Monarchy, and supported and improved ever since by a Succession of understanding men: which appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently was not done by any peculiar virtue in this <hi>Form</hi> of Government, but by a necessary Abating of its inherent rapaciousness, which otherwise would have swallowed up every <hi>Sols</hi> of the stocks imployed in Manufactures and other Trade, and thereby would have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away the people; as may be seen in the <hi>strong</hi> Governments of <hi>Turkey, Muscovy, Spain,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Councils discerning where the true strength of Empire lay, were not so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch't with the <hi>lusciousness</hi> of their Arbitrary power as to seek any such extreme execution

of it; their policies have long gone another way, as may be infallibly collected from the effects, and by other lights: So long ago as <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's time of <hi>France, Bernard de Gerrard</hi> Lord of <hi>Haillan,</hi> a great Politician in his time, presented an excellent piece to that King, intituled, <hi>The Estate and Success of the Affairs of</hi> France, thereby representing <hi>by what courses that Kingdom had been, or might be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandized or weakened</hi>; amongst others, he highly recommends the <hi>Support of the Populacy,</hi> beginning thus
<q>The people are by Justice to be preserved in <hi>liberty,</hi>

For so it was, that the Nobles or Gentry, being discharged of the Tailles, had given up the Constitution of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states; for which, <hi>they</hi> had been indulged with a kind of <hi>despotick power,</hi> within their own particular <hi>Fiefs</hi>; from whose barbarities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the greatest sufferings of the people; whereof this Author is not nice or sparing to

I have troubled you with this citation, because this piece was by the Author Re-dedicated to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, whom the Author tells in his Epistle, <hi>That his Predecessor</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 3<hi>d. used to read it with an Appetite,</hi> and yet the Author goes so far as to applaud the Antient Constitution of the Estates or <hi>Parliaments</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> affirming them to have been the <hi>mutual Succour, Medicine, and Remedy both of the King and People in all their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi>

In the Chapter of <hi>General Orders,</hi> Usury is thought fit to be Prohibited (which is accordingly suppressed by an <hi>Edict:</hi>) I shall leave it to Enquiry, whether most of the rest of these Politicks relating to matters at home, are not established by other <hi>Edicts</hi>; if the Reader would further observe, how curious the <hi>French</hi> Politicks are to provide for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and true Use of Populacy, I shall refer him to the Thirteenth Chapter of this Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tract, directing the <hi>Education of Children,</hi> and when 'tis fit to <hi>Marry</hi> them; and to the Chapter of <hi>Commerce,</hi> or rather to the whole piece. By all I have said, it appears, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>French</hi> Kings have assumed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, the <hi>French</hi> Politicks have not <hi>rested</hi> upon this as a <hi>Security,</hi> but for the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing of that Monarchy, have found it necessary to <hi>relax and retire</hi> from the severity of this Power, and to resort to <hi>popular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:</hi> a Matter, which may deserve the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our <hi>New Polititians</hi> the <hi>Hobbists,</hi> who place all the virtue of the <hi>French</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in its <hi>absoluteness:</hi> In the mean time I shall add, that notwithstanding what I have said, I do not pretend that the Condition of the <hi>French</hi> People, though made tolerable to the <hi>French,</hi> is comparable to the happiness of those whose greater Freedoms and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are secured by Fundamental Laws and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34974:133"/>
Constitutions: But this I shall observe, That whereas formerly, when this People were wretchedly poor, almost every small new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position begot an <hi>Insurrection</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as the said <hi>De Gerrard</hi> takes notice, the <hi>French</hi> now pay twenty times greater Taxes, with much more Satisfaction, because they are enabled so to do; and besides can live far more plentifully than before, many of the Traders splendidly, and gain considerable Estates: To all which may be added another particular, in which the late <hi>French</hi> Politicks deviate from the usual <hi>Jealous Maxims</hi> of <hi>Arbitrary Government</hi>; which is a general care to instruct the <hi>Plebeians</hi> of all sorts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the <hi>Discipline of Arms.</hi>

               <hi>Despotick,</hi> or <hi>Arbitrary Monarchy,</hi> was for many Ages as great a Stranger in this Part of the World, as <hi>Republican Government</hi>; As the <hi>European</hi> Nations by degrees cast off the <hi>Roman Yoke,</hi> they had before their eyes the Example of their former <hi>Mistress,</hi> the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which became Vassalized to her own <hi>Servants,</hi> by the unlimitted Power committed to Dictators and Generals; these assuming the Empire <hi>by force,</hi> and <hi>without title,</hi> were uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable by Law, and therefore did not only gratifie <hi>their own</hi> Lusts, and just Fears of being supplanted by all manner of Cruelties, but their <hi>Masters the Soldiers</hi> also, by the Spoils of the Provinces; nay, and of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it self; and yet were they very frequently killed, deposed, and changed by the same force which set them up: To avoid the Mischiefs on each side, as the Members of this Empire resumed their National Rights, they universally ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented into a third Form of Government, much the same with <hi>ours:</hi> which, if we truly consider it, appears purposely, and wisely Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to prevent the Inconveniencies of the other two, and yet to take in all that is <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in either</hi>; For first, we have a fixt Royal Legal Sovereignty, which filling the seat of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, frustrates the Ambitious hopes of others from stepping into it; Then we have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> by whose Interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34974:134"/>
Liberty and Property are preserved: Thus Revolutions and Oppressions <hi>at home</hi> are prevented. Then for the strength of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>outwards</hi> upon Forreign Nations, it must <hi>in the Nature of it,</hi> equal, if not exceed any other, especially absolute Monarchy; not only because its greater <hi>freedoms</hi> capacitate the People to Trade with more advantage, as I shall yet more particularly shew, but because the same <hi>freedoms</hi> beget a kind of Generosity and Bravery even in the <hi>common sort,</hi> when Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteness of Government debases their Spirits, and reconciles them to the Ignominy of being <hi>beaten,</hi> at least till they acquire a kind of <hi>inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> by long Service in War, which can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called <hi>Courage.</hi> All Experience hath warranted this odds between Freemen and Slaves; but there is yet a farther odds, when the Quarrel is <hi>National,</hi> especially if espoused both by the King and Parliament; for then the <hi>individual</hi> Animosities of the <hi>Whole</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, the People do not meerly fight for Pay, but out of <hi>Principle,</hi> and in defence of those greater Enjoyments they have at home, when the Vassals of Absolute Monarchy are driven on by the fear of their <hi>Despotical Power,</hi> which they would be glad to see subverted, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves delivered.</p>
            <p>In an <hi>Absolute</hi> Monarchy, the Fate of the Whole depends upon the <hi>Prudence</hi> of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34974:134"/>
be his Empire never so flourishing, he may by one <hi>temerarious Edict,</hi> or other Act, bring all into Confusion: How great must the Danger then be, when the wisest of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal men are often transported by Passions, and otherwise liable to Mistakes? The voluntary Councils of such a Monarch must gratifie his Power by Applauding or Complying with his Resolutions and Sentiments: But what if there come a <hi>weak</hi> Prince? against which there is no Security? Or suppose the King be left an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant?</hi> then all goes to wrack: those Armies which were the <hi>support</hi> of the last Predecessor, wanting Business and Conduct, fall into <hi>Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>; all are working their Ambitious ends, many contending for the <hi>Tuition</hi> and Publick Administration; those that have it not, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting those that have, whereby the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is endangered: all which was visible during the whole Infancy of the present <hi>French King,</hi> though he had a <hi>Mother,</hi> and so faithful and wise a Minister as <hi>Mazarine:</hi> The high Animosities of the <hi>French Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> carried them into continual Distractions and Civil Wars; so that had the <hi>English,</hi> or any other Neighbour Nation, then been in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to have supported the Male-contents, they might have Subverted the <hi>French Empire: which mischiefs</hi> are totally, or in a high mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure avoided by the Constitution of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>;

without whose consent, Laws cannot be altered, or Publick Innovations made; and who by their course of <hi>Impeachments</hi> are a continual Check and Awe upon men of indirect and Ambitious designs: So that (according to the excellent Motto of our own Sacred Prince) it may be truly said of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and its <hi>Parliaments,</hi> that they are to each other <hi>Decus &amp; Tutamen:</hi> what would have become of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy when their King <hi>John</hi> was Prisoner in <hi>England,</hi> had it not been for their Estates, or <hi>Parliaments?</hi> we have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That were that <hi>Crown and Nation</hi> brought into great Exigencies and Distresses <hi>by any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power,</hi> they would be convened again, the Constitution being not <hi>there</hi> absolutely <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,</hi> as the said <hi>De Gerrard</hi> Observes; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be fatal to such a Government, but a disunion between the Prince and Parliament, and therefore a great part of the transcendent Policy of this our Form of Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the high <hi>Obligations</hi> and <hi>means</hi> of a <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi> the Prince being invested with the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of making War and Peace, Calling, Prorogueing, and Dissolving <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and as many others as fill Volumes, hath such a Controll on the Parliament, that it is generally to be presumed, they will ever gratifie him in whatsoever is any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with that <hi>Trust</hi> they are under; on the

other side, the <hi>Parliament,</hi> being the great and High Council, and their Consent requesite to all new Taxes, whensoever the Prince on any Emergency desires their Advice, or a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Money, the People must necessarily have time to represent their true grievances to him, whose Princely favour and occasions, will then equally call upon him to redress what is really amiss; <hi>in which Commutation</hi> he must have a far greater advantage than any <hi>bare Tax</hi> he receives; since as it appears, the true strength of all Monarchies and Governments depend upon well-being Abilities, and Increase of the <hi>Populacy</hi>; which no other Prince hath Comparably so certain a means to understand and Improve, as he that hath a Parliament: To all which may be added, that <hi>mutual Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> which must naturally follow these Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and which must render the Prince and Nation much the stronger, never to be hoped for in any other kind of Monarchy: There are yet farther Obligations to this <hi>Vnion</hi> between the Prince and People from a just sense of those fatalities which must follow a <hi>disunion</hi>; we need not resort farther than to the Fable where we have an Accompt of a quarrel between the several Limbs of the Body Natural, whereof the Consequence was, that every part grew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently Languid and Impotent, and ready to yield it self a Feast to the <hi>Ravens.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:34974:137"/>That a speedy and Compleat Regulation of our <hi>English</hi> Trade may yet further appear highly necessary, I shall briefly observe what have been the more Modern Effects of this mighty Trade in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may too plainly be seen by the great performances of the <hi>French</hi> in these last Wars, in which, the <hi>French</hi> King hath been able to maintain above 250000 Men in Arms, whom he hath duly paid; and yet such have been his Treasures, That he hath not been obliged to put the event of the War to the <hi>push</hi> of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; but wearies out his Enemies with Expence from year to year, and being able to lay up mighty Stores, can keep the Fields in the <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when his Adversaries, though as valiant People as any on the Earth, are fain to lye at home: Thus watching his Advantages, he hath Taken and Burnt many strong Towns, laid many Provinces wast, breathing out Death and Devastations as he goes. This he hath done in the face of the world, in a War with near 20 Princes and States, whose lamentable Sufferings, with the Cries of their People, have long pierced our ears; whilst the <hi>French</hi> King grows more Vigorous and Powerful, and his Armies grow better Disciplined continually, and hath at last reduced the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> to the Terms of a dishonourable Peace, by exposing their Allies to the <hi>French</hi> Power;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:34974:138"/>
which hath obliged the rest to a Complyance on his own Terms; and now he gives the Law to them All, keeping mighty Armies on foot to Invade whom he pleases: But that which is yet more Prodigious is, that even during this War, he hath been able to carry on the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his present <hi>great Fleet,</hi> consisting of about 200 Ships of War, plentifully Armed with Brass Guns, and accurately built for Service; he hath also furnished himself with abundant of Naval Provisions of all sorts, at an immense Charge, every Ship having its distinct Stores and Storehouse, and therefore may be made ready on a suddain: At the same time, he hath imployed multitudes of Men in cutting of Canals through Rocks and Mountains, in making, cleansing, and securing Havens upon the Coasts opposite, or near to <hi>England</hi> (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by degrees, in these two or three years past, he hath drawn down the greatest part of his Navy) and at the same time hath answered mighty Annual Pensions to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Swisses,</hi> (whose lives he buys with his Money:) besides all the other vast private Pensions, Gratuities and Aids he bestows in the Courts and Countreys of other Princes, (by which, perhaps he hath made as great Advantages as by his Arms:) and yet 'tis probable, that in all this he hath not exceeded the bounds of his ordinary Revenue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:34974:138"/>That which most threatens the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> is his <hi>Naval Force,</hi> which none of his Predecessors ever had, and were checked if they pretended to it; Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad <hi>Henry the</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>France</hi> (on a suddain called the Great) Building great Ships, else she would fire them in his Harbours: Since which the <hi>French</hi> have desisted, till about the year 1664. as may appear by that excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, intituled, <hi>A free Conference,</hi> Printed in 1667. by the special Appointment of the truly Honourable the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> where <hi>Pag.</hi> 49. we find these words,
<q>Not above three years ago, <hi>France</hi> was hardly able to set out 20 Ships; (that is to say, Men of War) now they have 60 large Vessels ready furnished, and well Armed, and do apply their Industry in every part to Augment the number, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
I shall forbear repeating some sharp Reflections which next follow.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>French</hi> King might want no <hi>Seamen</hi> of his own, and might at least <hi>share</hi> in the Gain of <hi>Navigation,</hi> he hath for several years past endeavoured by all Imaginable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to establish a mighty Navigation in <hi>France</hi>; so that for one Trading <hi>French</hi> Ship there was 20 or 30 years since, there are now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 40. For this purpose he hath Propagated a Sea-Fishery, to a very great degree, which Improves daily to the prejudice of our remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34974:139"/>
               <hi>English</hi> Fishery; and besides, hath yearly educated Supernumerary Seamen on Board the <hi>French</hi> Trading Ships, at his own Charge; so that 'tis to be feared he will stand in little need of Forreign <hi>Seamen</hi> for his Ships of War; or if he do, the <hi>Dutch</hi> have Store, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may have for his Money, as 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he may the Fleets of <hi>Swedeland, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Algiers</hi>; these his Allies of <hi>Algiers,</hi> (as 'tis said, by the assistance of his Money upon a a general Redemption of <hi>French</hi> Slaves) are on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den gotten from 10 to above 40 Men of War;<note place="margin">Note, most of that Fleet which the <hi>Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> had (which was but small) was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>English</hi> at Cape <hi>Spartell,</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> about eight years since; They have since Built 40 Men of War, from 20 to 50 Guns and upwards, besides Brigantines, Gallies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and as soon as our Applications in <hi>France</hi> had prevailed with the <hi>French</hi> to desist from taking our Ships, these <hi>Algiers</hi> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats fell upon us, and have continually pick't up our Merchantmen, and Vassalized our Seamen and other People ever since; they now do it before our faces, in our Channel, finding Harbour in the <hi>French</hi> opposite parts, which makes a great Addition to our late Losses; and, which is yet worse, hath so terrified our <hi>Seamen</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> that many already think it necessary to trade in <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French Bottoms,</hi> a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which 'tis probable might be foreseen by some of our Neighbors, who wish we had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ships nor Seamen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:34974:139"/>At the same time our Gazetts weekly tell us of great Squadrons of <hi>French</hi> Men of War, proudly ranging in all Quarters of the World, in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> and in our own Seas, viewing the Strengths and Weaknesses, and Sounding and Commanding the Harbours of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>We find it said in the <hi>Free Conference,</hi>
               <q>That <hi>France</hi> is our Hereditary Enemy, and hath so often tryed what we are able to do against the enlarging of their Empire, who have graven it deep on their hearts, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of the Title, which to their shame <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> bears in all Publick Treaties, and her Trophies in reference to that Crown; This very <hi>France</hi> hath no greater desire than to take the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Sea</hi> from us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If we look into the before-mentioned <hi>French Politicks,</hi> they assure us of the same; of which piece, because I so often cite it; I shall first give the Reader some <hi>present</hi> Accompt; and <hi>farther,</hi> when I have done with it:
<q>The <hi>English</hi> Preface tells us, the Author was a Person bred up under Monsieur <hi>Colebert,</hi> and to shew his Abilities, writ this Treatise, and in Manuscript presented it to the <hi>French</hi> King, which was favourably received; but afterwards Vanity prompting him to publish it in Print, the King look't upon him as one
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:34974:140"/>
that had <hi>discovered his Secrets,</hi> and turning his favour into frowns, caused him to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned in the <hi>Bastile,</hi> where he continued a long time, and afterwards was Banished, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
'tis like to some place where he should not be able to aver the same, or disclose more Secrets; what opportunities he might have of learning Secrets by his Attendance on Monsieur <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> whether he might over-hear the Debates and Results of the <hi>French</hi> Councils, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Casually, or by order he had a View of the Papers, and was but the servile Compiler, or bare Porter of this Scheme or Manual of Policies, I leave to be examined; a stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious piece it is, which being written seven or eight years since, and presaging so great a part of what hath followed, gives so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an Authority to it self, that its Credit need not depend upon that of the Author of the <hi>Growth of Popery</hi>; who, as 'tis hinted in the <hi>English</hi> Preface, calls it the Measures of the <hi>French</hi> King's Designs.</p>
            <p>These Politicks having first delineated the Comprehensive and steddy Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy,<note place="margin">Pag. 162, 163.</note> as built upon Trade, Treasure, and Populacy at home, they then proceed to look abroad, and first they project the Ingrossing of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce at Sea, and this <hi>at a lump,</hi> by imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of this Treasure in Building a Fleet of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:34974:140"/>
Men of War able to Command it, in which they say,</p>
            <q>
               <p>All things Conspire to give the <hi>French</hi> hopes of Success; the work how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is such as must be <hi>leisurely</hi> carried on, and perfected by little and little, so <hi>great a Design continually Alarming Europe, Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> Friends and Foes; a Precipitation of it would be its Ruine, Six or Ten years time might be Allotted for it: The King may keep 100 Gallies, and 100 Ships in the Mediterranean, and 200 Sail upon the <hi>Ocean,</hi> the more Vessels he shall have, the more enabled he will be to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Expence made about them: The Sea will yield Maintenance for the Sea, either by Commerce or War; There is Timber in <hi>France,</hi> there is Cordage, there are Sails, there is Iron and Brass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When things have taken their Course, Seamen will be had in time, and the profit that will accrew will afford Store, and bring them in <hi>from all Parts of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fleets with the King might keep upon the <hi>Ocean,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 165.</note> would make him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of all the <hi>Powers and Trade</hi> of the <hi>North</hi>; yea, though the <hi>Hollander</hi> and <hi>English</hi> should <hi>Vnite</hi> against <hi>France,</hi> they could not avoid their Ruine <hi>in the end</hi>; for how could the one or the other make good their Commerce (which is all they have to trust to) if they
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34974:141"/>
were forced to keep great Armadoes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it? The Point of <hi>Britain</hi> is the <hi>Gate</hi> to enter into, and go out of the <hi>Channel:</hi> Fifty Ships of War at <hi>Brest,</hi> would keep this <hi>Gate fast shut,</hi> and they would not open it but by the Kings Command.—<hi>Thus there would need no War almost to be made for all these things, nor His Majestie's Forces hazarded: It will be sufficient to give his Orders to Forreigners; nor will it be difficult to cut them out work in their own Countries,</hi> and by this means stay their Arms at home, and make them spend their strengths there; something of this in its place hereafter.</p>
               <p>His Majestie's Power being thus strongly setled in each Sea, it will be easie to <hi>secure</hi> Commerce in <hi>France,</hi> and even <hi>draw</hi> the Merchants thither from all parts; I say <hi>secure</hi> Commerce; for till this be done, it will ever be incertain and dangerous.</p>
            </q>
            <p>It may not be improper to observe, with some reference to what hath been debated in the preceding Sections, what further Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients the <hi>French</hi> Politicks dictate in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the <hi>securing</hi> of Commerce: Amongst others we there find this Caution;
<q>It must be studiously prevented that Commerce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce not into a <hi>State-Superfluity, Excess,</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> which are often follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Ambition,<note place="margin">Pag. 169.</note> Avarice, and a <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34974:141"/>
Corruption of Manners:</hi> It is added,<note place="margin">Pag. 171.</note> That it hath been a question offered to debate, whether Traffick in <hi>France</hi> should be <hi>managed by Subjects or Forreigners,</hi> to make a short decision; 'tis evident that Forreigners must be allowed to gain our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, if we would have them take them off, if we carry them into their Ports, we shall make less Sales; yet, That our Merchants may <hi>share in the profit,</hi> they may enter into Partnership with them, or be their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners here, or Freight them themselves, provided they sell at somewhat <hi>cheaper Rates,</hi> and <hi>so be content with moderate Gain.</hi>
               </q>
Which passages I have cited to shew,<note place="margin">See Sir <hi>William Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> Pag. cited before, <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.</note> That 'tis no part of their Politicks <hi>to increase Luxuries or Excess</hi>; nor to inclose their home and Forreign Market to their <hi>own Navigation or Merchants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been thus long tracing the <hi>French</hi> Politicks, and our own unfortunate Methods in the matter of Trade, and this out of a hope to occasion the Restitution and Increase <hi>of ours</hi>; but have gone so far in the pursuit, that on a sudden I have step't into a Scene of Horrors, by a necessary and inevitable Apprehension of the Dangers we are in, from the present <hi>French</hi> Powers; it is impossible for any man to close up the eye of his Reason, when he sees a Ghastly

Troop of Ruins making their regular Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches against his Prince and his Countrey, and therein threatning many Millions of poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, and of these some Millions, who hardly <hi>know their right hands from their left,</hi> with Butcheries and Violations of all kinds; in such a Case, Silence would be the greatest and foulest of Barbarities, and no better than an Apostacy from the sacred Duties of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> and <hi>Self-Preservation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall we flatter our selves with an opinion that the <hi>French</hi> have no inclination to turn their mighty Treasures, Land and Sea-Forces upon us? How poor, weak, incertain and dishonourable is such a Security? Are we so tenacious of every little pretence of Right at home, and so busie to get a Penny, and yet shall be content to enjoy our Lives and Estates by no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Tenure than the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>French?</hi>

Is it not evident that the present <hi>French</hi> King aims at the Trade of the World, and particularly of the North? doth he not want Ports? will it not be more grateful to him to engross the Woollen Manufacture by securing the <hi>English Wooll,</hi> than to stand to our Courtesie?

Are our <hi>Talbots,</hi> and <hi>Bedfords</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? Did he not see us raise a considerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the other day to check his Progress? Is he not exasperated by our late Prohibition of <hi>French</hi> Goods, which touches him in the most tender Concern of his Trade? Doth he not think himself affronted in the face of the World?

Hereupon it follows <q>so it seems reasonable that we should make no Peace with them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>English; but on Conditions of the greatest Advantage to us,</hi> unless the King think fit to defer the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Project</hi> for another time:</q>

               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:34974:145"/>This <hi>great Prince</hi> hath thought fit hitherto to defer a <hi>formal War</hi> upon us, at least, under that Denomination; but whether he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the <hi>Project</hi> as these Politicks call it, may depend upon a Consideration of what he hath been <hi>visibly</hi> doing ever since; he hath been since building his Fleet, amassing his Naval Stores, Educating and Providing Seamen and Harbours, wasting and disabling those Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Empires and States, who being jealous of his Power, might otherwise have interposed in his Carriere, getting those great Passes and Strengths into his hands, by which they might have entred his Countrey, he hath been disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plining a victorious and mighty Army, and exhausting us by his Trade, with a great Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loss by his Capers; (the <hi>French</hi> are very curious at Cooking their Morsels before they eat them) and at last hath, as it were, <hi>forced</hi> a general Peace, even whilst he was Victorious, by which he is left at entire Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: of which Peace, whilst it was under Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, and drawing to a Conclusion, a wise and noble Lord of our time, gave this his sence to both our Houses of Parliament:<note place="margin">The present Lord Chancellour in his Speech to both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament, on the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1678.</note>
               <q>The influence such a Peace may have upon our affairs, is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for <hi>Meditation</hi> than discourse, only this is <hi>evident,</hi> that by the Preparations we have
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34974:145"/>
made for <hi>War, (viz.</hi> in the raising of our late Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and by the <hi>Prohibition</hi> we have made of Trade, we have given no small Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to so mighty a King, who may be at leisure enough to resent them if he please; and therefore it will Import us so to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our selves both at home and abroad, that it may not be found a cheap and easie thing to put an Affront upon us.</q>
I need not inform any <hi>English</hi> Reader, what fatal Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions the same Parliament had of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of such a Peace; they are in ordinary Memory; can we think this Fleet of Men of War is built to be employed in the Fishery, or to lye and rot in their Harbours? Can this Army profitably, or safely be supported Idle? Will he suffer them to be tainted with Luxury? Will he hazard Animosities or Factions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the numerous <hi>French</hi> Nobles (by whom this Army is Officer'd) the Mutinies of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,<note place="margin">The Gazett for Monday <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb.</hi> 29. gives us this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement. <hi>Hamburgh, Dec.</hi> 22.

            <p>It may reasonably add to our Fear, that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34974:146"/>
we see the <hi>French</hi> King hath lately made so strict Alliances with <hi>Spain,</hi> and with <hi>Bavaria,</hi> by which he is farther secured from any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads from those Parts; and that we also find him so vigilant to prevent our Leaguing with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to come to some closer Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with them himself; in which his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters use the utmost Arts, mixt with a sort of Menaces; I cannot but resort again to the <hi>French Politicks,</hi> where in the close of those Methods by which the <hi>French</hi> King may obtain an easie and intire Conquest of <hi>England,</hi> we find it far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dictated thus,

                  <hi>our League with the</hi> Hollanders <hi>should be renewed, and they put into a belief,</hi> that <hi>we should give them all the Trade still,</hi> because they have the knowledge of it, and are proper for it; whereas (<hi>as 'tis to be sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested</hi>) the <hi>French</hi> have no Inclination that way, and Nature cannot be forced; they <hi>must be told</hi> that now they are come to <hi>the happy time</hi> for advancing their Affairs, and ruining their Competitors in the Sovereignty of the Northern Seas: we see these Politicks go through stitch in the business.</q>
And that upon the Whole they were very unfit to be Printed; no man who had so much Wit as to be the real Author, could have so little as to publish them; and the rather, because of Another Secret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest very improper to be divulged</p>

               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:34974:146"/>As for the Proofs against this Prisoner, they were as home and positive as against the rest.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> declares how he came acquainted with him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> p. 9.</note> by bringing him Letters from his Sons from a Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in <hi>Spain</hi>; and then Swears, That <hi>Langhorn</hi> did hold Correspondence with <hi>Le Chese</hi> and others, and that the Witness carried several Letters to persons beyond the Seas; in one of which he saw under his own hand, words to this purpose, <hi>That now they had a fair opportunity to begin, or give the blow</hi>; with other expressions plain enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Plot: and these he saw signed <hi>Richard Langhorn,</hi> and that the Prisoner himself delivered them to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he had order from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial to give Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> an Account of the Resolve of the Jesuits Consult for Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 10.</note> and that he did acquaint him therewith; and that the said <hi>Langhorn</hi> thereupon lift up his Hands and Eyes, and prayed to God to give it a good success.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he saw at his Chamber cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Commissions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 11.</note> which they call Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; and that on his desire he permitted the Witness to peruse several of them; and that there was one Commission to the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour,</hi> and another to the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> for the one to be Lord Chancellour, and the other Lord Treasurer of <hi>England</hi>; and one to Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> himself, to be Advocate of the Army; and that they were signed <hi>Johannes Paulus d'Oliva,</hi> by Vertue of a Brief from the Pope: and Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> also told him, that he had sent one of these
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34974:147"/>
Commissions by his Son, to be delivered to the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardours</hi> Son.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> being employed as Sollicitor for several of the Fathers of the Society,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 13.</note> did prevail with the Benedictine Monks to raise six thousand pounds for carrying on the Cause; and did say in the hearing of the witness, That he would do his utmost for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the said Money.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> was disgusted that Sir <hi>G. Wakeman</hi> was not content with ten thousand pound to poison the King, and call'd him <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-spirited, narrow-soul'd Physician</hi>: for being a publick concern, and to carry on the Cause, it was no matter if he did it for nothing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. An Instrument was produced in Court, signed by <hi>Paulus d'Oliva,</hi> found in Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Chamber, long after Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had given in his Testimony. Now Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> swore, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Commissions were signed by the same hand, and had the same mark; but they were all conveyed away, and this being onely concerning an Ecclesiastick business, wherein they thought there was no danger, was left. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this much confirmed Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence, by shewing that Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> did use to receive Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents from, and had Commerce with the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Jesuits at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place comes Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and he swears that he went with Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Chamber,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 19.</note> and there Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> gave him his Letters to <hi>le Chese,</hi> and the Popes Nuncio, and others, open, to read and Register in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34974:147"/>
a Book by him kept for that purpose, and that he saw him read these Letters, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these designs in hand; and that he Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred them in a Book in his Closet, whilst he and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> walkt in the outer room; and that afterwards <hi>Coleman</hi> sealed up these Letters, and delivered them to the Witness, who carried them to <hi>le Chese</hi>; and that some of the expressions in those Letters were, That all things were now in readiness, and they onely wanted Money: That the Catholicks were now in safety; that Places and Offices had been disposed to them, and that all the Garrisons either were, or suddenly would be in their hands; and that now they had a fair opportunity, having <hi>a King so easie to believe what was dictated to him by their Party,</hi> and that if they missed this advantage, they might despair of ever introducing Popery into <hi>England.</hi> These were the very Expressions of some of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he brought other Letters from <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> to <hi>Langhorn</hi> to be Registred, and <hi>Langhorn</hi> writ back, that he had received and would Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster them; of which Letters one was from the Rector of the <hi>Irish</hi> Colledge at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> which specified, That the Lord <hi>Bellasis</hi> and the rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, should be in readiness, for that they had sent some <hi>Irish</hi> cashier'd Souldiers, with many other Lay-Brothers, under the notion of Pilgrims for St. <hi>Jago,</hi> who were to take shipping at the <hi>Groin,</hi> and to land at <hi>Milford</hi>-Haven in <hi>Wales,</hi> and there to meet and join with the Lord <hi>Powis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The onely defence Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> could make, was like that of the rest of his Party, by stout
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34974:148"/>
denyals, and endeavouring to invalidate the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Witnesses, by intrapping or confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in point of time or place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He would make Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> an <hi>Approver,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> as having been pardoned for the same Crime; and alleadged, that the Witnesses had received <hi>Rewards</hi> and gratifications for Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring against them. But to this the Court answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That it could not be supposed the King would Bribe his Witnesses; and unless he could prove any reward to be given by Contract, or <hi>subornation,</hi> it was no Objection, for that allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of sustenance was usually given of old to Approvers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He mustered up again their <hi>baffled</hi> Evidence from St. <hi>Omers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 33.</note> of whom one being askt how he came to take notice of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being at St. <hi>Omers</hi> all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and not in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> as well, plainly answered, (being not well instructed, or more simple than the rest)—It was—<hi>Because the Question he came for did not fall upon that time:</hi> Which gives more light to the suspicion, that they came with their Lessons in their Mouths, to save these mens Lives, and their Churches sinking Credit; not to speak truth, but only right or wrong confront the Kings Evidence: but in vain, for Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> sufficiently asserted his Testimony by seven Witnesses, who now again proved, as they had done the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his being in <hi>London</hi> at the time contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> produced the Woman at the <hi>White-horse</hi> Tavern,<note place="margin">P. 46.</note> where Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had said the Consult was held; and she boldly averred, that there was never a Room in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34974:148"/>
her House would hold above a dozen people, and therefore there could not meet 50, or 18 or 20 persons at a time. This was an Objection Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> could not fore-see, not thinking any body would have had the confidence to alleadge it; and so was not provided with any Witnesses to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it: but as Providence ordered it no less than three several strangers stood up in Court, that knew the House well, and being sworn, Attested, The first, that he had known sixteen to dine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in one Room of that House; the second, that he knew two Rooms, one backwards and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forward, where Thirty might Dine at a time; and the third, that at a Wedding he knew of above Twenty that Dined together in one Room next the street. Nay farther, there was a Gentleman of good Quality in Court, who declared, there have been Fifty in a Room there; so that this Evidence, by such a peremptory falshood, did but add to the suspicion already too apparent on the rest of his Witnesses.</p>
            <p>The matter being thus plain, the Jury did not find any difficulty that might require a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Consultation, and therefore returning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a short retirement, into Court, pronounced the prisoner Guilty; and then <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and the other Four Convicted the day before, being brought to him to the Bar, Mr. Recorder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to pass Sentence of Death upon them all Six. But Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> either in consideration of the affairs of others in relation to his Practice, which it might be convenient to adjust; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hopes he might have been wrought upon

               </argument>
               <p>WE have before related how Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted that he was in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> when Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and one <hi>Sarah Pain,</hi> attest upon their Oaths that they saw him in <hi>London.</hi> And this he not onely alleadged at his Tryal, and brought Witnesses to prove it, but made <hi>solemn Asseverations at his death,</hi> That he never was in <hi>London</hi> from the 5th of <hi>August</hi> to the 14th of <hi>September.</hi> And knowing that such a failure in circumstance of time and place, if they could get it believ'd, would much depretiate the Evidence, they not content with what had pass'd, <hi>revive</hi> it again at <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Tryal, as you have heard, offering fresh people to confirm it: And though the contrary was sufficiently attested by three Witnesses on Oath, enough to convince an impartial Jury, or any body else that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the nature of a Papists Religion, and how far he may lawfully, nay is bound to <hi>stretch</hi> his private Conscience, when it may be for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Emolument of their Church; yet it pleased
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34974:151"/>
                  <hi>Providence,</hi> as well for the vindication and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illustration of <hi>Truth,</hi> as to shame these false dissemblers, and expose their fallacious dealings, soon after to make a further <hi>discovery,</hi> and detect their Lyes in this behalf, by one that had been no small Zealot of their Party.</p>
               <p>For presently after that Tryal, <hi>Charles Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> upon some discourse concerning the same, was accidentally inform'd, That one Mr. <hi>Robert Jennison</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inne,</hi> a person of good Quality, and formerly a strict <hi>Romanist,</hi> had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, That he was with the said <hi>Ireland</hi> about the middle of <hi>August</hi> in <hi>Russel-street</hi> in <hi>Covent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden:</hi> whereupon Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> resolv'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire further after it, being thereunto encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> to whom he had communicated what he had heard. Then <hi>tracing</hi> the business, he went to <hi>Robert Bowes</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> who own'd, that Mr. <hi>Jennison</hi> had signified so much to him formerly in a Letter from <hi>Reading,</hi> dated the 19th of <hi>December.</hi> Hereupon several of these Gentlemen repaired to Mr. <hi>Jennison,</hi> who after some unwilling Evasions, ingenuously owned the same, and testified it upon Oath before <hi>Edmund Warcup</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of his Majesties Justices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Middlesex, viz.</hi> That coming up from <hi>Windsor</hi> on the 19th of <hi>August,</hi> he went to visit the said <hi>William Ireland</hi> (with whom for some time he had been well acquainted, as being <hi>Related</hi> unto him) and found him at his Lodging in <hi>Russel-street,</hi> who told him he was then newly arrived by Post from <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire</hi>; and in discourse enquired how his Majesty and the Court were diverted: To which
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:34974:151"/>
Mr. <hi>Jennison</hi> replied, That he heard his Majesty took much <hi>delight in Hawking and Fishing,</hi> but chiefly in the latter; which his Majesty follow'd early in the mornings, accompanied onely with two or three Lords: Whereupon <hi>Ireland</hi> replied, <hi>He wondred his Majesty should be so thin guarded, he were easily taken off or removed</hi>; or words to that effect. At which Mr. <hi>Jennison</hi> saying <hi>God forbid, Ireland</hi> began to qualifie it, saying, <hi>I do not say it is lawful</hi>; and some such Expressions, which made him take little notice of it at that time; but afterwards hearing of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and that the King was to have been <hi>kill'd</hi> at <hi>Windsor,</hi> he began to reflect upon these former words more seriously, and related them to his Father and one Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> his Fathers Confessor, being then at <hi>Wallworth</hi> his Fathers Mansion-house in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of <hi>Durham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This and some other Depositions confirming the same, with the true Copy of the said Letter, have since been published in print, and Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison</hi> publickly attested the same at <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s Tryal; the horror and detestation of this hellish Plot carried on by the Romanists, having induced him to quit their Communion.</p>
               <p>Three days after the Execution of <hi>Whitebread</hi> and the other four Jesuits, <hi>viz.</hi> 23 <hi>June,</hi> was Apprehended by <hi>Captain Rich,</hi> one of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Justices of Peace for <hi>Surry,</hi> one <hi>Caryl, alias Blunden,</hi> supposed to be a Popish Priest, at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-Marsh,</hi> at the House of one Mr. <hi>Woodinbrook,</hi> formerly an Haberdasher of Small Wares in the Burrough of <hi>Southwark</hi>; in whose Chamber was found the <hi>following Letter,</hi> prepared to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

                     <p>ON the Thirteenth of <hi>June,</hi> being Friday, Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Fenwick</hi> and <hi>Gaven</hi> of the Society, and Mr. <hi>Corker,</hi> were brought to the Bar in the <hi>Old-Bailey:</hi> Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> moved the Court for a longer time, being onely warned the night before, whereas the other Prisoners had eight days warning to prepare themselves; whereupon he was re-manded to prison till the next day: Then was the Indictment read against the Five above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Jesuits, for conspiring the Kings Death, Subversion of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> swore, that on the Twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> there was a Consult held in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:34974:152"/>
where the Kings Death was Conspired; and that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this Resolve from one to the other, for their subscribing; and swore particular Circumstances against each. To Corroborate this Testimony, other Witnesses, <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe, Prance, Dugdale,</hi> and <hi>Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine,</hi> came in with <note n="(1)" place="margin">
                           <hi>A pretty way of expressing plain positive Evidence of several Overt Acts of Treason.</hi>
                        </note> Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the matter sworn by <hi>Oates.</hi> Then did the Prisoners (after a most solemn and <note n="(2)" place="margin">

To prove this, about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Witnesses were produced, who did shew evidently, by several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable passages, how <hi>Oates</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers</hi> all the whole time. But the Judge <hi>Scroggs</hi> asked each Witness as he did appear, of what Religion he was of; and upon answer that he was a Catholick, the whole Court gave a shout of laughter. Then the Judge would say to them, <note n="(3)" place="margin">
                           <hi>All absolutely false, though it might have been the most proper way of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining such bold young Villains; for 'twas apparent they did not speak their knowledge, but their Masters dictates.</hi>
                        </note> Well, what have you
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:34974:153"/>
then been taught to say? and by many scoffing Questions (which moved the Court to frequent laughter) he did endeavour to take off the Credibility of their Witnesses. Then the Butler, Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and Gardiner of St. <hi>Omers</hi> offered to swear that they saw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> all that time at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> when he swore he was in <hi>London.</hi> After this, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners at the Bar produced Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Witnesses more, that proved <hi>Oates</hi>

                        <note n="(5)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Not the least pretence for this old baffled Scandal.</hi>
                        </note> perjured: then he did lay open the improbabilities of such a Plot, and how unlikely that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> should be entrusted in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering Commissions to Persons of Honour and Estates, whom he never (as he acknowledges) had seen before or since. This was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Mr. Gaven,</hi> 
                        <note n="(6)" place="margin">
                           <hi>O brave Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! sure this Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of such brave service done the Church, will hasten</hi> Gavens <hi>Canonizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at least one score or two of years.</hi>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:34974:153"/>
and in a voice very audible, and largely and pertinently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest. The Judge was incensed at this Speech, in which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten interrupted him: but <hi>Gaven</hi> still urged, My Lord, <hi>I plead now for my Life, and for that which is dearer to me than life,</hi> 
                        <note n="(7)" place="margin">

                        <hi>the honour of my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and therefore I beseech you have a little patience with me! After this Plea of Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi>'s, the Judge made his Harangue to the Jury, telling them, that what the Prisoners had brought, was onely the bare assertions of Boys, who were taught it as a point of their Religion, to lye for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Religion; whereas Mr. <hi>Oates, Bedloe,</hi> and others, were upon their Oaths; and if Oaths were not to be taken, no Courts could subsist.</p>
                     <p>Then Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> brought forth four <note n="(8)" place="margin">
                           <hi>These four were no less than seven.</hi>

the Cryers could not still them: Never was Bear-baiting more rude and boisterous than this Tryal. Vpon this the Judge dismiss'd the Jury, to consider and bring in their Verdict; who (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter half an hours absence) brought in the Five Prisoners at the Bar all guilty of High-Treason. Thereupon the whole Court clapt <note n="(11)" place="margin">

It being now eight at night, the Court adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned till next day at seven of the clock, which was Saturday: I was present from five in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till the Court broke up.

Then was <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne</hi> first tryed, whose Tryal held so long, that they had not time to try the other four; and the Commission by which they sat expiring that day, the Judge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed the Tryal of the other four till the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and then the Judge commanded the Keeper to bring the five Jesuits; whom with <hi>Langhorne</hi>

Mr. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> and Mr. <hi>March</hi> are close Prisoners, and have been so this eight months, with whom I have been; God has fitted, and is still fitting them as Sacrifices for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: They are very well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and resigned to Gods holy will.

                     <p>On Thursday, the day before the five Jesuits were executed,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:34974:155"/>
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was with <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Gaven,</hi> promising them the Kings Pardon, if they would acknowledge the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> answered, He would not murther his Soul, to save his Body; for he must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what he knew not, and what he did believe was not. On Friday the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> on one Sled with Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> upon another Sled, and Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> in a Sled by himself, were drawn from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tyburn.</hi> Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> is for a time reprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and promised Pardon, if he will (as 'tis reported) discover the Estates of the Jesuits: he was their Lawyer.

ful to all, especially Laborious men, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for Victualling of Ships.Both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> are <hi>great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises</hi> on most, or all, <hi>ordinary</hi> Meats and Drinks, in <hi>England</hi> on part of our <hi>Drink</hi> only, <hi>viz.</hi> That in Alehouses, and Publick Brewings, (I hope there never will be any such as shall bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Trade.)</p>
               <p>Our great <hi>Wasts, and void Lands,</hi> which are our present Grief and Scandal, may on the Regulation of our Trade, prove highly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to us, since they will afford present room for a vast Increase of People, whether Forreign Planters, or others; in the <hi>Vnited Provinces,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> none such are to be found.</p>
               <p>And lastly, <hi>England</hi> is far better <hi>situated for the Fishing Trade,</hi> and other Forreign Trade than either <hi>France,</hi> or the <hi>Vnited Provinces,</hi> and its People are naturally far more <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous</hi> and <hi>Valiant</hi> than theirs, as Experience hath shewn, which makes no small odds upon National Contests, between Nations emulous in Trade, when they fight upon equal Terms of Treasure, and Warlike Preparations: and there is no question but our <hi>National Industry</hi> in Trade, would be also more Vigorous and Successful, were it put into suitable Methods; but otherwise can no more Exert it self than a generous Courser in a Horse-Mill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:34974:156"/>From all which it must be evident, that were our Trade eased as in Neighbour Nations, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would have the Superiority, since the same Causes must produce greater Effects in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being invigorated with these our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Advantages, which no other Nation doth or can enjoy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>present Power</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> King would infallibly much <hi>Contribute</hi> to it, which being arrived to such a swelling and tremendous height, does not only intimidate all men of Trade and Wealth in <hi>France,</hi> especially Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants; but all the adjacent Provinces and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the Continent, who either already groan under the insupportable Oppressions and Insolencies of the <hi>French,</hi> or are under deep and Continual Apprehensions of being wasted by his numerous Troops, grown Proud and Wanton with Success, and ready to make irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable descents upon any <hi>private Order</hi>; in which these his Neighbours can never think themselves secure, because of his late suddain Invasion of <hi>Flanders:</hi> and would therefore flye to our <hi>English</hi> World, as a blessed and safe <hi>Asylum, were it put into a posture of being so.</hi> Then if the suddain Populacy, Treasures, Trade, and strength of the small <hi>Dutch Provinces,</hi> were the Effects of the then <hi>Spanish</hi> Tyranny in the Low-Countreys, what might we not hope for from far greater Confluences of the richest and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:34974:156"/>
most Mercantile and Industrious Protestants, or such as would be so, even from <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as well as from many other parts of <hi>Europe</hi>? whose Stocks being transported by Bills of Exchange, and their Manufactures with their Persons, and this on a suddain, would give the odds of Srength and Treasure to the <hi>English,</hi> who no longer need to trust to the fallible Security of <hi>Leagues,</hi> which are so often obstructed and broken by the humour or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidie of particular men, or frustrated by inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and accidents: And therefore this patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and piecing a Strength together by <hi>Leagues,</hi> is the dependance of small and weak Estates, such as those of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>; where they are always tricking and betraying one another; yet at this time Leagues (though not to be wholly rested upon) <hi>may be</hi> of great, and good consequence to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy never over-awed the rest of <hi>Europe,</hi> as it now does, it must be evident, that if our Trade had been regulated and eased equally with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> all those Merchants and People which have setled in <hi>Holland,</hi> would have planted here, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the former advantages, the extent of our Territory, renders the Burthen of Taxes far easier on particular men than in <hi>Holland,</hi> where they are also at a much greater <hi>necessary</hi> charge for Garrisons on their Frontiers; nay the very
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:34974:157"/>
                  <hi>Dutch</hi> would have forsaken those Provinces for <hi>England,</hi> or if any had remained, they would have been Carriers for the <hi>English,</hi> as they have been to the <hi>French,</hi> and will rather be so for the future, if our Shop were sufficiently furnished, because they will more willingly transfer the wealth of the World to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where they themselves may securely share in it, when they please, than to an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> which may in a moment swallow it up, and oppress those that brought it to any the most barbarous degree; from all which, these things are most manifest: First, That nothing does or can so formidably threaten the Trade, and by Consequence the Monarchy of <hi>France,</hi> as the Modern Freedoms of the <hi>English,</hi> and some other Neighbouring Countreys. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the <hi>English</hi> Freedoms are at this day so great an advantage to his most Sacred Majesty of <hi>England,</hi> that they are a Weapon left in his hands, with which, and a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Regulation of our Trade, he may with ease and assurance attain a Superiority over all the Monarchs and Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he will cut the Grass under their Feet, and <hi>draw</hi> away their Treasures and People, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the Policies can be used; no <hi>mere Prohibition</hi> can stop those whose Interests, quiet, and safety, shall oblige them to depart: In which, besides a <hi>sufficient</hi> Guard at Sea, (to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34974:157"/>
use the words of the <hi>French</hi> Politicks) <hi>there would need almost no War to be made, nor His Majestie's Forces hazarded.</hi> Thirdly, That for these Reasons it is most evident, that it doth highly import the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, that the Freedoms of the <hi>English,</hi> and all others in these parts should be subverted and evacuated, of which, whether the <hi>French</hi> Councils, who have been so long and so curiously projecting the Grandure of that Monarchy, are insensible, I leave to be considered. Fourthly, 'Tis also as evident, that upon such a Regulation of our Trade His Majestie's Revenue being (by some <hi>Excise</hi> added to the <hi>then</hi> smaller Customs, and other his present Funds) made <hi>but equal</hi> to what now it is, would infallibly swell higher and higher yearly, as <hi>Trade, People, and Treasures</hi> shall increase; if <hi>these</hi> shall become <hi>double, treble,</hi> or <hi>six fold</hi> what they now are, so would his <hi>Revenue:</hi> then what extraordinary Supplies in Parliament might he not expect, upon a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Emergence; nay, or for his own proper occasions, when by an increase of People, the Burthen upon <hi>particular men</hi> will be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eased, and by the increase of Treasure, and the advance of private Revenues and Stocks, these People should be enabled to give <hi>largely,</hi> and <hi>often</hi>; and this without any prejudice to their home Trade, or Land-Rents, and therefore with such an Alacrity, as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:34974:158"/>
to that true Honour and Affection they really bear him.</p>
               <p>I need not observe how much it will be in His Majestie's Power to secure the making up of his present Revenue by new Funds, should he graciously think fit to compute by a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Customs; but since I have now, and before mentioned <hi>Excises,</hi> and have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved some men of Parts, almost to <hi>startle</hi> at the <hi>naming</hi> of a new <hi>Excise,</hi> I shall thus far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and vindicate my self, and the proposal: First, I shall agree that such <hi>Excises</hi> as affect and over-burthen the <hi>beneficial parts</hi> of Trade, are of pernicious Consequence. Secondly, that an Universality of <hi>Excise</hi> is both incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and unnecessary; But that there may be <hi>Excises</hi> Imposed on many Superfluities, and Excesses, in Meats, Drinks, or Equipages, or upon some imported Goods <hi>Consumed at home,</hi> which would be no prejudice to any kind of Trade; being no clog upon our Exports, or Re-exports; or perhaps, a very small <hi>Excise</hi> on ordinary Meats, Drinks, and Apparel, might be supportable: I do not propound all, but some of these, in this Course there will be this odds of advantage on the part of the King, That the <hi>Vsers, Wearers, and Consumers,</hi> being this way made chargeable, His Majesty would be less liable to be defrauded than in the Customs, which are perpetually smuggled, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34974:158"/>
then the Imported Goods openly Vended, and used; This, on the part of the People, That it will bring the like Obligations of charge on men of <hi>Visible and Invisible Stocks,</hi> in, or out of Trade, as on the Land-holders; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not see any shadow of reason why <hi>Excises</hi> should appear such Bugbears in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> especially to Land-holders, any more than in <hi>Holland,</hi>

from the Crown, which having also given <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions</hi> to some Towns, we may presume them first intended for the ease of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers, of which the Government had an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard: having said this, if the Reader will reflect on All that I have said, he cannot think I have any design in beggaring the <hi>English</hi> Subjects by an invention of new Taxes; 'twas Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Opinion, that the smaller and more numerous Payments of Custom, would rise far higher than before, which he Confirms with Fact; be they more or less, the National Wisdom is at Liberty to exert it self in further Levies, by Excise, Land-Tax, Poll, or otherwise as there shall be cause.</p>
               <p>Having now written what I intended on the present Subject, the Nature of it may sufficiently assure the Reader, that I have not designed any peculiar Ends of my own: On the contrary it hath been a trouble, which I wish an abler hand had undertaken, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Publick, may expect what usually ensues, when men engage upon the cutting of Common Rivers, wherein they must have Contests with every one, who hath a <hi>Lands End</hi> abutting upon the Work, who will set a greater value upon six foot of Earth, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Good the Countrey, and therein themselves, and all their Posterity, might reap by the Accomplishment of the Business: i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Nothing but a Consideration of our present Difficulties, and a hope to be Instrumental to the publick felicity could have moved me an Inch beyond these common Prudentials; to which I have yet conformed as far as I can; I have touched no man's Person, and I presume I need not say I have forborn Reflections, in which I do not think any one obliged to me, being but what I have judged requisite for a Composure of things; it hath been absolutely necessary that I should represent our ill <hi>Constitutions in Trade,</hi> and some of the <hi>most important Consequences,</hi> that from a general apprehension of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interest, there may ensue a National Union

in those Methods which may be most for the Publick Advantage, and this upon the <hi>mighty Basis</hi> of our present form of Government, and under our present most gracious Prince, whose Glories I hope to see expanded by an exuberant increase of National Treasures, People, and Royal Revenues, and to such a degree, as that the days of our Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> shall appear but a faint Type, or dawning of the greater Lustre and Happiness of His now Majestie's Reign: This is what I wish for, and have to my utmost endeavoured, and therein the real Advantage of all Ranks of Men in the Nation; If then these Excellent Ends appear obstructed by a sort of antient or Innovated Laws or Usages, who can speak of them, without much Resentment? In which, I hope, I am Excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. These are the <hi>Spells</hi> by which our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent People are inevitably lead into Courses destructive to the Publick.</p>
               <p>How can our Merchants or Shop-keepers now avoid Trading in Forreign Consumptive Goods? Have they any sufficient Stores of Home-Manufactures? Can our Merchants Trade from Port to Port as the <hi>Dutch</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do? or must Men that are bred up to these Gentile professions, that are Men of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, Industry,</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> fling up, live lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or poorly? Who doth not know how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generous and intelligent Men, are to be
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:34974:165"/>
found amongst our <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Shop-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of all sorts? Such as bear a true affection to their Country, and are an honour to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and such as wish for a Regulation of our Trade, and would be ready and capable to give all farther assistances, were they called to it? This I wish to see, being not so conceited, as to think I have said all that is material on this Subject; but on the contrary apprehend, That there are very few Paragraphs of what I have written, but may admit of farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations: In the mean time, from what hath been already said, it must be apparent to these and others, That as an open and free Trade would be far more profitable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of <hi>Merchants,</hi> so would it be far more honourable to all; That the Consequential Increase of People and Wealth, would better support our great Increase of <hi>Shop-keepers, Lawyers, Solicitors, Pen-men,</hi> &amp;c. (of which the present Numbers would then hardly be sufficient) That the benefits of our <hi>Clergy</hi> must receive an inevitable Improvment by it. And that our great and famous City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (which is the Seat Royal, where our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Courts of Justice are, which is contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our most secure Harbour for Ships, which hath the sweetest and most Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous situation of any City in <hi>Europe,</hi> and is so vastly peopled already) must by these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34974:166"/>
for ever, have the greatest resort and Trade of the Nation, (even under the utmost Improvments of our Trade) which must then be incomparably more than now: Besides, the vast advantage our <hi>Gentry</hi> would infallibly reap by the continual Rising of their Rents, even such of these as desire more business, or gain, will then have other and farther daily opportunities, by putting Stocks into Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, or Forreign Trade, and projecting and solliciting the Improvement of either, or both. In <hi>Florence,</hi> the very <hi>Nobility</hi> and great <hi>Duke</hi> himself are <hi>Traders</hi>; hence might our Members of Parliament be continually prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make the most suitable Laws for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating of Trade.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Nothing can so effectually and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly secure the peace of the Nation, as the Regulating of our Trade, since it will set all Mens heads and hands at work in all manner of Innocent and Profitable Imployments, and introduce a general satisfaction and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Then, and never 'till then, shall we make up that invincible <hi>Phalanax,</hi> which must not only be terrible to all Forreign Nations, but to all Enemies of the Government at Home, when they find it supported by the solid Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Trade and Treasure, and a Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial swelling Populacy and Navigation; which
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:34974:166"/>
will deter Men of sence from Treasonable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations, and of Fools there needs no fear: Whereas the defect of these Supports must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually administer temptation to all such as by reason of their particular circumstances, can hope for any greater advantage or security, by the general ruin. The Body Politick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this like the Natural, more subject to new Distempers when it is infirm before, but when stanch in every part easily bears off the Corruption or Acidity of any malevolent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Trade of the World</hi> hath long <hi>courted England,</hi> but never with <hi>so much importunity,</hi> or with so much <hi>advantage</hi> as now: This <hi>great Lady</hi> affecting Freedom and Security, hath no Inclination to continue under the <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> nor the <hi>Vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fate</hi> of the <hi>Dutch</hi>; with <hi>these</hi> she hath resided only as a <hi>Sojourner,</hi> but is ready to <hi>espouse</hi> our Interest and Nation, and with her self to bestow upon us the Treasures of the World; but if we still continue inexorable and stubborn, things are grown to such a Crisis, That we may have reason to fear this is the last time of her asking, and that she may suddenly turn this Kindness into such a Fury as we shall not be able to withstand.</p>
               <p>Shall we then embrace so advantagious Overtures, or, shall we still proceed in our
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:34974:167"/>
present Methods? I have heard it was a hard matter to reclaim the <hi>Irish</hi> from drawing with their <hi>Horses Tails</hi>; shall the <hi>Irish</hi> now beat us out of our Trade? Shall we continue rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Forreign Silks and Linnens? or be still sotting in Forreign Wines, whilest they pick our pockets? Shall we be Curious in Trifles, sneaking after our private interests? or like the blind <hi>Sodomites</hi> groping after our filthy Pleasures, whilest the Wrathful Angels of God stand at our elbows? Shall we like the Reprobated <hi>Jews</hi> be under continual Demica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within,<note place="margin">See <hi>Josephus</hi> of the Siege and Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                  </note> whilest our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are at the Gates? Shall those of the <hi>High City,</hi> those of the <hi>Low City,</hi> and those in the <hi>Temple</hi> be picking out one anothers Eyes to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the Aggressions of more powerful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners? or shall we be hunting or grasping after false Shadows, and Imaginary Forms and Ideas, and neglect that most valuable substance which we have already in our Mouths, and which would turn into the most solid Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would we take the pains to chew it?</p>
               <p>Which leads me to say, There is yet a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Requisite to our happy procedure in the Whole, of greater importance than any other; <hi>viz.</hi> a general Humiliation of our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God,</hi> accompanied with an abhorrence of our past Intemperances, Corrupt Passions,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:34974:167"/>
Pride, Avarice, Lusts, Prophaneness, mutual Oppressions, Perfidies, and other Impieties, with such a Christian Meekness, Charity, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Truth, Holy Zeal and Resolution as may render us Capable of his Mercy and Protection; perhaps one <hi>false step</hi> at this time, may be more Irreparable than ever; 'tis certain we shall never be able to make a <hi>true one</hi> whilest we are under the displeasure of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>It is as undeniable, that the Laws which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct our Trade, cannot be <hi>Repealed,</hi> or <hi>new ones</hi> requisite for its <hi>Improvement</hi> or <hi>Security</hi> be <hi>made,</hi> otherwise than by <hi>a Parliament</hi>: Whether therefore, upon this and other impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Considerations, the <hi>Convening</hi> and <hi>Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of a Parliament be not, under <hi>God, (who does not work by Miracle</hi>) a necessary means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Ruine of this Nation, and how Long it may <hi>now</hi> with <hi>any</hi> security be deferred, is that, which I most humbly submit to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Authority.</p>
