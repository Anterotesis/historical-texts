            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That ſeeing the Decree of God is ſubordinate vnto meanes; or rather doth ſubordinate meanes vnto it: So wee are not to preſume or builde thereon, without vſing the ordinary meanes <note place="margin">I.

               <p>And therefore ſeeing the Lorde hath decreed and ordained ſome to ſaluation, others to perdition: Euen ſo hath he ordered his workes in a different varietie, for the more holy, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Reaſons, 1.

               <p>1. And do not they then iuſtly exclude themſelues from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that builde vpon Gods Decree, concerning their ſaluation, without conſcience of holines: preſuming that Gods decree ſhal ſtand, howſoeuer they daylie growe worſe and worſe? ſhall not <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>2. And doe not they alſo iuſtly exclude themſelues of the comforts of the earth, that ſay; A Lyon is in the way, the meanes are difficult, or God will prouide: What neede wee vſe any? Is it not a Decree, that as, Hee that ſoweth ſhall haue plentie; So he <note place="margin">Pro. 11. 2. Theſſ 3. 12</note> that laboureth not, ſhall not eate?

               <p>3. Haue we any further warrant of the protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, then, that we walke in our wayes? <hi>Pſal:</hi> 91.

               <p>4. And whereas there is difference of meanes, and therefore to be vſed in their order, the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> firſt, <hi>Matth:</hi> 6. 33. and then thoſe for this life; Do not they renounce Heauen, that make ſure

               <p>Secondly, howſoeuer the curſed poſteritie of <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> are ſaide to builde Citties, and dwell in them, thereby expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their affection to this life, &amp; deſire of conſtant enioying the happines thereof, moſt deceitfull and tranſitorie: yet the Saints of God are commended vnto vs, to remaine <hi>in Tents,</hi> which being <note place="margin">Hebr: 11.</note> Habitations not onely weake, and ſleight in compariſon, but moueable alſo vpon euery ſudden occaſion, and eſpecially vſed in military affayres: Doth therein ſhadowe out vnto vs three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conditions of the Church of God in this life.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Shem was the eldest Sonne; not onely by Nature, but by Grace;</hi> Hee firſt in his Fathers houſe, called on the Name of God; The <hi>Iewes</hi> of him, were alſo the firſt-borne; Firſt, in the temporall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, firſt, in the ſet worſhip of God, and ſo alſo, in the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all election. And therefore ſeeing the truth is moſt Ancient, the olde way is the true way: Therefore the religion of the <hi>Iewes</hi> is the true worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That which was commanded of God, and performed, both for the ſubstance and manner, is the true Religion;</hi> Such was the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Iew;</hi> wholly commaunded of God, both for matter and manner; enformed from Gods owne mouth. <hi>Exod:</hi> 20.

Shall not all nations take hold of the skirt of a <hi>Iewe</hi> and ſay, we will goe with you, becauſe the Lord is with you? <hi>Zach:</hi> 8.

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly. <hi>And ſhall not the Truth abide for euer?</hi> Shall not the remnant of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be ſaued? Shall not the <hi>Iewes</hi> (though for a time <note place="margin">Ierem: 31. Ezech: 11.</note> caſt off) yet bee brought in againe? And ſo the promiſe of God certaine, Gods couenant with the <hi>Iewe</hi> euerlaſting. And ſo the originall truth, the euerlaſting truth. The <hi>Iewes</hi> religion, as moſt ancient, ſo moſt permanent, and perpetuall.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, Was not the <hi>Iewe</hi> an abomination to the <hi>Aegip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian?</hi>
