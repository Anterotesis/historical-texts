         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Several Bills being found by the Grand Jury, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38597:3"/>
Amongſt many others, two Indictments were exhibited againſt one William Burnet, by birth (as is ſaid a Scotchman but educated at St. Omers, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or ſome other forraign Seminary) by the firſt he was charged to be a Romiſh Prieſt, having received orders beyond the Seas, and that contrary to the ſtatute (in that caſe made and provided) he had preſumed to come into England, and ſo incurred the Penalties of High Treaſon. By the ſecond, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for perverting and ſeducing ſeveral of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties good Subjects, and reconciling them to the Church and See of Rome.</p>
            <p>The proſecution being grounded upon ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, as thoſe of the 23. Eliz Cap. 1. 3. Jac. Cap. 4. &amp;c. whereby it is enacted. <q>That to abſolve, perſuade, or withdraw any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from their obedience to the King, or to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them to the Pope; or to draw them to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion, or move them to promiſe obedience to any other ſtate, or procure, Counſel, or aid them that do it, ſhall be connted and puniſhed as High Treaſon. </q> Vide. Lamb. 220. 226. 412. and Dalt. 232.</p>
            <p>Upon the firſt of theſe Indictments no ſufficient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence being produced, the Jury could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon bring him in Guilty; as to the ſecond there was full proof that he had often endeavoured to reconcile divers of his Majeſties Proteſtant ſubjects to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh

Church, and had actually perverted ſeveral to embrace the Roman Catholique Religion, and aſſert and maintain the Popes ſupremacy in matters Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To all which he had very little to object, only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, that if it were a Crime ſo Capital in him to perſuade People to the Roman Catholique Religion, (which he was verily perſuaded was the onely true one) then it muſt be the ſame offence in Quakers and other different perſuaſions, ſince they as well as he made it their endeavour to draw people from the Church of England to their particular party. But to this was eaſily anſwered, that the very Words of the Law had expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſed the Roman Catholique religion or Popery, but no ſuch thing of any orher Faction, and that Recriminations were no excuſe, much leſs Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Whereupon after a full hearing, Debating, and weighing of the matter, the Jury brought him in guilty of High Treaſon upon the laſt Indictment, and accordingly on Saturday he received ſentence, To be Hang'd, Drawn, and Quartered; which he received with a modeſt Generoſity, ſaying theſe words, <hi>Gloria in Excelſis deo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The next Criminal we ought to mention for the likeneſs of their offence in its nature and puniſhment, though of Different ſex and manner, was Miſtris Ann Petty, Widdow, a perſon of above ſixty years of age; ſhe lived lately near Holbourn Conduit, but formerly in the Green-yard in Leaden-Hall, her Husband ſome Years ſince, in a very melancholly Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

humour upon I know not what provocations went and hang'd himſelf, ſince whoſe deceaſe this woman hath followed ſeveral indirect courſes, but more eſpecially for Clipping of money, for which purpoſe ſhe held a Correſpoddence with ſome wild Apprentices, Servants, or Caſheirs to eminent Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who it is ſaid) brought her ſumms of large law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful money which ſhe clipt and returned, allowing them five pound in the Hundred more or leſs, and yet got conſiderably her ſelf for her own pains, as ſhe then apprehended, though now ſhe is like to pay dear enough for it: for ſhe was here indicted, and Evidence came in that ſaw her at the Clipping trade, and others that had bought divers quantities of ſilver melted down of her, beſides the violent ſuſpition for that ſome of her tools were taken in the houſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Fileings and Clippings to a good conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able value; upon which ſhe was brought in guilty of high Treaſon, and ſentenced to be Drawn on an Hurdle or Sled to <hi>Smithfield</hi> (the uſual place for ſuch Executions) and there to be burned to Death: A Youth her Son was alſo Indicted, but not being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be any way concerned in his Mothers ill pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was acquitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Lancet, Elijah Arnold, and Bartholomew Jennings</hi> were arraigned for Fellony and Burglary; For that they on the Lords Day had broken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

that ſhe was not able to utter a word: they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way there in Plate and Money to the value of two hundred pounds or thereabouts; but diligent inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being given out and Enquiries made upon the ſale or diſpoſal of ſome of the things they were ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and now Indicted, Convicted, and Condemned, (being old Malefactors) to be Hang'd for the ſame.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph Foſter</hi> was convicted for Burglary and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, though he did not ſteal above the value of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings, yet being a notorioos offender that had often commenc'd in Newgate Univerſity, and but a Seſſions or two ago got off by pleading a pardon, he now received ſentence of Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Clark</hi> was likewiſe condemned for Burglary or Houſe-breaking; three more were concerned with him, but he only was as yet taken, though 'tis not doubted but we ſhall very ſhortly have an account of the reſt.</p>
