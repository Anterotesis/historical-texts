         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

diſtracted Kingdoms, have beene and

malicious miſinformations againſt his ſacred Majeſty, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in point of Religion and morall-Wiſdome; whereof,
I confes with great griefe of heart, my ſelfe to have been (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many moe of my coate) none of the leaſt; who out
of Imaginary feares and Jealouſies, were made reall Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to advance this un-naturall Warre, wherein ſo much
Innocent Proteſtant blood hath beene ſhed, and ſo much
downright Robbery committed, without f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as cannot but draw downe heavy Judgements from Heaven
npon theſe infatuated Nations, and more particularly upon
us who ſhould have inſtructed them in the way of Truth,
Peace, and Obedience.</p>
            <p>I conceived it the duty of a good Chriſtian, eſpecially
one of my profeſſion, and in the condition that I lie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
God Almighty 's-call, not only to acknowledge to
the All-mercifull God, with a humble ſincere remorſe of
Conſcience, the greatneſſe of this offence; which being
done in ſimplicity of Spirit, I hope with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
to obteine Mercy, becauſe I did it through Ignorance: But
alſo, for the better ſatisfaction of all others, to publiſh this
<hi>Declaration</hi> to the view of the World; to the intent, that

all thoſe (eſpecially of the Miniſtery) who have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
with mee, may by God's Grace, and my example
(though a weake and meane Inſtrument) not only bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived
themſelves, but alſo ſtirred up to undeceive others,
with more alacritie and facilitie; that the ſcandall may bee
removed from our Religion and Profeſſion, and the good
King reſtored to his juſt Rights, and truly honoured and
obeyed as God's-Annoynted and Vice-gerent upon
earth; and the poore diſtreſſed Subjects freed from thoſe
intollerable Burdens and Oppreſſions which they lye groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
under, piercing Heaven with their teares and cries;
and a ſolid Peace ſetled both in Kirke and Commonwealth,
throughout all his Majeſties Dominions, to the glory of
<hi>God,</hi> and of our bleſſed Mediator and Saviour the <hi>Lord
Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doe therefore <hi>Declare</hi> before <hi>God</hi> and the World, that
ſince I had the honour and happineſſe to converſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
with his Majeſty, with all ſort of freedome; eſpecially
in matters of Religion, whither in relation to the Kirke or
State (which like <hi>Hypocrates</hi> Twins are lynked together)
that I found him the moſt intelligent man that ever I ſpoke
with; as fair beyond my expreſſion, as expectation,
grounded upon the Information that was given mee (before
I knew him) by ſuch as I thought ſhould have known him.
I profeſſe that I was oft-times aſtoniſh'd with the ſolidity
and quickneſſe of his Reaſons and Replies; wondred how
hee, ſpending his time ſo much in ſports and recreations,
could have attained to ſo great knowledge, and muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
ingenuouſly, that I was convinced in Conſcience, and
knew not how to give him any reaſonable ſatisfaction; yet
the ſweetneſſe of his diſpoſition is ſuch, that whatſoever I
ſaid was well taken; I muſt ſay that I never met with any
Diſputant (let be a King, and in matters of ſo high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment)
of that milde and calme temper, which convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
mee the more, and made mee thinke that ſuch Wiſdom
and Moderation could not bee without an extraordinary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116393:4"/>
meaſure of divine grace. I had heard much of his carriage
towards the Prieſts in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and that King <hi>James</hi> told the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> upon his going thither, that he durſt
venture his Sonne <hi>Charles</hi> with all the Jeſuites in the
World, hee knew him to bee ſo well grounded in the
Proteſtant Religion, but could never beleeve it before.</p>
            <p>I obſerved all his actions, more particularly thoſe of
devotion, which I muſt truly ſay, are more then ordinary;
I informed my ſelfe of others who had ſerved him from
his Infancy, and they all aſſured me that there was nothing
new or much inlarged in regard of his troubles, either in his
private, or publique way of exerciſe; twice a day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
morning and evening for an houres ſpace in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
twice a day before dinner and ſupper in publique,
beſides preachings upon Sundayes, Tueſdayes, and other
extraordinary times; and no buſineſſe though never ſo
weighty and urgent can make him forget, or neglect this
his tribute and duty to Almighty God. O that thoſe who
ſit now at the helm of theſe weather beaten Kingdomes
had but one halfe of his true piety and wiſdome! I dare
ſay that the poore oppreſſed Subject ſhould not bee plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into ſo deepe Gulfes of impiety, and miſerie without
compaſſion or pittie; I dare ſay, if his advice h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d beene
followed, all the bloud that is ſhed, and all the repain that
is committed, ſhould have beene prevented.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould ſpeake of his Juſtice, magnanimity, charity,
ſobriety, chaſtity, patience, humility, and of all his both
Chriſtian and Morall vertues, I ſhould runne my ſelfe into
a panegyricke, and ſeeme to flatter him to ſuch as doe not
know him, if the preſent condition that I lye in did not
exeem me from any ſuch ſuſpition of worldly ends, when
I expect every houre to bee called from all tranſitory va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to eternall felicitie; and the diſcharging of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
before God and men, did not oblige me to declare
the truth ſimply and nakedly, in ſatisfaction of that which
I have done ignorantly, though not altogether innocently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:116393:5"/>
If I ſhould relate what I have received from good hands,
and partly can witneſſe of my owne knowledge ſince
theſe unhappy troubles began, I ſhould inlarge my ſelfe
into a Hiſtory: Let theſe briefe Characters ſuffice. No
man can ſay that there is conſpicuouſly any predominant
vice in him, a rare thing in a man, but farre rarer in a
King; Never man ſaw him paſſionately angrie, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
moved, either with proſperity, or adverſity,
having had as great tryalls as ever any King had; Never
man heard him curſe, or given to ſwearing; Never man
heard him complaine, or bemoane his condiction, in the
greateſt durance of Warre and confynement; When hee
was ſeparated from his deareſt conſort, and deprived of
the comfort of his Innocent Children, the hopefulleſt
Princes that ever were in theſe ingrate Kingdomes: when
hee was denuded of his Councellors and domeſtique Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
No man can complaine of the violation of his Wife
or Daughters, though hee hath had too many temptations
in the prime of his age, by the inforced abſence of his Wife
which would bee hardly taken by the meaneſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
and (which is beyond all admiration) being ſtript
of all councell and helpe of man, and uſed ſo harſhly as
would have ſtupified any other man, then did his undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
courage, and tranſcendent wiſdome ſhew it ſelfe more
clearly, and vindicate him from the obloquy of former
times, to the aſtoniſhment of his greateſt enemies: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
this did ſo take me that I could not but ſee the hand
of God in it, and which will render His name glorious,
and (I greatly feare) ours ignominious to all poſterity,
hee ſtands faſt to his grounds, and doth not riſe and fall
with ſucceſſe, the brittle ſquare of humane actions, and is
ever ready to forgive all by paſt injuries to ſettle a preſent
ſolid Peace, and future tranquility, for the good of his
Subjects; nay, for their cauſe hee is content to forgoe ſo
many of his own known, <hi>undoubted juſt rights; as may
stand with their ſafety, as</hi> 
               <q>Salus populi est Spurema Lex,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116393:5"/>
ſo, &amp; ſi parendum est patri in eo tamen non parendum quo
efficitur ut non ſit Pater. <bibl>[Seneca.]</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſſe that I could have wiſhed an eſtabliſhment of
our Presbyteriall Government, in the Kirke of <hi>England,</hi> for
the better <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> betweene them and us, but I finde the
conſtitution of that Kingdome, and diſpoſition of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo generally oppoſite, that it is not to bee expected:
They are a People naturally inclined to freedome, and ſo
bred in Riches and Plenty, that they can hardly bee induced
to embrace any Diſcipline that may any waies abridge their
Liberty and Pleaſures. That which wee eſteeme a Godly
Kirk policy, inſtituted by the <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> and his Apoſtles,
is no better to them then a kinde of ſlavery, and ſome doe
not ſtick to call it worſe then the Spaniſh Inquiſition: Nay,
even the greateſt part of thoſe who invited us to aſſiſt them
in it, and ſent hither their Commiſſioners to induce us to
enter into a ſolemn nationall covenant for that effect, having
ſerved their turne of us, to throw downe the King and the
Prelaticall partie, and to poſſeſſe themſelves with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Government both of Kirke and State; are now In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
evaſions to bee rid of us, and to delude it, ſome of
them publiſhing openly, in Pulpits and Print: That the
ſacred Covenant was never intended for the godly, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a trap to enſnare the Malignants, which cannot but
bring heavy Judgements from Heaven, and, I am afraid,
make a greater diſ-union betweene theſe Nations, then ever

            <p>I profeſſe, when I ſaw theſe things ſo cleerly, I could
not blame the King to bee ſo backward in giving his aſſent
to the ſetling of our Presbyteriall diſcipline in that Kirke,
for the great inconveniences that might follow thereupon,
to Him and his Poſteritie, there being ſo many ſtrong Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
in that Kingdome to leade on a popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch a number of people that have eyther no, or

            <p>Let mee therefore exhort and conjure you, in the words
of a dying man, and bowels of our <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> to ſtand
faſt to your Covenant, and not to ſuffer your ſelves to bee
abuſed with fain'd pretences, and made wicked inſtruments
to wrong the Kirke and the King, of their juſt Rights and

            <p>Remember the laſt Propheticall words of our firſt bleſſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116393:6"/>
Reformer, that after the ſubduing of the Papiſts, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
us the great battell remain'd againſt manifold Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the devill, the World and the Fleſh, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
againſt the ſacrilegious devourers of the Kirke rents,
which will not bee wanting now with baites cunningly lay'd
upon golden hookes to enſnare the greateſt amongſt you
both in Kirke and State, but I beſeech you in the words
of our bleſſed Saviour to be wiſe as Serpents and milde
as Doves, let no worldly conſideration induce you to
ſlide backe from the true meaning of our holy covenant
with the all-ſeeing God; who puniſhed <hi>Saul</hi> in his Sonnes
for the breach even of an unlawfull Covenant with the
Gibeonites. <bibl>[2. Sam. 21.]</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Remember the ſupplication of the Generall Aſſembly

Act. 5. ſeſſ. 7 Junij 1640]</bibl> that branded us maliciouſly
with an intention to ſhake off civill and dutifull obedience
due to Soveraignty, <bibl>[verbatim ex Registro]</bibl> and to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Kings greatneſſe and authority, and for clearing
of our loyalty; Wee in our names and in the name of all
the reſt of the Subjects and congregations whom wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,
did in all humility repreſent to his grace and the
Lords, of his Majeſties moſt honourable privie Councell,
and declared before God and the World that wee never
had, nor have any thought of withdrawing our ſelves from
that humble and dutifull obedience to his Majeſtie and his
government which by the deſcent, and under the Raigne
of 107 Kings is moſt cheerfully acknowledged by us and
our predeceſſors, and we never had, nor have any intention
or deſire to attempt any thing that may tend to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, or diminution of the Kings greatneſſe and
authority, but on the contrary acknowledging with all
humble thankfullneſſe the many recent favours beſtowed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116393:7"/>
upon us by his Majeſty, and that our quietneſſe, ſtability
and happineſſe, depends upon the ſafety of the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Perſon, and maintenance of his greatneſſe and
Royall authority who is Gods Vicegerent ſet over vs for
the maintenance of Religion and adminiſtration of Juſtice,
wee did ſolemnly ſweare, not only our mutuall concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and aſſiſtance for the cauſe of Religion, and to the
uttermoſt of our power with our meanes and lives to
ſtand to the defence of our dread Soveraigne, his perſon and
authority, in the preſervation and defence of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Lawes, and Liberties of this Kirke and Kingdom;
but alſo in every cauſe, which may concerne his Majeſties
honour, to concurre with our friends and followers in quiet
manner or in armes, as wee ſhould bee required of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
his Councell, or any having his authority, according to
the Lawes of this Kingdome, and the duty of good Subjects.</p>
            <p>And though ſome malignant Spirits wreſt maliciouſly
Some words of our Covenant, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. contrary to the true
meaning thereof, as if wee intended thereby to reſtrayne
our allegiance contrary to the Apoſtles precept and nature
of our duty, and make Religion a back-dore for Rebellion
to enter in at; if there bee any of the ſimpler zealous ſort
that conceive the Senſe to be ſuch, or if there bee any others
that would make uſe of it for their politique ends, wee
diſclaime them: and I declare before God and the world
that it was farre from the intention of thoſe that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, to wrong the King and his poſteritie, as the plaine
words of that Article in the cloſe doe clearly beare; and
the foreſaid ſupplication doth manifeſtly declare, their
intent being only to have ſetled a conformity in Kirke
government throughout all his Majeſties dominions, which
they conceived would have ſtrengthened his Majeſties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and made him and his poſterity more glorious: but
ſince wee ſinde many invincible difficulties and intollerable
inconveniences ariſe, chiefely from thoſe who invited
us to enter therein for their aſſiſtance in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116393:7"/>
thereof in that Kirke, and ſo clearly that they intend
to delude us with vaine gloſſes and diſtinctions to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of true Proteſtant Religion, and Monarchicall
government, and perceive, to our great griefe, that wee
have beene abuſed with moſt falſe aſperſions againſt his
Majeſtie; the moſt Religious, Prudent, and beſt of Kings:
I doe further declare before God and the World that they
are guilty of the breach of the Sacred Covenant, and that
wee have diſcharged our duty thereof (which is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory
&amp; conditionall as all oathes <hi>de futuro</hi> are) by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to effectuate it <hi>quantum in nobis erat,</hi> and that wee
are abſolved <hi>in foro Poli &amp; Soli</hi> of any oath or vow contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
therein, in ſo farre as concernes the ſetling of Religion
in the Kirke of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that wee are only
bound thereby to preſerve the Reformation of Religion
in our own Kirke and Kingdome confirmed by his ſacred
Majeſty in Parliament, and to reſtore our native King
to his Juſt Rights, Royall Throne and Dignity, in as full
and ample a manner as ever any of his Royall predeceſſors
injoyed them, and that the mouthes of all Malignants may
bee ſtopped, that it may not bee ſaid Presbytery fetters Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
as Independency deſtroyes it, who caſt up to us the
holy league and covenant of <hi>France</hi> as a pattern on the
mont of ours.</p>
            <p>Therefore I exhort and conjure you, again and again,
in the bowells of our <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> and words of a dying
man, eſpecially my brethren of the Miniſtry; as you expect
a bleſſing from God upon this diſtreſſed, diſtracted Kirke
and Kingdome, upon you and your poſterity; as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to remove Gods heavie Judgements from this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Land, the Sword and Peſtilence, and what elſe may
follow, which I tremble to thinke of; to ſtand faſt and
firme to this poynt of your Covenant, which you were
bound to before by the Law of God and of this Land, and
never ſuffer your ſelves by all the gilded allurement of this
world, which will prove bitter and deceitfull at laſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116393:8"/>
it: Stand faſt to your Native King moſt gracious
to this Land farre beyond all his predeceſſors; none owes
greater obligation to him then the Miniſtry and Gentry,
let not an indelible charracter of Ingratitude lye upon us
that may turne to our ruine. The Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi>
when they were happy in the free profeſſion of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ſuffred themſelves to bee abuſed and miſled by ſome
great ones unto a Rebellion againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> 13, their Naturall
King, which coſt many of them their Lives and Eſtates and
the loſſe of all their hoſtage Townes, and might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangred
their libertie of conſcience, if the King had not
beene very gracious to them, the Templers pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
rendred them formidable to all Chriſtian Kings and
made them to bee cut off in the twinkling of an eye. The
Jeſuites are running hedlong to that ſame height; and our
Biſhops, not contenting themſelves with moderation, were
made inſtruments of their own deſtruction; as ſome of
our brethren before by their Indiſcretion inforced King
<hi>James</hi> to ſet them up; wherefore I beſeech you my brethren
of the Miniſtrie to carry your ſelves mildly toward all men,
<bibl>[Tit. 3.]</bibl> and obediently towards the King and his ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Officers, <bibl>[Rom. 13.]</bibl> Preach ſalvation to your
ſtocks, <bibl>[1. Pet. 2.]</bibl> and meddle not with them that are
ſeditious; keepe your ſelves within the bounds of our bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Saviours <bibl>[Prov. 24.]</bibl> Commiſſion and doe not, as the
Biſhops did, intrench upon the civill Magiſtrates authority,
that yee may live in Peace and Godlineſſe together as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
the meſſengers of the <hi>Lord Christ, non eripit terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria
qui Regna dat coelistia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God of his mercy grant you all, the Spirit of Love and
Union that you may Joyne as one man to Redeeme the
honour of this ancient Nation, which lyes a bleeding in
Forraigne parts where it was once ſo famous for its valour
and fidelitie even to forraign Kings; to redeeme it I ſay
even with your Lives and Fortunes according to your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Covenant and the duty of your allegiance to your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116393:8"/>
Native King; conſider I beſeech you your own intereſts,
beſides honour and conſcience, and never reſt untill you
have reſtored him fully to his Royall Throne and Dignity;
let us his Native Subjects, bee his beſt ſhield and buckler
under God, to defend him from all enemies, and to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
his Scepter to his poſterity ſo long as the Sunne and
Moone endureth, and let our forces bee imployed for the
Reſtitution of the moſt Religious and Vertuous Queene
of <hi>Bohemiae</hi> and her diſtreſſed Children, to their juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
and for the pulling down of the Antichriſt and
