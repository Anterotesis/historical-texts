            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>WHen I firſt chanced upon
this ſevere piece, and
read it in the Language it was ſent
me, I was ſo much concern'd for the
honour of our Country, that it was
my reſolution to ſuppreſs the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of our ſhame, as conceiving
it an Act of great Inhumanity;
But upon ſecond, and more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Thoughts, I have been tempted
to make it ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
give it Liberty, not to reproach,
but to inſtruct our Nation, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
what the Wiſe-Man hath
ſaid, <hi>Open rebuke is better than
<pb facs="tcp:35541:4"/>
ſecret Love.</hi> Prov. 27. 5. The
truth is, I cannot ſay but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
are moſt of them, very
home; and which we may no way
evade, without acknowledging, at
leaſt, that the Gentleman (whoever
he were) made notable uſe of his
time, but beſt of all, by ſetting
upon an effectual redreſs of what is
amiſs. And though I doubt not,
but one might eaſily retort in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inſtances, upon defects as great
(if not greater) of that Nation;
(for he that finds fault, had need
be perfect) yet were it then fitteſt
to do it, and to revenge this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Office, when we ſhall have
firſt reformed our ſelves.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOU Command me to give
you a Minute account of
what I obſerved, and how I
paſſed that little time which
I lately ſpent in <hi>England;</hi> a Country,
whoſe <hi>Character</hi> you ſo greatly deſire
to be informed of, in a Conjuncture
(as you rightly deduce) of ſtrange Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude,
and indeed they are a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of all the World moſt fond of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
And to whom, My <hi>Lord,</hi>
ſhould I more readily ſubmit? Firſt,
encourag'd to make this excurſion by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35541:6"/>
your Lordſhip, who had formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,
and ſo much admir'd the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Magnificence of this <hi>Court,</hi>
and <hi>Kingdom</hi> in its greateſt <hi>Acme</hi> and
Luſtre. But, My <hi>Lord,</hi> I cannot
imagine, that you ſhould eſteem me
either of Years, or Capacity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<hi>You,</hi> whoſe Judgment is ſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Correſpondence ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
as that there is nothing which
can eſcape your Cognizance, not only
in that <hi>Iſland,</hi> but in all the VVorld
beſides. But ſince you oblige me not
to dip into the Tranſactions of State,
the effects of Providence, Time, and
other Notices of a Superiour Orb;
and in which you cannot be inſtructed
by ſo weak an inſtrument as your
Servant; and demand only the little
<hi>Remarks</hi> of my haſty, and deſultory
<hi>Peregrination;</hi> though I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to improve your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s
Knowledge, yet I may hope to give
it diverſion, and an <hi>Eſſay</hi> of my Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>It muſt be avowed that <hi>England</hi> is
a Sweet, and Fertil Country.</p>
            <p>Terra potens armis, atque ubere gleba.</p>

That the Fields,<note place="margin">Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Country.</note> the Hills, and the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
are perpetually clad with a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

not omitting the moſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Ladies,</hi> I had almoſt ſaid, of the

we came on ſhore at <hi>Dover,</hi> where
the People of the Town entertain'd us
with ſuch ſuſpicious and forbidding
Countenances, whiſpering, and ſtiff
Poſtures, that I ſhould never have
believed ſo great a difference in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
of two Nations, could have
been produced by ſo ſhort a trajecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in a Port continually accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd
to the Faces of Strangers, had
not the contrary humours of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
Neighbours, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
made it poſſible, in ſo many pleaſant

inſtances. But I was amazed, when
we had taken <hi>Poſt,</hi> and ſcarce out of

<hi>Boys,</hi> running after, and affrighting
our Horſes, hooting, and crying
out, <hi>French Dogs, French Dogs, a

in this Triumph (though ſomewhat

ſtile of this Country; and that
the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who lodge at their

Company, and are much pleas'd with
their impertinences: Arriv'd at the
<hi>Metropolis</hi> of civility, <hi>London,</hi> we put
our ſelves in <hi>Coach,</hi> with ſome Perſons
of Quality, who came to conduct us
to our Lodging; but neither was this
paſſage without honours done to us,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35541:7"/>
the Kennel dirt, and roots being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
which were frequently caſt at
us by the Children, and Apprentices
without reproof; Civilities, that in

who in this Town domineer in

vaſt, <hi>City.</hi> The Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s,
and the Banqueting-Houſe at <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
of which I remember to have
heard your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſpeak: But you
would be amaz'd at the <hi>genius</hi> of
theſe People, that not much above for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years ago ſhould ſuffer this goodly
and venerable Fabrick, to be built a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
and converted into raskally
<hi>Ware-Houſes,</hi> and ſo ſordidly obſcur'd
and defac'd, that an argument of
great Avarice, Malice, Meanneſs, and
deformity of Mind, cannot poſſibly
be expreſſed: Nothing here of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
nothing of Magnificence, (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a heavy piece of Architecture;) no
publick and honourable Works, ſuch
as render our <hi>Paris,</hi> and other <hi>Cities</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> renowned, and viſited by
all the World; emulating even <hi>Italy</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35541:8"/>
herſelf, for her <hi>Palaces,</hi> uniform and
conſpicuous Structures: I aſſure your
<hi>Lordſhip,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> is the ſole ſpot
in all the World, where among <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
their <hi>Churches</hi> have been made
Jakes, and Stables, Markets and
Tipling-Houſes; and where there
were more need of <hi>Scorpions,</hi> than
<hi>Thongs,</hi> to drive out the <hi>Publicans</hi>
and <hi>Money-Changers:</hi> In ſum, where
theſe <hi>excellent</hi> uſes, are pretended to
be the Marks of Piety and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I had ſometimes the curioſity
to viſit the ſeveral <hi>Worſhips</hi> of theſe
<hi>Equivocal Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts:</hi>
But I extreamly wondred to find
thoſe whom they call <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prebyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</note>
and that would imitate us of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> to have
their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> ſo confuſed and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
In this <hi>remark,</hi> My Lord, to
be ſomewhat more particular, you
will not be diſpleas'd; becauſe it
was a thing you ſo much recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to my eſpecial Notice. <hi>Form,</hi>
they obſerve none; They pray and
read without method, and indeed,
without Reverence or Devotion; I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35541:9"/>
have beheld a whole Congregation
ſit on their—with their Hats on, at
the reading of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and yet
bare-headed when they ſing them,
in divers places they read not the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> at all; but up into the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi>
where they make an inſipid, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and immethodical <hi>Prayer,</hi> in
Phraſes, and a tone ſo affected and
myſterious, that they give it the
name of <hi>Canting,</hi> a term by which
they do uſually expreſs the <hi>Gibbriſh</hi>
of Beggars and Vagabonds; after
which, there follows the <hi>Sermon,</hi>
conſiſting (like their Prayers) of
<hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Abſtracted</hi> Notions,
and things, which, nor the People,
nor themſelves, well underſtand: But
theſe they extend to an extraordinary
length, and <hi>Phariſaical</hi> repetitions;
'till almoſt they ſleep; I am ſure, 'till
their Auditors do.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Miniſter</hi> uſes no Habit of
diſtinction, or gravity, but ſteps up
in <hi>querpo;</hi> and when he lays by his
<hi>Cloak</hi> (as I have obſerved ſome of
them) he has the action rather of a
<hi>Thraſher,</hi> than a <hi>Divine;</hi> this they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35541:9"/>
call <hi>taking pains,</hi> and indeed it is ſo, to
thoſe that hear them: But thus they
have now encouraged every pert <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick</hi>
to invade, affront and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preach
them; and having cancel'd
all manner of decency, proſtituted both
their Perſons and Function to uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
penury and deriſion. You may
well imagine by the manners of the
People, and their prodigious Opinions,
that there is no <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> nor <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
duly Adminiſtred: <hi>The Religion
of</hi> England <hi>is Preaching, and ſitting ſtill
on Sundays.</hi> How they Baptize I
know not, becauſe the Congregation
is diſmiſſed, and they agree in no
form; and for the other <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
no Man gives, or receives alike: Such
of their Churches as I have frequented,
were damned up with <hi>Pues,</hi> every
three or four of the Inhabitants, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in narrow <hi>Pounds</hi> or <hi>Pulpits,</hi> by
themſelves; for they are all turn'd
<hi>Preachers</hi> now, In ſhort, there is
nothing more unlike to our reformed
Churches in <hi>France</hi> and I think in all
<hi>Europe</hi> beſide; the apprehenſion of
<hi>Popery,</hi> or fondneſs to their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35541:10"/>
having carry'd them ſo far
to the other extream, that they have
now loſt all Moderation, and Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;
And I have been herein, My
Lord, the more induſtrious to inform
my ſelf of each particular; becauſe it
ſeems yet to be as publick as the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
of the State. Some of their own
party, I have heard deplore this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
but certainly, they themſelves
gave the firſt occaſion to theſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
Liberties, by a Rigid, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Diſcipline; primarily (it
ſeems) introduced by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and
ſo refined upon by theſe, as there are
few or none that will ſubmit to the
Tyranny; but every one takes his
own courſe, and has protection for
it. Some well natur'd abuſed Men I
have met withal among them; but,
if I miſtake not, for the greater Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
Ambitious, Ignorant, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening,
Sower, and Uncharitable,
<hi>ne quid aſperius,</hi> combining with the
intereſt of the times, and, who to
render themſelves powerful, have in
compliances with the Spirital Pride of
the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> and Corporations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niv'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35541:10"/>
at thoſe many, and prodigious
<hi>Schiſms</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi> which are now
ſpawn'd under themin ſuch numbers,
as give terrour to the State. I omit
to tell your Lordſhip that few take
Notice of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-Prayer; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
a kind of weakneſs to uſe it,
but the <hi>Creed</hi> and the <hi>Decalogue</hi> are
not once heard of in their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
This is Milk for <hi>Babes,</hi> and
theſe are all <hi>Giants.</hi> They do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Solemnize their late <hi>National</hi>
deliverances, and ſome days of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Bloodſhed,</hi> with all poſſible exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
But they think it groſs <hi>Idolatry</hi>
to join with the whole <hi>Chriſtian
Church</hi> of all Profeſſions under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in the <hi>Anniverſaries</hi> of our B.
<hi>Saviours Incarnation, Paſſion, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
and deſcent of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
Spiritual, Eternal, and never to be
forgotten Mercies. Would your
<hi>Lordſhip</hi> believe that this madneſs
ſhould advance ſo far, as to diſturb
the <hi>French-Church</hi> there, which you
know, does in all places obſerve thoſe
ſignal Deliverances and Bleſſings,
both by <hi>Preaching, Prayer, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35541:11"/>
and Exhortations, appoſite to
to the Occaſion; What think you
will be the iſſue of this goodly Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?
I could tell you more of the
Myſterious <hi>Claſſis;</hi> their ridiculous,
inſidiary, and preſumptuous Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
their unheard of Animoſities
againſt their Brethern of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> ſuffering themſelves to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Demotrius</hi> and the <hi>Crafts-Men,</hi> whilſt
they contend about trifles and meer

            <p>Concerning the <hi>Independents,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deſcripti- of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Auabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Quakers, &amp;c.</note> all I
can learn is; They are a refined, and
Apoſtate ſort of <hi>Presbyters;</hi> or, rather
ſuch as renounces all Ordination, as who
having Preached promiſcuouſly to the

There is nothing does

Rom. <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> ſent out <hi>in partibus
Inſidelium;</hi> for they take all other
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be <hi>Heathens.</hi> Theſe are
thoſe great Pretenders to the <hi>Spirit,</hi>

are the confidents, who can deſign
the <hi>minute,</hi> the <hi>place,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi>
of their Converſion: A <hi>Schiſm</hi> full of
Spiritual diſdain, incharity, and high
impoſture: But every alteration of
<hi>State,</hi> deſtroying the intereſt of the

to <hi>Tranſmigrate</hi> into the next more
thriving Fraternity, as the <hi>ſouls</hi> of
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> into Beaſts, and may then
perhaps, aſſume ſome other <hi>Title,</hi>
This is a ſad, but ſerious truth, and
not a little menaces the common <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>
unleſs timely prevented. But,
Sir, I will not longer tire your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with theſe <hi>Monſters</hi> (the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

nor with the madneſs of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,

and a <hi>Cento</hi> of unheard of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi>

the once renowned <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>

               <hi>Reformation,,</hi> which we in
<hi>France</hi> have been made to believe they
are arrived to.</p>
            <p>But I have dwelt too long on this
<hi>remark,</hi> I return to the Town, where
they arc peſtred with <hi>Hackney-Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
and inſolent <hi>Car-Men, Shops,</hi> and
<hi>Taverns, Noiſe,</hi> and ſuch a cloud of
of <hi>Sea-Coals,</hi> that if there be a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of <hi>Hell</hi> upon Earth, it is in this
<hi>Vulcans</hi> in a Foggy Day:<note place="margin">Of the Cough.</note> This peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Smoak</hi> ſo fatally ſeizes on the
<hi>Lungs</hi> of the Inhabitants, that the
<hi>Cough,</hi> and the Conſumption ſpare no
Man. I have been in a ſpacious
<hi>Church,</hi> where I could not hear the
<hi>Miniſter</hi> for the Peoples Barking.</p>
            <p>There is within this <hi>City,</hi> and in all
the Towns of <hi>England</hi> (which I
have paſſed through) ſo prodigious a
number of Houſes where they ſell a
certain Drink called <hi>Ale,</hi> that I think
a good half of the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> may be
Denominated <hi>Ale-Houſe-Keepers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of their Ale.</note> theſe
are a meaner ſort of <hi>Cabarets:</hi> But
what is moſt deplorable, where ſome
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> ſit (eſpecially in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
and ſpend much of their time;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35541:12"/>
drinking of a muddy kind of <hi>Beverage,</hi>
and <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which has, univerſally
beſotted the <hi>Nation,</hi> and at which (I
hear) they have conſumed many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Eſtates.<note place="margin">Of their Taverns.</note> As for other <hi>Taverns,
London</hi> is Compos'd of them, where
they drink <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Red-Wines,</hi> and
other Sophiſticated Liquors to that
fury and intemperance, as has often
amaz'd me to conſider it: But thus
ſome mean Fellow, the <hi>Drawer,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
to an Eſtate, ſome of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
built fair Houſes, and purchaſed
thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> out of their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
who have ruined themſelves by
that baſe and diſhonourable Nice of
Ebriety: And that nothing may be
wanting to the height of Luxury and
Impiety of this <hi>Abomination,</hi> they
have tranſlated the <hi>Organs</hi> out of the
<hi>Churches,</hi> to ſet them up in <hi>Taverns,</hi>
and even a worſe ſort of <hi>Tipling-Houſes,</hi>
chanting their <hi>Dithyrambicks,</hi>
and beſtial <hi>Bacchanalias,</hi> to the Tune
of thoſe <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> which were
wont to aſſiſt them, in the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>God</hi>'s Praiſes, and regulate
the Voices of the worſt Singers in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35541:13"/>
World, which are the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their
<hi>Churches</hi> at preſent; I cannot but
commend the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi>
who ſtill retain their <hi>Organs</hi> in the
<hi>Churches,</hi> and make uſe of them at
the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> without any Opinion of
Superſtition; and I once remember to
have heard the Famous <hi>Diodati</hi> wiſh
they might be introduc'd even at
<hi>Geneva.</hi> A great error undoubtedly
in thoſe who ſit at the Helm, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this ſcandal; to ſuffer ſo many
of theſe <hi>Taverns</hi> and occaſions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,<note place="margin">Women at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and Drink Healths.</note>
ſuch Leaches, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
to gratifie ſo ſordid and baſe
a ſort of People with the ſpoils of
honeſt, and well Natur'd Men.
Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> will not believe me
that the <hi>Ladies</hi> of greateſt Quality,
ſuffer themſelves to be treated in one
of theſe <hi>Taverns,</hi> where a <hi>Curteſan</hi> in
other <hi>Cities</hi> would ſcarcely vouchſafe
to be entertained: But you will be
more aſtoniſh'd when I ſhall aſſure
you, that they drink their <hi>Crowned
Cups,</hi> and roundly, ſtrain Healths
through their <hi>Smocks,</hi> Dance after
the Fiddle, Kiſs freely, and term it an
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35541:13"/>
honourable <hi>Treat.</hi> But all this my
Experience, particular addreſs, and
habitudes with the greateſt of that
Nation has aſſur'd me, that it is not
the paſs time, only of the inferiour
and <hi>Meretricious</hi> ſort;<note place="margin">Of the hard Drinking at private Houſes.</note> ſince I find it a
chief ſuppletory at all their Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to drink Exceſſively, and that
in their own Houſes, before the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and the <hi>Lacques:</hi> It is the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons
diverſion; whether for want
of better to employ the time, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the drink, I know not:
But I have found ſome Perſons of
Quality, who one could not ſafely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
after Dinner, without reſolving to
undergo this <hi>Drink Ordel,</hi> and endure
the Queſtion: It is eſteem'd a piece
of Wit, to make a Man Drunk, for
which ſome ſwilling inſiped <hi>Client,</hi> or
<hi>Congiarie,</hi> is a frequent and conſtant
<hi>adjutant,</hi> Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> may hence
well imagine, how heavy, dull, and
inſignificant the Converſation is;
loud, querillous, and impertinent.
I ſhall relate a ſtory that once hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in my preſence, at a <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s
Houſe in the <hi>Country,</hi> where there was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35541:14"/>
much Company and Feaſting. I
chanced to come at Dinner-Time, and
after the Cloth was taken away (as
the manner is) they fell to their lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Exerciſe: But I unacquainted
then with their Cuſtom, was lead up
into a <hi>With-Drawing-Room,</hi> where
I had the Permiſſion (with a Noble
Perſon who introduced me) to ſit and
converſe with the <hi>Ladies,</hi> who were
thither retired; the <hi>Gentleman</hi> of the
Houſe leaving us in the mean time,
to Entertain his Friends below: But
you may imagine how ſtrangely I
was aſtoniſhed; to ſee within an hour
after, one of the Company that had Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there, entering into the Room all
bloody,<note place="margin">Of the quarelling among the Engliſh.</note> and diſorder'd, to fetch a
Sword which lay in one of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and three or four of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
whom the Fumes of the
Wine had inſpirited, purſuing, and
dragging him by the Hair, till in this
confuſion, one of their Spurs engaged
into a Carpet, upon which ſtood a
a very fair <hi>Looking-Glaſs,</hi> and two
noble pieces of <hi>Porſelain,</hi> drew all to
the ground, broke the <hi>Glaſs,</hi> and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35541:14"/>
               <hi>Vaſas</hi> in pieces; and all this on ſuch
an inſtant, that the <hi>Gentleman</hi> and my
ſelf, had much ado to reſcue the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
<hi>Ladies</hi> from ſuffering in the
tumult; but at laſt we prevailed,
and brought them to terms, the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
concerning an <hi>Health</hi> only, which
one of them would have ſhifted. I
don't remember, My <hi>Lord,</hi> ever to
have known (or very rarely) a
<hi>Health</hi> Drank in <hi>France,</hi> no not the
<hi>King</hi>'s; and if we ſay <hi>A voſtre ſante
Monſieur,</hi> it neither expects Pledge,
or Ceremony. 'Tis here ſo the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
to Drink to every one at the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
that by the time a <hi>Gentleman</hi> has
done his Duty to the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
he is ready to fall aſleep, whereas
with us, we ſalute the whole <hi>Table</hi>
with a ſingle Glaſs only. But, My
<hi>Lord,</hi> was not this, imagine you; an
admirable <hi>Scene</hi> and very Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary?
I confeſs, the <hi>Lady</hi> of the
Houſe being much out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
at what had happened, profered
to excuſe this diſorder, and I was as
ready to receive it, till ſeveral encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
confirmed me, that they were but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35541:15"/>
too frequent, and that there was a
ſort of perfect: <hi>Debauchees,</hi> who ſtile
themſelves <hi>Hectors,</hi> that in their mad
and unheard of <hi>Revils,</hi> pierce their
Veins to quaff their own <hi>Blood,</hi> which
ſome of them have Drank to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
that they died of the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
Theſe are a profeſſed <hi>Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Order of <hi>Bravo</hi>'s compos'd for the
moſt of <hi>Cadets,</hi> who ſpending beyond
their <hi>Penſions,</hi> to ſupply their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances,
practiſe now and then the
High-Way,<note place="margin">Younger Brothers Rob on the High-Way.</note> where they ſometimes
borrow, that which they often repay
at the <hi>Gibbet;</hi> an Ignominious Trade,
unheard of amongſt our Gallant <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi>
however Fortune reduce them.
But I know not whether I might not
here Match theſe Valiant <hi>Hero</hi>'s with
an avowed Society of <hi>Ladies,</hi> and
ſome of them not of the meaneſt for
Birth (I even bluſh to recount it of
that Fair Sex,) who boaſt of making
all advantages at <hi>Play,</hi> and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo Dextrous at it, that ſeldom
they make a ſitting, without deſign
and Booty; For there is here, My
<hi>Lord,</hi> no ſuch thing as Courtſhip, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35541:15"/>
the decent mode of our <hi>Circles;</hi>
for either being mingled in a Room,
the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> ſeparate from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of the <hi>Ladies,</hi> to Drink, as
before I related; or elſe to Whiſper
with one another at ſome Carner, or
<hi>Bay-Window,</hi> abandoning the <hi>Ladies</hi> to
Goſſip by themſelves, which is a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
ſo ſtrange to a <hi>Gallant</hi> of our
<hi>Nation,</hi> as nothing appears more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and undecent; and this in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
muſt needs be the reaſon, that
theſe Beautiful Creatures want aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
addreſs, and the charming
Diſcourſe of our Damoiſels, which
are faculties ſo ſhining, and agreeable
in their Sex with us in <hi>France:</hi> And
in truth even the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
are greatly defective as to this
particular, ill Courtiers, Unpliant,
Moroſe, and of Vulgar addreſs; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
not ſo poliſhed, free, and

amongſt the moſt inferiour of our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
I am not ignorant that they
impute it to a certain levity m us;<note place="margin">The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies want Addreſs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</note>
but it is a miſtake in them, and that
becauſe they ſo hardly reform it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35541:16"/>
ſome ridiculous affectation, as is
conſpicuous in their ſeveral <hi>Modes</hi> and
<hi>Dreſſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Have no <hi>Standard</hi> for Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> which they vary ten times
for our once; every one affecting
ſomething particular; as having no
Standard at <hi>Court,</hi> which ſhould give
<hi>Laws,</hi> and Countenance the Faſhion.
The <hi>Women</hi> are much affected with
<hi>Gaudry,</hi> there being nothing more
frequent than to ſee an Ancient Lady
wear Colours, a thing which neither

               <note place="margin">Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Coloured Clothes.</note> but <hi>Widows</hi> at no time. And
yet reprove they us for theſe Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances;
but I have often diſputed the
caſe: Either we do ill, or well; if
ill, why then do they <hi>ape us?</hi> if well,
why do they reproach us? The truth
is, they have no Moderation, and
are neither ſo lucky, nor frugal as our
<hi>Ladies</hi> are in theſe Sumptuary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences;
and whereof the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>
takes ſo little Cogniſance, that it is
not an eaſie matter to diſtingniſh the
<hi>Lady</hi> from the <hi>Chamber-Maid;</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
being ſuffered in this brave
Country, to go clad like their Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35541:16"/>
a thing neither decent, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in <hi>France,</hi> where they may
wear neither Lace, nor Silk.
I may not forget to acquaint your
<hi>Lordſhip,</hi> that though the <hi>Ladies,</hi> and
the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are ſo ſhie of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet when once they grow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
it paſſes into expreſſions,
and compellations extreamly new to
our uſages, and the ſtile of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
Do but imagine how it would
become our <hi>Ladies,</hi> to call <hi>Monſieur</hi>
N— <hi>Jack</hi> N. what more frequent
than this? <hi>Tom.</hi> P— was here to
Day; I went Yeſterday to the<note n="*" place="margin">A place near <hi>Paris</hi> like <hi>Hide-Park. Engliſh</hi> Women have Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ways with them.</note>

at firſt by ſome <hi>Camerades</hi> one
with another; but it is mean and
rude, and ſuch as our <hi>Lacques,</hi> would
almoſt diſdain in <hi>Paris;</hi> where I
have often obſerved two <hi>Chimny-Sweepers,</hi>
accoſt one another, in <hi>better Forms,</hi>
and Civiller Addreſſes. But
to be confident and civil, is not a thing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35541:17"/>
ſo eaſily underſtood, and, ſeems a
peculiar talent of our Nation.</p>
            <p>However the <hi>Ladies</hi> are not more
obliging and Familiar, than the
<hi>Lords</hi> are difficult and inacceſſable;<note place="margin">Some of the Lords ſurley.</note>
for though by reaſon of my Birth, and
Quality, my recommendations and
addreſſes, I found ſome tolerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
amongſt them; yet I obſerv'd,
that they kept at ſuch a ſurly diſtance
with the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> even of Family,
that methought I never beheld a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Converſation; eſpecially, when
comparing their Parts, and Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I found them generally ſo much
inferiour, as if a <hi>Lord</hi> were indeed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> or a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s
not fit Companion for a <hi>King:</hi>
But this muſt needs be the reſult of an
ill, and haughty inſtitution, and for
that moſt of theſe great Perſons are in
their Minority, and the Age wherein
they ſhould be furniſhed with the
nobleſt impreſſions, taught only to
converſe with their Servants, ſome
<hi>Sycophants,</hi> and under the Regiment
of a <hi>Pedant,</hi> which imprints that
ſcornfulneſs and folly, and fits them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35541:17"/>
with no better forms when they
ſhould produce themſelves, and give
teſtimony to others, as well of their
Superiority in Virtue, as in Birth,
and Dignity. But this is, My <hi>Lord,</hi>
a particular, which I have heard you
often complain of, and which we do
frequently take notice of, at their
coming abroad into our Country;
where for want of addreſs, and fit
Perſons to introduce them, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
return more refined than they
came, elſe they could not but have
obſerv'd, that there is nothing which
makes the diſtinction of <hi>Nobles</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> but the <hi>Title,</hi> and that his
<hi>Majeſty</hi> himſelf does them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
which here they uſurp upon
their equals; But, My <hi>Lord,</hi> they
are ſufficiently puniſhed for it in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
Where, to me they appear ſo
degenerate, for want of this humility
and free Converſation; by which,
and their other Vices, they grow now
ſo much deſpiſed, that the <hi>Gentlemen</hi>
need ſeek no Revenge: For though
(as I told you) the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are
moſt of them very intemperate, yet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35541:18"/>
the <hi>Proverb</hi> goes,<note place="margin">Whence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>As Drunk as a Lord.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>As Drunk as a Lord.</hi>
But, My <hi>Lord,</hi> as there is no rule ſo
general, but it does admit of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo ſhould I give my own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
as well as your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> the
contradiction, to make the Cenſure
Univerſal; there being even amongſt
<hi>theſe,</hi> ſome <hi>few,</hi> and in particular my
<hi>L. P.</hi> my <hi>L. M.</hi> my <hi>L. D.</hi> &amp;c.
whom I eſteem to be very noble, and
accompliſhed Perſons, as who have
learned (by the good Fortune of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Education) how to value the
Converſations of worthy Men, and
who indeed, do ſufficiently verefie
all thoſe <hi>Attributes</hi> which are due to
their Qualities, and therefore whom
this <hi>Paragraph</hi> does no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould I be leſs ſevere and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
totally to exclude even ſome of
the <hi>Ladies</hi> from the Advantages of
this <hi>Period,</hi> whoſe perfections and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
claim an equal right to all that
I have here ſpoken, out of a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment

It was frequently,<note place="margin">Their Balls.</note> during the laſt
<hi>Winter,</hi> that I was carried to their
<hi>Balls,</hi> as where indeed, I expected to
ſee what ſhould appear the moſt of
Gallant, and Splendid amongſt the
<hi>Ladies,</hi> nor really did my expectations
deceive me; for there was a confluence
of very great Beauties, to which the
gliſtering of their Jewels (which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occaſion they want not) could
add nothing ſave their <hi>Weight;</hi> the
various Habits being ſo particular, as
if by ſome ſtrange <hi>Inchantment,</hi> they
had encountered, and come out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Nations: But I was aſtoniſh'd
to ſee, when they were ready to move,
that a <hi>Dancing-Maſter,</hi> had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to take forth the greateſt <hi>Ladies,</hi>
and they again the <hi>Dancing-Maſter,</hi>
who performed the moſt part of the
<hi>Ball,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that were
preſent, were the leaſt concerned, and
ſtood looking on; ſo as it appeared
to me more like the <hi>Farce</hi> of a <hi>Comedy,</hi>
than a <hi>Ball</hi> of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and in truth,
their meaſures, when any of them
were taken out, made me ſome
what aſham'd to lead a <hi>Lady</hi> who did
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35541:19"/>
me the honour, for fear (though my
skill is very vulgar in that exerciſe)
they ſhould have taken <hi>me</hi> for a <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-Maſter,</hi>
as who had happily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
my Youth ſo ill, as to have
ſome advantage of the reſt in that
faculty. This favour is particular to
the <hi>Dancing-Maſters</hi> in this Country;
and Reaſon good; for they have ſuch
ample <hi>Salaries,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> as maintains both their

are the <hi>Ladies,</hi> of their reſpect in this

all this; but permit themſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

            <p>When this Ceremony was ended,

            <p>The next place to be remembred

But thus, thoſe mean Fellows are (as

ſupply the defects of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi>

(where the <hi>Lawyers</hi> take Liberty to

avow their Avarice) that I have
much admired at the temper of the

reproved; and certainly, it ſprings
