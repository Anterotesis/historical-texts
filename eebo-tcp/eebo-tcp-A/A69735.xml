            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He cause which formerly moved mee to Answer M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Edwards</hi> his first Booke, was; First, the <hi>frothinesse</hi> of his <hi>reasons</hi>: for when I saw them <hi>light,</hi> I thought a man of understanding would not medle with them, because they were so <hi>rotten</hi> they could not hold together: And I conceived that if hee were not answered at all, he would then have abounded in vaine glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the hearing of the <hi>disturbance</hi> it made in the City, (<hi>the better party</hi> being greived that hee so discovered himselfe, and the <hi>worser party</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> was become their <hi>Champion,</hi>) moved me to take into consideration the difficulty, and finding his booke to be (as indeede it was) <hi>a rangling-insinuating, -contradictory, -revengefull story,</hi> it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto me to be a taske most befitting <hi>a woman</hi>; The consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of moved me to answer it <hi>publikely</hi> as it was <hi>published.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And forasmuch as it plainely appeareth, that this his <hi>second booke</hi> (or <hi>Antipologie</hi>) is of the same nature with his other, and hath no more <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> then it, I doe affirme, <hi>It was answered before it was written</hi>: for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth (for the most part,) of <hi>tales, and reports, it is an unsavory history,</hi> full of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful-slaunderous-accusations,</hi> but abounding with reprochful <hi>jeeres</hi> and evill <hi>calumniations</hi>; But I have now noted some things therein which concerne my selfe—and all who feare <hi>God,</hi> and walke in his <hi>way,</hi> [I meane the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi>] that <hi>way</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> walked in, which <hi>way</hi> was then called <hi>herisie,</hi> and so is still, by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and such as he.</p>
            <p>Both I, and my faithfull yoakefellow have joyntly tasted of the pressures of the <hi>Hyrarchy</hi> above these twenty yeares, and the <hi>Bishops-Priests</hi> have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us out of our place of abode 16. yeares agoe: and we (amongst the rest of the people of <hi>God,</hi>) are now prosecuted afresh by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and such as he, for he hath unjustly charged them to bee <hi>the movers of sedition, and distubers of the Kingdomes.</hi> By all which it appeareth that it concerneth the <hi>Separation</hi> principally to take notice of <hi>Shimies cursings,</hi> and <hi>Rabshakes ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> and not only to consider that <hi>it may be God hath bidden them so doe,</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:53166:3"/>
also to declare that what they doe is unjust, which was one cause that moved me to endeavour (according to my skill) to unmaske the faces of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded arguments, against <hi>Independencie, and Tolleration,</hi> in his former booke, which I answered three yeares agoe: And though he hath not ability to defend, or relieve, any one of those his arguments against <hi>Separation,</hi> yet he chargeth others with neglect in not answering his first borne: against that way, in which booke he declared that though it was the <hi>first brought forth, yet not the first conceived</hi>: for that he had <hi>large tractates to put forth against the whole way of Separation</hi>; I have waited these three yeares, for the bringing of them forth,<note place="margin">☞</note> but now it seemes to me, <hi>It was a false conception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover I suppose that (Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>) his painefull labouring thus, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of feare, least (as <hi>Christ</hi> is exalted, and as the <hi>hill</hi> of <hi>Syon</hi> appeareth more eminently (then <hi>the Priests</hi> wil be in danger to loose some maintenance (as hee hath in part expressed in his former booke <note n="*" place="margin">

And true it is, that people rightly informed will not have their necks captivated, under <hi>Jewish yoakes of tithes paying,</hi> to maintaine <hi>a popish-ordained-Clergie</hi>; for <hi>God</hi> requireth his people to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine no <hi>Ministry</hi> but their owne, <hi>even</hi> such as <hi>labour with them in the word and doctrine,</hi> and not those who labour against them: And I know right well that the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Separation,</hi> have never beene chargeable to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> neither have any of their <hi>poore Orphans</hi> beene left to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her <hi>Parishes,</hi> though their <hi>parents</hi> have suffered <hi>death (in prison)</hi> by the cruelty of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> [as I could name divers within these 10. yeares:] yet God <hi>turned his hands upon the little ones</hi> and provided for them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promise, <note n="*" place="margin">Zech. 13.7.</note> so that as the <hi>righteous</hi> parents <hi>were never forsaken, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did their seede beg their bread.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He causes of my writing unto you at this time are three. 1. Your threatnings. 2. Your challenge. 3. The out-cryes of the people against you, for that which you delivered in <hi>Pulpits</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pulpit, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Cockpits</note> where they expected to heare the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> Preached by you; in stead whereof, they heare proud boastings that you will after your skirmishing with the <hi>Separation</hi> take their <hi>Fort</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But peradventure you may, by your fishing for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, be caught your selfe. Now our <hi>fort,</hi> and <hi>fortresse</hi> is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and though you take him, you shall never take him from us, for he is all fulnesse to all, and sufficiencie for all, that draw neere unto him; But whether you intend so to take him as to rest upon him, or to take him as the High Priests Officers once tooke him, to crucifie him; let your hearers judge.</p>
            <p>Sir, you are a brave warriour, and can fight well in a Pulpit, where you are sure none shall come neere you, so much as to give you an answer: for proofe whereof, witnesse your owne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in your <hi>Antipologia,</hi> that the <hi>Separatists will not come in your Churches</hi>: Therefore you may easily make the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve great matters by your juggling, where there is none to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist you, nor hold out the light in opposition to your false figures;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53166:4"/>
But if they were there, they might not be admitted there to opose you, nor to use any meanes to undeceive the people; But it is an old saying (though somewhat grosse) that <hi>every cocke croweth on his owne miksen,</hi> and that makes you so bold, where you are sure you shall have no oposition.</p>
            <p>But (Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>) now I will counsell you, to <hi>muster up all your army you bragge of,</hi> and <hi>come forth, set up your colours,</hi> and pitch a field with the <hi>Separation, bring forth all your strong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> not only the <hi>last conceived,</hi> your <hi>latter thoughts, and studies,</hi> but also <hi>your large tractates [against the whole way of Separation,]</hi> which were <hi>the first conceived of old,</hi> which you promised in your <hi>former booke</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">In your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction.</note> for you have brought no argument in your <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologia</hi> against <hi>Separation</hi> from a <hi>false Church</hi> and <hi>false Ministry,</hi> but you have challenged all, <hi>high, and low, Anabaptists, Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, and Semiseparates, &amp;c. to bring a ground from Scripture for the lawfulnesse of seperating from a true Church,</hi> which thing wee never strived for, for we know it is utterly unlawfull. But this was your policie (especially when you preached upon the house top,) to make the people beleeve that <hi>those who seperate from the Church of England seperate from a true Church</hi>: But this is yours to prove, I therfore challenge you now, to prove [by the Scripture] that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is a <hi>true Church,</hi> and the <hi>Ministry</hi> thereof a <hi>true Ministry,</hi> and that they have a true <hi>outward calling,</hi> which yet you have not done, neither have you brought any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument neither in your former booke, nor in this <hi>Antipologia,</hi> that proves your <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Ministry</hi> true; And I thinke you dare not deny but that these bee <hi>substantialls,</hi> and not some of your <hi>meere circumstances,</hi> which you <hi>would have decided without the word of God,</hi>

               </note>By this it appeareth what manner of <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is, even such a one as Mr. <hi>Henry Barrow</hi> hath discribed it to be long agoe; for if you please to read but his discovery of a <hi>false Church,</hi> which he wrote in prison, you shall see there he hath proved the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to be as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is, even <hi>Babylon, a filthy cage of all unclean and hatefull birds.</hi> But rather then you will take Mr. <hi>Barrowes</hi> advice, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to come from among them, you will sooner helpe to hang all such <hi>Barrowes,</hi> and then say it is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon them: for none hath beene more forward then your selfe to persecute the <hi>Lords people,</hi> as appeareth by your <hi>Writ of Ne admittas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> which you sent to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to keep the <hi>Petitions</hi> of the <hi>poore Saints</hi> out thence. But it will not be for the <hi>Parliaments</hi> safety, to take such <hi>wicked counsell</hi> as yours, I hope the <hi>Parliament</hi> seeth (by this time) that God is making inquisition for <hi>bloud,</hi> yea, for the <hi>blrud of the Saints.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53166:8"/>
it is better that all <hi>sinne</hi> which hath beene committed, should be repented of, then that more should be added to the stock.</p>
            <p>By all this you may see that the 4. things (in the <hi>Apollogie,</hi>) which you say <hi>are good,</hi> are good <hi>for us,</hi> but not for you: And if you had not beene benumed in your spirit, you would never have taken up (against us) such weapons, which (if you had beene sensible) you might have known would have come positively a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your selfe; But these <hi>tales</hi> which you tel in your <hi>Antipolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> are like unto some of your tales which you tell the people in the <hi>Pulpit</hi>: for there you say you will face the <hi>Separation,</hi> and they will flie away, but you are shrewdly mistaken: For I, (who am one of the meanest) dare give you the meeting, and I hope to speed as well as I did, when I met that <hi>ragged Regiment</hi> which you set out <hi>against Independency and Toleration,</hi> which you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led your <hi>Scout</hi>; (in your 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Reason</hi> against <hi>Independency</hi>) and <hi>joyned and subjoyned forces against Tolleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover you say, (in <hi>your Antipologia) that the Anabaptists cast away thir baptisme, (received in a false Church) because they wil not put a new peice to an old garment. And upon the same ground, you say the Separation would have the Materiall Churches pulled down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be one of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> grounds (as it may be it is) then you may see their mistake:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note> For they ought to discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Baptisme</hi> in a <hi>false Church,</hi> which is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> that Church hath stollen &amp; carried away in their <hi>Apostacie,</hi> they ought (I say) to put a difference betwixt that, and an <hi>Idol</hi> of their owne making, as for example. The <hi>circumcision,</hi> which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> caried with him, was Gods; but the <hi>Calves</hi> were his owne, <hi>Daggan,</hi> and his <hi>Temple</hi> was the <hi>Philistems,</hi> but the <hi>Arke</hi> was Gods. And therefore if the <hi>Separates</hi> desire the pulling down of the <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> they doe well, but if these <hi>high places</hi> stand, they will be no <hi>peice sowed to their garments,</hi> for they touch them not. But they have not been more forward (in this good worke of the pulling downe of the <hi>Idols Temples,</hi>) then your self in writing to the <hi>Parliament</hi> for a whole and <hi>totall Reformation,</hi> because they should not be blemished, you would have them to <hi>pull downe the high places and all Idols and Idolatry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> as whosoever readeth your <hi>Epistle</hi> to your booke against <hi>Independency</hi> may see at large, where your <hi>reasonable arguments</hi> are set down to the

               <hi>Parliament</hi> for that end and purpose. But the Anabaptists have no such ground to put away their <hi>Baptisme</hi> which they received in a <hi>false Church,</hi> as hath beene proved before. The <hi>Calves</hi> and <hi>high places</hi> of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> were to be done away, and it was their duty to demolish them, because they were a <hi>curse</hi> to the <hi>Land, and Idols</hi> of his owne making as hath beene said before: But the <hi>Circumcision</hi> which was <hi>Gods,</hi> which they carried away with them, they brought againe to <hi>Gods Temple,</hi> (as wee have done our <hi>Baptisme,</hi>) and were accepted. By all which it appeareth that you are able to lay no errour to the chage of the <hi>Separation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover in this your <hi>Antipologie,</hi> you advance, and extoll your booke against <hi>Independencie and Tolleration</hi>: You say, that <hi>the Apologists meant that, as well as others, which were written with strength against there way</hi>: And secondly, <hi>you</hi> affirme it to bee <hi>argumentall, and that therefore it behoved either all or some of them to have answered it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, They know best what they have to doe, yet for my owne part, I did conceive it ought to have beene answered, and therefore I answered it my selfe, and that for these reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">☞</note>First, because <hi>you should not be wise in your owne conceit.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because I read that our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> answered <hi>Sathan,</hi> when <hi>Sathan</hi> brought false arguments against him, and it is also written, that we <hi>should be ready to give a reason of our hope, to every one that shall aske us:</hi> and I considering the many questions that you asked, and the weakenesse of your <hi>reasons</hi> and arguments, and the untruths of some of them, and how contradictory they were to one another, thought it very easie to undermine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow them, therefore I answered them, holding it meet for those who were more able, not to trouble themselves therewith, but to be employed in matters of farre greater and higher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernement. But seeing you are yet so bold as to stand in it, to affirme that your booke was <hi>argumentall and ought to have beene answered by them all, or some of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I desire againe to repeat the heads of some of the Cheifest of your <hi>arguments,</hi> that so <hi>rationall men</hi> may consider, whether they be truely <hi>Logicall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The substance of your first Argument is this: <hi>Its evident that the Church of God could not stand without some other helpe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>then

Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors,</hi> &amp; <hi>Teachers, and all other Officers</hi>: But you have not declared any evidence, neither <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor true reason:</hi> what! must wee then beleeve you upon your <hi>bare word</hi>? I will not, for that were to make you a <hi>God,</hi> or at least one infalliably inspired.</p>
            <p>Your second argument is, that <hi>the Government of Independent or seperated Churches, is not of divine institution, because it forceth them to have Ministers without Ordination,</hi> which thing is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth like your former, as hath been proved at large in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereunto: and there are divers untruths in this <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> (or section) which have been answered, as will plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to those that will take the paines to reade your booke and mine.</p>
            <p>Your third, is; <hi>that it is not to be thought that Christ would leave such a Governement, that affords no way of appeale, &amp;c.</hi> This is answered at large: that the Churches of the <hi>Separat<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">

               </hi> have <hi>true waies of appeale.</hi> But the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath not.</p>
            <p>These be your mighty Arguments of strength, which deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an answer, though you proved none of them: If the answer which I sent you already have not sufficiently proved your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to be groundlesse, declare (I pray you) what substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall point is not answered, (if there be any substantialls in them) and it shall be answered by Scripture, and good reason, or else you shall have the conquest.</p>
            <p>But you have (in this your <hi>Antipologia</hi>) named some learned Authors; who have written against Separation, amongst which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> is one.</p>
            <p>And I have seen Mr. <hi>Rutherfords booke,</hi> and also weighed it, But I could not discerne, that he hath set down any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Separation</hi> that hath any force, neither hath hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any thing sufficiently, but hath propounded many queeries. which have been both framed and answered long agoe, and he hath in his discourse expressed and repeated many answers, which have been made (to those <hi>queeires,</hi>) by the <hi>Separation,</hi> and running them over, he telleth us what this man saith, and what that man saith, and what another man saith, but he in declaring his owne conceptions, (following his <hi>blind zeale, and popish Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>) runneth himselfe headlong to justifie the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry

            </p>
            <p>But as Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> by pleading for the <hi>Ecclesiasticall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to be in the <hi>Officers,</hi> hath given great advantage to the <hi>Pope,</hi> so hath he to the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> by pleading the universallity of his <hi>Church,</hi> bringing in the <hi>seed</hi> of wicked men to be <hi>baptized</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their fore father was a beleeving <hi>Parent,</hi>

to his <hi>revealed word,</hi> most especially upon that time institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his publike worship, even the <hi>first day</hi> of the <hi>weeke,</hi> being the <hi>Lords day</hi>: And that all the 6. dayes, we may follow our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings without feare of the execution of such <hi>unjust Lawes</hi> which former <hi>Parliaments</hi> have made; against such, who would not come to their <hi>Common Prayer book,</hi> or submit to all the orders of the <hi>Parishes</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; for such a Toleration as this we plead.</p>
            <p>IN your first reason, you affirme that <hi>a Toleration of Independent Churches and governement with their opinions and practise, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Magistrates duty laid down in the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have proved it to be the Magistrates duty, to Tolerate the true worship of God, and those practises which are according to the word.</p>
            <p>But you would insinuate still your <hi>old slander, that we plead for a toleration of herisie and Scisme: which</hi> we know is <hi>against the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates duty</hi>; and this maketh against your evill way; For if a <hi>Parliament may not</hi> (as you say) <hi>displease God to please men, nor winke at evill, to content some persons, And if Parliaments in making lawes for religion, must depend on the will of God, revealed in his word, and not upon the consciences of some People.</hi> Then it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for a <hi>Parliament</hi> to constraine men to submit to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of a <hi>Synod</hi> (or <hi>Presbytery</hi>) when neither the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> nor their decrees have ground in the word of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOur second reason is, that <hi>The Toleration desired is against the Solemne League and Covenant taken by the Parliament and Kingdomes, and therefore the Toleration desired comes to late, the doores being shut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Here you lay a fearfull aspertion upon the <hi>Parliament:</hi> for requiring such an <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gospel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants doe not teach men to persecute.</note> as if they intended to shut the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>true worship</hi> out of the three <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> for you say further, <hi>If the toleration were lawfull in it selfe, yet because of the Oath and Covenant, it is unlawfull, though it might have beene granted before, it cannot be granted now, least the Kingdome should be guilty before God of Covenant breaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Surely you will make the <hi>Parliament</hi> all like <hi>Herod,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark. 6, 26.</note> they must take poore <hi>John Baptists</hi> head off, <hi>because of their oath</hi>!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53166:12"/>But is this <hi>oath so foule</hi> as you would make it? and yet is it <hi>like the Decree of the Medes and Persians, that it may not be altered.</hi> Wells<hi>God</hi> can deliver <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> 
               <hi>poore Daniell in the Lyons denne,</hi> and (it may be) you shall come in our stead, when once the <hi>Parliament</hi> discerneth your wicked intentions.<note place="margin">☞</note>
            </p>
            <p>But (Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>) bethinke your selfe, will not you <hi>blush,</hi> and <hi>be ashamed</hi> to give in the <hi>oath</hi> in these termes, as you have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exprest it (in this your second Reason, <hi>pag.</hi> 283.) that <hi>we are to endeavour the reformation of Religion, in the Kingdomes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland in Doctrine, Worship, Governement and Discipline, according to the example of the best reformed Churches,</hi> [forgetting <hi>the word of God</hi>] which ought to have beene set before you (as it was indeede by the <hi>Parliament</hi>) But you deale by the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> as you deale by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> hack them, and mangle, and labour to make them fit for your owne turne; and yet you jeered the Apologists (when they spake of the way and practise of their Churches) because they did not name the Law or O<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Testament in expres words (though they in the same place testifie that they reverence and adore the fulnesse of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and their sufficiency to make us perfect, &amp;c.) but here you have shamefully forgotten your selfe, and overslipt both Law &amp; Gospel. And so tye your selves to mens patterns without the word of God.</p>
            <p>And surely I cannot beleeve that the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted</hi> so, as you inferre in the same page of your booke, <hi>How</hi> (say you) <hi>can they grant a tolleration so different as their way is that will not depend upon a Synod</hi>? And in the next page of the same Reason you say, that <hi>there is in the Covenant a clause in the second branch, that wee shall without respect of persons, endeavour the extirpation of Scisme, and whatsoever shall bee found contrary to sound Doctrine, and the power of godlinesse, least we pertake in other mens sinnes.</hi> Now surely (Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>) I wonder that wise men can smile upon you, except it be in consideration of your folly, for you are made all of contradictions, unlesse you would have us take it for granted, that it is <hi>according to sound doctrine, and the power of godlinesse,</hi> that a number of <hi>Priests</hi> should bee called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of <hi>contrary religions,</hi> some for the <hi>Bishops</hi> and some for the <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> and some for <hi>Christ,</hi> and that the two first casting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53166:12"/>
aside the last, should agree to make <hi>decrees,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Parliament</hi> should bee bound to establish them. Would this bee now to <hi>extripate scisme</hi>? nay: it would be to establish a <hi>grand scisme</hi>: For <hi>godlinesse</hi> is cast out by the two first, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> must establish, what ever shall be thought of those two first to be sound, whether it be for the <hi>Bishops the antient fathers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> or for the <hi>Presbyters</hi> their <hi>younger sonnes</hi>: and so you would have the <hi>Parliament</hi> to bee indeede guilty of their <hi>sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOur third Rreason is, that <hi>A Tolleration is against the nature of a Reformation</hi>: and here you discover your selfe in this Reason; that the <hi>Reformation</hi> you intend to make <hi>is to force all men in the Kingdom to submit to some perticular forme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> for you say you <hi>cannot make a reformation but it must offend many consciences.</hi> But if it be so, it will be the <hi>consciences</hi> of them that have <hi>knowledge</hi> in the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God</hi>: For the <hi>ignorant multitude</hi> will bee offended at nothing, but of what ever <hi>Religion</hi> their King will be of, they will be of the same, therefore you are a contentious man indeede! that will offend the consciences of the <hi>godly,</hi> to make your <hi>Church</hi> great, that so your revenewes may be large!</p>
            <p>YOur fourth Reason is, <hi>A tolleration of men in their errors is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the judgements of the greatest lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is granted, Therefore you might have spared your labour, in citing your <hi>antient fathers</hi>: For in all that you doe herein, I oppose you not.</p>
            <p>YOur fifth Reason, is that the <hi>Magistrates tollerating of errors, and new opinions, is a kinde of invitation to them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This thing I grant.</p>
            <p>And therefore the <hi>Magistrates</hi> ought not to <hi>tollerate er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> or any <hi>opinion</hi> that is not grounded upon the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; And therefore I conceive it to be the <hi>Magistrates duty,</hi> to make tryall of the <hi>Synod,</hi> whether their gathering together bee according to the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God</hi>? or according to the customes of this <hi>Kingdome</hi>?<note place="margin">☜</note> And whether they bee not of the same nature with the <hi>Synod</hi> which used to sit in the <hi>Convocation house?</hi> And whether any decree which they shall now pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

[not having the Scripture for their warrant] may be consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto? And though it have the Scripture for their warrant, whether there bee ever the more weight in it for their decreeing of it: and it greatly concerneth the <hi>Parliament</hi> to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Assembly</hi> have any thing to do with the things of God, [while they stand Priests by their <hi>OLD-POPISH-CAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING,</hi>] And that upon your ground (namely) that <hi>the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates ought not to tollerate errors, or new opinions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all waies, and practises, are new, and strange, which have not warrant in the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN your sixt Reason, you pleade against <hi>a tolleration of different formes of Church governement, for feare of division among Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and families</hi> (you say) <hi>it will not stand with Christian policie, but it will stand with Matchevillian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> If <hi>Christian policie</hi> might take place in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and all your <hi>Matchivillian pollicie</hi> banished out, there would be no striving then about <hi>different formes</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; but <hi>Christs true Religion</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> would then have a free passage without interposing, for the <hi>free tollerating</hi> of it will produce no <hi>mischiefes,</hi> nor <hi>evills</hi> at all; And it is not wee, that pleade for <hi>different formes of Church governement,</hi> but <hi>your owne party.</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> We pleade but for one intire <hi>governement</hi> established up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>sound principles,</hi> unalterable. And not a <hi>government</hi> which may looke with <hi>severall faces,</hi> in <hi>severall times,</hi> upon <hi>severall occasions,</hi> according to <hi>mens fancies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore it had beene better for you to have held your tongue, then made so <hi>many repetitions</hi> of things which have beene sufficiently answered long agoe.</p>
            <p>YOur seventh Reason is, that <hi>Independency, or the Church way, as being a scisme in forsaking the Reformed Churches, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting new, the way of constituting Churches by the people, the way of making their Ministers, the refusing of beleevers and their children to the Sacraments unlesse they bee Church members, with many more, are all flat against the primative patterne, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these words you have so jumbled things together as it were in a broken language.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note> If you meane that the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi> from your <hi>false Churches,</hi> &amp; their way of making <hi>ministers,</hi> &amp; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53166:14"/>
Churches,</hi> is contrary to the <hi>primative patterne,</hi> you speake untruly; for they make the <hi>primative patterne</hi> their rule: And then (for <hi>their refusing of beleevers and their children from the Sacraments, unlesse they be members of their Church,</hi>) in this you accuse them unjustly also: for they doe admit beleevers, and their <hi>Infants</hi> to the ordinance of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> though they bee not <hi>members</hi> of a <hi>particular congregation</hi>: for they are not cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be <hi>members</hi> before <hi>Baptisme,</hi> (in respect of <hi>order</hi>) and to partake of the <hi>Supper,</hi> till they be in <hi>[particular] Church fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> And this I will engage my selfe to maintaine against you, if it please you to dispute the case; And therefore you had no neede to have branded this practise, with such a blacke badge, to call it <hi>the fountaine of evill, and root of bitternesse and manifold er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and other mischiefes.</hi> For this is but your <hi>bitter language</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth.</p>
            <p>And if you intend to make your rejoynders, and <hi>large tractates</hi> (which you brag of,) of such stuffe as you have made this <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia</hi>; It were better for you to put on a <hi>buffe coate,</hi> &amp; to go fight in the Army against your <hi>enemies,</hi> then to sit at home to slander and accuse your <hi>friends,</hi> even those who ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er did, nor thought harme to you or any other.</p>
            <p>YOur eighth Reason is a commendation <hi>of the Presbyteriall way, and that by the testimony of many fathers, and the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Scottish Commishioners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you say <hi>there will be objected a passage against it, in a booke lately printed of M.</hi> Simpsons.<note place="margin">☜</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I leave Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> and you to try it ou<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>you had so defined your Presbyterian governement, and set downe your bounds and limitts, what, and what not,</hi> according as you call upon the <hi>Apologists,</hi> to define their <hi>Church way,</hi> then you should have had my judgement of it, here, to the full. But to judge and determin so of a thing, which is not yet begotten, or brought forth in this Kingdome, is not so easie a matter, neither do we know what forme or shape it will have when it is brought forth. [It may (for ought I know) be <hi>a MONSTER</hi> like <hi>the Image of the seven beaded beast,</hi>] and if it bee found <hi>defective,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 13.24.</note> then <hi>all, who have taken the Nationall Covenant, are</hi> (by your own confession) <hi>to endeavour the exterpation of it.</hi> Yea, <hi>And further</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53166:15"/>
(you say) <hi>as the Parliament will not be respecters of persons, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, they must grant no tolleration, but what is agreeable to sound doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this you speake very true, although indeed you crosse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your former speeches. And therefore the way to deside the controversie, is to sease writing of such <hi>large tractates,</hi> wherein you doe but (as it were) <hi>picke strawes</hi> (and make <hi>abundance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pititions, to tryfle away the time,</hi>) (In my judgement) (<hi>I say</hi>) It were better (for your selfe, and Mr. <hi>Samuel Rutherford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>A.S.</hi> (or any of you,<note place="margin">☞</note> or whomsoever the Parliament shall apoint,) to produce Scripture and good reason for your way, (if you can) and let as many of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Congregations</hi> of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> have freedome to produce Scripture, and <hi>sound reason,</hi> for their way, [in a <hi>free conference.</hi>] And let the <hi>houses</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> who are able to judge of the great, and weighty businesses of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> (let them I say) have the <hi>hearing,</hi> and <hi>tryall</hi> of the <hi>conference,</hi> and as things are cleared, so let them allow, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow. And this is according to your <hi>counsell</hi> (in <hi>pag.</hi> 304. of your <hi>Antipologia</hi> where you say. <hi>To conclude, If the way of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie be of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>and the Apollogists can make that good, let it be established by Parliament, and let all come to that; but if not</hi> (say you) <hi>why then should it be tolerated.</hi> In this I thinke you say right, stand to this, and let it come to the tryall; and doe not insinuate against the <hi>Church way,</hi> as you have done (in this page, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other places of your booke) where you say, <hi>the Divell would affect</hi> th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore I would have you to correct your language, <hi>and search and try your wayes,</hi> (as you exhort the <hi>Apollogists</hi> to doe;) <hi>Consider with what spirit, and intention you writ this booke, Let your conscience reflect upon what is plainely layd downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you,</hi> in the Answer to your former booke, and in this.
