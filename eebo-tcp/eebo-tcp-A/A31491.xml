            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgesses,
Ministers of the Gospell, and Commons of all sorts in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the providence of God
living under one King, and being of one reformed Religion, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes the glory of God, and the advancement of the Kingdom
of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, the honour and happinesse of the
Kings Majesty, and His Posterity, and the true publique Liberty,
Safety and Peace of the Kingdoms, wherein every ones private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is included, and calling to mind the treacherous and bloody plots,
conspiracies, attempts, and practices of the enemies of God against
the true Religion, and professours thereof in all places, especially
in these three Kingdomes ever since the reformation of Religion, and
how much their rage, power, and presumption are of late, and at this
time increased and exercised; whereof the deplorable estate of the
Church and Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the distressed estate of the
Church and Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and the dangerous estate of the
Church and Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are present and publique testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112843:3"/>
We have now at last, (after other meanes of Supplication, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance,
Protestations, and Sufferings) for the preservation of our
selves and our Religion from utter ruine and destruction, according to
the commendable practice of these Kingdomes in former times, and
the example of Gods people in other Nations, after mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
resolved and determined to enter into a mutuall and solemn
League and covenant, wherein we all subscribe, and each one of us for
himself, with our hands lifted up to the most high God, doe swear:</p>
            <p>SEeing it hath pleased the composers of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to set it forth with an Introduction,
which containes that which (it seems) prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with them, and they expect should work
upon the three Kingdomes to take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Covenant; it will be behoofefull in the
first place to reduce the conscience to a cleare
and strict examination upon the contents of this Introduction;
and then if it shall find that all things therein be true, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sufficient to that end for which they were premised, (<hi>viz.</hi> to
inferre a necessity of swearing to all things contained in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Articles) the conscience will be directed to follow that
dictate: But if it fail in either of those, we must betake our selves
to other considerations to be guided by. We will therefore sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
propound the contents of the Preface, as neer as may be
according to its method, joyning together matters of the same
kind: And then we shall find the discourse of the Preface to be
resolved into these principles.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The glory of God, the advancement of the Kingdome of Iesus
Christ, the honour and happinesse of the King &amp;c. are to be aimed at
and endeavoured.</item>
               <item>2. Especially when they are endangered.</item>
               <item>3. The meanes therefore necessary towards those ends are to be used,
which are either Supplication, Remonstrance &amp;c. or making warre.</item>
               <item>4. The former are first to be used, but if they faile, then the latter.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These are the universall Maximes, whereon (by application to
the present condition) the taking of the Covenant is enforced:
The three first then being granted, they subsume, that having used
the former, and failing of successe, we are all necessitated to use
the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> To swear to joyn with the Scots in Armes, which is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112843:3"/>
the generall, and to those particulars after mentioned in the Articles.</p>
            <p>That such joyning in armes is the generall end of the Covenant,
will appeare by comparing the sixt Article of the Covenant for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
assistance and defence of one another, with the 14 Article of
the Instructions, wherein the imposers of this Oath appoint to be
read (publiquely at the time when the Covenant is read) the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> joyned in Armes
for the vindication, &amp;c. In which Declaration, the taking this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is made one of the grounds both of their confidence (as they
say) that this warre wherein they are so deeply engaged is of God,
and of their resolution (which they professe) with courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
unto the end to doe their part.</p>
            <p>Whosoever therefore is not perswaded in his conscience, either
that all these meanes mentioned, and all other such like have been
used, and have been rejected; or upon supposition that they had, yet
doubts of the consequence (viz. that such an Army may be leavied, and
such a warre managed) cannot without deadly sinne (though dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
from oaths for any of the following particulars) upon the
former principles take this Covenant. But not to insist hereon, we
will briefly run over the severall places of the Preface, and consider
the naturall intimations from them; onely supposing for example,
the end of this Covenant to be the assistance, or at least, consent in
this present joyning in armes, applying it to men of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I,</hi> A. B. <hi>living under the King.</hi>] This cannot reasonably be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to warre, but obedience to him; nor a motive to enter into a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
League, Oath and Covenant not prescribed by Law, without
him, much lesse against his expresse Proclamation; forasmuch as an
Oath for confirmation (either assertory or promissory) is to men
for <hi>an end of all strife:</hi> And a publique Oath propounded to a Nation
or Nations, is for the ending of publique strife and divisions: and of
any publique strife of a Nation or Nations, under one King (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called) <hi>the King is the supreame Iudge in all causes, as well
Ecclesiasticall as civill</hi> (as is evident by the Law of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. And
to us moreover by the Law of the Land, 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 12. by the doctrine

an Oath and Covenant may not be entered into without and against

kingdome of Iesus Christ.</hi>] Here the consideration of the mind requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
towards the judgement of conscience will be this; whether by
this warre, considered with its circumstances, <hi>the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. is
more apt to be advanced then by peace: wherein, although reason
might easily conclude, yet it will be much more certainly guided,
if we shal examine those precepts which Christ and his Apostles have
laid down, towards the accomplishment of those ends here proposed,
and try whether they doe suggest or intimate any thing towards such
a warre; If they doe not (or if the contrary) the conscience <hi>having
before its eyes the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. will not be induced to take this
course for the advancement of it. For the rectification of conscience
in this case, it will be requisite to consider this warre to which we
are enjoyned to contribute, by whom and against whom it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken:
Where, if the conscience finde it to be unlawfull in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
it cannot lawfully consent or assist, <hi>viz.</hi> If it be no waies
lawfull for such as we are moved to joyne with, to take up Armes
against such as we should be sworne to oppose; If it might possibly
be lawfull in the first undertaking, it could no otherwise be but as it
should be a necessary meanes to procure a just peace; and the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of conscience in this case will depend upon the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the conjunctures of things at the undertaking, and all the
time of the continuance of this warre: and if peace with truth might
have been, or may be established without it, (much more if this means
shall be found opposite) the conscience cannot without sin assent to
this warre: Here the mind is to examine the severall propositions,
motions, overtures, &amp;c. which have been and are made by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and according to them to judge.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>The happinesse and honour of the King and his Posterity.</hi>] Here we are
to consider, whether, or what this action of ours will contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the honour and happinesse of the King and his posterity. And
because it is not easie to discover any foundation of such <hi>honour and
happinesse</hi> &amp;c. besides, that the managers of this party with whom
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112843:4"/>
they would have us to joyne, have never particularly declared the
way how these ends shall be or are advanced by their warre (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is one of their most common expressions:) the safest way
(at least the most naturall) for the conscience is to raise a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of what is likely to ensue upon what hath preceded (since these
undertakings) upon the same Principles: where it is to consider,
whether his Honour or Contumely have beene increased by and
since these warres. And so for the happinesse of Himselfe and his
Posterity, consider whether if these men be upon the same designe
with those who gave him battell at <hi>Edge-Hill, Newbery &amp;c.</hi> what
those designes made towards the happinesse of him, and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>

the Scots (to whose assistance especially we are to be sworn) should
not hereby be able to conquer and prevail, what will our taking of
the Covenant advance the publike Liberty and Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
according to the conceit of the enjoyners of the Covenant?
If they should, consider how that can conduce to our <hi>Liberty,</hi> unlesse
thereby be meant freedom from our ancient Laws, and from the
setled happy government of Church and State, whilst we may fear
to be put under uncertain new ones? Secondly, <hi>Safety,</hi> whether the
danger of ruine doe not outweigh or equalize the hopes of safety.
Thirdly, <hi>Peace,</hi> whether this be the onely, the likeliest, or indeed
any probable meanes of procuring <hi>Peace?</hi> Seeing there are but two
wayes obvious by which this course should procure it, <hi>viz.</hi> Victory,
or reducing the King to yeeld to their desires. Here the judgement
of conscience will be grounded upon this, Whether the King be no
way but by force inclinable to a just <hi>Peace?</hi>

this may proceed as upon that, seeing they have not set downe

Apostles, and primitive Christians (who were assuredly Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
did hold and practice for doctrine and example in the like (if
there have ever been) or a worse case them is proved or pretended.
And if they have not resisted (or held it lawfull) their Princes in the
greatest persecutions and utmost danger of Religion, and all that
could be dear unto them, it may raise a conclusion, (till some stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
reasons can be presented, or the errour of these be cleared and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off) what is to be done when we are required to assist a warlike
entrance of Subjects (with all the other circumstances which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this action of the Scots) made onely upon a beleeved charity
of helping their neighbours.</p>
            <p>The summe of all is, That if all and every of the materials of this
Preface (in as much as concernes the Premisses) were true, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
cannot assent to the consequence, that it is lawfull for us
as Subjects of the Church <hi>England</hi> (though we had not sworn or
subscribed to some particulars, against which some of the Articles
are contrived) to assist the Scots, or consent to them in this warre,
which assistance is the generall end of this Covenant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is not any one member which doth conclude any
thing to our consciences to move us to take it, neither in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
doe they conclude.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is not any particular member of it which doth not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112843:7"/>
either directly, or by considerations naturally suggested by them
and altogether unforced, prevaile with us to the contrary. So that
till every one of these obstacles and scruples be taken off, we cannot
without violence to our consciences take this Oath:</p>
            <p>That we shall sincerely, really, and constantly, through the grace of
God,<note place="margin">Article 1.</note> endeavour in our severall places and callings, the preservation of the
Reformed Religion in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Doctrine, Worship, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
and Government, against our common Enemies; the Reformation
of Religion in the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
Discipline and Government; according to the Word of God, and the
Example of the best Reformed Churches: And shall endeavour to bring
the Churches of God in the three Kingdoms, to the neerest conjunction
and uniformity in Religion, Confession of Faith, Form of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Directory for Worship and Catechizing; That we and our
posterity after us may as brethren live in Faith and Love, and the Lord
may delight to dwell in the midst of us.</p>
            <p>In the first Article are we to be sworne <hi>to endeavour the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Doctrine, Worship, and Discipline of the Church of Scotland</hi>
absolutely, or with this added as a restriction, <hi>against our common
Enemies?</hi> By whom doe we not rightly conceive to be meant the
common Enemies to the Churches of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
That those words, [<hi>against our common enemies</hi>] are to be
taken restrictively it may be thought, because they otherwise should
have been vainly added; and that by <hi>common Enemies</hi> those are
meant, the necessity of the Grammaticall sense implies; there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
preceded no other division, to which this community can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
besides that of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Preface.
So that the word <hi>Our</hi> must referre to <hi>We</hi> in the beginning of the
Preface, whose onely distribution which can referre to <hi>common</hi> here,
is that of the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Is not
therefore the true sense of this part of the Article this, <hi>viz.</hi> I will
sincerely, really, constantly, through the grace of God, in my calling
against those who are enemies (for example) both to the Articles of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and those of <hi>Scotland,</hi> both to our Liturgy
and their directory for worship, both to our Church-Government
and to Presbyteriall Government, endeavour to preserve their Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
manner of worship and Presbytery? If thus it be, these things
are to be considered; If the imposers of this Oath are assured in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112843:7"/>
their Conscience, that the <hi>Doctrine, Worship &amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Church of
Scotland,</hi> can infallibly be proved out of the Word of God, why
would they have us sweare to endeavour (in our calling of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery)
to preserve it with a restriction against some men onely, and
not absolutely and indefinitely? Whether is this so free from the
scandall of respect of Persons, as an oath for the impartiall defence
of Truth doth require? If they doubt it cannot be infallibly proved,
how can our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without spirituall Tyranny, desire
an Oath to be imposed upon us Ministers of the Gospell of another
Church, <hi>to endeavour sincerely, really &amp;c. in our calling</hi> (viz. by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
disputing, or otherwise) the preservation of it thus far?</p>
            <p>Secondly, how can we take an Oath to endeavour the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Doctrine which we neither know what it is (as it now
stands) nor are told in any Declaration or Exhortation to us? nor
were bound to know or search (no opportunity offering it self?)
How then can this Oath be by us taken in judgement? Or since we
doubt thus, though in generall, how can it (not being of Faith) be
other then Sinne? Whether are we not, if any thing shall be by us
hereafter found in the Doctrine of <hi>Scotland</hi> contrary to sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
bound to endeavour by the second Article to extirpate it, and
by the first to preserve it? As for their Discipline and Government, so
much as we understand of it (though otherwise we never interposed,
yet being now called to give our consent to it, or reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
we professe it to be such as that we dare not binde our selves by
Oath to endeavour its preservation constantly and indefinitely, for all
time to come, till it be evidenced unto us that it hath been in any
time before untill this our last age. If it shall here be replyed, that we
are required <hi>to endeavour the preservation of their Doctrine, Worship,
Discipline and Government,</hi> onely <hi>against our common enemies,</hi> that
is, of us of the Churches of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and so
the preservation of it onely so farre as we all agree; this we cannot
conceive to be the adequate sense of those words, especially accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the intention of the imposers. For it is clear (as we have
already touched) that our common Enemies are not onely they
who are adversaries to us in that wherein we all three doe agree, but
those also who in such things wherein we differ amongst our selves,
are yet by opposing themselves to us all, our common Enemies; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom therefore by this Oath we should be bound to preserve
to each that also wherein we differ amongst our selves. Moreover,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112843:8"/>
that that Sense is neither the onely, nor the chief Sense intended by
the Imposers, we have cause to think: because if so restrained, our
Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> (in favour of whom we conceive this part of
the Article to have been proposed) would be no whit secured against
the fears of innovations from <hi>England,</hi> if we were onely sworn to
preserve unto them those things wherein we all agree at the entring
this present League and Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we desire to know why our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> should
desire it to be imposed upon us by Oath to maintain the Articles of
their Religion, so far forth as hath been said, since our Mother the
Church of <hi>England</hi> never yet hath imposed upon us by Oath to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
her own known Articles, but hath testified her moderation
to all, in that she hath required subscription onely of all men which
were admitted into holy Orders, or Ecclesiasticall Benefice, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in the University? And yet this was lately judged, since the sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this Parliament, to be too harsh an imposition upon young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Students at their admission to degrees, and the urging of it sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.
And we know not whether ever it was in use before this age,
even in any not corrupted Church, to command men to swear the
maintaining the Articles of their Religion, much lesse their Discipline
and Church government.</p>
            <p>As to the second thing in this first Article to which we are to
swear, How can any who are perswaded that there is nothing in the
Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is not consonant to
the Word of God, without vanity swear to endeavour the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it according to the VVord of God? especially since we have
lately protested to defend that <hi>Doctrine of the Church of England?</hi>
And how can any who reverently beleeve this Church to be in respect
of her Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government established by
Law, no lesse perfect then any of the Reformed Churches, swear to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
its reformation in all those, according to the example of the
best reformed Churches? And here by the way we cannot but take
notice that this part of the Article is so framed, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the <hi>Doctrine &amp;c. of the Churches of England and Ireland</hi> to
be preserved, and nothing in theirs of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be reformed.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the best direction for Conscience in examining what is
here meant by Reformation, will be to consider those instances
wherein in the following Articles is declared the Reformation, and
then if perswaded that there is any thing there exprest (as instances
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:112843:8"/>
of reformation) which is not according to (much more if against) the
Word of God, how can we take this part of the Oath, at least in the
sense of the Imposers?</p>
            <p>As touching the third thing, <hi>an endeavour of Uniformity &amp;c.</hi> the
considerations for direction of conscience will be the same with the
second: For we are required to swear <hi>to endeavour an uniformity,</hi>
and that in the reformation before mentioned, and after that refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
so that in whatsoever sense or kind the reformation by
them mentioned, and after described, is not to be undertaken, in the
same our endeavour for uniformity is not lawfull.</p>
            <p>Lastly, in the taking of this first Article, we should (as we conceive)
make our selves guilty either of rash swearing, or of perjury; and
that from the necessary consequence of the complication of these
two clauses, wherein first we should swear to preserve <hi>the reformed
Religion in the Church of Scotland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and
Government against our common enemies.</hi> And secondly, <hi>to bring the
Churches of the three Kingdoms, to the neerest conjunction and uniformity</hi>
in those particulars among ourselves: If we endeavour in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
(but by prayer) to alter any thing in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
wherein our enemies are theirs also (though therein we differ amongst
our selves) we commit perjury, because we swear to preserve it. To
effect therefore the neerest uniformity in those particulars in the three
Kingdoms, we are sworn to endeavour to bring the other two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
to the neerest conformity to the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now
how can we swear to regulate by a rule, and to reform by a form,
which we fully know not, (and much lesse know to be a fit rule or
form) without rash swearing? sure we are, we cannot swear it in
judgement, and for ought we know, not in righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>That we shall in like manner, without respect of persons,<note place="margin">Article 2.</note> endeavour the
extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, (that is, Church-government by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,
Bishops, their Chancellours and Commissaries, Deans, Deans
and Chapters, Arch-deacons, and all other Ecclesiasticall Officers depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on that Hierarchy) Superstition, Heresie, Schisme, Prophanenesse,
and whatsoever shall be found to be contrary to sound Doctrine, and the
power of Godlinesse; lest we partake in other men sins, and thereby be in
danger to receive of their plagues, and that the Lord may be one, and his
Name one in the three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>How can we swear to this part of the Covenant, who doe believe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112843:9"/>
that to endeavour the extirpation of Church-government by Bishops
is an act utterly unlawfull for all severall places and callings (and
especially ours) by the Law of God and this Land, and to swear it
much more sinfull. And are we not here bidden to covenant and
swear to <hi>endeavour the extirpation of Church-government by Bishops?</hi>
To us either the words are ambiguous, (and to ambiguities we may
not swear) or rather (for we are loath to charge the words with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie)
the Grammatical sense (according to which the Oath is to
be taken) speaks so: for as to what we hear by some said, that onely
our Church-government <hi>in aggregato,</hi> by all those Governours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a collective sense taken formally, is to be endeavoured to be
extirpated, and not each there mentioned: first, Such interpretation
given out is private onely, and not by the authority of the imposers;
and secondly, those words [<hi>and all other, &amp;c.</hi>] do manifest that all the
formerly mentioned particulars (in the parenthesis) are to be constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
distributively, so farre forth as to the extirpation of them. To omit
that the word <hi>Prelacy</hi> there interpreted more properly agreeth to
<hi>Arch-bishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> then to the rest there mentioned, and a
Prelacy they would be without them, because preferred before Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters:
and if it no more were meant to ejure Bishops then Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or Deacons, since as well Presbyters and Deacons make up
part of our Church-government, as it now stands <hi>in aggregate,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might this Oath be taken, had they also been included? Lastly,
is not their practise for whose satisfaction this Covenant should be
taken<note n="a" place="margin">Intelligentia verborum ex causis est assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menda dicendi, H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</note> (added to the common sense of mankind in the like manner
of speaking or understanding such speeches) evidence enough
to us that we cannot take this Oath and Covenant, unlesse we will
swear to endeavour the extirpation of Church-government by
Bishops.</p>
            <p>If this be so, we desire to know, first, whether it be lawfull for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to swear such a Covenant as directly contradicts the oath of
their Soveraigne at his Coronation, as this second branch of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
doth, binding us to endeavour the extirpation of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Church by Bishops? For that our Soveraign hath taken
as contradictory Oath is evidently manifest by the last clause of the
oath which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> take at their Coronation: when after
many other gracious promises w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the King makes to his people, one
of the Bishops reading to the King before the people concerning the
Canonicall priviledges of the Church, and beseeching him that he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:112843:9"/>
would be the Protectour and Defender of the Bishops &amp; the Churches
under their government, the King answereth in these words [<hi>With
a willing and devout heart I promise and grant my pardon, and that I will
preserve and maintain to you and the Churches committed to your charge,
all canonicall priviledges, and due Law and Iustice, and that I will be your
Pretectour and Defender, to my power, by the assistance of God, as every
good King in his Kingdom in right ought to protect and defend the Bishops,
and Churches under their government.</hi>] Then the King ariseth, and at
the Communion Table makes a solemn Oath in the presence of the
people, to observe the premisses, and laying his hand upon the book
saith [<hi>The things which I have before promised, I shall perform and keep,
so help me God, and the contents of this Book.</hi>] How can this Oath
then for the <hi>extirpation of Church-government by Bishops</hi> be consistent
with the Oath or Honour of our Soveraign, which we have so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
protested to defend in the late Protestation? How can we
with a solemn Oath enter into such a Covenant to which we may
neither swear without our Soveraigns consent, nor yet can lawfully
desire nor have his consent? How sad were our condition, were the
King willing of himselfe to violate this Oath? But what should we
have to answer, should we by taking such a Covenant, this way neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate
(so far as in us lies) His sacred Majesty to violate his Oath so
solemnly sworn at his Inauguration?</p>
            <p>Secondly, that <hi>to endeavour the extirpation of Church-government
by Bishops,</hi> is a sin against Divine Law, all those Arguments and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
convince, which prove that Bishops are of Apostolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and unalterable, and consequently Divine; which we shall
unfold in these Propositions: First, that their institution stands
grounded upon our Saviours own Action and Institution of the
Apostles. Secondly, that Christ and his holy Spirit, by his
Apostles appointed Bishops. Thirdly, that Christ the Sonne of
God, and the Holy Ghost afterward confirmed and approved
Bishops, and their Commission and power which the Apostles had
appointed.</p>
            <p>For the first, we say their institution is grounded upon our Lords
own instituting and ordaining twelve Apostles, above seventy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
who saith to these his Apostles, <hi>As my Father hath sent me,
even so send I you.</hi>

Episcopall, (as it is now taken in this dispute) which we shall prove

after the Apostles, was undeniably in the Apostles, and for a while

Churches; such as was <hi>Polycarp,</hi> the <hi>Angell,</hi> the Bishop <hi>of the Church
of Smyrna,</hi> made Bishop of that place by the Apostles themselves
thirteen yeers before this book of the Revelation of St. <hi>John</hi> was
written: and <hi>Onesimus</hi> probably the then Bishop, <hi>the Angell of the
Church of Ephesus.</hi> Their Office, Power, and Commission are there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
to have been Episcopall, and charged upon them by Christ,
in that five of the Angels are charged as blameable, and accomptable
for the faults of both Presbyters and people; and therefore surely
were trusted with authority over Presbyters and people, to have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
and censured them. Particularly, Episcopall power is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
there, chap. 2. of the <hi>Revel. vers.</hi> 20. and that power of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
is sufficiently grounded on the 14 verse, Mr. <hi>Perkins in locum,</hi>
affirmeth. Their mission to that office also, as it is there confirmed by
the Sonne of God, and by the holy Spirit: So also, to have been at
first from God is in their title implied: For Angels sent forth for the
Churches sake are never said in holy Scripture to be any's Messengers
but Gods; and if his Messengers or Angels, then sent by him. That
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112843:11"/>
their superiority was fixed, not weekly, or annuall, is clear, as from
the Ecclesiasticall History of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and <hi>Onesimus,</hi> so also from
the Text it self, c. 2. 10. Where the <hi>Angell of the Church of Smyrna,</hi>
as Angell of the Church, is bidden <hi>to be faithfull</hi> (in his Office surely)
<hi>untill death</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 1b: v: 26:</note>. Nor was it personall onely but describing the Office
of the Angell of any Church (in like laudable or blame-worthy state)
unto the comming of Christ (as it is implied v. 24. &amp; 25. of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
chapter.) For what is said to them, so long as there is any that
<hi>hath an eare to hear,</hi> he must hear, c. 2. v. 3. Nor did the personall
blameworthy carriage of the <hi>Angell of the Church of Sardis,</hi> c. 3. v. 1,
&amp;c. or of <hi>the Angell of the Church of the Laodiceans,</hi> v. 14. 16. hinder
Christs approbation of their Office, who are in regard of their Office
(not of their personall Excellency) stiled <hi>the Angels of the seven
Churches, and the Stars in the right hand of the Son of man:</hi> both
which stiles that they are there singularly appropriated to these suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
of the Apostles, ought not to seem strange, since the twelve
Apostles are confessedly meant by <hi>the crown of twelve Stars,</hi> Apoc.
12. 1. And St <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle of us Gentiles, speaks of himself <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as an Angell of God, Galat.</hi> 4. 14. Summarily therefore out of
holy Scriptures thus we reason, Many Presbyters and Preachers in
one Church, and one chief, having eminency and power over all
Presbyters and people therein, proveth the Office of a Bishop; but so
holy Scripture witnesseth were in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> many Presbyters, Act. 20.
17. (or if they were Bishops in the sense now disputed, some of them
at least, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thought, l. 3. c. 14. we need go no further in the
argument) and more afterwards surely, and yet one chiefe Pastor or
Bishop over all, such as was <hi>Timothy</hi> in his time, and the Angel of
that Church (whosoever he was) mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1. So also in the
<hi>Church of Pergamus,</hi> there were divers Teachers, true and false, c. 2.
v. 13, 15. one Angel Governour in chief, v. 1. For be it that all the
Presbyters of each of the Churches might well have been called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<note n="c" place="margin">Iob 33. 23. &amp; Malach. 2. 7.</note>, yet that one among them (in each Church) in such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
community of name is so called by way of eminency, proves
an eminency in the one so called: which must either be of personall
excellency above all the rest (and this who can shew us in <hi>the Angel of
the Church of Sardis, Laodicea,</hi> or <hi>Thyatira?</hi>) or else (and rather) of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and power, so as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was called <hi>an Angel, Malac:</hi> 3. who
was <hi>more then a Prophet;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul received as an Angell, Gal.</hi> 4.
14. who was more then a Minister, and our Saviour Christ is called

               <hi>Michael,</hi> Apoc. 12. 7. <hi>with his Angels</hi> fighting under him. One ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
more we shall take notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> the pretended necessity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
by each of the <hi>Angels</hi> there a collective body, from c. 2.
v. 10. &amp; 24. But this is manifestly clear to be no necessity at all from
the like manner of speaking of the holy Ghost 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 1. &amp; to
the 5. Compare and judge. And therefore it is not lawfull without
any necessary reason, to depart from the literall and determinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation
of one chief spirituall Church-governour, in each of the
seven Churches: for otherwise, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks <hi>lib. de carne
Christi, cap. 13. Omnia periclitabuntur alitèr accipi quàm sunt, &amp; amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere
quod sunt, dum alitèr accipiuntur.</hi> Yea there is not onely no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
but much in the Text which doth resist such an interpretation of
a collective body: for it should be either an Angel put for the whole
particular Church; and this cannot be, seeing the Angels and the
Churches are accurately distinguished c. 1. v. 20. Or an Angel put
for the whole collection of the Presbyters; but neither may this be
admitted, inasmuch as in the same 20 verse the <hi>Angels</hi> are called
<gap reason="foreign">

as <hi>Suidas</hi> distinguisheth the words. You have our reasons from
these Scriptures, why to us it seems that to swear to endeavour the
extirpation of Church-government by Bishops is to swear to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the extirpation of that whose Root is in holy Scripture; and
to swear to endeavour (which we tremble to think of) to wrest these
Stars out of the right hand of the Sonne of man, who is also the
Son of God. For <hi>in his right hand are they held, the Angels of the
Churches, Revel.</hi> 1. 16, 20.</p>
            <p>As Church-government by Bishops hath been evidenced by holy

be acknowledged of institution Apostolicall, and approved by God
but temporary onely, the contrary will be made manifest, as from
the proper light of the Texts alledged, and from the forecited Text,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 14. So also from this Proposition which we avow: No
Constitution Apostolicall received by the universall Church perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in all ages, unto this age of this controversie, can without
scandall and dangerous consequence be called Temporary; the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112843:12"/>
an Apostolicall Institution, being a most sure Commentary
that it was no temporary institution. Forasmuch as we are taught
by the holy Ghost in divine Scripture, that contention in what the
Law of God is pretended not to be expresse, may be warrantably ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off by <hi>the custome of the Churches of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 16. See

<hi>the houshold of Stephanus,</hi> and of <hi>the keeper of the prison, 1 Cor. 1. Acts</hi> 16.

118. 24. or of any other Scriptures to be a divine warrant for the
translation of our one day in seven from the seventh day of the week
to the first? Or on the other side, how shall we convince those of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that that Apostolicall divine Precept, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.14.
<hi>as to the anointing the sick with oil</hi> was a temporary Precept onely, but

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112843:13"/>
thorow all the ten persecutions, and descending in each

27 Bishops from S. <hi>Timothy</hi> to the time of the Chalcedon Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
as was declared there, <hi>act.</hi> 11. that in all times, primitive and
following, Bishops have been chief in Ecclesiasticall government,
in Councels, in Martyrdom, in Piety, in Learning, in the conversion
of Nations, in the mighty confounding of Heresies and Heretiques;
we beleeve we are able (if any deny) to make good. And first here

            <p>This order of Bishops which began (though the first we read of
in Scripture be <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>) in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or
Saint <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> continued thorowout all the following
ages of the Churches of God, in which Bishops have been the most
reverend Martyrs, such as <hi>Ignatius, Polycarp. Irenaeus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Cyprian</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and more then 30. of the first Bishops of
<hi>Rome</hi> successively both in Episcopacy and Martyrdom. Of Bishops
also especially did consist the first four generall Councels, received
by all the reformed Churches, the confounders of the maine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
touching the second and third persons in the blessed Trinity;
and by an Act of Parliament, 1. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 10. next to the canonicall
Scriptures, made the rule of judging Heresies: who also in Councell
gave judgement for the inviolable practice of the Church in this
order: the generall Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> providing, <hi>Ne in unâ civitate
duo sint Episcopi, Cant.</hi> 8. The generall Councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:112843:14"/>

               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>For as much then, as in the first Article we are required to swear to
endeavour the reformation of Religion according to the Word of
God, and the examples of the best reformed Churches, surely we may
not in the second Article swear to endeavour the extirpation of
Church-government by <hi>Bishops,</hi> and so to forsake the government
grounded on the Word of God, and to forsake the example of all the
ages of the Primitive Churches, then which we conceive no late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Church will pretend to be more pure, and to whose examples
they do or ought to endeavour to reform themselves.</p>
            <p>But after all this, it will be said, that this government by Bishops
is ejured onely, as it interprets <hi>Prelacy,</hi> which word if it have been
translated <hi>Regimen Tyranicum,</hi> the Translation as farre exceeds the
truth of Grammar, as the Prelates are accused to have exceeded their
lawfull power; forasmuch as Prelacy in its originall, and acception
of ancient Authors (<hi>Praelati</hi> we say, not <hi>elati</hi>) imports but lawfull
preeminence and power. So is <hi>Timothy</hi> called by <hi>Gregory de Cura
pastor: p.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>Praelatus Gregi;</hi> and the word Prelate is often ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
mentioned in our Lawes, 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. &amp; 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and is no
more then the Title <hi>Praepositi</hi> mentioned also with honour by St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
Epist. 10. &amp; 55. &amp; 65. <hi>Augustin. de civitate Dei,</hi> l. 20. c. 9. or
<hi>Antistites,</hi> S. <hi>Cypr. ep.</hi> 69. &amp; <hi>Sancti Antistites, S. August. ep.</hi> 162. and
divers words in Scripture used, signifying equivalently such preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
but let it not be told indeed in other Churches, that any other
is here abjured then <hi>Regimen Tyrannicum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But are we warranted by the following stile of Hierarchy? Doth
that word import originally and anciently any other then a sacred
government? was it not accepted and approved in it selfe by Mr.
<hi>Calvin. lib. de necessitate Eccl. reformandae, Talem si nobis Hierarchiam
exhibeant in quâ sic emineant Episcopi, ut Christo subesse non recusent,
&amp;c. ut ab illo tanquam uno Capite pendeant, &amp; ad ipsum referantur, &amp;c.
tum verò nullo non anathemate dignos fateor, qui non eam reverentèr
summâque obedientiâ observent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, how can we in the same Article abjure Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:112843:14"/>
by Bishops, with Heresie, Schisme, and Prophanenesse, (as there
it follows) yea Prelacy even before Schisme and Heresie, &amp;c. when
as Bishops have been in all ages the chief confounders of heresie and
heretickes, such was <hi>Athanasius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> of the heresie
of <hi>Arrius. Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> of the <hi>Nestorian</hi> heresie. <hi>Caelestine</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome, Augustine</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hippo, Prosper</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,
Fulgentius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ruspi,</hi> of the <hi>Palagian</hi> heresie: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more in all ages of the Church before and since. Nor was there
found any one Christian, thorowout all the Primitive and purest
times of the Church, for above five hundred yeers after Christ, who
thought it fit to abolish Church government by Bishops (much lesse
to ej<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re it) save onely one heretick, <hi>Aerius,</hi> so censured by <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
Haeres.</hi> 75. and by Saint <hi>Augustine, Haeres.</hi> 53. <hi>whose speech sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
of madnesse,</hi> saith <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> for he had said, <hi>What is a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
differing from a Presbyter?</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Et infra <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and the occasion of it Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
lets us know, <hi>lib. de Haeres. c. in Aerium; Aerius</hi> being a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
is said to have been vexed, because he could not get to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
a Bishop, and thence arose his envy: <hi>Epiphanius</hi> witnesseth as
much, <hi>Haeres.</hi> 75.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as to Schism, Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> the one and onely Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
as denying the divine Institution of Bishops, yet held them
necessary to represse Schism, and then surely most necessary, when
Schism doth, as in these our dayes, most abound: For avoiding of
Schism, Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> witnesseth, Episcopacy was thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long within the Apostles times, even as early as it was said by
some, <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Apollo &amp;c.</hi> and therefore saith in his
Dialogue, <hi>Adversus Luciferian. Ecclesiae salus in summi Sacerdotis dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate
pendet, cui si non exors quaedam, &amp; ab omnibus eminens detur pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stas,

<hi>Epist.</hi> 55. <hi>Non aliunde haereses obortae sunt, aut nata sunt schismata,

obortae sunt &amp; oriuntur, nisi dum Episcopus qui unus est praesumptione
contemnitur? &amp;c.</hi> Master <hi>Calvin</hi> also himself upon <hi>Philipp.</hi> 1. 1.
<hi>Fateor quidem ut sunt hominum ingenia &amp; mores, non posse ordinem stare
inter verbi Ministros, quin reliquis praesit unus.</hi> So that we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the abjuration of Episcopacy to be a meane to that unity
in this Article mentioned, <hi>That the Lord may be one, and his Name
one amongst us,</hi> but rather the continuation thereof, according to the
counsell of the holy Martyr S. <hi>Cyprian, Unus Deus, unus Dominus, unus
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112843:15"/>
Episcopus;</hi> and that of <hi>Ignatius ad magnes.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Subjecti estote Episcope

            </p>
            <p>Next, <hi>Prophanenesse</hi> is here also to be cast out with Episcopacy;
yet who may not fear Gods Judgements, if he deny the detestable
growth of prophanenesse since the contempt of that Apostolicall
institution of Episcopacy? So that this Article as to Bishops extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we must refuse, upon that close upon which others take it,
<hi>lest,</hi> as it is said, <hi>we should partake in others sin, and consequently in
their plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, because neither can we swear to endeavour the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of that part of this Church-government by Archbishops, an
Ecclesiasticall constitution, so confessedly ancient; nor that part of
this Church-government by Deanes and Chapters, that is, a soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of grave Divines, of Presbyters joyned to the Bishop in his see
of residence, as assistants in Councell and Government: as <hi>James</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had his resident Presbyters, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 18.
and consulted with them, <hi>vers.</hi> 20. According also to the ancient
generall and continued custom of the Church of God ever since the
first Christian Emperours time; and moreover endowed with means
given to them by the last Wils and Testaments of many (which it is
not lawfull for us to endeavour to annull, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 17.) and by the
gifts of many other Donors, who had true propriety in their goods,
and might and did transfer the undoubted property to those to be
enjoyed by the right and liberty of the Subject; especially such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
having been consecrated and devoted unto God for pious
uses, and which may not therefore by us (as we conceive) be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to be alienated, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 25. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 38. And as to
the exercises of piety, so also to the encouragement of the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
part of learning, the study of divinity and of holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>We shall with the same sincerity,<note place="margin">Article 3.</note> reality and constancy, in our severall
Vocations, endeavour with our estates and lives, mutually to preserve the
Rights and Priviledges of the Parliaments, and the Liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and to preserve and defend the Kings Majesties Person and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
in the preservation and defence of the true Religion, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Kingdoms, that the world may beare witnesse with our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of our loyalty, and that we have no thoughts or intentions to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
His Majesties just power and greatnesse.</p>
            <p>Because in the third Article, whereas we are required, and that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112843:15"/>
in the first place to binde our selves absolutely without limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
expressed, <hi>To preserve the Rights and Priviledges of Parliaments,
and the Liberties of the Kingdoms;</hi> and were likewise tied sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and indefinitely to defend the Kings Person, State, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
by the Oath of Allegiance and the late Protestation; here
when we are bidden to swear to defend his Majesties Person and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
it is added [<hi>In the preservation and defence of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Liberties of the Kingdoms</hi>] therefore this manner of swearing
we dare not admit, till it be publikely declared by the Imposers,
that the meaning of those words is not (as to some it may sound)
that I binde my selfe to preserve and defend his Majesties Person and
Authority <hi>so farre forth</hi> as he shall preserve and defend true Religion
and the Liberties of the Kingdoms: Since by the holy Scriptures of
the old and new Testament, by the Law of Nature and Nations, by
the Oath of God, and by true Religion, we are bound to endeavour
the preservation and defence of his Person and Authority, though
he were a persecutor of the true Religion, and an abridger of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
such as were <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> in their times. And surely a
larger Declaration of our endeavours simply to defend his Person, is
at this time necessary, when through the divisions of the Kingdom
his sacred Majestie is so endangered; and that his Majesty hath often
complained of affronts offered to his person; and hath complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also, that some have endeavoured to kill his Person in two set
battails; and that there is nothing more frequent in the minds and
mouths of some <hi>Shimei's,</hi> then that <hi>the King is popishly affected. A
Papist in his heart;</hi> and therefore some furious Zelot may not onely
upon these surmises conclude himselfe exempted (in case) from the
duty of preservation and defence of his Royall Person, but also mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it as a debt to this Covenant, even to offer violence to his sacred
Majestie. May not therefore some such fuller Declaration and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of our duty (when we will by Oath professe it) seem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the end here proposed, <hi>That the world may bear witnesse
with our Consciences of our loyalty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall also with all faithfulnesse endeavour the discovery of all such as
have been,<note place="margin">Article 4.</note> or shall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or evill Instruments, by
hindring the reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his people,
or one of the Kingdoms from another, or making any Faction or parties
amongst the people, contrary to this League and Covenant, that they may

be brought to publike triall, and receive condign punishment, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of their offences shall require or deserve, or the supream Indicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of both Kingdoms respectively, or others having power from them for
that effect, shall judge convenient.</p>
            <p>Whether are not all those to be accounted to us as <hi>Malignants,
&amp;c. by hindring reformation of Religion</hi> (and consequently <hi>to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
that they may receive condign punishment</hi>) whom we know
to endeavour in their places and callings, the continuation of
Church-government by Bishops, and the preservation of the whole
frame of government (as it now stands by the known Laws of this
Kingdom established) administred according to the right intent of
those Laws against all alteration, till it be by act of Parliament (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by his Majesties personall consent, and both Houses) altered
and changed?</p>
            <p>Secondly, we demand how far forth we are here to be sworn <hi>to
endeavour the discovery of all that have been or shall be Malignants &amp;c.</hi>
Is the son hereby ingaged to betray his father, the wife her husband,
the servant his master? and to accuse them <hi>as Malignants and evill
Instruments by hindring the reformation?</hi> If so; hath the Law of God,
of Nature, or of the Land ever commanded it; except in the case of
high Treason? Where God enjoyned to the Jews the discovery of
those who should entice them to serve other gods (a sin surely as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
and hainous, as to be such as here are to be accounted <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
&amp;c. by hindring the reformation of Religion</hi>) thus we read, <hi>Deut.</hi>
13. 6. <hi>If thy brother the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter,
or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend which is as thine own soul, entice
thee, &amp;c. thou shalt not conceal him, but thy hand shall be first upon him
to put him to death:</hi> where it may be observed, That all the persons
there by God so particularly recounted in the Text, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
they are onely such as are in a collaterall equall degree, as
the brother not to conceal his brother, the friend his friend; or of
some inferiority, as the husband his wife, the father his son: But there
is expressed no such injunction, That the son was to reveal his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or the wife her husband: so tender was the God of nature of
the respects due to those by whom he hath bestowed upon us our
Being, Life, and Livelihood, or whom he hath made a head to others;
that he did not command inferiours should give in an accusation
against such their superiours, even in crimes which the Law judged
should be punished with death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:112843:16"/>Thirdly, whereas we have in the late Protestation vowed <hi>to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the liberty of the Subject,</hi> and also are required to bind our selves
in this Covenant to preserve the same (if the liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
include the liberty of the subject.) Yet contrary hereunto (as
we conceive) we should bind our selves to endeavour that our fellow-subjects
may be brought <hi>to punishment, either such as their offence shall
deserve, or such</hi> as not onely <hi>the supream Indicatories of both Kingdoms,
but any other also having power from them for that effect, shall judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;</hi>
by which we should endeavour to put power (arbitrary
surely, since it is not restrained according to the Lawes of our Land)
in some other then the supream judicatory, <hi>viz.</hi> some deputed from
them, who may judge it covenient (if what they shall judge conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
may be their rule) as well sometimes to exceed the Letter of the
Law, made by the supream Judicatory, as otherwhile to mitigate it:
Yea who may proceed against such Malignants where the Laws are
wholy silent, and neither have given name to their fault, nor prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
any punishment?</p>
            <p>And whereas the happinesse of a blessed peace between these Kingdoms,
denied in former times to our progenitors,<note place="margin">Article 5.</note> is by the good providence of
God granted unto us, and hath been lately concluded, and setled by both
Parliaments, we shall each one of us, according to our place and interest
endeavour that they may remain conjoyned in a firm peace and union to
all posterity; and that justice may be done upon the wilfull opposers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in manner expressed in the precedent Articles.</p>
            <p>Concerning the happy <hi>peace between these Kingdoms lately conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
we earnestly prayed and desired that it might have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
and pray that it may be renewed; and are sorry heartily, that
contrary to the Pacification made by His Majesty and both Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and contrary to the solemn Faith given, there is at this time a
miserable War begun again between an Army of that Kingdom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
ours, (without and against his Majesties consent and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and the Forces raised by His Majesty, who (we have heard)
hath much deprecated their entring in, alledging vehemently that
their late solemn Faith and Pacification: So that shall it not be in
us also <hi>Protestatis contraria facto,</hi> to bind our selves in this Article (as
willingly we would) to endeavour the continuance of a <hi>firm peace
and union,</hi> and in the next to assist and defend those who declare,
that in pursuit of this Covenant they now enter into this Kingdom
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112843:17"/>
with an Army? which if we look to the late Act of Pacification, and
may for our selves judge and discern what it is, since we are required
to swear thereto, appears in its self an action as contrary thereto as
War to Peace. So that this Covenant would bindus to endeavour that
which it makes us to abjure.</p>
            <p>We shall also according to our places and callings in this common cause
of Religion,<note place="margin">Article 6.</note> Liberty, and peace of the Kingdoms, assist and defend all those
that enter into this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing
thereof, and shall not suffer our selves directly or indirectly by whatsoever
combination, perswasion, or terrour to be divided and withdrawn from this
blessed union and conjunction, whether to make defection to the contrary
part, or to give our selves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in this
cause, which so much concerneth the glory of God, the good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and the honour of the King; but shall all the daies of our lives zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
and constantly continue therein, against all opposition, and promote
the same according to our power, against all lets and impediments whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
and what we are not able our selves to suppresse or overcome, we shall
reveal and make known, that it may be timely prevented or removed; All
which we shall do as in the sight of God.</p>
            <p>Whereas we are in the sixt Article required to Covenant <hi>in this
common cause of Religion</hi> (which is described in the first Article, <hi>A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion in England and Ireland) that we wil assist and defend
all those that enter into this League and Covenant against all opposition,</hi>
and that in the close it is implied, that we should endeavour to do
what we are able to <hi>suppresse</hi> and <hi>overcome</hi> whatsoever <hi>opposition;</hi> we
conceive it to be against the whole current of the Gospell of <hi>Christ,</hi>
the practise and Doctrine of all Primitive Christians, whom the world
hath ever esteemed for blessed Saints and Martyrs, and lastly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Doctrine of the best reformed Churches, (to which we
here should swear to conform our selves) to endeavour a Reformation
of religion by force of Arms against the supream Magistrat's consent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, May we swear never to <hi>suffer our selves to be withdrawn
by whatsoever perswasion</hi> from this League and Covenant, since the
reasons perswading us to it are in no wise Demonstrative? What if
hereafter we shall see better reasons, and stronger motives to forsake
it, then we have now to take it, or shall have then to keep it? will
not then our consciences better informed force us to break our Oath
(an Argument that we sinn'd in taking it) or our Oath bind us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112843:17"/>
to our consciences so informed, (which is impossible?) What
if (as now the King, so) future Parliaments disallow this Covenant,
and oppose it, shall we then be obliged to continue therein, and to
assist and defend all those that so <hi>continue against all opposition,</hi> though
it shall be contradicted by the same Authority by which it is now
imposed upon us?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Where we are required to bind our selves never <hi>to make
defection to the contrary part;</hi> whether by the contrary part is not
to be understood all that are against this Covenant? If so, will not
these words following, [<hi>Against all opposition, against all lets and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
whatsoever</hi>] include His Majesties opposition? And then, as
we have said, we are in the close impliedly supposed, That we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to do what we are able to suppresse and overcome any part
whatsoever of the contrary part opposing it self; which since it seems
not to except His Sacred Majesty, how will this be consistent with
the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and the Laws of the Land,
5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3? Secondly, how with the Word of God, when
we are taught by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>That whosoever shall resist the
higher Powers, shall receive to himself Damnation?</hi> and in case of
contrary conflicts of these higher Powers among themselves, from
the reason included in the object, the damnation will be (without
repentance) to those that resist the Highest: and among the higher
powers, (if St. <hi>Peter</hi> may interpret St. <hi>Paul) the King is Supream,</hi> and
all other <hi>Governours</hi> are <hi>sent by Him, 1 Pet. 2. 14.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, were there nothing in the Law of God, or of this Land
forbidding us of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to enter a Covenant of
mutuall assistance and defence, without and against the allowance of
the King, yet it would be unlawfull for us to joyn in this Covenant,
since we are required here not onely to joyn with one another, but
with the Scots also in a Covenant of mutuall assistance and defence;
to whom, if by a law of their Land all such Covenants and Leagues
be forbidden as seditious, we, if we knowingly covenant to assist and
defend them in such a League, contract to our selves the guilt of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Now to the Scots (in the second part of that Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112843:18"/>
holden at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> anno 1585.) are forbidden <hi>all leagues or
bonds of mutuall defence which are made without the privity and consent
of the King, under the pain to be holden and execute as movers of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and unquietnesse.</hi> This we read objected by the Divines of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi>
but could never yet see any satisfying answer made thereunto.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Whether will not men think themselves bound by this part
of the Covenant, all the daies of their lives to continue so farre zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
united against the contrary part, as to reject all overtures of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodation,
and reconciliation; till they be <hi>suppressed or overcome,</hi>
and so our wounds become incurcable?</p>
            <p>Sixtly, This Covenant (as we conceive, under correction) cannot
be wisely taken by any man affected to this cause; for should they
not here swear never to yeeld themselves, though debelled, and unable
to withstand the common Enemy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Forces raised by the King?
nor ever to lay down Arms, or cease active resistance? But if it should
please God to give the foresaid contrary part power of conquest, and
consequently <hi>Ius victorie,</hi> should they not bind themselves by this
Covenant never to submit themselves to Gods Will and Judgement
against them? and so exclude all Christian patience and suffering in
afflictions, and tie themselves (though unable) actively to resist, plot,
disturb and overthrow all such who shall so have power over them
hereafter, all such Governours and governments, which it may please
God (as they must confesse for a punishment of their sins at least) to
place over them, which thing we conceive to be against the Law of
God, reason and Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And because these Kingdoms are guilty of many sins, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>What the Conclusion<note place="margin">Concl.</note> suggests we have also considered, and professe
our selves ready to joyn with our brethren in the necessary <hi>humbling
of our selves</hi> under the mighty hand of God, and in the confession of
<hi>our sins,</hi> (though in a publique set form &amp; prescribed, such as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this former part of the Conclusion to be) <hi>our purpose</hi> also, <hi>desire
&amp; endeavour,</hi> through the grace of God, <hi>to amend our lives;</hi> and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those words here mentioned [<hi>In all duties we owe to God and man</hi>]
we professe and declare, that did we believe in our consciences, the
above-written Articles of the Covenant not to be repugnant to our
duties which we owe to God and man, (in the particulars specified
relating to His Majesty and to the Bishops of our Churches, by God
set over us, and otherwise) we should gladly have gone along with our
brethren therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:112843:18"/>Secondly, since this Oath expresly professeth, what also all lawfull
promisory oaths must include, that it is to be made <hi>in the presence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, the searcher of all hearts, with a true intention to perform the
same, as we shall answer at the great day;</hi> we trust our just refusall will, or
ought to be better interpreted, even by the Imposers themselves, then
those mens detestable hypocrisie, who enter this League, and make this
Oath, with mentall reservation; others <hi>as far as lawfully they may,</hi> and
<hi>saving all former Oaths;</hi> yet others, <hi>as far as it is agreeable to Gods Word,</hi>
or <hi>in their own sense,</hi> or <hi>according to the sense of the Preacher,</hi> scandalizing
thus our Christian and reformed Religion, with Jesuiticall mentall
reservations, reserving in their minds a sense contrary to their words
(which are instituted to signifie our minds) and contrary to the mind
of the Imposers, (even in the judgement of their own minds) suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
signified in the words of the Covenant: and indeed, <hi>mentem
injuratam gerunt;</hi> reserving this Popery in thus swearing, while they
swear to extirpate Popery. We professe to know no other legitimate

the taking of the Oath, not in a post-Declaration) and the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
common sense of the words without limitation other then
what is expressed; according to the rule of St. <hi>Augustin. Juramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
debet esse pressum, &amp; expressum:</hi> By thy words thou shalt be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. How also can
any lawfully take an Oath, the matter whereof he judgeth to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
<hi>so far as lawfally he may?</hi> Be we not deceived, God is not moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
May we swear to lie, steal, or commit adultery so far as law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully
we may? Is it more sinfull to go about to do it, so far as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
we may, then so to swear it? He that so swears, swears with
judgement against his judgement, and to unrighteousnesse without
truth, and condemneth himself in that which he alloweth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to swear, <hi>saving all former Oaths,</hi> to what we judge to be
opposite to our former lawfull Oaths, is to delude both our former
and present Oath; to warrant, that we may without scandall abjure
(in words, not in heart) what we have sworn before to keep, because
we have sworn before to keep and never to abjure it; to make vain
(as far as in us lies) the great and dreadfull name of God, the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
end and use of Oaths, and particularly to destroy the end of this
present Covenant, if the takers intend not what the Oath intend<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;
and may also hereafter (saving this present Oath) swear to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For the present be it considered, that whereas this Oath is a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:112843:19"/>
League for unity; if each may take it in their own sense, its end will
be none; and we as far from joynt union of assistance as before. For,
swearing to assist all who enter into this League, if we think our selves
bound to assist o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely the takers in our own sense, then we may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
be tied to assist none hereby, for perhaps our own sense is peculiar
and different from all others, and probably from most, for most take it
in the common sense of the words.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if one end of this Covenant be, that (if it succeed) it may
be <hi>encouragement to other Christian Churches</hi> (in like case) <hi>to joyn in
the same or like Association and Covenant;</hi> we judge it necessary to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
our selves and others, that if in this we offend, we also lay a
stumbling-block of offence before the faces of so many Christian
Churches now and hereafter, who are here invited to follow our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
Should we not therefore sadly consider, whose example in
this action we follow, before we give and invite others to follow our
example? Ought we not wisely to fear, lest by this we expose our
brethren of the reformed Churches beyond the Seas, to the jealousie
of their severall Princes under whom they live, and become guilty of
the provocation of all those evils, wherewith Princes in prevention
of what is here suggested to their Subjects (if not declared against by
them) may aggrieve our brethren of the reformed Religion? And
also, have we not cause to question with our selves, how the example
of entring a covenant mutually to assist and defend one another,
when there is declared a joyning in Armes, without and against the
consent of the supream Magistrate, how this example (we say) will
make, as is here said, to <hi>the Peace and Tranquillity of Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Common-wealths?</hi> Now the Lord of Peace himself give
unto us, and to all the Churches of God, Peace alwaies, by all means.</p>

            <p>IF it had not been intimated that the Authors of this Exhortation
were the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> (as they are stiled in the 14 Article
of the Instructions) and expressed, that the end of it was the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of such scruples as may arise (and that by the same Authority
by which the Covenant it selfe is to be imposed) it could not have
given the conscience of any man either so much licence to examine
the discourse with strictnesse and severity, or so much satisfaction
(one way or other) in the examination; seeing there is scarce any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of writing which necessarily obliges to a discovery of all the
consequences and the principles of a discourse, and there is no such
outward encouragement to the conscience towards satisfaction, as
when it shall consider that it is examining <hi>an Exhortation and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi>
the Authors of which have been chosen, the worke appointed,
and after the performance <hi>twice publiquely read,</hi> and considered, and
lastly <hi>ordered to be published</hi> by them who are the managers of the
Cause for which this Exhortation and Defence is made. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the declared end, and those the Authors, it will not stand with
the opinion of the faithfulnesse of those men towards the Cause it
self, to imagine that they reserve to themselves clearer and firmer
principles, upon which they are able to enforce the taking of the
Covenant, then those they have here expressed: And consequently, if
upon just examination it shall appear, that all the truth that is by
them laid down is not sufficient to infer their Conclusion, they may
be more tender of those who are of different perswasion from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
though they shall (notwithstanding their endeavours) persist
in their opinion, nay though they should hereby gain a degree of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion
to it.</p>
            <p>The conclusion which they would infer is the taking of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and the generall end of that, as expressed in the Covenant it
selfe and in all the Declarations which concern the same, is (in our
calling) the assistance of those of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112843:20"/>
joyned in Arms, &amp;c. against the Popish, Prelaticall, and Malignant
party:</hi> in a word, to assist, or comply with those English and Scottish
Forces, against the Forces raised by the Kings personall command.
This being the case wherein the scruples (by them spoken of) are
supposed to be removed, that their Arguments to that end might be
effectuall, it was necessary to their end, that the present case should
have been clearly and particularly laid down, considering that the
discovery of strong and not doubting presumption and supposall of
that part which is defended, though it might produce a degree of
confirmation in those who are (though not so strongly) of the same
opinion, yet can it not in reason be reputed a means to take off scruple
from a rationall adversary. This being necessary in it self for a true
and thorough resolution of conscience in the case, it cannot be denied
but their discourse is imperfect in it selfe, and consequently they may
as well have erred in assuming to themselves all that is holy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and esteeming of the adverse party as of people <hi>bewitched and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted,
hoodwink't and blinded, &amp;c.</hi> nay, as <hi>the dregs and scum of the
people,</hi> and in affirming <hi>the name and countenance of His sacred Majesty
to be captivated, and prostituted to serve all the lusts of such men;</hi> and
in setting in opposition the <hi>King and those that be faithfull in the

            </p>
            <p>But seeing that it is possible that a case may be so clear and plain
to all men, that it may without any great damage be omitted in a
discourse made for the resolution of the conscience; it will concern
the conscience however impartially to set before its eyes the present
question, and then to examine the discourse of this Exhortation, upon
which the determination of conscience will naturally follow.</p>
            <p>To propound the State of the question impartially (though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <item>4. That he hath sent many Messages for Treaties toward Peace,
both before and during the time of these wars, and expressed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of making the people witnesses of the equity of his proceedings.</item>
               <item>5. He hath declared his will against both the Scots and English,
who take up Arms in this Cause.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Out of these principles (whereas many more might be added in
behalf of His Majestie) let the question be, Whether it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and necessary for subjects to covenant together, without
and against the expresse will of their lawfull Soveraign, to joyn in
Arms against the Forces raised by his command, and that for the
vindication and defence of that which he hath by all possible obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
engaged himself to maintain and defend, and for security
of his people hath desired that differences might be composed by
Treaty, and that the world might judge of his proceedings in it.</p>
            <p>If this be a true state of the question (at least so far as is here expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
the next labour for our Consciences will be to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any argument in this exhortation (upon supposition that they
all were truths in themselves) doe infer a lawfulnesse and necessity
to covenant in our case, all things considered; and if it be evident
that they are not sufficient, it may be a motive to abate the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the composers of it (whosoever they were in particular)
and to procure an examination of their own principles and actions,
wherein they may possibly see that they have not either in their own
actions, or in their judgement of others, proceeded so exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of conscience and the word of God.</p>
            <p>Now, although we are confident that there is not in this exhortation
any one argument which the Assembly it self will undertake so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive,
as that it shall conclude for a necessity or a lawfulnesse of taking
such a Covenant in such a case (all things considered) and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the whole businesse, which was of necessity for vindication of our
selves from <hi>sottishnesse &amp;c.</hi> is already done; Yet that it may without
any danger of prejudice or errour appear, that we are not guilty of
such a presumption as we have excepted against in them, we will, as
briefly as may be, examine their whole discourse, and evidently (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:112843:21"/>
indeed we be <hi>bewitched</hi> to think so) discover what is untrue or
uncertain (if any thing of those kinds shall occur) and what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
in their Exhortation, after we have by way of Apology
premised, that we will not all answer them in the manner of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of the reasons. We have (as we hope) prevailed against those
affections which might have arisen upon those expressions which
concern our selves, and (though with far greater difficulty) against
that indignation which followed upon the apprehension of those
(not so very reverent) expressions and reflections upon his sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
so far as not to suffer our judgements or consciences to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
from a just and meer examination of the truth: having seen
in them, that zeal and confidence (however they are excellent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in those who are sufficiently grounded in an unfallible truth,
yet they) do in no measure help toward a discovery of truth or a
removall of scruples in a case of conscience.</p>
            <p>The whole discourse was intended by the Authors of it, to consist
of perswasions, and resolutions of scruples, and is immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into an introduction and the body of the discourse.</p>
            <p>As for the Introduction, it contains a collection of many places,
from whence the composers thereof presume that the necessity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this League might be enforced. But seeing it carries not clearly
in it self any discovery of the consequences, it could not in reason be
premised to any other discourse, then such as in the processe should
clear that which was there presumed; and seeing the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is no way ordered to a clearing of those inferences, so that
the design of him who made the introduction is no further prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
we may here indeed observe an instance of the variance which
is said to be in the Assembly, but are no wayes helped in that which
was the fundamentall intention of the whole (the resolution of our
scruples) which by the serious consideration of those things here
reckoned up, we professe to have been exceedingly strengthened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us; and that by such inference as may be gathered, if not cleerly
seen, by this ensuing parallel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the power of Religion,</hi> described and practised by our Saviour
Christ and his Apostles, and expressed in the most heroicall actions
of the primitive Christians; or if <hi>solid reason</hi> informed by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and assisted by the light of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of holy Saints and Martyrs, and by a perfect information
of the beginnings and proceedings of our present miseries, and of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:112843:21"/>
the standing known Laws of the Land; <hi>If loyalty to the King, and
piety to their native Couatry, or love to themselves, and naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to their posterity; if the example of men touched with a deep sense of
all these,</hi> such as have been the most eminent among the Clergy for
piety and learning, the Instruments (as it is confessed) used by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God for the preservation of our Religion against all its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who, with many others, the most worthy of the Laity, have
cheerfully and constantly been spoiled of their goods, and suffered a
long and tedious imprisonment, and are and have been ready to
suffer death it selfe in the present cause of his Sacred Majestie; or if
<hi>extraordinary successe from God thereupon,</hi> such as was necessary to
raise his Majesty from a state of despised weaknesse to a power able
to resist, and probably able to debell all the Forces which his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of three Kingdoms can procure. If any or all of these <hi>can
awaken a Nation</hi> hitherto stupified and blinded, and thereupon <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled</hi>
in the miseries which have attended upon this war, <hi>to see and
imbrace the soveraign and onely means of their recovery;</hi> there can be no
doubt or fear, that they will enter into a League with those who have
<hi>lifted up</hi> (under what pretence soever) <hi>their hands</hi> against his Sacred
Majestie, but they will rather repent them of their former disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
endeavouring to reduce their brethren to a labour for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
and pardon from his Majestie, at least to an acceptation of
those proffers for Treaty towards accommodation, which he so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
makes; and in case they shall be by any pertinaciously refused,
joyn themselves with his Sacred Majesty in his just defence.</p>
            <p>Having thus done with the Introduction, it follows that we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Discourse it self, which proceeds in this method:</p>
            <p>First, to propound the motives to perswade men to take the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to answer the objections or scruples which might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here, before we begin to examine the strength of the motives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
we observe the different apprehensions of the framers of it;
for, whereas he who framed the Introduction did, it seems, imagine
that the taking of the Covenant might be enforced from the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Law of God, and the Law of Nature; the other, who was to lay
down the Motives, was so farre from that, as to esteem it necessary
towards the same end, in the first place to insinuate the example of
themselves of the Assembly, and others who had already taken it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:112843:22"/>The strength of their perswasive Arguments is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> This Covenant is already taken by the two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the Assembly of Divines, the City of London, and the Kingdom
of Scotland.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It hath been already seconded from Heaven by blasting the
Counsels, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It carries in it self such a convincing evidence of Equity,
Truth, and Righteousnesse, as may raise in all enflamed affections to take
it; <hi>which is proved, because</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>There is [almost] nothing in this Covenant which was not for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
either expressed, or manifestly included in the Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of May 5. 1641.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> whosoever are not <hi>wilfully ignorant,</hi> or <hi>miserably seduced,</hi>
must infallibly take this Covenant.</p>
            <p>For the first of these Arguments:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, in generall, we do not see how the example of either party
can reasonably be alledged to direct the Conscience in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we have reason to believe that farre the greater number,
both in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> could
not take this Oath <hi>in judgement,</hi> as being not able to discern of the
<hi>righteousnesse</hi> or <hi>iniquity</hi> of some of the Articles, especially that
which concerns Episcopacy, so that a chief strength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from Example, consists in the example of themselves who are
of the Assembly, and made this Exhortation. And then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
they cannot justly accuse us either of immodesty or presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if we shall openly professe that they have not in this first Essay
of theirs (at least which we know to have been published) given
evidences of so great Judgement, Learning, or Integrity, as may
warrant or encourage us in matters of Religion and cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to subscribe to the authority of their example.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To the second Argument, which is, <hi>That it hath been seconded from
Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> it cannot conclude to the Conscience, till it be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proved; neither can that be without a revelation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of God, which if the Composer of this part hath obtained, it
was requisite to the end propounded that he should have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
till when it may be beleeved, that those instances where the
signature of Gods Judgements may the most plainly have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
have fallen upon those who have had the greatest share in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:112843:22"/>
raising and managing of those Arms, for the maintaining of which
this Covenant is ordained.</p>
            <p>So then the whole force of their perswasion will depend upon the
third Argument, and the proof of it, which (to avoid any errour in
examining) shall be again propounded:</p>
            <q>
               <p>There is (almost) nothing in this Covenant, which was not for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
either expressed, or manifestly included in the Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
May 5. 1641.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Therefore this Covenant goeth forth in its own strength, with such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
evidence of Equity, Truth, and Righteousnesse, as may raise in
all not wilfully ignorant or miserably seduced, inflamed affections to joyn in
the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. We are not able by all those wayes of reasoning, to which
we have hitherto been used, to discover the inference which is here
made. If by the strength of their <hi>solid reason</hi> it may possibly be made
to appear, yet we are confident the dependence is so deep and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
that it ought not (to the end for which this discourse is declared
to be intended) have been left unrevealed.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas the Argument <hi>of the evident Equity, Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi>
of this is taken from the agreement of it with that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
we will assume the matter of that Protestation to have been
(in the judgement of this Assembly) <hi>Equall, True,</hi> and <hi>Righteous;</hi>
from whence it will follow, that if this should, according to their
principles, either immediately or by necessary consequence contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
that Protestation, therein they must confesse it to be <hi>unequall,
false,</hi> or <hi>unrighteous;</hi> and wherein soever it doth positively dissent
from it, there the <hi>Truth, Equity,</hi> and <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to be here no way proved; this being premised, let us compare
together this Covenant and that Protestation.</p>
            <p>There we protested that we would <hi>with our lives, &amp;c. defend the
Doctrine of the Church of England</hi> [indefinitely] which is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
contained in the 39. Articles, which (in the further Articles of
impeachment, Jan. 17. 1643. by the Commons assembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) are stiled, <hi>The 39. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Church England established by Act of Parliament;</hi> and in
the six and thirtieth of those Articles it is avouched that <hi>the Book of
Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops, and ordering of Priests and
Deacons, confirmed by Authority of Parliament, doth contain all things
necessary to such Consecration and Ordering, and hath nothing in it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:112843:23"/>
This book asserteth, that <hi>it is evident to all men, diligently read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that from the Apostles times
there have been these Orders of Ministers in the Church, Bishops, Priests,
and `Deacons, which Officers were evermore bad in reverent estimation.</hi>
Wherefore we there protested <hi>with our lives, &amp;c.</hi> to defend that it is
not ungodly (therefore not false Doctrine) to say, That diligent
reading of the Holy Scriptures will help to make it evident, that
from the Apostles times there have been Bishops, which could not
be, unlesse the Scriptures did testifie, that in the Apostles times they
were. One of the Prayers also (<hi>&amp; lex orandi lex docendi</hi>) thus begins;
<hi>Almighty God, giver of all good things, which by thy Holy Spirit hast ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
divers orders of Ministers in thy Church, mercifully behold this
thy servant now called to the work and ministery of a Bishop;</hi> and the
elected Bishop is afterward required to professe, <hi>That he is perswaded
that he is truly called to this Ministration according to the will of our Lord
Iesus Christ.</hi> And by consequence we there did protest to defend
that also; and consequently (upon their own principles) it is <hi>une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall</hi>
and <hi>unrighteous</hi> to swear to the <hi>extirpation</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Again, in that Protestation there was nothing concerning the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
the preservation of the Doctrine, Discipline, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Reformation of the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Moreover, in that we protested <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
the defence of the Kings Person, according to our Allegiance,
which here we do <hi>not absolutely</hi> swear to, <hi>to maintain the Laws of the
Land, the Liberty of the Subject, and</hi> onely to <hi>defend one another so far
as lawfully we may,</hi> which here are omitted. Many other differences
may be observed. If yet they shall say, that there is nothing (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most)
in this which is not in that, or nothing of moment (which
must be the meaning, if their Argument be of any force at all) it
may not be thought unreasonable, if we desire (with leave from His
Majestie) to renew that Protestation, that we may be thereby excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from this League and Covenant.</p>
            <p>After the proposall of their perswasive Arguments, they proceed
to the taking away of scruples, not all, or most of such as might arise
to the contrary (as appears by that which we have humbly represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against the Covenant it self) therefore such as they have chosen
out (probably) because they conceived themselves best able for their
Answer. The scruples which they suppose, are such as concern
either the King or the Bishops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:112843:23"/>They begin with the extirpation of Bishops, where first they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to prove, that they may, and ought to be extirpated; and after
they addresse themselves to answer one speciall objection. We will
therefore in order propound and examine the weight and truth
which is in their Arguments.</p>
            <p>The first is but an intimation, <hi>Some say this Government was never
formally established by the Laws of this Land at all.</hi> If this were true,
which some say, the Argument were not of so great force toward the
taking away of this government, as it would be of power to confirm
us in the belief we have of the venerable institution of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when we shall consider that our Predecessors, who have been
the Authors of our Laws, had such an esteem of the government by
Bishops, that they thought it altogether needlesse <hi>formally</hi> to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
it by Law. Now that this (if any positive) consideration might
be a ground of that which is here intimated (if true) appears, in
that if it were true that it were not <hi>formally established,</hi> yet is it so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
with many of our Laws, that they and it must stand or fall
together. So that here again we may desire of them to be tender of
us, who have protested solemnly with our lives to defend the Laws of
the Land.</p>
            <p>2. The life and soul of it is already taken away by an Act, &amp;c. so as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of jurisdiction remains, but what is precarious in them, and voluntary
in those who submit unto them.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. We cannot acknowledge that any essentiall part of Episcopacy
(such as that which is <hi>the life and soul of it</hi> must be) is, or can be <hi>taken
away</hi> from our Bishops, whether it be of <hi>order</hi> or <hi>jurisdiction;</hi> however
the outward coercive Power communicated to it by the secular arm,
hath been in the times of the famous Persecutions, and may be again
divided from it.</item>
               <item>2. For the Act of this present Parliament here mentioned, we do
believe that there was more taken away in it, then was intended by
the major part of both Houses at the passing of it: This we gather
out of those words of his Majestie in his Declaration, <hi>Aug.</hi> 12. <hi>And
whether that Act was penned with that warinesse and animadversion, that
there was not more determined by it, then the major part of both Houses
intended at the passing of it, let themselves judge.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. However that were, we cannot conceive it reasonable, that their
<hi>temporall lurisdiction</hi> should be taken away (as was suggested) that
they might the better intend their <hi>Spirituall,</hi> and then an argument
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112843:24"/>
made to take away the <hi>Spirituall</hi> part of their Government also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the former is already parted from them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>That their whole Government is (at best) but a humane
constitution.</hi>] If there be no fallacy in these words, it is necessary
that <hi>whole</hi> be taken materially, as it includes each severall part, and
not formally onely; and then we answer, That the Government so
far as to the superiority of Bishops above Presbyters is (at least) of
<hi>Apostolicall constitution,</hi> as is proved in our reasons against the second
Article: and consequently (as to that which is here spoken of) it is
not lawfull to be taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is such as is found and adjudged by both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not onely very prejudiciall to the civill State, but a great hindrance
also to a perfect Reformation; Yea, who knoweth not? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We know the danger (and if indeed we did not) yet the honour
and respect we bear to the very name of Parliaments would not suffer
us to question the judgement of the two Houses; onely in this case
which so neerly concerns the Church of God, we crave leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,
that we doe not apprehend how that should be in it self
<hi>prejudiciall to the civill State,</hi> together with which the State both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
and of late, we conceive, hath flourished, and enjoyed a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall
happinesse beyond most of the Nations of the earth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
how that should be opposite to a <hi>perfect Reformation,</hi> which in
our Consciences we are perswaded (and we think may as clearly be
proved as most matters in Divinity) was instituted by the Apostles
and constantly obtained in the purest times of the Primitive Church,
to which we conceive a <hi>Reformation</hi> ought to be squared: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the chiefest Instruments and Defendants of that <hi>Reformation</hi>
which we (by the mercy of God) enjoy, having been Bishops, some
of which were Martyrs, as Bishop <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, Latimer,
Ferrers, Jewell, Bilson, &amp;c.</hi> We cannot see to what <hi>Reformation</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy
can be <hi>a hindrance,</hi> unlesse to such a form as supposes that
Episcopacy must be extirpated.</p>
            <p>Which moved the well-affected thorowout this Kingdom, long since to
petition this Parliament (as hath been desired before in the days of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>) for a totall abolition of the same.</p>
            <p>In this which is intended for a proof the fourth Argument, seeing
it is presumed that those who have <hi>petitioned for the abolition of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy,
are</hi> and have beene <hi>well affected;</hi> For a judgement of that we
doe onely represent, that the same in the dayes of those renowned
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:112843:24"/>
Princes, by those famous Parliaments held in their times were rejected
as Ignorant and Seditious. And whereas it is said, <hi>the well affected
throughout the Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> It doth, and may appear, that since the
sitting of this present Parliament (and that after discountenance
given to that party) more then four and fourty thousand men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
have <hi>petitioned</hi> for the continuance of our present Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
besides the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Counties of <hi>Dorcet, Kent,
Surrey, Westmorland, Cumberland, Southampton, Lancaster, Cornwall,
Oxfordshire, Berkeshire, Wiltshire,</hi> the six shires of <hi>North-wales,</hi> and
besides the two Universities: all the which have petitioned for the
same.</p>
            <p>The restriction (or what else) is here laid down that we are not by
this Covenant <hi>bound to offer violence to their persons,</hi> we pray may be
observed by those who have taken this Covenant, or shall hereafter
enter into it; for us who are so perswaded as we have expressed, it
would have been a greater satisfaction, if we should have been to
swear to bring the <hi>persons</hi> of any who have offended to a just and legal
triall, so that their <hi>Office</hi> might have been continued, then to <hi>extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
the Office,</hi> with an intimation only that we are not necessitated to
<hi>offer violence to their persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which follows, is to take off the onely scruple which they
would suppose to remain, the oath of Canonicall obedience, wherein
Clergy-men have sworn to <hi>obey the Bishops, in licitis &amp; honestis;</hi>
we will propound their Arguments.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. They which have sworn obedience to the Laws of the Land, may yet
endeavour their abolition in a lawfull way. Therefore they which
have sworn to obey the Bishops may endeavour the abolition of
Bishops.</p>
            </q>
            <p>We do not see this consequence from the Law to the Law-giver, or
the Authority it self from whence the Law is derived.</p>
            <p>It follows upon this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> that they who have sworn to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the injunctions of Bishops, may <hi>endeavour in a lawfull way</hi> the
alteration or abolition of those injunctions; but to infer their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
the <hi>Hypothosis</hi> must have been, that notwithstanding our
<hi>Oath made to obey the Laws</hi> made by the King and the two Houses of
Parliament, we may <hi>endeavour to abolish</hi> the King and both Houses of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>Their second Argument is this:</p>
            <q>
               <p>2. If Ministers or others have entred into any Oath not warranted by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:112843:25"/>
Gods Word and the Laws of the Land, such Oaths call for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
not pertinacy in them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> notwithstanding the Oath of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxicall
obedience, Ministers may endeavour the extirpation of
Bishops.</p>
            </q>
            <p>We believe, that to have cleared this consequence, they ought to
have proved that the <hi>Oath of Canonicall obedience</hi> is not warranted
by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> or the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> which seeing they have
not done, the scruple, notwithstanding this Argument, will still
remain.</p>
            <p>Having thus done with Episcopacy, they proceed to such scruples
of conscience as they suppose may arise from that which concerns
His Majesty; And there the design is to prove, that this Covenant
may be taken, notwithstanding the <hi>Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance</hi>
already taken, and notwithstanding the <hi>want of His Majesties
consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>1. This Oath binds all, and more strongly engageth them to preserve and
defend the Kings Majesties Person and Authority in the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and defence of the true Religion and liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
<hi>therefore,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It doth not crosse the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance.</p>
            </q>
            <p>We answer, 1. The Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
against those, who would not have denied to swear in these very
words, <hi>To preserve and defend His Majesties Person and Authority in
the preservation and defence of the true Religion and liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;</hi>
Therefore notwithstanding this Argument, this Covenant may
crosse the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance.</p>
            <p>2. That this Oath may be taken <hi>without His Majesties consent,</hi> they
would prove by examples, either Modern, or out of Scripture, as</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. The Protestation May 5. was taken without His Majesties
consent.</p>
            </q>
            <p>We did not think we took it without his Majesties consent, and
one reason we will expresse in their words of the same Paragraph,
<hi>Because His Majesty did not except against it, or give any stop to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it, albeit he was then resident in person at Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>2. Ezra and Nehemiah, <hi>Ezra 10. Nehem. 9. Neh. 1.</hi> being vassals,
and one of them meniall servant to Artaxerxes, drew all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into a Covenant, without the speciall Commission of the Persian
Monarchs.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Covenant <hi>into which</hi> Ezra <hi>drew the people is expressed</hi> Ezra
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:112843:25"/>
10. 3. <hi>to have been to</hi> put away all the strange wives, and such as were
born of them, according to the counsell of the Lord, and of those that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the Commandement of God, and <hi>that</hi> according to the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that of</hi> Nehemiah, (Nehem. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 29.) <hi>is expressed to have
been</hi> a Curse and an Oath to walk in Gods Law, which was given by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the servant of God; and to observe and do all the Commandements of
the Lord, and his Iudgements and his Statutes.</p>
            <p>The Commission of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> (besides what is mentioned <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
2.) cannot be denied to be the same which <hi>Ezra</hi> had obtained,
which is expressed <hi>Ezra</hi> the 7. In the 7 of <hi>Ezra,</hi> v. 26. we find this
as a part of his Commission: <hi>Whosoever will not do the Law of thy God,
and the Law of the King, let judgement be executed speedily upon him,
whether it be unto death, or banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment.</hi> Wherefore we cannot but extreamly wonder that these
Covenants here mentioned, should be said to have been <hi>entered into
without the consent of the Persian Monarchs;</hi> an Assertion to us so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
inconsiderate, that our apprehension of the failings in it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in a few words be expressed.</p>
            <p>As for that of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> which follows at some distance, we might
answer, that it is not, nor can it be proved out of the Scripture,
that the <hi>keeping of the Passover</hi> was not consented to by <hi>Hoshea King
of Irael.</hi> However, if the revolt of the ten Tribes were indeed a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
as it is believed by many of the most famous Divines<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyril. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and Calvin. in</hi> Hosea 8. 4. <hi>vide</hi> also the Fuller answer to Dr. Ferne.</note>, then
why might not <hi>Hezekiah</hi> justly send <hi>Proclamations</hi> to them, to joyn
with him in a Covenant, although the King of <hi>Israel</hi> should positively
have dissented?</p>
            <p>But not to insist upon negative Answers, or any thing which may
be controverted, we answer: 1. That act of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was a bare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation.
2. That to which he invited them was <hi>not a League or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
but (that which the Law of God enjoyned) <hi>the observation of
the Passover:</hi> which was some yeeres after the Covenant mentioned.
2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 3 That it was at that time when <hi>Israel</hi> had not the face of
a Kingdom, their King being in captivity under the King of <hi>Assyria.</hi>
Which two latter answers are joyntly proved by this following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
The <hi>Covenant</hi> was made in 1<hi rend="sup">mo</hi> 
               <hi>Hezekiae,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover</hi>
was not celebrated till after the captivity, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 6. There
was no captivity mentioned till after this first yeer of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
Therefore the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Passover</hi> were not kept in the same yeer;
and therefore also <hi>Hoshea</hi> was in captivity, before this invitation of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:112843:26"/>
               <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> The last of the premisses (which onely can be doubted)
is thus proved, because the first time expressed (which we read in
Scripture) of <hi>Salmanasers</hi> comming up against <hi>Israel</hi> is the fourth
yeer of King <hi>Hezekiah, 2 King.</hi> 18. 9. It no wise followeth therefore
from this act of <hi>Hezekiah and the men of Israel,</hi> that it is lawfull to
impose, or enter a <hi>Covenant, without the consent of the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, after these instances of Scripture, they betake themselves to
modern examples, from whence they would infer more then a bare
lawfulnes to enter a <hi>Covenant without the Kings consent,</hi> viz. an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Subjects joyning in Arms against their Soveraign, which they
would warrant from the actions of Q <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> K. <hi>James, and our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Soveraign.</hi> Here we must indeed ingenuously professe, that we
have not been sufficiently exercised in passages of State, to give a full
satisfaction in all these particulars; wherefore we shall not of our
selves interpose at all, onely briefly speak to their instances.</p>
            <p>1. As concerning the assistance of, and the <hi>confederacy with the
united Provinces,</hi> we shall transcribe for satisfaction, a part of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who first entered upon their Assistance; the
Declaration is entituled, <hi>A Declaration of the causes moving the Q. of
England to give ayd to the defence of the people afflicted and oppressed in
the low Countries.</hi> This Declaration was put sorth, 1585. and in the
8, &amp; 9. pages it hath these words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>And furthermore, as a good loving Sister to him, and a naturall
good Neighbour to his Low Countries and people, we have often,
and often again, most friendly warned him, that if he did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
by his wisdom and Princely clemency restrain the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of his Governours, and cruelty of his men of war, we feared
that the people of his Countrys should be forced for safety of their
lives, and for continuance of their native Countrey in their <hi>former
state of their liberties,</hi> to seek the protection of some other forraign
Lord, or rather to yield themselves wholy to the Soveraignty of
some mighty Prince, <hi>as by the ancient Laws of their Countreys', and
by speciall priviledges granted by some of the Lords and Dukes of the
Countries to the people,</hi> they do pretend and affirm, that in cases of
<hi>such</hi> generall injustice, and upon <hi>such</hi> violent breaking of their <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi>
they are free from their former Homages, and at liberty
to make choice of any other Prince, to be their Prince and Head.
The proof whereof by examples past is to be seen and read in the
ancient Histories of divers alterations of the Lords and Ladies of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:112843:26"/>
the Countries of <hi>Brabant, Flanders, Holland and Zealand,</hi> and other
Countries to them united, by the States and People of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
<hi>And that by some such alterations, as the Stories do testifie, the
Duke of Burgundy came to his Title, from which the King of Spains
interest is derived.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Upon these principles it it evident that then the Queen and Kings
of <hi>England</hi> in joyning to the assistance of or <hi>confederacy with the low
Countries,</hi> have not joyned with Subjects in Arms either against or
without the consent of their true undoubted Monarch.</p>
            <p>2. As touching the assistance of the French Prosestants of <hi>Rochell</hi>
by our gracious Soveraign that now is, we shall onely reply (not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
upon the Charter of <hi>Rochell</hi> granted to them by <hi>Lewis the</hi> 11.)
that we are fully satisfied, that no argument can be drawn from
thence, except by those who would raise a dispute of His Majesties
Title and Interest in the <hi>Kingdom of France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As for the Scots, we expected that all further mention of their
former actions should have been prevented by the <hi>Act of Oblivion.</hi>
Yet seeing these men have undertaken to make an advantage against
His sacred Majesty, even out of His acts and expressions of Grace and
Clemency: we answer, That <hi>forms of Pacification</hi> and reconciliation,
are not to be interpreted any further then to the <hi>reputation of the
party to whom the reconciliation is made</hi> (you have not done so, or so,
i.e. you shall be to me as if you had not) so as out of His Majesties
expressions in the late pacification with the Scots, to conclude his
approbation of the course then taken by them, or to take a warrant
for their present undertaking, seems to be alike, as if they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that it was lawfull for other Churches to use St. <hi>Paul</hi> as the
<hi>Galathians</hi> had done, <hi>by accounting him their enemy,</hi> because (by his
own confession) they <hi>had done him no injury,</hi> and should gather that
out of his Act of pacification with them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Brethren, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you be as I am, I am as ye are, ye have not injured me at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sum of all is this: The Assembly of Divines in their exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
have neither concluded any thing positive for a lawfulnesse,
or necessity of taking this Covenant, nor taken away any of those
scruples which they propounded to themselves; they have neither
proved that Bishops must or may be extirpated, nor taken off the
scruple from the Oath of Canonicall obedience: They have neither
cleared the objection from the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:112843:27"/>
nor proved by any example recorded in Scripture, or by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
warrantable practise, that it is lawfull in any case whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
without the Kings consent, to enter into any whatsoever League
and Covenant: So far have they been from proving that it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
or lawfull to enter into this League, the state of the question
being such, as we in the beginning have evinced it to be. So that
should we enter into this covenant, it would be impossible to conclude
our innocency therein from the innocency of <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the
<hi>lewes</hi> here mentioned out of <hi>Esther</hi> 9. Their innocency was clear
indeed, (but how would ours be so?) in that they resisted not the
higher power, or the Arms commanded by him otherwise then by
Fasting and Prayer, untill the King granted them leave <hi>to gather
themselves together, and to stand for their lives,</hi> which before they did
not assume, for no want of sufficient strength to have defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
(as is usually in the like cases objected) which is evident from
their after sufficient strength by themselves to defend themselves,
cap. 9.</p>
            <p>Thus having examined the strength of their Reasons and Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we think it still true (not onely <hi>pretended,</hi> as the Exhortation
hath it) that <hi>Clergy men (above all others) may not covenant to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
Church government by Bishops,</hi> both because of <hi>their Oath</hi> (as
hath been proved) and simply considering the nature of the thing,
in respect of the Reasons already by us alledged; and because Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
if here they erre, they erre most dangerously and arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
swearing (in effect) to endeavour to extirpate all order of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Church Governours above themselves, to endure none such
(if they can help it) superiour to themselves. The danger we had
rather such should hear from St. <hi>Cyprian, Epist.</hi> 10. <hi>Quod enim non peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum
metuere debemus, de offensa Domini, quando aliqui de Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris,
nec Evangelii, nec loci sui memores, sed neque futurum Domini
Iudicium, neque nunc sibi praepositum Episcopum cogitantes, quod nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
omnino sub Antecessoribus factum est, cum contumelia &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptu
praepositi totum sibi vendicent?</hi> What also will they think of
that ancient and reverend Canon (the 35. among those 50. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>The Canons of the Apostles) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
If any one ordained Bishop be not received, not through his own will, but
through the wickednesse of the people, let him remain a Bishop, but let the
Clergy of that City be bar'd Communion, because they have not been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:112843:27"/>
instructors of so inobedient a people.</hi> By which also it appeareth,
that those lay men deceive themselves, who think that the Clergy
onely need scruple at this Oath, at least in the second Article thereof;
we must tell them of <hi>Ignatius his rule, Epist ad Magnes. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Nothing ought to be
done without the Bishop, by Presbyter, Deacon, or Lay-man.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(according to the Preface of this Covenant) we set the glory of
God before our eyes, the same <hi>Ignatius</hi> gives us this other excellent
monition, <hi>Epist. ad Trallian.</hi>

               <hi>It becommeth each of you, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Presbyters, to cherish the Bishop, to the honour of God the Father,
and our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>

not yet ingaged in the Covenant, this will confirm thee in thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
