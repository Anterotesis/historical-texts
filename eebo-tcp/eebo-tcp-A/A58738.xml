            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have some Years since met with a Prophecy (and many talk of such things at this Time) which may yield a little Comfort in this <hi>Day of our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation.</hi> The Original it self I have not seen: but it is taken out of <hi>Telesphorus de Tribulat.</hi> and thus cited by Dr. <hi>John White: Antichristus non poterit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugare</hi> Venetias, <hi>nec</hi> Parisios, <hi>nec Civitatem Regalem</hi> Angliae.</p>
            <p>The Memorable Baffle that the <hi>Venetians</hi> gave to <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth; the frequent Picqueering of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> with the same See, may in part <hi>Justifie:</hi> But the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Preservations, both Antient and Modern, of this Kingdom and <hi>Metropolis,</hi> from the Restless At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts


<pb facs="tcp:100831:3"/>
of many of that Faction, will, I hope, Evince its <hi>Probability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How Instrumental your Lordship hath been towards that Security and Happiness we yet Enjoy, how Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable your Pains, how Undaunted your Courage in the most Critical Conjunctures, is with Gratitude and Applause proclaimed to the World, not only by your own Large and Numerous Flock, but by the Loud Acclamations of the Whole Nation. And though I never was so fortunate as to be an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those Heroick Vertues which daily Influence Your Charge, rendring You so Amiable to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Friends, and at the same time so Formidable to her Enemies: yet that Universal Character which is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where given of You, engages me to look on you as no less than a Person in whom Concentre those Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, which some Criticks in Morality (how justly I dispute not) have exacted to make up a Compleat Christian. They are these: <hi>The Orthodox Faith and Loyalty of a true</hi> English Protestant; <hi>the Zeal and Good Works of a</hi> Roman-Catholick; <hi>the Gratious Words and Painful Preaching of a</hi> Puritan. And all these Inculcated by your Life, as well as Injunctions on your most Learned and Religious Clergy.</p>
            <p>But I must remember my self at the <hi>Judges Barr,</hi> and not at the <hi>Heralds Office;</hi> and that this Paper attends You as a <hi>Petition,</hi> and not as a <hi>Panegyrick.</hi> Your most Gracious Approbation of my Desires (inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to you by the Reverend Dean of St. <hi>Pauls) Invites</hi>

the one; as Your undoubted Worth and Honour <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts</hi> the other.</p>
            <p>Vouchsafe then, my Lord, to Accept into the Arms of your Noble Charity what is penn'd purely with a Spirit of Charity. They are such Reflexions as Reclaimed my self, and may, with Gods blessing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Reducing of some others, as unwarily mis-led as I was.</p>
            <p>To which purpose, I endeavour Brevity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity: designing this Discourse for the Vulgar, (the Learned have richer Mines to recurr to) and therefore waving that Accurateness of Method and Expression, which Your Lordships Judicious Eye may expect; but neither my Intent, the present Affliction I lye under, the unsettledness of my Affairs, nor Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from my Books (all which afford not that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillum Scribentis &amp; otia)</hi> will admit.</p>
            <p>However, when all <hi>Athens</hi> was Busie and in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Cynick</hi> for Company would needs rowl a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Tub. And, if so obscure a Person as my self, intrude into the Crowd of those Many Able <hi>Contenders for the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> which daily almost appear upon the Stage; I have St. <hi>Augustines</hi> Advice for my Apology. <hi>De Trinit. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>In places infected with Heresie, all men should write, that have any faculty therein, though it were the same thing in other words: that all sorts of People, among many Books, might light upon some; and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in all places might find one or other to encounter him.</hi>

               <hi>AN EPISTLE From a Late Roman Catholick To the Very Reverend Dr.</hi> EDWARD STILLINGFLEET <hi>Dean of St.</hi> Pauls, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Very Reverend and Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough I am not altogether Ignorant of your Person, yet my chief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance is with those Learned Works of Yours, (the best Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative) wherewith you have enriched this Age, obliged the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and (I speak it experimentally) given the greatest Satisfaction to ingenious Minds, that sober and unaffected Reason (I do not mean such stuff as Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Serjeant's</hi> Demonstrations) can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly perform.</p>
            <p>And thus, Sir, I have been your most intimate Friend and Servant these seven or eight years.</p>
            <p>All which space I have been a very attentive Spectator of your famous Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to my Comfort seen single Truth and modest Reason combate with whole Troops of Old, Subtle, Confident, Cholerick, and I may add, Malicious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, And I hope I shall have Cause to bless God to all Eternity, and thank you for so Glorious a Sight. But before I return my full Acknowledgments to you, I must crave Leave to give you a Short but True Narrative: only be pleased not to believe it (as you style Mr. <hi>Cressey's)</hi> a <hi>Legend</hi> of my self.</p>
            <p>I had my Education in one of the chiefest Free-Schooles in <hi>London,</hi> under the Care of a very able Instructor, and by him was sitted for the University<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But about a year before my advancing thither, it happen'd that an ancient Gentleman came frequently to divert himself in a Walk that was near the School, and so took Occasion to discourse with divers of the Lads: I being the Head of the School at that time, he pretended a particular Complacency (though I know not why) in my self. He never conferred about any Point in Religion, but still entertained me with speaking Latin, which he did very fluently and politely: and his constant Discourse was about the rare Method of Education used beyond Sea, the great Number of their Students, the Diligence of their Tutors, the Exactness of their


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100831:5"/>
Discipline, and much more to the like Effect. What this Conversation would have produced at last, I know not. But the chief Master of the School perceiving me often with him, at last forbad me his Company, and told me he shrewdly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Gentleman to be a Jesuit. And I remember he instanced in some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular slie wayes those Persons used to Intice and Spirit away Youths, whom they judged fit for their Employment.</p>
            <p>So this Correspondence broke off, and I never had more to do with him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I must confess that much of his Discourse did recoil upon my Childish Fancy a long time after. And though within a short while I went to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> viz. in the year <hi>1658.</hi> yet my mind was not quiet: and those stupendous Distractions both of Church and State that immediately followed, did infinitely add to my Perplexity.</p>
            <p>Then happen'd his Majesty's happy Restauration: which being as it were a year of Jubilee, no wonder if the younger sort of the University did take the Benefit of the Indulgence: I mean <hi>Indulgere Genio,</hi> and use some Liberties, which at other times the strictness of an Academical Life would not have permitted. Here likewise I acknowledge I swam with the Stream, and did not so seriously mind those Affairs I was designed for by my Friends, and so fell into those Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which, not long after my having proceeded Batchelor of Art, induced me to leave the University.</p>
            <p>Coming up to London I light into the Company of an ancient Acquaintance, and among other Discourses we at last fell upon Religion. The Gentlewoman ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured mee by no small Considerations to advise well what I fix'd upon, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to recurr to some able Person of her Perswasion, which was that of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon I was introduced to one of the most Grave, Subtle, and Acute Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then in the Nation (one whose Works I perceive you are not wholly a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to,) I mean <hi>F. Fran. Ã  S. Clara:</hi> with whose winning discourse I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly taken, and to whose extraordinary Civilities I must always account my self extraordinarily obliged.</p>
            <p>You cannot be long in Suspense concerning the Issue of this Interview. He who had triumphed over so many Persons of Honour and Quality, Clergy and Laity, (witness among the rest, Dr. G. Bishop of <hi>Gloucester)</hi> might easily bassle such a young Stripling as my self, and soon dazle my Eyes with the glittering Pretenses of <hi>Infallibility, Antiquity, Unity, Universality, Succession, Councils, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Saints, Miracles, Religious Orders,</hi> &amp;c. These, with the Example of several learned men, Converts of our own Nation, as <hi>Dr. Baily, Vane, Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Cressey, Walsingham, Montague, Crashaw,</hi> with many others yet living and therefore nameless, were, I then thought, too great a <hi>Cloud of Witnesses</hi> for my single Wit either to oppose or so much as question.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, you may easily guess what became of me. For about nine or ten years I was wholly imuiured up, forced to comply with and swallow every thing, durst not propose any Scruples for fear of being suspected Heretically incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100831:5"/>
And thus I continued till the latter end of the year <hi>1671.</hi> At which time, by Gods great Mercy I got some respite to reflect upon what I had done in revolting from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and engaging with one, the ignorance of whose Proselytes is often made Use of for something more than bare Devotion.</p>
            <p>Since that Time, I take God to witness, I have most impartially survey'd all the several Writers I could procure on both sides; but especially your own Books, Dr. <hi>Tillotson's,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lloyd's.</hi> (To both whom, I beseech you, in my name to tender my most humble Thanks for that Great Satisfaction I have reaped by their Writings, especially <hi>The Rule of Faith.)</hi> And, I assure you, I found the <hi>Infallible Principles</hi> so shaken by those Solid and Learned Treatises, and my self so intrigued by my own Experience of the Juggling Practices of some Persons most cryed up for Perfection, that neither <hi>Father Bellarmine</hi> (for as you well observe, amidst that great boast that is made of Fathers, He is the <hi>Great Father</hi> with most of our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oterick Controvertists) nor Dr. <hi>T. G.</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Cressey,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Serjeant himself,</hi> who speaks nothing but <hi>Scientifical Oracles,</hi> could <hi>Unblunder</hi> my thoughts: (that I may not wholly forsake the Rhetorick of my old Friends.)</p>
            <p>And this hath been the true state of my Soul for several years, just like S. <hi>James</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, unconstant in his wayes. For, what with the Terrour of that Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Scare-crow, Schism, on the one hand; with the Flattery of an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged possibility of Salvation in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church on the other (though the Dean of <hi>Canterbury's</hi> Sermon on that Subject hath now perfectly cleared me) I was still detained in a Communion with that Church, which I conceived to hold all the Fundamentals of Christianity. To which (to acknowledge something of Humane frailty) I may add the Advantages I enjoyed, and the Damages I should unavoidably incurr, by quitting a Party, whose Inveterate and Implacable Malice towards a Deserter, though upon the strongest Convictions of Conscience, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known, and particularly taken notice of by the afore-mentioned Reverend and Learned Author, in his Discourse on that of the Gospel, <hi>There is joy in Heaven over one Sinner, &amp;c.</hi> and I my self have already begun to experiense from some, from whom I neither expected nor deserved it. To omit that Innate Reluctancy, well nigh in All, of Recanting a Committed Errour. Though these were but Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the <hi>Second Rate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet at last those Desperate Practices whereof many of that Party stand suspected, and some indicted, made me resolve to break through all Obstacles, and publickly declare my Detestation of their Actions, by Renouncing their Communion, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing against those Principles and Doctrines (as is evident in the most General Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and others, seconded by the undeniable Practice of many Popes, in Actual <hi>Deposing</hi> of Princes, and <hi>Disposing</hi> of Kingdoms) which, it is to be feared, had but too much Influence on such Traiterous Designs.</p>
            <p>This Tenent of a Foreign Power, either Direct in Spirituals, or Indirect in Temporals, is most manifestly inconsistent with the Peace and Safety of our <hi>English</hi> Nation; and till it be <hi>Renounced</hi> or <hi>Disabled,</hi> we shall never be free from <hi>Jealousies</hi> and <hi>Fears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100831:6"/>
There is another Point of as Fatal Consequence to Common Conversation, as the former to the Publick Government, and that is the Trick of <hi>Equivocation,</hi> or <hi>Refined Art of Lying.</hi> I will not say it is a Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but I know it to be both the Doctrine and Practice of a Leading Party in that Church; and never, as I ever yet heard of, was it yet Censured by the Church it self; no more than the Deposing Doctrine, and other such like Hellish Maxims have been disowned.</p>
            <p>Of this Latter I had a famous Instance not long since: A known Jesuit being apprehended in a Neighbouring Town, upon the Interrogatories put to him by the Magistrate, he denied himself to be a Priest, protested he was a Married man, had Wife and Children. And all this was salved by that pittiful Evasion (you know the shift of the Crucifix in the Sleeve used at <hi>China) That his Breviary was his Wife, and his Penitents his Spiritual Children.</hi> This was a very great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to all that heard of it, both <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Romanists;</hi> and for my own part, I was so Concerned in it, that I writ expresly to my old Learned Friend <hi>F. Fran. Ã  S. Clara,</hi> to be satisfied. Who, quite contrary to my Expectation (and which hath much diminished the Esteem I had for him) gave we this Answer in Writing; That he had done nothing amiss, nor misbeseeming an Honest man. Nay then, thought I, the Good Lord open our Eyes! And, to deal plainly with you, from that very Moment I have been very much unsatisfied, whether the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Principles</hi> be safe to <hi>Dye in:</hi> much less to Ruin Estates, and <hi>Dye for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, being very timorous of diverting your many Weighty Employments, I have given you a Cleer, Faithful, and Succinct Account of my self. And so now, <hi>Laqueus contritus est, &amp;c.</hi> The Snare is broken, and we are escaped. My remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Business is, as speedily as I can procure it, to be received into the Bosome of my antient Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom with unfeigned Contrition of heart, I acknowledge to have forsaken before I throughly understood: and purpose, by Gods help, to Evidence to the World, that I have far more Considerable Motives to return, than I had to Wander. And though I shall not make such a noise as Those who have Published <hi>Exomologeses, Challenges, &amp;c.</hi> yet I hope I shall make it appear, that the Change I now make, is done upon the maturest Deliberation, back'd by the most earnest Imploring of the Divine Assistance.</p>
            <p>About five years since, it was my hap, at the Instance of a Person of Quality who had Considerable Sums to Dispose of, to publish a Small Tract entituled, <hi>The Case of Interest, or Usury, as to the Common Practice, examined in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the same Person.</hi> It is the onely Piece I ever yet penn'd: and I mention it, that if you please you may perceive, that I alwayes proceeded upon Principles of Honesty, Conscience, and Moderation; and even then had an Honourable Regard for the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But, Good Lord! what Outeries were then made against it by the Jesuitical Party, who look'd on it as purposely written to affront their Trade! what Excommunications threaten'd by others! So you may easily foresee what I am to expect, when I disingage my self of the Promise I just now


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100831:6"/>
made you. But a Good God, a Good Cause, and a Good Conscience, will, I question not, carry me through all.</p>
            <p>It is no small Comfort to me, when I think how that Vast Wit, Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> could not escape those very Snares that I have been entangled with. And I presume it may serve as an Apology for the Slips and Failings of my Weak In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals, when such a Great Master of Reason as He, was for a time led Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Yet at last, he most happily Discovered and Proved <hi>The Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Safe way to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those whom I forsake have a Tradition (as indeed they have too many) That none ever Retire from their Communion, but they presently become depraved in their Morals. (If they mean the Jesuits Morals, it is no great Matter) I have no wayes to Confute them fully, but as <hi>Diogenes</hi> did <hi>Zeno,</hi> by Walking: <hi>viz. with a Conscience void of Offence both towards God and Man.</hi> And if they shall, after their Charitable Method, think to bespatter me for any thing past; I have such Publick, Authentick and Late Testimonies under Hand and Seal from the Chief among them, of my Comportment (though I will not disown the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes of Common Frailties and Imperfections) that shall be able to Silence the most Impudent Calumny.</p>
            <p>But I fear I have already trespassed upon your Patience; and I must referr what else I had to propose, till such time I am so happy (and truly till then, I shall neither be happy nor satisfied) as to see you. Many Doubts I have to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, fitter to be committed to a Ghostly Father's Ear, than to Paper: and many Particulars there are, wherein I may perhaps gratifie your own Curiosity<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But, having been so long a <hi>Romanist,</hi> and being still a Reputed one, I should he loth that Disobedience to Royal Proclamations (however they have been slighted by some) should be the first fruits of my Conversion. And therefore I must patiently attend that good hour, when I may satisfie both my Obedience and my Inclinations together.</p>
            <p>In your Conference with Sir <hi>P. T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> (that Wretched man, who, had he meddled with nothing but what he then pretended himself so desirous to be resolved in, had never come to that sad Catastrophe) you express so much Candour, Meekness, Christian Zeal and Charity for Satisfying those Dissenters, who in reality did nothing but shuffle with you; that it emboldens me to Address a Request to you (besides my Thanks, which most Cordially I do by these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.) <hi>viz.</hi> That because I apprehend Danger from some of those I relinquish, having already tasted a little of their kindness that ways, and because I would not long remain in an Unfix'd, Neutral posture; you would be pleased to procure leave that I might come up to <hi>London,</hi> where I may attend you, and both Give and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all desired Satisfaction possible. I know you so Eminent, that you may procure a License. This would Complete my Felicity: and as for your own Reward, besides the Complacency you take in the very Performance of such Charitable Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I can but referr you to that of St. <hi>James, cap. &amp; v. ult. Brethren, if any of you do err from the Truth, and one Convert him: Let him know, that</hi>


               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100831:7"/>
               <hi>he who converteth a Sinner from the Error of his wayes, shall save a Soul from Death, and shall hide a multitude of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one Cavil I must needs remove, and it is this: How chances this Change just now? why in this present Conjuncture? It is to be suspected you act more out of Fear than Conscience. This Surmise I insinuated before, and partly adverted to it But more particularly I have these things to offer in Reply:</p>
            <p>I might, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> put the Objectors in Mind how <hi>Dr. Vane, Mr. Cressey,</hi> and others forsook the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when it was in a very low, persecuted Condition: and were not ashamed in their Writings to intimate as much. For one of the Motives of their withdrawing was, that She never had been well grounded; and therefore God seemed to forsake her, and <hi>Lopt off her Head:</hi> with much more to the same Purpose; as is particularly to be seen in <hi>Dr. Bailey's End to Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</hi> But I scorn such Disingenuous, Mean-spirited Principles. And I desire that they would withal consider that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was then reduced to those Exigences for her constant and never blemished Loyalty. Whereas divers of themselves now stand charged with something else besides <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to answer for once and all; I confess I do it out of Fear; not of any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Incommodity; for that might several other wayes be avoided: but of having Fellowship with any of those horrid Works of Darkness, whereof many of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, and the Religion it self are accused. And this may serve for my old Friends.</p>
            <p>Now as for your self and all other candid disinterested Persons, I know it will be satisfactory to put you in mind, that to impute my Proceedings to the frowning of the Times on that Party, is <hi>Fallacia non Causae pro Causa:</hi> a Mistake of the Adjunct or Circumstance of Time, for the Principal Motive. The Conversion of a Sinner is the Work of Omnipoteuce; who as he is most free in all his Actions <hi>ad Extra;</hi> so especially in the reclaiming of a strayed Sheep. He is no wayes tied up to the Circumstances of <hi>Whom, How, Where or When. Nescit tarda Molimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na SpiritÃ»s Sancti Gratia,</hi> sayes S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> And if he were graciously pleased more effectually to touch my Heart now, than at any other time (and times of Affliction are his especial Seasons. <hi>Afflictio dat Intellectum. Cum Occideret eos</hi> &amp;c.) I know no other Account can be given of it than that of our B. Saviour, <hi>Even so Father, for so it seemed Good in thy Sight.</hi> Nay I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated that these Thoughts have been long hovering in my Mind, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they had not been altogether so suddenly declared, but out of a deep Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Dangers of any further neglecting the Divine Call: and a seasonable Desire to Testifie to the World my perfect Abhorrence of such desperate Practices and Principles, which I am convinced are pernicious both to Publick Polity and Civil Society. And I hope none can reasonably be angry, that I have gained more Experience now I am thirty six years old, than I had when I was but twenty.</p>
            <p>These are the Principal Matters I thought worth your Knowledge at present, wherein I protest before God and Man, that I have no other Design but the Quiet of my Conscience, and the Salvation of my Soul. And when I have given a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

Tolerable Account of this Affair, I will take my leave of this <hi>Noble Science of Controversie</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> calls it) having alwayes been more addicted to <hi>Ascetick Theology;</hi> and sit down with Divine <hi>Anselm's</hi> Resolution, <hi>Quid restat per Totam Vitam meam, nisi ut Defleam Totam Vitam meam?</hi> Crosses and Afflictions are no more than I except and deserve, having hitherto been so little acquainted with them. The Wise man hath read my Doom to me, <hi>Fili, accedens ad servitutem Dei, praepara Animum tuum ad Tentationem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the sincerity of my Resolutions, I can but Appeal to that Great Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Hearts and Tryer of Reins. And though some Folk talk of Dispensations from <hi>Rome</hi> for the taking All Oaths, and Complying with All Externals: and no meaner a Person than the Author of the Difference between the Church and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> out of Arch-Bishop <hi>Spotswood's</hi> History, mentions some such like thing practised in <hi>Scotland:</hi> yet, with submission to the Learned Author, I conceive there is no such matter: since the <hi>Pope</hi> himself could never be induced to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove even the single Oath of Allegiance; but expresly condemned it, and severely prohibited the taking of it, as containing, saith he, divers Points contrary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And moreover, put case any thing of that nature were in Being; I here solemnly Avow, that I disown all such Pretended Authority.</p>
            <p>One Circumstance, not very Material I confess (but I would not too much swerve from the Accurate Exactness of Writers of <hi>Epistles Apologetical:</hi> though Mr. <hi>Cressey</hi> observe it in the Beginning, and I in the Conclusion) must not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; and thus it is: To you above all Persons living, I have an Obligation to recurr in Spiritual Concerns; for I am your Parishioner: <hi>Holborn</hi> having been the place of my Nativity. I have nothing more, but with all Respect and Gratitude to assure you I am</p>

            <head>Several Weighty CONSIDERATIONS Humbly Recommended To the Serious Perusal of ALL: especially the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a very good Rule prescribed by some Spiritual Writers, <hi>That in Converse, we should rather discourse of Things, than Persons.</hi> And I intend, as much as the Matter will permit, to observe it in this subsequent Treatise; carefully avoiding all personal Reflections, especially upon such as are living; and shall only bring some Doctrines and Practices to the Test, which, though they pass for currant with many, will yet be found adulterate and contrary to Holy Scripture, the best Genuine Antiquity, and Right Reason: highly scandalous to the Christian Religion in General, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of Civil Government, fatal to Humane Society, and very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both to the Spiritual and Temporal Concerns of the Practisers even in their private Capacity.</p>
            <p>In short, I shall very plainly and briefly endeavour to make good two As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is no sufficient Ground for any one to forsake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and incorporate with that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is all Reason imaginable both for such as have been educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, to <hi>Reform;</hi> and for such as have unwarily ingaged with her, to <hi>Return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the happy Result of these following Considerations upon my own Heart: And it shall be my Prayer that they may have the same Blessed Effect in the impartial Perusers of them.</p>
            <p>The sacred Oracles of the Holy Scriptures deservedly Command our first Inquiry.</p>
            <p>We have Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> own Concession, that in the grand Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, the Scripture is better known than the Church. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently then, not only her Authority but her very Being must be subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to it. And therefore in the first place let us see what Sentiments the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath of these Heavenly Records, and whether Hers, or those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be more Consonant to Pure Antiquity, Reason, and Holy Writ it self.</p>
            <p>All Protestants, and particularly the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England, Artic.</hi> 6. look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Holy Scriptures to contain all things necessary to Salvation; so that whatever is not read in them, or cannot be proved from them, is not to be Imposed on any, to be received as an Article of Faith, or a Necessary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100831:8"/>
to Salvation. Whence it appears, that they take Them to be the Onely, Complete, and Adequate Rule both of Faith and Life: sufficiently intelligible and easie in matters that concern what is simply necessary to make us <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They consequently hold, that since Holy Scripture is the Rule of our Faith, it must have an exact Proportion to that, whereof it is a Rule. So that Matters of Faith are not to be extended beyond this Rule, nor can any unwritten Traditions any way be pretended to appertain to the Substance of Faith.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Rule being the Idea, Model and great Exemplar of what is regulated by it, it is in order of Nature before the thing so regulated. And if the word of God be antecedent to Faith it self, it must likewise precede the Faithful themselves; and if the Faithful, then must it have Preheminence before the Church it self, which is nothing else but the Congregation of the Faithful. Thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will evidently fall short of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative she so presumptuously arrogates, of being both <hi>Before,</hi> and <hi>Above</hi> the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Again, a Rule consisting in <hi>Indivisibili,</hi> as we say, <hi>i. e.</hi> being of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that it is not to be inlarged or diminished; how guilty are they who either make Additions to, or Substractions from it? Both which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church practiseth, as <hi>de facio</hi> will be manifest in the Sequele of this small Tract.</p>
            <p>In Fine they hold the Word of God written, to be that one, infallible, entire Rule, whereby all men, Learned and Unlearned, may in all necessary and fundamental Points of Faith and Manners be sufficiently instructed what is to be embraced for <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Good:</hi> That it is a Rule most Certain, Plain, Universal, Impartial, not addicted to one Side more than another: (which neither Pope, Conclave nor Councel can so much as pretend to) of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority able to convince the Consciences of such as use it, and from which there can be no Appeal. And the only Cause why any miss of the True Faith, is, because they do not sincerely seek and find out this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Rule; or having found it, will not with an obedient Mind captivate their Understanding, but have Access to it with Pride, Curiosity, Prejudice, or some other unmortifyed Lust or Impediment.</p>
            <p>More especially the Church of <hi>England,</hi> besides that high Veneration that she her self hath for these sacred Books, labours to confirm and root the same in the Hearts of her obedient Children, by her Devout Practice. For, to omit the Frequent, Laborious and Judicious Preaching and Expounding of them in this Church; she hath so prudently disposed of her publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, that every day some Part and Portion of both Testaments is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be read: The whole Book of Psalms is gone through once a Moneth, the Old Testament once, and the New thrice every year; with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most excellent Exercises of Piety; (at which even the <hi>Romanists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100831:9"/>
can take no just Exception; and a very great Author affirms, that a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Pope would have approved the whole Service-Book, had his Authority but been acknowledged) which discreet Course cannot but afford much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Instruction and Consolation to the constant Attenders on such Blessed Opportunities.</p>
            <p>But what saith the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> all this while in this Business? In her <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine</hi> Council, Sess. 4. Can. 1. She expresly Decrees, that unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of equal Authority with the written Word; that they are to be received with the same Reverence and Affection. And Cardinal <hi>Hosius,</hi> who was one who in the Popes Name presided at that Council, defends that most Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Speech of <hi>Wolfangus Hermannus,</hi> that the Scripture is of no more Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than <hi>Esop's Fables,</hi> but for the Churches and Popes Approbation, lib. 3. <hi>de Authorit. Script.</hi> The Council of <hi>Basil</hi> would fain perswade us that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Acts and Customs must be to us instead of the Scriptures, <hi>(Instar habeant Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crarum Scripturarum)</hi> for that the Scripture and Churches Customs both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the same Affection and Respect.</p>
            <p>Indeed I find the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctors in nothing more fluent than in degrading and vilifying the Scriptures. Our Country man, Dr. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> positively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that the Church hath Authority to put into the Number of Books of Scripture, and to make Canonical the Writings of <hi>Hermes</hi> and Constitutions of <hi>Clemens</hi> (two famous Counterfeits) and that then they would have the same Authority which other Books have, canonized by the Apostles themselves. Some call them a Nose of Wax, to be wrested any way. <hi>Cardinal Cusanus</hi> blushes not to write that the Scriptures are fitted to the time, and variously understood; the sense thereof being one while this, and another while that, according as it pleases the Church to change her Judgment. Some teach that the Scripture is not simply necessary, that God gave it not to the People but to the Doctors and Pastors; and that we must live more according to the Dictates of the Church, than the Scripture. <hi>Eckius,</hi> the great Antagonist of <hi>Luther,</hi> would make us believe that Christ never gave any Command to his Apostles, to write any thing. Which yet seems very odd, when such an express Injunction was lay'd on S. <hi>John</hi> to write that mystical Book of the Apocalypse, which certainly is not more conducing to the Churches Edification than our B. Saviour's Sermon on the Mount, and the many other practical Discourses both of himself and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. In a word, the most ingenuous and civil among their Writers think they have pay'd all due Respect to Holy writ, when they term it a Dumb Judge, Dead Ink, or Ink shaped into various Forms and Characters. Notwithstanding which I humbly conceive, that let an Indifferent Person open the Bible and the Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> together, and he will receive at least as clear and full Satisfaction from the Bible, as from the other; unless we will impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously deny Almighty God the Faculty of expressing his holy Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as intelligibly as frail Men can theirs: or without any shew of Reason af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm with a late Divine, that Religion it self was never fully setled till that upstart Conventicle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100831:9"/>
Conformable to the Sentiments are the Practices of that Church, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bible lock'd up in an Unknown Tongue from the Use of the Vulgar. <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth very strictly orders all Vulgar Translations to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Index of Prohibited Books. And in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and wherever the Inquisition hath the least Jurisdiction, the very keeping of them is a Crime no less than Capital.</p>
            <p>It is true, where the Reformation hath got any footing, Faculties are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times granted to read a Translation; but clog'd with so many Proviso's and various Cautions, and their Spiritual Guides give so small Encouragement to it, that it seems rather a Trick to stop the Mouthes of their Adversaries, when they Object the Prohibition of Reading Scripture, than any real Intention of Promoting so Pious an Exercise among their Devotes. Besides, their other Forms of Devotion, Rosaries, or saying over the Beads after divers Methods, our Ladies Office, Prayers for the Dead, Manuals, the long Litanies of Saints, hearing of Masses, reading of Legends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in so great Vogue, and take up so considerable a Time, that I scarce see how any can be allotted for that contemned Employment of studying Gods Word: which ought to be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of every good Christian Day and Night. Indeed this neglect (to say no worse) of Holy Scripture is so notorious among, and so peculiar to those of that Way, and the Ignorance not only of the Laity but of divers of the Clergy in that kind of Learning especially, is so gross, that it would be a Work of Supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to attempt the proof of it: Their Doctors generally pretending Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Scripture to be the cause of all Heresies and Phanaticism. Nay, I have met with one so frantick, that he thinks it was the Devils invention to permit the people to read the Bible. <hi>Martin. Peres. de Tradit.</hi> And I remember <hi>Thyrraeus de Daemoniac.</hi> c. 21. says, that thence he knew certain Persons to be possess'd by the Devil, because being but Husbandmen they were able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning Scripture.</p>
            <p>We will now see what Holy Writ it self, untainted Antiquity, and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Reason alleage in this Case: and which side they patronize, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation or the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this Encomium of his Disciple <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> c. 3. v. 15. That from a Child he had been Conversant in the Holy Scriptures, and tells him they were able to make him <hi>Wise to Salvation</hi> (which I hope is Knowledge enough, and I am sure is a more plain, compendious Path, than the crooked La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths of uncertain Traditions, forged Decrees, Canons and Fathers.) He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assures him, that the same Divine Scriptures were profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction to Righteousness; that the Man of God might be <hi>perfect,</hi> throughly furnished to <hi>every</hi> good Work. For my part I know not what remains then for Tradition and such like Trash to perform, since the Word of God alone can so compleat us. <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 2. 9. as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us that Gods Law alone will make a man understand Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and Judgment, and Equity, and <hi>Every</hi> good <hi>Work.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Esa.</hi> c. 8. 20. refers us to try all things by the Law and Testimony: and that


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100831:10"/>
we must conclude those to have no light, who speak not according to that Word. Our B. Saviour <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 26. When a Lawyer inquired of him what he should do to inherit Eternal Life: bids him have recourse to what was written in the Law, and asked him how he <hi>read</hi> there. S. <hi>Luke</hi> writ his Gospel to <hi>Theophilus</hi> a Lay Person. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 4. to the end he might <hi>certainly</hi> know those things wherein he had been instructed. S. <hi>John</hi> writ his, as he himself testifies, <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 31. that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing we might have Life through him. <hi>Abraham</hi> sends <hi>Dives</hi> his Brethren to <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, rather than to Visions, Apparitions, and private Revelations: which yet are so much pretended to and boasted of in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Christ himself submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Tryal both of his Doctrine and Miracles to the Censure of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. Search the Scriptures, for they are they which testifie of me. Thoughts are free, and I am apt to think that some will take the Liberty to judge it a little unreasonable, that our B. Saviour should so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily stand to the Verdict of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets; and yet his pretended Vicar should scorn to submit to the Censure of Christ and his Apostles; but defie both their Doctrines and Practices with so many <hi>Non Obstante</hi>'s, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their new model'd Creed at this day: wherein <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth hath coined twelve new Articles of Faith, to shew his single Power equivalent to that of all the Apostles in General, who did but every one contribute his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Article to that ancient Symbole bearing their Name.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Auditors the <hi>Bereans</hi> are highly commended for searching the Scriptures daily, to examine whether the Doctrine they heard were true or no. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. In Sum, the old Law was severely injoyned to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Meditation both of Prince, Priest and People; men, Women and Children, as is obvious to observe all along the Style thereof. And the <hi>Jews</hi> were so versed in it, as to be able to reckon up the Number of the Words, nay Letters contained therein. And the new Law excludes none, either from that <hi>Common Salvation</hi> it holds forth, or the means to attain it, which is the Doctrine of the Gospel. The Epistles are directed to Persons of all sorts and both Sexes. In fine, the whole Oeconomy both of the Old and New Testament is so diametrically opposite to the Practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in this Point, that it is but too too palpable that the three Main Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Popery, are to keep the <hi>Prince in awe, the Priest in Honour, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Antiquity is so luxuriant in this point, that it will be a greater Difficulty to select than to accumulate. Famous is that Speech of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great to the Fathers in the Niccne Council, recorded by <hi>Theodor. Histor.</hi> l. 1. c. 7. and this Saying among the rest is very remarkable: We have the teaching of the Holy Ghost <hi>written:</hi> for the Evangelical and Apostolical Books and the old Prophets do evidently teach us the things that are <hi>needful</hi> to be


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100831:10"/>
known concerning God. Wherefore laying aside all Contention let us out of <hi>the Divinely Inspired Scripture, take the Resolution of those things we seek for. Tertullian</hi> contr. <hi>Hermog.</hi> in plain terms calls the Scripture <hi>The Rule of Faith.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> Hom. 13. in 2 <hi>ad Cor.</hi> styles it, A most Excellent Rule and Exact Ballance to try All things by. St. <hi>August.</hi> in l. 2. <hi>de Nupt. &amp; Concup.</hi> c. 33. speaks thus: This Controversie depending between us requires a Judge: let Christ therefore judge, and let the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> judge with him: because Christ speaks in his Apostle. But most Memorable is that Passage of <hi>Optatus contr. Parmen.</hi> l. 5. where he thus presses the <hi>Donatist:</hi> We are (saith he) to enquire out some to be Judges between us in these Controversies: The Christians cannot, because both sides cannot yield them: and by part-taking the Truth will be hindred: the Judge must be had from <hi>without our selves.</hi> If a <hi>Pagan,</hi> he knows not the Mysteries of Christianity: if a <hi>Jew,</hi> he is an Enemy to Baptisme: therefore on Earth no judgment concerning this matter can be found. The Judge must be had from Heaven. But to what end should we knock at Heaven, when here we have one in the Gospel? Quotations might be Infinite, but I Supersede.</p>
            <p>Nor did the Antient Fathers onely think this themselves, but by their frequent Translations of the Scripture, and vehement Exhortations to the People to read them so translated, they endeavoured to beget the same aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Respect to Gods Holy Word in the Minds of all. <hi>Ulphilas,</hi> a Bishop of the <hi>Goths,</hi> turned the Scripture into that Barbarous Language, as <hi>Socrates</hi> witnesses. <hi>Methodius</hi> into the <hi>Sclavonian.</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> hom. 1. in <hi>Johan.</hi> makes mention of <hi>Syrian, Aegyptian, Indian, Persian</hi> and <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Theodoret de Curand. Graec. Affect.</hi> assures us the Bible was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Languages used in the World, <hi>Greek, Latin, Armenian, Scythian, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian,</hi> &amp;c. And we have at this day divers Fragments of them remaining. Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> shews the same of our own Country.</p>
            <p>To speak plain: I know no Topick the Fathers are more Copious upon, than in calling upon the People to get Bibles, to read them, to examin what they hear by them, and severely inveighing against the Negligence of such as did not: According to the Apostles Advice even to the Laity, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all Wisdom, teaching and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoret,</hi> before cited, gives this Account of his Times. <q>You shall eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where see these Points of our Faith to be known and understood, not only by such as are Teachers in the Church, but by Smiths, Weavers, and all kinds of Arcificers: yea, all our Women, not only such as are Book-learned, but also by them who get their Living by the Needle, Maid ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Waiting-women: and not Citizens only, but Husbandmen are very skilful in these things. You may hear among us Ditchers and Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds discoursing of the Trinity and the Creation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100831:11"/>
And that the Laity were thus familiar with the Bible, may evidently be made out, in that <hi>Nectarius,</hi> of a Judge, was made Bishop of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> of a Secular Deputy, Bishop of <hi>Milan; Gregory</hi> the Father of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> of a Lay-man was made a Bishop: <hi>Origen</hi> from a Child was Learned in the Scriptures; and to the great Joy of his Father <hi>Leonides,</hi> a Holy Martyr, often questioned with him concerning the meaning of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult places. <hi>Macrina,</hi> St. <hi>Basil's</hi> Nurse, taught him the Scriptures when he was very young: and <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> the Sister of <hi>St. Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> was rarely well experienced in them.</p>
            <p>I will wind up this Argument with declaring what was St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> mind in so Weighty a Business. He, besides his Writing to divers Women, as <hi>Eustochium, Salvina, Celantia, &amp;c.</hi> commending their Labours in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and encouraging that study: speaking of the Noble <hi>Roman</hi> Lady <hi>Paula,</hi> in the Epitaph he made upon her, he extolls her for imposing a daily task of reading the Scriptures, on her Companions and Maids. But more signally in an Epistle to <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> he gives her these Directions for the Education of her little Daughter. <q>Let the Child be deaf in hearing of light Musical Aires; but cause her every day to render a task of the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Holy Scripture. Let her not be sought for in the press of secular People, but in the Closet of the Scriptures, asking Counsel of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles concerning Spiritual Nuptials. Let her first learn the Psalter, and with those Heavenly Songs wean her self from light Sonnets. Then let her be taught to Govern her Life out of <hi>Solomons Proverbs,</hi> and repair to <hi>Job</hi> for Examples of Vertue and Patience, Let her then come to the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and never lay those Books out of her hands. With these she must joyn the <hi>Acts of the Apostles, &amp;c,</hi> But let her be cautious in <hi>Apocryphal Books,</hi> and if she read them, let her understand, that they are not those Author's, whose Names they carry; and that many things faulty are mix'd with them; and it is no small Wisdom to fund Gold among Dross.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which excellent Advice, let me onely subjoyn what I find scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and down in <hi>S. Augustin; viz.</hi> To read plain Passages first, and heartily to practice what we understand; and as for obscure Places, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, Genealogies and Mysteries, whereof we shall never be demanded an Account at the Day of Judgment, let us leave it to the Divine Pleasure, either to reveal them to us, or reserve them still Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: since our Saviour told his own Disciples that it was not for them to know the Times and Seasons: but plainly informed them, that he who did his Will should know of his Doctrine, whether he spoke from God or from himself. The same Father acquaints us with the admirable Commixture of Plainness and Obscurity in the Holy Scripture: that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Wanton Wits are wholsomely curbed, Weak Wits cherished, and Great</hi>


               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100831:11"/>
               <hi>Wits delighted:</hi> and that nothing of highest Importance is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexedly delivered in one Place, but it is as plainly set down in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I have inlarged a little more than I intended on this Theme, because I am verily perswaded, that if the Sober, Judicious <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of this Nation would be induced but for Tryal sake a while to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit some of those Dry, Insipid Devotions, which take up so much of their Time; and exchange them for a Pious, Humble conversing with God's Word; they would soon be out of Conceit with what they are now so fond of; and discover the sandy Foundation of many of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: and perhaps at last become of that good Abbots mind who was Unkle to Arch-Bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and was often heard to complain, that their Religion must needs at last fail, because he found no ground for it in Gods Word.</p>
            <p>Having considered hitherto the great Rule of our Faith and Life, we will now descend to that Article of our Creed which makes such a noise in the World, I mean the <hi>Holy Catholick Church:</hi> which, omitting the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Acceptations of the Word <hi>Church,</hi> as to our present Purpose, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a Company of People united in the Profession of the True Faith of Christ, and due Use of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that the Papists would fain foist in another Requisite, to wit, <hi>Under the Obedience of the Bishop of Rame, the only Vicar of Christ upon Earth.</hi> But to omit many other Absurdities, I shall only instance at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in two: that hereby they exclude Universality, which they put down as an Essential Note of the True Church; and Charity, which I am sure is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Badg of Christ's true Disciples. For by this very Clause, they very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously obtrude less than a fourth part for the Whole; and by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating all the rest from the Pale of the Church, as much as in them lies, very mercifully Doome greater, more antient and better Churches than themselves to everlasting flames.</p>
            <p>To make this good, we will take our Measures by the Judicious Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sir <hi>Edwyn Sands,</hi> who in his <hi>Survey of Europe,</hi> assures us that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church in Number exceeds any other: and the <hi>Protestants</hi> in Multitude and extent of Territory fall very little short of those that are under the <hi>Papal</hi> Yoke. So that here we have two four Parts. To which add all the Oriental Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and those in the Vast Empire of <hi>Prester John,</hi> or the <hi>Abyssines,</hi> who are all out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion; and questionless we shall find another fourth Part. And thus we have three to one, even in the point of Universality.</p>
            <p>I will put this out of all dispute by a particular Induction.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Asia</hi> we have Multitudes of Christians who have nothing to do with the Pope. Those of <hi>Palestine</hi> are subject to the Patriarch of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> under him of <hi>Antioch:</hi> the <hi>Armenians</hi> and


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100831:12"/>
               <hi>Georgians</hi> have their own Patriarchs. The <hi>Circassians,</hi> and those of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> are under him of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> The <hi>Jacobites</hi> and the Christians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> have also their peculiar Patriarchs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Africa,</hi> where we find any steps of Christianity, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Cophtes</hi> are under the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> or <hi>Abys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines,</hi> which are innumerable, are under their own Governours Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> submit to the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The spati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Empire of the <hi>Russians</hi> hath a Patriarch at <hi>Mosco.</hi> The Kingdoms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland, Denmark, Swedeland,</hi> and the far greatest part of the United <hi>Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungaria,</hi> are subject to Bishops and Church-Officers of their own, without any dependance upon Him at <hi>Rome.</hi> Even in <hi>Bohemia, Poland, France, Transylvania,</hi> some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of <hi>Italy</hi> there are multitudes of Reformed Churches, which have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the <hi>Popes</hi> Jurisdiction. And thus that Large Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality of Power that the Old Gentleman at <hi>Rome</hi> brags of, is at last shrunk away into <hi>Spain,</hi> part of <hi>France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> some of the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> some of the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> And here you have a <hi>Map of the Papal Universality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They boast indeed much of their New Acquisitions in the <hi>Indies:</hi> but (not to Examine by what Right they Invaded those Countreys) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such a brutish manner were those Conversions made, driving the poor Natives to Baptisme, like Herds of Beasts to Watering, that their own Writers blush at Recording it. And when all comes to all, it will appear, that they <hi>Butcher'd</hi> more than they <hi>Baptiz'd. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus Casa,</hi> a Bishop that lived in those Countreys, and <hi>Acosta</hi> the Jesuit, are sufficient Witnesses in this matter.</p>
            <p>And since We are entred upon this much cryed up Universality of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, it will not be amiss to glance a little at those other Claims and Pretensions whereby she would Impose her self on the World, for the Onely, Immaculate Spouse of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>Antiquity is much talked of, and it is a kind of Universality in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Time, as that before mentioned, was of Place and Persons. But how groundlesly the <hi>Roman</hi> Church appropriates and ingrosses it to her self, is too apparent from the Novel <hi>Tridentine</hi> Constitutions and Articles. And besides, it can be no Discriminating Note, in as much as it is applicable to things prophane as well as Sacred; even to Paganism it self; and to Heresies (many of which are as Antient as the first Century) as well as to Orthodox Doctrine. And if we come down to Practice, we shall find it far more feasible to discover the


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100831:12"/>
True Church here or there at present, than to discern where it was in the constant Series of many Ages. History being one of the most obscure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, tedious and fallacious Principles, in this case, whereon we can possibly proceed. Nor could any particular Church or the Catholick Church it self at the Beginning lay any Claim to the Title of being ancient. Besides, the Characteristical of Truth is not so much to be <hi>Antiqua,</hi> Old, as <hi>Prima,</hi> from the Beginning from Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: and such Antiquity the Church of <hi>England</hi> is very willing to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by in every one of her Articles. So that here are two Conditions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, <hi>Soli &amp; Semper:</hi> Antiquity belongs not only to the True Church, nor is it alwayes competible to it.</p>
            <p>To this is reducible their Duration or Continuance, but this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the same manner as their Antiquity is: to which it is so near al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed.</p>
            <p>And here by the way we have a most Satisfactory Reply to that thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare Demand, <hi>Where was your Religion before Luther?</hi> I will not at present use his Answer, though very good; <hi>That it was in the Bible, where theirs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was.</hi> Nor will I demand where theirs was before the late Assembly at <hi>Trent,</hi> some years after <hi>Luther?</hi> But I say it was by wonderful Providence preserved all along down from the Apostles dayes to ours, and so will be to the Consummation of the World. So we need not turn over all the Immense Volumes of Antiquity to give in a Catalogue of visible Professors of the Reformation, (and yet this may and hath been sufficiently done) but our only Task is to prove our Religion the same which was taught by the Blessed Jesus and his Apostles; which can only be done by appealing to the Sacred Records of the Gospel: and as for the Professors, we have his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that he will preserve a Select Company (though sometimes living in a corrupt visible Church, as Wheat among Tares, or the seven thousand in <hi>Elisha</hi>'s time that had not bowed their Knees to <hi>Baal.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 18.) to his second Coming; though he hath not told us where to find them in every year. And therefore such as go about to demonstrate that such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors were not in Being, do but attempt to enervate our Saviours Promise, and render themselves and Christianity equally ridiculous.</p>
            <p>The Multitude Extent, and Variety of their own Professors is indeed Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great Ostentation; and it hath in part been adverted to in the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of Universality. But in Truth it is so far from being a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Truth of their Church, that it rather concludes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Fear not <hi>little Flock,</hi> sayes our Saviour; and strive to enter in at the <hi>Straight Gate.</hi> What shall we think of that time S. <hi>Jerome</hi> speaks of, <hi>Cum ingemuit Orbis &amp; Mirabatur se factum Arianum?</hi> when, as <hi>Vincentius Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinensis</hi> speaks, in a manner all the Latin Bishops partly by Force and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100831:13"/>
by Fraud, were deluded into Arianisme? It is indeed a Note of Anti-Christ. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. That the Whore shall sit upon many Waters; which Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are People, and Nations and Tongues.</p>
            <p>As for the Name <hi>Catholick,</hi> so often objected, we know that Names have little Weight with wise men; that there were some Hereticks who called themselves <hi>Apostolical Men;</hi> that S. <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Apocalypse</hi> tells us there were such as had a <hi>Name</hi> to live, but were dead; and that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself acknowledges, that if one only Province should retain the True Faith, yet might it be called <hi>Catholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Succession of Bishops from the Apostles times, is another very plausible Topick, on which they much Descant: and I confess it bore great Sway with me for a long time, especially as to the Validity of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Orders. Yet upon Mature Deliberation I found more of Pomp than real Solidity in this Pageant: though our Ears are continually filled with Clamour about it. For neither doth it agree only with the true Church, since themselves acknowledge it among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> (as in the Patriarchates of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexandria:</hi> the former whereof derives from S. <hi>Mark,</hi> the other down successively from S. <hi>Andrew</hi> to this day:) nor, if you will credit S. <hi>Ambrese de paenit.</hi> l. 1. c. 6. is Succession of Persons so much to be heeded as Succession of Doctrin; <hi>Non habent haereditatem Petri, qui fidem Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri non habent.</hi> Wherefore if the present <hi>Roman</hi> Church want the Life and Soul of True Apostolical Succession, to wit, Apostolical Doctrine, a meer local and titular Succession is little worth.</p>
            <p>But the Mischief is, that the visible Succession of Bishops in that Sea, is not so Glorious and Uninterrupted as is pretended. And this is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all Monuments of History and Antiquity, that it hath been fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stained by Simoniacal and Violent Entries upon the Popedom; by Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Intrusions, and by a perfect Alteration of the very Form and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Election appointed by the Apostles, and practised in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. For either S. <hi>Peter</hi> named his Successor, or he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the Clergy alone, or else by the Clergy and People, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Emperour. But now he is chosen by a pack of Cardinals, a sort of Clergy altogether unheard of in primitive Ages, all created by Popes themselves, some in Favour to their Kindred, others in Faction, and to curry Kindness with some Christian Princes, especially those of <hi>France,</hi> and the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> who alwayes have their Creatures very busie in the Conclave; most of them as fit for Clergy-men as <hi>S. Peter</hi> was for a Courtier, as my Lord of <hi>Hereford</hi> speaks in his Legacy; a Spruce, Delicate, Effeminate Clergy: (and the World talks far worse things of them) very fit persons for the Choice of <hi>S. Peters</hi> infallible Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.</p>

The truth is, this boasted succession is so weak a support to the Roman Cause, that their most confident Champions could never so much as pretend the very shadow of Divine Authority for it. <hi>Alphonsus Ã  Castro</hi> and others very frankly acknowledge it is not <hi>De fide,</hi> a matter of Faith, that this or that, or the present Pope is <hi>S. Peter's Successor.</hi> But of this more by and by. Nor is there the least agreement in Ecclesiastical History concerning the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Successor of <hi>S. Peter.</hi> Some put <hi>Linus</hi> next, some <hi>Clemens,</hi> some <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> And it is a most miserable Shift that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is put to, and below his great Wit, to affirm the business may be thus Composed; That <hi>S. Peter</hi> left his Episcopal Seat to <hi>Clement:</hi> but <hi>Clement,</hi> when <hi>S. Peter</hi> was dead, out of his Humility would not ascend the Chair, as long as <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus</hi> were living, who had been the <hi>Coadjuters</hi> of <hi>S. Peter</hi> in his Episcopal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: so <hi>Linus</hi> succeeded <hi>S. Peter, Cletus</hi> to <hi>Linus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> to <hi>Cletus.</hi> But if <hi>S. Peter</hi> left his Chair to <hi>Clement,</hi> how comes this Apostolical consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to be abolished, and why do not the Popes now design their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, but leave a matter of so high Consequence to the factious Canvassing of the Haughty Ambitious Cardinals? How durst <hi>Clement</hi> refuse the Charge; intrusted to him by so great an <hi>Apostle,</hi> and that only out of a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>A Man that duly ponders this Circumstance, might very well conclude it to be a most remarkable Providence of God, and intended for the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of that proud Church, that when they come to make good their claim to that Exorbitant, unlimited Authority they at this day Exercise in the Christian World, they should stumble at the very Threshold, as we say, and fail in the very first name of their Vaunted Catalogue. In a Word, all things here are dark and in a Riddle, and afford not sufficient matter even to ground an <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> upon.</p>
            <p>But what shall we think of those long and frequent Vacations in that See for some years together? and Schisms for 30 nay 70 years? Which was a long Vacation indeed; for it is <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> Rule, <hi>An uncertain Pope is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for none at all.</hi> Nay many and great Authors have put a Woman into the Succession; many of their Bishops have been Hereticks, and this makes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interruption: even Occult Heresie rendering the Pope, <hi>ipso sacto,</hi> none.</p>
            <p>Let Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> a Man of undoubted Authority with them, serve instead of a thousand Witnesses. He, treating of the year of our Lord, 912, thus represents the wretched, deformed Face of that Church. How filthy a time was it when Whores bare all the sway at <hi>Rome?</hi> At their pleasure Sees were changed, Bishopricks disposed of, and which is most horrible and scarce to be uttered, their <hi>Gallants</hi> were thrust into the Seat of <hi>Peter.</hi> We find no where any mention of Clergy choosing or giving Consent, all Canons were put to silence, the Pontifical Decrees were choaked, Antient Traditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and all Sacred Rites extinguished. Thus had <hi>Lust</hi> gotten every thing into its own hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100831:14"/>
Where did this Uninterrupted Succession sleep all this While? Well near 200 years together, saies the same Annalist, did these monstrous abuses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Certainly if Discontinuance of Time, or Illegal Entry can marr a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, this of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church is sufficiently spoiled. <hi>Benedict</hi> the <hi>9th</hi> was a Boy of 10 years old. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> a Hectoring Lad not above 18. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> was set up by that Infamous Strumpet <hi>Theodora:</hi> and her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Marozia</hi> by force of Arms deposed him. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> was Bastard to <hi>Sergius</hi> by <hi>Marozia,</hi> and was violently intruded into the Popedome by his Mother.</p>
            <p>It is not so much the wickedness of these Popes Lives, as the manner of their Creation, that we urge to invalidate the Succession. Above 50 Popes were thus installed successively for those 200 years: besides many other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, frequently occurring in History, wherein this applauded Succession hath been very notably disturbed.</p>
            <p>To which if we adjoin the 30 Schisms, wherein 2 and 3 Popes have been set up in opposition to one another; the matter will be out of all Controversie. One of these Schisms, <hi>viz.</hi> that between <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Urban</hi> lasted for 70 years, till the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was Elected Pope by the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> to put a period to that fatal Tragedy. And many of these Competitors had such Learned Advocates and Patrons, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> cannot assign which was the true Pope.<hi>â€”pudet haec opprobria vobisâ€”Et dici potuisse et non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuisse reselli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Unity is no less bragg'd of, than their Universality and Succession; and with as little Justice; for Unity without Truth and sincere Charity is but a Conspiracy or Confederation. I find <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 13. that in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Anti-Christ,</hi> they are of <hi>one mind,</hi> and make War with the Lamb. And the Devils themselves in the possess'd person could unite into a <hi>Legion.</hi> And if we a little better consider this pretended <hi>Roman</hi> Unity, it will soon be discovered to be purely slavish and enforced: an Unity of Fear more than of Affection; a product of the Inquisition rather than of Charity. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> seems to intimate as much; They cannot think otherwise, saith he, because they have subjugated their sence to the sence of another; meaning the Pope.</p>
            <p>Nor yet is this their Unity, let the Quality of it be what it will, so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as they would make us believe. How do the <hi>Jansenists</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi> at this day hug one another? The large Order of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> look upon the <hi>Jesuits</hi> as no better then <hi>Semi-Pelagians</hi> in the Doctrine of Grace and Free Will: and the <hi>Jesuits</hi> to requite them call them <hi>Calvinists.</hi> The <hi>Seculars</hi> and <hi>Regulars</hi> how Unanimous they are, appears by their continual Clashing. And those who are throughly acquainted with their Customs, may easily perceive that there are as many <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Factions</hi> in point of <hi>Opinion,</hi> as there are <hi>Religious Orders</hi> in that Church; and in point of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> as many parties as there are <hi>Religious Houses.</hi> But as for that real Unity, which


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100831:14"/>
according to <hi>Dominie. Bannes,</hi> in 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>a.</hi> 10. consists in having one God and Christ for our King, in being governed by the same Holy Law, in having the same Faith, Hope and Charity, the same Heavenly Example, one worship in Spirit and in Truth, one Communion or Communication of the Members; which is the Unity of that Church which includes all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful from the beginning of the World to the end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In short, such an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the Holy Scriptures require, in being derived from one beginning, which is the Holy Ghost, who as one Soul quickens and moves all the Parts: in having one Head which is Jesus Christ: and in being but one Body, partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Doctrine, Sacraments and Worship of God: This Unity by God's Grace all true Protestants breath after, as may apparently be evinced by the Harmony of their Confessions; although in points of smaller impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance there may be some little differences: and most of their Dissentions are rather Verbal then Real.</p>
            <p>As to the Sanctity of that Church, let but the Lives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops be perused, written by their own Authors (a noysomer Sink and Kennel of Abomination can never be raked up in all Antiquity: some <hi>Atheists,</hi> some <hi>Conjurers,</hi> some <hi>Adulterers, Murderers, Incestuous, Sodomites, Sim<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Bernard, Nic. Clemangis, Alvar, Pelagius, Claud. Espencaeus,</hi> &amp;c. and at least they will have little cause so boldly to challenge, and appropriate it to themselves above all their Neighbours. These things are sufficiently known to any that have viewed their Doctors, or conversed even with their Modern practices: (though themselves are very much amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed since the Reformation.) But I love not to tell stories out of the School, and I promised at first to refrain from personal Reflections. There are Books enough on this Subject, and the World talks sufficiently loud of it.</p>
            <p>If all the precedent Prerogatives signifie nothing, at last we must be over-born by whole Legions of Innumerable Miracles that are obtruded upon our Credit. But so spurious, so ridiculous, so impious many of them, that the more modest and discreet among themselves dare not own them. Their best Writers affirm, That Miracles are not necessary for the Being of a Church, but onely for the Begetting of a new Faith, or an Extraordinary Mission.</p>
            <p>Nay I may add not for an Extraordinary Mission neither; as we may see in many of the Prophets of the Old Testament, of whose Miracles not one word is mentioned. Nor are they at all to be expected from or by the Protestants, who neither profess a new Faith nor an Extraordinary Mission. The Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Saviour, his Apostles and the first Age of the Church, are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Seals</hi> to the Doctrine they own. And as for those so importunately urged by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> they are but too often convinced to be meer juggles, contrivances for filthy Lucre, Sleights to uphold some gainful Doctrine, or to advance the reputation of some particular place or Religious Order, done

A man that duly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the most palpable Cheats and Impostures of this kind daily practised in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for these By-Respects, would almost be of Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s mind, that it cannot be sufficiently made out, that ever so much as a Lame Horse was cured by way of Miracle in confirmation of any Popish Tenet.</p>
            <p>Some insist much on the Outward Prosperity, Pomp, Splendour and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of their Church. To this the Wise Man hath given an answer, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>Our Works are in the hand of God, and no man knows either Love or Hatred by all that is before him.</hi> Nay, our Saviour puts it down as a Mark of the false Church. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20. <hi>Verily I say unto you, that you shall weep and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the World shall rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains then, that the onely Certain and Evident marks of a True Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Church are, <hi>The Sincere Preaching of God's Word,</hi> and a <hi>Due Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Sacraments.</hi> To which may be annexed <hi>Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;</hi> but this is reducible to the other two. These are All that the Holy Scriptures afford us. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go and Teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you.</hi> Act. 2. 42. <hi>And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrin and Fellowship, and in Breaking of Bread, and Prayers.</hi>

            <p>Having thus survey'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in general, it will hardly be thought Good Manners, if we neglect his Holiness the Pope in particular, or as some are pleased to flatter him, <hi>The Church Virtual.</hi> For what ever stir<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It is the express Doctrin of S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> (and his Doctrin in that Church is little less than Canonized) 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>a.</hi> 10. that the making of a true Creed belongs to the Pope; as all other things do which belong to the Whole Church: and that the Whole Authority of the Universal Church abides in him. 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 12. <hi>a.</hi> 2. Thus as they take all Authority and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency from the Scripture and give it to the Church, so all the Churche's Authority they attribute to the Pope. <hi>Gregorius de Valentia,</hi> one of the Learnedst Jesuits, tells us plainly, That by the Church they mean <hi>Its Head;</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop, in whom resides the full Authority of the Church, when he pleases to Determin matters of Faith, whether he d th it with a Council or without. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teaches, that the Pope himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Council may decree matters of Faith. <hi>Bannes</hi> affirms, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Universal Church, the Authority of a Council, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100831:15"/>
of the Pope, are one and the same thing. <hi>The Canon Law in Sext. Extrav. Johan.</hi> 22. <hi>c. Cum inter. in Gloss.</hi> speaks thus, It is Heresie to think <hi>Our Lord God the Pope</hi> may not Decree as he doth. And <hi>Distinct.</hi> 19. <hi>in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> His Rescripts and Decretal Epistles are Canonical Scripture.</p>
            <p>All which passages clearly convince us what is the meaning of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Braggs of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>His Holyness must excuse me, if, being no Courtier, I address not my self to him in the phrase of the Roman Inscription to <hi>Paul</hi> the V. yet to be seen in that City, saluting him as a <hi>Vice-God,</hi> and the Stout Assertor of the <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Omnipotency:</hi> or as the <hi>Gloss of the Canon Law</hi> in their last and best Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> 1580, and <hi>Parisian,</hi> 1612. <hi>Our Lord God the Pope.</hi> Waving therefore these Ceremonies, I shall summarily consider his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both what he pretends to, and what it really is.</p>
            <p>And here starts forth a material Difficulty, even at our first setting out: namely, Whether S. <hi>Peter,</hi> whence all this Power and Soveraignty is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, were himself Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or were indeed ever at <hi>Rome?</hi> I will not Deny either, because I know many of the Antients plead for both. But the Point being onely grounded on Humane Authority (for Divine Authority seems rather to contradict it) <hi>i. e.</hi> Ecclesiastical History; and the Differences among the Reporters being so Many and so Considerable, both in Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and divers other Weighty Circumstances; and the Probabilities that are produced against it being not altogether Contemptible, I hope a Man may be excused from being a <hi>Damn'd Hererick,</hi> if he do not believe it to be a Fundamental Article of Faith <hi>(The Article of the Standing or Falling Church,</hi> sayes a Modern Famous Controvertist) and consequently hath a Meaner Esteem for all that prodigious Train of Positions, which are thence deduced.</p>
            <p>These following Inducements make it at least Doubtful whether S. <hi>Peter</hi> ever was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or was ever there.</p>
            <p>For his ever having been at <hi>Rome,</hi> we do not much stand upon it. But the Reasons and Testimonies brought out of Humane Histories (which onely mention it) are so uncertain and involv'd with such difficulties, as may make any Man deservedly question it. <hi>Vellenus</hi> hath published several Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he was never there. And those Authorities of the Fathers that are alleged for it are so Various, that the Learned'st Romanists cannot r. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them. <hi>Marsilius Patavinus</hi> in his <hi>Defens. Pacis, part.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. sayes, By Scripture it cannot be made out, either that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that he was ever there at all: and when he considers the Ecclesiastical Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians that affirm it, he doth it so, that it is evident he doth not believe them. It is true, S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his 1. Ep. <hi>c.</hi> 5. 13. writes as from <hi>Babylon;</hi> but that <hi>Babylon</hi> was in <hi>Assyria.</hi> For though in the Apocalyptical Visions, <hi>Rome</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet in a plain Epistolary Salutation there was no reason at all for such a Trope. Nor doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>S. Luke,</hi> who make frequent mention of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever call it <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100831:16"/>
There is indeed an <hi>Old Chair</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> pretended to be S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and on certain daies it is shewn to the people; as likewise a <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> and certain parts of his Body as Relicks. But the Jugling and Imposture with Reliques and such like Trumpery is so well known, that the World hath long since lessen'd her Credit to such Monuments. Nor hath it been the lowest part of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Policy for many Ages with Feigned Miracles, Counterfeit Relicks, and Forged Records and Legends to raise in the Vulgar an Opinion of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and so maintain her Grandeur. But we have been too long on this Impertinency.</p>
            <p>Whether He was ever Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> deserves our stricter Examination. Holy Writ seems not silent here, as in the former Case, but fully Opposite.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> by the Instinct of the Holy Ghost made an Accord that S. <hi>Peter</hi> should Preach to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Whereupon in the Sacred Text S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s peculiar Title is, <hi>The Apostle of the Circumcision:</hi> and Consequent to his Charge we see, that he wrote his Epistles to the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Jews: neither did he direct any to, or date any from <hi>Rome.</hi> So that it is incredible he should be Bishop or Resident there for 25 years. Whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> was the <hi>Great Doctor and Apostle of the Gentiles,</hi> and both writ to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and taught and was imprisoned at <hi>Rome</hi> for several Years, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from Scripture. Again, the Authours of this Story (the first whereof were probably <hi>Papias</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the one too Credulous and Erroneous, the other a Counterfeit) are wholly at a loss in declaring when S. <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> how long he sat there, when he dyed, and who were his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours. And the most tolerable Account that is given by the best Writers, How S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the 5th Year after Christ's Passion, went to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and there fix'd his Episcopal See for 7 years, thence removed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 25 Years; is no waies coherent with what is related of S. <hi>Peter, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. &amp; 15. From which places it is manifest, that S <hi>Peter</hi>'s most usual Abode was at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at least till the 18th year after Christ's death, and the 17th of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Conversion. Nor is it likely that S. <hi>Peter</hi> setled his Chair at <hi>Antioch</hi> so long, since <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. we read only of his passing by there; and that he was so far from behaving himself as their Bishop, that he seems to have understood little of the Affairs of that Church, till S. <hi>Paul</hi> had rightly informed him</p>
            <p>In the 16. to the <hi>Romans</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> salutes very many by name, yet takes not the least notice of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor gives them the least account where he was, or how he did: which seems something odd, if S. <hi>Peter</hi> had then been their <hi>Soveraign Pastor.</hi> And when S. <hi>Paul</hi> was himself at <hi>Rome,</hi> and writ diverse Epistles in the Reign of <hi>Nero</hi> (at which time <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would have S. <hi>Peter</hi> to have been at <hi>Rome)</hi> though he make mention of many others of inferior rank, yet not one syllable of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Nay he generally denies that there was any such present with him. <hi>Colos.</hi> 4. 11. And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. he griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously complains that at his first Answer, when he appeared before <hi>Nero,</hi> All


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100831:16"/>
men forsook him. And when S. <hi>Paul</hi> came first to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Jews there, who were S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s peculiar charge, seemed to know nothing of the Gospel. <hi>Act.</hi> 28. Thus S. <hi>Peter</hi> must be Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> 25 years, and yet never be at <hi>Rome,</hi> when ever the Scripture mentions the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: And S. <hi>Paul</hi> could never find him there, though he is reported to be Martyred there at the same time with him.</p>
            <p>We see then upon how tottering a Foundation this mighty Fabrick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: I mean, how justly Questionable the Papal Monarchy is, even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and to its very <hi>An sit.</hi> But perhaps it may plead better for it self in point of <hi>Right and Equity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will briefly here inquire into two things. 1. What Authority S. <hi>Peter</hi> had. 2. What Authority the Pope pretends to derive from him, and how justly.</p>
            <p>That our Lord and Saviour never intended such an <hi>Absolute, Arbitrary, Soveraign, Monarchical Government</hi> in his Church, as the Pope at this day exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises both over Clergy and Layity, is as evident in the Gospel as any Truth there contained. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 25. <hi>You know,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>that the Princes of the Gentiles exercise Dominton over them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But it shall not be so among you: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will be great among you, let him be your servant.</hi> And the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. reckoning up the whole <hi>Sacred Oeconomy, Ministry and Government of the Church,</hi> lets not fall one word concerning a <hi>Visible Monarch: He gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors and Teachers; for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the Body of Christ.</hi> And when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends Unity, by reason of one Body, one Spirit, one Hope, one Faith, one Baptism, one Lord, there is no mention at all of any Pontifical Monarch.</p>
            <p>In all the New Testament there is not any one called the Head of the Church, but only our Blessed Saviour. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>God hath put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, and given him to be Head over all things to his Church.</hi> And chap. 4. 15. <hi>Grow up to him in all things, who is the Head, even Christ.</hi> Colos. 1. 18. <hi>He is the Head of the Body, the Church.</hi> Wherefore they are highly injurious to our Saviour who set up any other.</p>
            <p>Nor do Protestant Princes take themselves to be Heads of their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, in any other sence than the good Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Juda</hi> were; to defend the Orthodox Religion, and maintain good Order and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in the Church; and take cognizance of abuses crept in among any persons Ecclesiastical or Civil, and reform what they find amiss, according to the Canon of the Scripture, by the advice of their Chief Clergy. And not as the Papists impertinently object concerning Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that she had assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med power to preach, administer the Sacraments <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this, as I said before, is the undoubted Right of Soveraign Princes in their own Territories, and was practised by the Good Princes under the Old Law, with great Commendation and Reward. It was likewise promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100831:17"/>
to the New, That <hi>Kings</hi> should be <hi>Nursing Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Queens Nursing Mothers</hi> to the Church.</p>
            <p>In fine, that Paternal Wisdom and Providence of God, which so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully revealed to us All matters of importanee for our own private Good, for the Being or Well-being of his Church; (and certainly this great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Jurisdiction most be of that Nature) that the most Curious Inquirer can desire nothing more; and which did under the <hi>Mosaical Dispensation</hi> so exactly describe the Condition and Power of the High Priest, even to the minute Circumstances of his Garments; so that none could be so stupid among the Jews, but if he read the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> he might sufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that there was a High Priest constituted, and what Authority he had; would certainly have left us some intimation of the like Regiment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, had there been any such matter to be expected. Whereas on the contrary we cannot there find so much as the Name or Title of any such Dignity, nor of any Seat appointed for his Residence; no singular Office is assigned to him above others, no Ensigns of Soveraignty are recorded, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by He might be distinguished from others, no manner of Succession is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for; nor is there the least practice or exercise of such a singular Absolute Power so much as hinted at in the whole New Testament. And therefore we may justly conclude it to be an upstart Usurpation, and no Authority of Divine Institution.</p>
            <p>There are but two passages in Scripture that with any tollerable shew can be made use of, to countenance this Supremacy that is so much urged to be conferred on S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and intayled on his Successors. The one, wherein it seems to be promised; the other, wherein they say it was actually bestowed.</p>
            <p>The first is that famous place, the <hi>Achilles</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cause. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 17, 18. <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in Heaven.</hi> These words which they think so plain and obvious, do yet contain two <hi>Metaphors</hi> of a <hi>Rock</hi> and the <hi>Keys;</hi> and I cannot find in any other part of Scripture that they are explained in the <hi>Romanists</hi> sence, <hi>Simply</hi> and without <hi>a Metaphor.</hi> I am sure they were not so easie to the Aposiles themselves, nor did they understand thereby any principality intended for S. <hi>Peter;</hi> as appears by sundry contentions among them, after these words were spoken, who should be the Chiefest.</p>
            <p>Nor can the Antient Fathers, Good men, discover any such Energy or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in them for S <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Pope. For our Saviour doth not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and literally affirm that he will build his Church upon S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rock which he confess'd: <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>es</hi> Petrus: Petra <hi>autem erat Christus.</hi> It was not said to him, Thou art the Rock, but Thou art <hi>Peter:</hi> for the Rock was Christ: says <hi>S. Augustin, Retract. l. c.</hi> 21. The same Father in his 124 <hi>Tract. on S. Joh. &amp; Ser.</hi> 13. <hi>deVer. Dom.</hi> thus paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses this Text: <hi>Upon this Rock which thou hast confessed; upon this Rock which thou hast acknowledg'd,</hi> (saying, <hi>Thou art Christ the Son of the Living God) will I build my Church:</hi> that is, upon my self, the Son of the Living God will I build my Church: I will build Thee upon Me, not Me upon Thee. For the Rock was Christ, whereon <hi>Peter</hi> himself was built. I am punctual in citing this Great Doctor and Father of the Church, because the <hi>Romanists</hi> give out that they desire to stand to the alone Judgment of this Learned Father.</p>
            <p>The Holy Martyr S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> could not apprehend any such Intrigue in these words. <hi>l. de Unit. Eccles. The rest of the Apostles,</hi> saith he, <hi>were the same that</hi> Peter <hi>was, being endowed with an equal share both of Honour and Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor S. <hi>Ambrose, Serm.</hi> 66. <hi>S.</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>were eminent among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and it is doubtful which is to he preferred before the other.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>S. Hillary. l.</hi> 6. <hi>de Trin. S. Chrysost. hom.</hi> 55. <hi>in Matth. Euseb. Emissen. Greg. the Great. V. Beda. Haymo, the Gloss of Gratian, Lyra,</hi> and a multitude of others, understand the Text of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> doth. Cardinal <hi>Cusanus l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>Concord. Cath.</hi> is very positive, that nothing was here said to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but what was said to the rest of the Apostles  And the words of <hi>Sixtus Senensis,</hi> a very Learned Pontifician, <hi>Biblioth. l.</hi> 6. are worth our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. <hi>We believe and acknowledge with a sure faith, that Christ is the first and Chief Foundation of the Whole Ecclesiastical Edifice: But we also affirm that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Foundation there are other Rocks lay'd, namely</hi> Peter <hi>and the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, whom</hi> John <hi>in the Apocalypse names the Twelve Foundations of the Heavenly Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In sum, I find three Interpretations of these words among the Antients: <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ is the Rock: That the Confession, Faith and Doctrine of Christ is the Rock; and that <hi>S. Peter</hi> himself as an Apostle, is Metonymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally a partial Rock. All which meanings agree very well together, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing favour the Supremacy that the <hi>Romanists</hi> desire.</p>
            <p>Nor do the Protestants deny S. <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>Primacy</hi> of Authority and Spiritual Jurisdiction over the Church as an Apostle: or in respect of his Fellow Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles a <hi>Primacy</hi> of Order, Calling, Graces, Gifts, Courage, &amp;c. or that he was a Ministerial Rock. But since the Rock and the Keys signifie the same thing, to wit, the power of Binding and Loosing; which <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. is expresly promised to all the Apostles; and the same words, of Binding and Loosing are there used, which were before to S. <hi>Peter:</hi> and after the Resurrection, <hi>John</hi> 20. 21. the same power was amply bestowed on all the Apostles equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and their Successors: He breathed on his Disciples, saying: <hi>As my Father sent me, even so send I you<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Receive you the Holy Ghost, Whose sins you retain they are retained, and whose sins you remit they are remitted;</hi> so that no mans Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction came from <hi>Peter</hi> to him, but every one had it alike and equally from

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100831:18"/>
alas, this is too scant for his pretended Successour, as we shall now manifest.</p>
            <p>And I shall be a little more exact in this <hi>Seasonable Argument</hi> because that I know many of our <hi>English</hi> Roman Catholicks will not believe that this Vast, Unlimited Power is owned by their Church; but is onely the product of the Flattery of private Doctors, and the Pope's particular Parasites.</p>
            <p>I will onely mention how the Usurpings, Innovations and Incroachments of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops have been constantly opposed by the Greatest part of Christendom in all Ages.</p>
            <p>In the first General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> he was consined to his own particular District; as the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and others were to theirs. In the first General Councils of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Provinces of the World were distinguished, and the Patriarchs restrained to their own Circuits, and He of <hi>Constantinople</hi> is by name made Equal to Him of <hi>Rome</hi> in all Ecclesiastical Matters. He of <hi>Rome</hi> had indeed the Chief Honour; but that consisted not in Jurisdiction, but in sitting in the first place, and such like Ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>les.</p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> confirms the same Decrees, and adds withal, 
<q>Our Fathers gave the Privileges to the Seat of Elder <hi>Rome;</hi> because that City had the Empire: and the 150 Bishops assembled at the Council of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> moved with the same reason, gave the same Privilege to the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Throne of New <hi>Rome:</hi> thinking it reasonable, that the City which is honoured with the Empire and Senate, should also have <hi>Equal</hi> Privileges with Elder <hi>Rome,</hi> and in Ecclesiastical Matters be advanced <hi>alike</hi> with her.</q> Another Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> Enacted the same. But the Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, Anno</hi> 418. consisting of 217 Bishops, is most Worthy of our Remark.</p>
            <p>In this Council, when <hi>Sozymus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> claimed a Right to receive Appeals from all parts of the World, and pretended a Canon of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council that should give it him: the Bishops strongly debated the Matter, and having searched the Original Copies of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, whereby the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth of his Claim was discovered, they wrote sharply to him, not to meddle any more with their Provinces, nor admit into his Fellowship such as they had Excommunicated. Telling him he had nothing to do in their Causes, either to bring them to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to send legats to hear them at home: and that this pretence of his was expresly against the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</p>
            <p>The Evidence of this Great Testimony stands to this day unanswerable by the <hi>Roman</hi> Party. It is abundantly known how Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> was sleighted by S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> by the Bishops of the East. But this is an Infinite Theme, and I must not forget my promised Brevity.</p>
            <p>I shall onely Request the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman-</hi>Catholick Persuasion, seriously to lay to heart what Trivial Grounds this Grand Article of their Church, the Pope's Supremacy, even in Ecclesiastical Affairs, is founded upon; and to consider how many Difficulties must be cleared to make it a <hi>probable Tale.</hi> 1. That S. <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. That he dyed at <hi>Rome</hi> by the special Command of Christ. 3. That he dyed Invested with such a


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100831:19"/>
Supremacy, as is now Exercised in that Church. 4. That his so dying there is sufficient (without a new Revelation from God) to make the Succession of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> of Divine Authority.</p>
            <p>We shall now take a View of that <hi>Grand Machine</hi> of the Pope's power over Temporal Princes, and make it most evident, that it is an Article and Doctrin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and being so, that this alone were a sufficient Motive to forsake her Communion, since She Teaches Justifies and strictly Commands (even under the penalty of being accounted no Christians) Treason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. The present Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> hath written a Learned and Satisfactory Treatise on this Subject, and I find his Lordship very faithful in his Citations. Wherefore I may be the more sparing.</p>
            <p>However, because I heartily desire, that Honoured, Pious and Loyal Persons may not unwarily ingage their Liberties, Estates and Lives for the Maintainance of so Extravagant and Tyrannical a Power, which hath in all Ages caused so many disinal Tragedies in the Christian World, and is in it self Fatal and Destructive to all Civil Government, I shall briefly treat of this Matter, to undeceive others: especially since I was herein miserably seduced my self, till I had Maturely and Exactly Examined the whole Business.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with General Councils, whose Decrees if they will not admit, I confess I as yet understand not what the Doctrin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is, nor do I know where to find it.</p>
            <p>The Third Council of <hi>Lateran, c.</hi> 27. after it had Condemned and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated many Hereticks, (and you must know that All Protestants are both accounted so, and as such, are once every year solemnly accursed by His Holyness in Person on <hi>Maundy Thursday:)</hi> It Absolves All that had sworn Fidelity or Homage to them, from those Oaths <hi>(and we know who they are, to whom Fidelity and Homage, strictly speaking, is due:)</hi> and they are required in Order to the Remission of their Sins, <hi>to fight</hi> against them. And those who dye doing Penance in that manner, may undoubtedly expect Indulgence for their Sins, with Eternal Rewards. Then by the Authority of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> the Council remits to all who shall <hi>rise and fight</hi> against them, two years penance.</p>
            <p>Here a General Council uses all its Industry to poyson people with Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Doctrin, and calls Treason, <hi>Doing of Penance.</hi> Not long after, Pope <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestin,</hi> Predecessor to <hi>Innocent the Third.</hi> with more than <hi>Luciferian</hi> Arrogance, sets the Crown on the Head of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th with his two feet, and then kicks it off again. And the fact is produced by no meaner a Person than Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> to shew that it is in the Pope's power to <hi>Give</hi> and <hi>Take away</hi> Empires. But to as much purpose as He produced that Text, <hi>Rise Peter, Kill and Eat;</hi> to incense <hi>Paul the 5th</hi> against the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Evidence shall be the Fourth Great, and, as they call it, Most General Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> wherein were assembled 1200 of one sort or other. These, C. 3. make a Decree, 
<q>That the Aid of Secular Princes should


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100831:19"/>
be required for the Rooting out of Hereticks (i. e, <hi>All that are not of the Roman Communion)</hi> and that when the Temporal Lord, required and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the Church, shall neglect to purge his Territory from Heretical Wickedness, He shall be Excommunicated by the Metropolitan and his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragans. And if he persist in neglecting to give satisfaction for the space of a year, let him be signified to the Pope, that he from thenceforth may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Subjects discharged from their Obedience, and expose his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory to be seized on by Catholicks, who having exterminated the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, shall possess it without Contradiction, and preserve it in the Purity of the Faith. So as no Injury be done to the Right of the Supreme Lord, where there is such; provided He do not any ways oppose himself. And the Law is to take place in them who have no Superiour Lord.â€”</q>
Which Last Clause perfectly comprehends Soveraign Princes, and so anticipates that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply which some make, That the Decree was only made for Feudatory and Subordinate Princes.</p>
            <p>And whereas some few deny it to be a General Council, and that it made any Canons; it is a most Impudent Cavil. For both the Council and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons have been and are Universally received by the Roman Church: the Council as General, and Approved so by <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. and the Canons as Authentick. All their Writers concerning Councils put this down among the General ones, <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap> commonly call it the <hi>Great General Council of</hi> Lateran: and <hi>Joverius</hi> says, he cannot see with what face a Man dare deny it. They always put it among those Councils that are Approved by the Church: for you must know that some are Reprobated, some are partly Approbated and partly Reprobated. Their Canon Law so esteems of it. The Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> puts it among those General Councils, to the Observation whereof the Popes were to swear at their Installment. The Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which I hope none will boggle at, <hi>Sess</hi> 24. <hi>C.</hi> 5. in express terms calls it a <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> and Confirms one of its Canons. To which I may add, because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, a Synod at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where this Council was received for <hi>England.</hi> And though some Princes that were deposed out of the Pope's meer Spite and Malice, got some Advocates to write for them, and Synods of Bishops to Protest against the Pope's Proceedings: yet in the case of <hi>Pretended Heresie,</hi> (which neerly touches Protestant Princes) not one Writer or Bishop appears in Vindication of the Temporal Power. A shrewd Sign that this Deposing Heretical Magistrates, is in General the Romish Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The General Council of <hi>Lions</hi> is next. It was summoned by <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4th, against the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the 2d. Here the Pope having consulted with the Council, Declares the Emperour deprived by God of his Dominions: and thereupon they <hi>Actually Depose him,</hi> and <hi>Absolve</hi> All from their Oaths of Fidelity to him: strictly charging All persons to acknowledge him no more for Emperour, and denouncing All that did otherwise, Excommunicated <hi>Ipso facto.</hi> So we have another whole General Council concurring with the


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100831:20"/>
Pope in asserting this <hi>Deposing Power,</hi> and with Candles burning in their hands, thundering out Sentence against the poor Emperour.</p>
            <p>In the Council of <hi>Constance, Sess.</hi> 19. we often meet with this Clause, 
<q>That All Breakers of their Privileges, whether Emperours, Kings, or any other Degree, were thereby <hi>Ipso facto</hi> subjected to the Banns, Punishments and Censures in the Council of <hi>Lateran:</hi>
               </q> and <hi>Sess.</hi> 17. in the Pass they gave to the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> they decree, That whatsoever Person, either King, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hinder him in his Journey, he is <hi>Ipso sacto</hi> deprived of all Honour, Dignity, Office or Benefice, whether Ecclesiastical or Secular.</p>
            <p>It is true, with much Importunity and Danger, <hi>Gerson</hi> procured a Decree in this council that No Subject should Murder his Prince. But that Practice was only condemned in such as did it, <hi>without waiting the Sentence of any Judge whatsoever.</hi> So that if Sentence be past by the Spiritual Judge, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this Decree, a Prince may be Assassinated. But there is a further My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in it. For a King once declared to be no more such, <hi>i. e.</hi> being Deposed, He then becomes a Rebel and an Usurper, according to their Principles, and then it is lawful to kill him.</p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Siena</hi> confirms all the former Decrees made against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and the Favourers of Heresie are declared liable to all Pains and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Hereticks: and consequently to the Greatest of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Deposition.</p>
            <p>The Council at <hi>Basil</hi> rati<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s the Decree of <hi>Constance</hi> by which, Emperours and Kings, that presumed to hinder any from coming to the Council, are subjected to excommunication, Interdicts, and other Punishments Spiritual and Temporal.</p>
            <p>Finally, the <hi>Council of Trent<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> though the world was then much changed, and they durst not trample on Crowned Heads as formerly, yet they would still be nibling at this sweet Morsel, as near as they could, and still endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though covertly, to continue the Claim to this <hi>Deposing Authority.</hi> For in the Decree against D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>els, <hi>Sess.</hi> 25. <hi>c.</hi> 19. they declare, <hi>If any Emperours and Kings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did assign a field for a Combate, they did thereby lose their Right to that place, and the City, Castle, or other places about it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Councils then, as surely they are, be fit deliverers of the Churches sence, we have here no less than seven General Councils to prove this to be the Churche's Doctrine. For my own part, I can see no ways they can extricate themselves, but either by Confessing their Church hath erred, or by obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going on in a most wretched Justification of such Damnable Tenents and Practices.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more to do in this business, but by way of surplusage to give a General Touch at these following particulars.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Book of the Sacred Ceremonies</hi> (which is Authentick and of great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem with the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> the Emperour as soon as he sees the Pope, must bare-headed, bow, till his knee touch the Ground, and worship the Pope: coming nearer he must bow again, and when he comes to the Pope


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100831:20"/>
he must bow a third Time, and devoutly kiss the Pope's Toe. The same book informs us that the Pope never gives any Reverence to any Mortal, either by rising up, or uncovering or bowing his head. That the Emperour must hold the Pope's stirrup till he gets on horseback and then lead the Horse for some paces. And some mean spirited Emperors have <hi>de facto</hi> performed these slavish offices.</p>
            <p>The Emperour must swear <hi>Fealty</hi> to the Pope, and be his <hi>Hector</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all his Rights and Honours. That horrid <hi>Extravagant of Boniface. VIII.</hi> makes it absolutely necessary to Salvation; that all Christians be subject to the Pope; who hath <hi>both the Swords,</hi> and Judgeth all Men, and is Judged of None. And the Gloss upon that Extravagant dares to say our Saviour had not done discreetly, unless he had left such a Vicar behind him.</p>

                  </gap>scomus,</hi> Vicar General to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Bononia,</hi> and a great Lawyer, terms the Pope the Universal Judge, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and saies that God's Tribunal and the Pope's are one and the same, that they have the same Consistory, and therefore all other powers are his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that the Pope is judged of none but God, not of the Emperour, Kings, Clergy or Laity.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, <hi>Extra. de Major.</hi> gives this description of the Papal power, that it is as much greater than the Imperial, as the Sun is than the Moon. And the Gloss saies that is 47 times greater: but the note in the Margin puts 57 times: nay there is an Author that adds 7744 times. This Decr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tal of <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. and the forecited Extravagant of <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. are both put into the body of the Canon Law.</p>
            <p>It would be endless to enumerate the <hi>Romish</hi> Authors that defend this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious power of deposing Kings. <hi>Bellarmin, Suarez, Sa Mariana,</hi> maintain and prove this Doctrine. Nor do I know one Jesuit that teaches the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And it is very well worth our notice what an odd kind of answer Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> gave to King <hi>James,</hi> who demanded of him what he thought Subjects ought to do in the case of the Pope's deposing a Prince? The <hi>Jesuit</hi> gives this sly return: I will pray for Peace and Tranquillity between both Parties; I will exhort all to do good offices conducing thereto, and will rather dye than any wayes be accessory to your Majestie's death. And no more could be got from him but this <hi>Compliment.</hi> But else where he told the King more plainly, that he disclaimed any singular opinion of his own, or more than the Definitions of Councils and Consent of Divines did force him to hold. And what those are, we have pretty well discovered.</p>
            <p>The Canonists, Casuists and Schoolmen are <hi>Generally,</hi> if not <hi>Universally</hi> of this opinion, some teach that it is evident to all, that Emperors are to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived and Deposed by the Pope, not onely for things pertaining to Faith,


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100831:21"/>
but for Manners, Others, that the Secular Power is subject to the Spiritual, and that it is no Usurpation, if the Spiritual judge the Secular: and that the Pope hath Supreme Power over Christian Kings and Princes and may Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, <hi>Depose</hi> and <hi>put others in their places:</hi> that he may deprive a King of Royal Dignity for <hi>Heresie, Schisme or any intolerable Crime, Negligence or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyness; if in great matters he break his Oath, or oppress the Church,</hi> and several other Cases: and that the Pope himself is sole Judge both of the Crime and of the Condemnation. And <hi>Bzovius de Pontifice, Rom. c.</hi> 46. p. 611. gives us a Catalogue of above 30 Kings and Princes who have <hi>de facto</hi> been Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or by Anathema's damn'd by the Pope. They count them Martyrs that dye for the maintaining this Power; which cannot be unless they Esteem it an Article of Faith. And we have a late Instance of <hi>F. Paul Magdalen,</hi> alias <hi>Henry Heath,</hi> a Learned and in his way Pious, <hi>Franciscan,</hi> who was put to death by the Long Parliament about the year 1643. Who just before his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution being desired to give his Judgment of the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> (which chiefly concerns our present purpose) declared it absolutely unlawful, and that he would as soon lay down his Life for the Refusal of it, as for any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Roman Belief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eman. Sa</hi> is not ashamed to publish that if a Clergy Man rebell against his King it is no Treason, because Clergy men are not the Kings Subjects. <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism. Confess. verbo Clericus.</hi> Others, (though I will not say this is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taught) that Faith is not to be kept with <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And if my Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fail not, the Famous <hi>Navar</hi> hath written a whole Tract in Defence of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation and Mental Reservation, and takes upon him the Defence of the Noble Society of <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he calls them, for Universally teaching it: and to my knowledge practising it.</p>
            <p>It were very Easy to collect these Corollaries out of the Canon Law, and the Decretal of <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIII. That Emperors and Kings are the Popes Subjects; that they may be Deposed for Heresie and any great Sin: that the Pope hath power over the whole World in Spirituals and Temporals, and that he hath this Temporal power in a more worthy, Superior and perfect manner than Temporal Princes: that Statutes made by Lay Men do not bind the Clergy: that it is necessary to Salvation to be subject to the Pope, and he who affirms the contrary is no Christian; without any hope or possibility of Salvation. <hi>A most Pious and Charitable Rhapsody of Canonical Theology!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now you must understand that this Canon Law is approved, received and obeyed in that Church, as The Rule of Justice in All their Courts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories. In this we further learn, that the Holy Church by her frequent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>absolves Subjects</hi> from their Oaths to Superiors; and it exemplifies in Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> who deposed the King of <hi>France,</hi> not so much for his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as for his Unprofitableness. And Cardinal <hi>Turrecremata</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this Canon proves that Subjects, if they have the Popes Consent may Depose their Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100831:21"/>
The Bulls os many Popes against the Princes both of our own and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are too well known, and may at any time be seen in the <hi>Roman Bullary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To draw to a Conclusion in this Odious Matter. Our Country Man <hi>Creswell</hi> the Jesuite in his <hi>Philopater. sect.</hi> 2. affirms, That it is the Opinion of <hi>All</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that Subjects are bound to Depose an Heretical King: that they are obliged by the Law of God, by the most strick bonds of Conscience and utmost peril of their Souls to do this. <hi>Bellarmine de Rom. Pontif. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 7. assures us, it is the Consent of <hi>All</hi> Roman Catholicks, that Heretical Princes, <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Ought</hi> to be Deprived of their Dominions. And the <hi>English</hi> Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi> speaking how S. <hi>Thomas</hi> defended this Position, and how Cardinal <hi>Tolet</hi> expounds him, adds these words of his own (in his Answer to the Book of <hi>English Justice)</hi> Thus doth this Notable School-man write: Neither do we know <hi>any Catholick Divine</hi> of any Age to say the contrary.</p>
            <p>If now, the Testimonies of their Own most eminent Writers, their established Laws and Canons, their Authentick Papal Bulls and Decretal Constitutions, the Decrees and Canons of their own General Councils (the confess'd Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of their whole Church) seconded by Actual Deposing of Emperours <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not undeniable Evidence that this Seditious, Desperate and Pernicious Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, is the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; I must humbly crave Pardon for my Ignorance in their Faith, and must so far disown my self from ever having Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, that I never understood their Doctrine, and consequently never was a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick.</p>
            <p>But how Repugnant are these Positions to the Doctrine and Example of our Humble, Meek <hi>Jesus</hi> and his Apostles? Learn of me for I am Meek and Lowly. The Son of man came not to be Ministred to, but to Minister. My Kingdom is not of this World. Man, who made me a Judge or Divider over you? <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 14. If I your Lord and Master have washed your feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Render to <hi>Caesar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caesar's.</hi> And He himself paid Tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and made S. <hi>Peter</hi> do so too. He submitted to the Power and Jurisdiction of <hi>Pilate,</hi> who was <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Deputy. And this not <hi>quia deerant Vires,</hi> because he wanted power to resist (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> fondly affirms of the Primitive Christians:) for He could have called for more than 12 Legions of Angels. Nay so far was He from granting the <hi>Two Swords,</hi> so much boasted of, to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that he severely checks him for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Use of <hi>one.</hi> And the Two Princes of the Apostles, as they are styled, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> were perfectly of their Master's temper in this point. The former would not permit a Common Centurion to fall down at his feet, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 25. and his Doctrine was far different from his Successors at <hi>Rome,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: Whether it be to the King, as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fear God, Honour the King.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> preaches the very same. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13 1. <hi>&amp;c. Let every Soul be subject to the Higher Powers, &amp;c. For he bears not the Sword in vain. Wherefore you must needs be subject not only for Wrath, but for Conscience sake.</hi> And in matter of Jurisdiction he expresly <hi>Appeals</hi> to the Judgment Seat of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> the Emperour.</p>
            <p>And till the Mystery of Iniquity had gained Head, the <hi>Roman</hi> Popes themselves


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100831:22"/>
spake in a different Dialect from what they now use. We were in hopes, says Pope <hi>Leo, Ep.</hi> 44. to the Emperour <hi>Marcianus,</hi> that your Clemency would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended so far as to have deferred the Council; but since You resolve it should be kept, I have sent thither <hi>Paschasme.</hi> Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> speaks thus to another Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, Hath not the <hi>Roman</hi> Church sent her Legats to the Council when you <hi>Commanded</hi> it? We offer these things to your Piety, says Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Basilius,</hi> with all Humility, &amp; <hi>veluti praesentes Genibus Adv l<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Having thus as briefly as the matter would permit, dispatched what was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my Design of penning this Discourse, and what had the greatest Insluence on the satisfying my own mind, I shall make much shorter work with what follows.</p>
            <p>General Councils, when truly so, are highly venerated by Protestants, and the Four first, so much honoured by <hi>S. Gregory the Great,</hi> are better observ'd by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than by that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor are we so severe as S. <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zian.

Which Censure is certainly true of those Conventions which have been for diverse Ages last past. No, we desire nothing more than a Free, General Council to conclude differences in Religion: and are most ready to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Determinations of it, and yield the same Authority to it, which the Antient Church in the days of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, <hi>Theodosius,</hi> &amp;c. and which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And that we may not be slandered as being our own Judges, We only desire it may be Qualified according to Cardinal <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>sanus</hi> his Doctrine. <hi>Concord, Cath. l.</hi> 2. Where he declares that a Compleat General Council consists of All the Patriarchs and Principal Governours of the Universal Church. That a Council kept by the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop, and those only who are subject to him, excluding others, is but a particular Council. That a General Council may be celebrated, though the Pope refuse to concurr by his Presence and Consent. That All that meet in Councils, ought to have free Liberty, orderly to declare and Determin Maters in question. That whatever must oblige as Divine, ought to be confirmed by the Authority of Holy Scripture. That no Councils are Legitimate, where private Respects are managed, under pretext of Faith and Religion. That the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop hath not that power, which many flatterers attribute to him: <hi>viz.</hi> That he alone is to Determine, and Others only to Consult and Advise. That a General Council is Superiour to the rest of the Patriarchs, and also to the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop. That a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council may be deficient, and that <hi>de facto</hi> Councils lawfully assembled have erred.</p>
            <p>And since they have failed, and have contradicted one another; as appears in the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that of <hi>Constance</hi> among many others; the one Decreeing the Worship of Images, the other prohibiting Communion in both Kinds; against the express words of Scripture; the Councils of <hi>Lateran</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Kings: the Council of <hi>Frankfort</hi> opposite to that of <hi>Nice</hi> in the Business


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100831:22"/>
of Images: the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> against those of <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Constance,</hi> in the point of the Pope's Superiority over a Council; It is certain that Councils are to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and Examined by God's Word, and to be Received or Rejected as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to, or Disagreeing from that. And for this we have the Authority of the Great S. <hi>Augustin, contra Maxim. Arian. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14. <hi>Nec ego Nicenum, &amp;c.</hi> Neither ought I to produce the <hi>Nicen,</hi> nor Thou the <hi>Ariminum</hi> Council, as having already prejudged or absolutely Determined the Cause, beyond all Appeal. For I am not bound up by the Authority of this, nor Thou by the Decree of that; but let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Authority of the Holy Scripture; witnesses not partial or appropriated to either party, but common to both. A speech worthy the Gravity, Learning, and Piety of S. <hi>Augustin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Councils of the Later Centuries, they neither have been General, nor hath either their <hi>Assimbling</hi> or <hi>Proceeding</hi> been Lawful; and they have most Industriously thwarted the Canons of the most Pure and Antient Councils.</p>
            <p>Their Assembling hath not been Legal, in that the Modern Popes have Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the whole Right and Authority of Convocating Councils contrary to the Primitive Custom and Practice of the Church. The first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was called by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great; the first <hi>Constantinopolitan,</hi> which is the second General Council, by <hi>Theodosius;</hi> that of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> by <hi>Theodosius</hi> Junior; that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> by <hi>Martianus;</hi> the fifth, by <hi>Justinian,</hi> &amp;c. All which are such evident Proofs, that the Cardinals, <hi>Cusanus, Jacobatius,</hi> and <hi>Zabarella</hi> confess, that in the first Ages of the Church, the Right of Calling Councils belonged to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
            <p>Nor are Their Proceedings any better. For the Popes admit no Assessours or Judges in Councils, but their own Faction, Men beforehand enslaved by a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath (which all Bishops of that Communion take at their Consecration) to maintain the <hi>Regalia Petri,</hi> all the Usurpations of that See. The Pope is the only Authentick Judge in All matters, Approving and Refusing whatever He pleases.</p>
            <p>Their own Histories afford us Examples enough to confirm this. I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance but in the Sleights and Wiles of the Late so much cryed up <hi>Trent-Council.</hi> Wherein, to make sure work, on the Pope's side there were more Italian Bishops than of all the World beside. And most ridiculously to dazle the eyes of the People, some of these subscribe themselves Eastern Patriarchs, as of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> &amp;c. and Others as if they were Greek Prelates. Some had the Titles of Archbishops, who had neither Church nor Diocess; as <hi>Upsalensis</hi> and <hi>Armachanus,</hi> who were Created on purpose to fill up the Number. And when the Pope on a certain Occasion wanted Voices to sway the cause, He sent a fresh supply of 40 Bishops newly made. And this was part of that Leigerdemain, which an Eminent French Bishop, <hi>Claud, Espenc.</hi> one of those vvho sat in the Council, calls <hi>the Great</hi> Helena <hi>which of late Ruled All at</hi> Trent. <hi>in Ep. ad Tit. c.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>All the Oriental and Greek Patriarchs and Bishops were Excluded: None out of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, Danemark, Swedland;</hi> few out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> fewer out of <hi>Germany</hi> it self, were admitted. When the Protestants required,


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100831:23"/>
Audience, they could not be hearken'd to, upon any tolerable terms. It was long before they could get a Safe-Conduct; and when it was procured, it was clogg'd with this Clause, <hi>That it should belong to none, but such as would Repent and Return to the Bosom of the Roman Church.</hi> This Partiality and Jugling when the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> saw, they sent their Protestations against the Council, as being Insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Resorm Religion.</p>
            <p>In Trying and Deciding Controversies, they adhered more to Tradition than Scripture: and pass'd nothing till the Pope with his Consistory had seen it at home, and approved it; and then he transmitted it to his Legats. So that, as One said, the Holy Ghost was continually posted in Cloakbags between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi> (Though, by the way, their own Doctors teach that the Assistance of the Holy Ghost is a personal Privilege and cannot be Delegated.) While the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines were formally Disputing at <hi>Trent,</hi> the Pope was as busie in Ingrossing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons at <hi>Rome,</hi> and sending them to the Council to be published. Thus they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, sometimes by a wrong Rule, sometimes by none at all. In the 4th Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they Decree, That none should give any other Exposition of Scripture, than such as might agree with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctrine was the Thing questioned, and the Scriptures were to have been the Touchstone to try it by.</p>
            <p>Take this whole Affair in the Words of <hi>Andraeas Dudithius,</hi> a Bishop in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and an Eminent Member of this Council. He thus writes in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the 2d, what good could be done in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, where voices were taken by Number, and not by Weight? The Pope was able to set an 100 of his against every one of ours; and if an 100 were not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, he could on a sudden have created a thousand to succour those that were ready to faint. We might every day see hungry and needy Bishops, and those for the most part Beardless Youngsters, come in Flocks to <hi>Trent,</hi> hired to give their Voice according to the Pope's humour: unlearned indeed and foolish but of good Use to him for their Audaciousness and Impudency The Holy Ghost had nothing to do with that Conventicle. All things were carried by Humane Policy, which was wholly employed in Maintaining the Immoderate, and indeed most Shameless Lordship and Domineering of the Pope. From thence were Answers waited for, as from the Oracles of <hi>Delphos</hi> or <hi>Dodona.</hi> From thence the Holy Ghost, who, as they brag, was President of their Council, was sent shut up in Carriers Budgets, who (a thing worthy to be laugh'd at) when the Waters were up, as it falls out many times, was fain to stay till they were down again, before he could repair to the Council. By this means it came to pass, that the <hi>Spirit was not carried on the Waters,</hi> as in <hi>Genesis,</hi> but along besides the Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing is more talk'd of than the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and this I know to be a most tempting Bait to get Proselytes; especially amidst those Many Dissentions in the Christian World at this Day. But because this Pretext hath been utterly destroyed by the Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and other most Learned Pens, I will only Recommend this Single Consideration to All Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Roman Catholicks, who would not be chouced out of their Wits, Estates


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100831:23"/>
and Liberties by a Gang of Ecclesiastical Mountebanks, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Huge, Swelling Prerogative of Infallibility is so Sensless a Thing, so Ungrounded, that no Romanist according to his own Principles, can have so much as a probable Moral Assurance of that wherein he thinks himself Infallible. And unless every one in particular be Infallible, it is to little purpose to boast of an Infallible Judge. For a Man may as well mistake the Meaning of his Sentence, as the Sentence of one who proceeds only upon prudent Moral Assurance: and we see that thousands do erre in the Interpretation of those acknowledged Infallible Oracles, the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The Consideration I recommend is this. That after All the Stirr that is made about Infallibility, the Learnedest amongst them knows not where to meet with it; nor in what cases it is annexed to that Chair, in what it forsakes it. Some, as the Jesuits generally, will have it in the Pope: but then whether with his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, or by Himself is controverted very briskly. Others will have it in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council: and this Opinion is backt by no less Authority than the Councils of <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Constance.</hi> But then the Church hath been very long without it, and possibly may never injoy it by means of a General Council to the End of the World. That wherein they fix it with most plausibility is both the Pope and a Council together. But even here we are at a great many losses. For as to the Pope, no man can be assured of his being a true Pope; considering the various defects that may render him otherwise; as a fundamental Error in his Election, Simoniacal Induction, the female Sex, Want of true Baptism and Holy Orders, both which depend upon the Intention and Validity of those, from whom he receives them; and theirs upon the like Qualifications in their Predecessor <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Occult Heresie and Many others. And then as to a Council, which consists chiefly of Bishops (tho the Popes, for some ends best known to themselves have now pack'd in Cardinals, Abbots, Generals of Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides that, the Validity of a Council depends upon the uncertainty of the Pope's being truly Qualified; the very same Difficulties occur in every particular Member, as did in respect of the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The like uncertainty appears in every Sacrament administred in that Church, some whereof are absolutely necessary, both <hi>Necessitate Medii &amp; Praecepti.</hi> v. g. in Baptism, Absolution, Consecration of the Host, which if it be not duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, Idolatry is committed by the People in adoring it, even by their own Concessions. <hi>Azorius</hi> the Jesuit, <hi>Enchirid.</hi> c. 8. openly proclaims, That it is a more tolerable Error in them who worship Golden and Silver Statues, as the Gentiles did their Gods; nay, a piece of red Cloth on the top of a Spear, as the Laplanders are reported to do, than in those who adore a piece of Bread.</p>
            <p>And now I would fain know of a Lay-Roman-Catholick, what is become of his Infallibility, where it is, and to what purpose it serves him? No where is it to be found, as I know of, but in the bold Assertion of every pragmatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, Who bids you be sure to look to your Faith; (who are the Solifidians now?) to believe as the Church believes, and then all is safe; for the breach of the Ten Commandments, there are Merits and Indulgences enough in the Church, which being mixt with a little Attrition and Confession will do the


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100831:24"/>
work. Though in the mean while He himself can neither tell where this Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Church is, nor what she certainly believes.</p>
            <p>Methinks S. <hi>Paul</hi> spoke as much like a <hi>Prophet</hi> as an <hi>Apostle:</hi> as if he foresaw the Haughtiness of the Members of that Church to which he wrote. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to curb them and banish from their Minds all such vain conceits of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he tells the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> she stood on no firmer grounds than her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. His words are these, worthy to be had in everlasting Remembrance by All Roman-Catholicks. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 18, 19, <hi>Boast not against the Branches, &amp;c. Well: because of unbelief they were broken off; and Thou standest by Faith. Be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but fear. For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not Thee. Behold therefore the Goodness and Severity of God: on them which seli, Severity, but towards Thee Goodness; if Thou continue in his Goodness: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Thou also shalt be cut off.</hi> Which words need rather your Practice than my Paraphrase.</p>
            <p>How much Safer and more Satisfactory is it to rely on the Holy Scriptures themselves; which by all Sides are acknowledged Infallible? For as much as they were divinely Inspired by that great Infallible Truth, which neither can be deceived, nor deceive his Creatures; which can make you wise enough to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and who hath promised to every humble Petitioner, and devout Practiser, a sufficient Competency of Knowledge, in what is necessary for his present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Eternal Happiness.</p>
            <p>Now all this you will find abundantly provided for in the Doctrine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the Word of God faithfully Translated, and exactly, as far as the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diomes of Languages will permit, compared with the Originals: and All those Books received, of whose Authority there was never any doubt made in the Church. Some others called <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> are read indeed; but as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in <hi>Exposit. Symboli,</hi> speaks, <hi>non ad Fidem firmandam sed ad Mores Instruendos:</hi> Not for confirming Faith, but for direction of Manners. And they are excluded from the Canon upon very weighty Reasons. For that they were never committed as of Divine Authority to the <hi>Jews:</hi> to whom the Oracles of God were intrusted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. Nor are they to be found in the Hebrew Canon. They are never found cited by Christ or his Apostles: and in some places they contain things manifestly false, contradictory both to themselves &amp; the other Genuine Prophetical Writers.</p>
            <p>You have here the three Creeds, the Apostles, that of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and that of S. <hi>Athanasius:</hi> together with the four first General Councils, which represent to us the Sincere Scheme of Apostolical, Primitive Doctrine and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline.</p>
            <p>You have here good works Recommended, Preach'd and Practiced, as the Fruits of Faith and Evidences of our Justification: and though not as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory for our Sins, yet as in Obedience to the Divine commands, and as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice acceptable to God. And even in this Degenerate Age of Christianity it might be made to appear, that as many Acts and Monuments of Real Charity have been exhibited since the Reformation, as were in many Ages before. But


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100831:24"/>
for those Works of <hi>Suprerecogation,</hi> as they are called, whereby we are presumed to perform more than is our Duty, this Church worthily disowns them, as savouring of too much Pride and self Conceitedness in us, who at the best are but unprofitable Servants.</p>
            <p>You have here a just and Competent Authority allowed to the Church, of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Decent Rites and Ceremonies, and of determining Controversies in Religion: provided she decide nothing Repugnant to the Holy Scripture. And the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves challenged no more, Witness S. <hi>Paul: Be ye followers of me as I am of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have here a <hi>Lawful Call</hi> to and <hi>Succession</hi> in the Ministerial Function (and this Succession, if need were, may be shewn to be more <hi>Sincere</hi> and less <hi>Interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> than that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.) As likewise those <hi>Three</hi> most Antient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Bishops, Priests</hi> and <hi>Deacons:</hi> and the manner of their Ordination most conformable to God's Word and Primitive Constitutions and Practice.</p>
            <p>You have here all the Divine Services and Administration of the Sacraments, performed in the known Vulgar Tongue of the Country, to the Edification of the People, and according to Divine Precept. On which Subject S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath written a whole Chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. no ways reconcilable to the Practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: which herein is confessed to disagree with Antiquity, by the most Learned of our Adversaries, and many of them wish that the Custome were abolished. Nor doth their <hi>Common Plea</hi> avail; that God understands any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: for many parts of their Service are addressed to the People, and not to God: as the Instructions out of the Epistles and Gospels, <hi>Orate Fratres,</hi> &amp;c. and many Occurrencies in the Administration of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Here you will find the <hi>two great Sacraments</hi> of the New Law, <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Sacred Eucharist.</hi> The first never so much as questioned by our Adversaries as to its Validity. And the other Administred in the due <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution; and that <hi>intirely,</hi> without committing that <hi>Grand Sacrilege</hi> of taking away the Cup from the Layity. And if the Church of <hi>England</hi> Embrace all that is <hi>Really</hi> conveyed to us in those High Mysteries, <hi>viz.</hi> The Application of those Ineffable Benefits and Advantages of the <hi>Sacred Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ; it is as much as every Good Christian can desire, and enough, if duly received, to make him Happy.</p>
            <p>And as for that Wonderful Doctrin of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> we have the <hi>Romanists</hi> own Acknowledgment, that it was not believed in that Church till the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Lateran,</hi> which likewise <hi>Decreed the Deposing of Kings:</hi> and I am sure the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath <hi>Scripture, Antiquity, Reason,</hi> and the concurring Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>all our Senses,</hi> when she acknowledges a <hi>Real Presence</hi> to the True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, without <hi>Annihilating</hi> the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Elements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sure our Blessed Saviour at the Institution calls the whole Action a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration:</hi> and in the Consecration of the Cup he most apparently uses a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Figure; both in the <hi>Cup,</hi> used for what is in it, and the <hi>Testament,</hi> for what is conveyed by it. He himself calls it the Fruit of the Vine. And S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. 27, 28. in 3 verses together expresly calls it <hi>Bread</hi> even after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration;


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100831:25"/>
Whoever shall eat this <hi>Bread,</hi> &amp;c. As often as ye eat this <hi>Bread,</hi> &amp;c. Let a man examine himself and so let him eat of this <hi>Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas our Saviour saies <hi>This is my Body:</hi> to omit the multitude of Authorities that might be produced, let the great <hi>S. Augustin</hi> speak the sence of All Antiquity: <hi>Christ</hi> did not stick to say <hi>This is my Body,</hi> when he gave the <hi>Sign of his Body,</hi> in <hi>Psalm.</hi> 98. and <hi>de Doctrin. Christian. l.</hi> 3 <hi>c.</hi> 10. he lays down this notable Rule; If you find a Commandment that forbids a Crime, or injoins any good Action, then its sense is not Figurative: but it is otherwise when it seems to command a Crime and prohibit a good Action. Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you, saies <hi>Christ.</hi> That word seems to command a Crime: it is therefore a <hi>Figure;</hi> which bids us Communicate in the passion of our Lord, and call into our Memories with sweetness and benefit, that his Flesh hath been wounded and nailed on the Cross for us.</p>
            <p>Thus doth <hi>S. Augustin</hi> teach. And indeed nothing is more frequent in Holy Writ, than such manner of Speech: <hi>This is the Lord's Passover. I am the true Vine,</hi> &amp;c. But to examine this business fully, would require a just Volume, and it is already done by very able Pens.</p>
            <p>The 5 other Sacraments in use in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, are solemnly used by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though not under that notion: excepting the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Anoynting,</hi> which was a Miraculous guift of Healing peculiar to the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Church of <hi>England</hi> you may injoy the true use and Advantage of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>Absolution,</hi> in a far more serious and less suspicious manner than in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And as for <hi>Absolution,</hi> even the <hi>Form</hi> of it is as full and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as theirs. I will set it down here, as it is found in the Service for the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Sick.<hi>â€”Our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left power to his Church, to Absolve all Sinners, who truly Repent and Believe in him, of his Great Mercy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thee thy offences: And by his Authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy Sins; in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her Churches are decently kept and adorned, (at least it is her desire they should be so) though not crowded with <hi>Images:</hi> the Historical use of which she rejects not: but the Adoration of them she worthily esteems most Dangerous and Detestable. And truly for my own part, I think that Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> now the Reverend Dean of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> hath little less than <hi>Demonstrated</hi> it to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Let any but impartially examin the general practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> especially on <hi>Good-Friday</hi> in creeping to the Cross: and he will find an undeniable proof of their <hi>Adoring Images.</hi> The Priest by degrees uncovers the Crucifix, lists it upto be <hi>Adored</hi> with these words, <hi>Ecce Lignum Crucis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold the Wood of the Cross, come let us Adore it.</hi> Then first he himself, then all that are present, with three Prostrations of the Body, even to the Kissing of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Earth, approach to it, and with all Reverence Imaginable <hi>Adore it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Worship and Invocation of Saints and Angels, is here looked upon as at least very Dangerous, and not having any President in the Old or New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath imparted his mind to us in this matter<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Let no</hi>


               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:100831:25"/>
               <hi>man beguile you of your reward, in a voluntary humility, and worshipping of Angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrines of <hi>Merit, Indulgences, Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c. are presumptuous at best, and full of Abuses, contrived more for the Priests profit than the Penitents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. All which considered, together with the small grounds for the belief of them, they are worthily disowned by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nor was <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> when out of the heat of School Disputes, of a Different Judgment, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de Justif. c.</hi> 7. <hi>Propter incertitudinem,</hi> &amp;c. By reason of the Uncertainty of our own Justice and the Danger of Vain Glory; <hi>Tutissimum est,</hi> &amp;c. It is the safest course to repose all our Confidence in the alone Mercy and Benignity of God.</p>
            <p>In short, you will find that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Reformation, which was most Regular, and by the Supreme Authority of the Whole Nation, retains all the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christianity, and onely Rectified such things as She found, and the whole World complained, were some Ridiculous, some Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious; Others Sensual and Cruel.</p>
            <p>Such are the Innumerable Crossings, Repetitions of Names, Kissings of the Pax and Images, Offering up of Incense and Candles, Impertinent Pilgrimages, &amp;c. and a Thousand the like absurdities.</p>
            <p>Such as teach men to put their Confidence in Bless'd Beads and Medals, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Relicks, Confraternities, Sodalities; to trust to <hi>Mundayes</hi> Prayers for the Dead, and our Ladie's Litanies: and Ascribe to pieces of Wax called <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> Divine power and Efficacy, even as much as is due only to the <hi>Pretious Blood of the Son of God.</hi> Nor is this the belief and practice onely of a few Old Wives: but the <hi>Authentick Book of the Sacred Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, tells us how <hi>Urban</hi> V. sent three <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> to the <hi>Greek Emperor,</hi> with most Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Rythmes annexed concerning their Virtue. Amongst others this is <hi>Verbatim</hi> set down,<hi>â€”Peccatum frangit ut Christi sanguis et angitâ€”</hi>that it Destroys Sin as the Blood of Christ doth.</p>
            <p>And this was not the Practice of one Phantastical Pope alone, but according to the foresaid <hi>Book,</hi> l. 1. Every Pope in blessing these <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> uses this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. 
<q>That it would please thee, O God, to bless these things, which we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to pour into this Vessel of Water prepared for thy Name: so as by the Worship and Honour of them, we thy Servants may have our heinous offences done away, the blemishes of our Sins wiped off, and thereby we may obtain pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>No Meaner a Person than the Angelical Doctor S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes the same Virtue of taking away Venial Sins, to <hi>Holy Water.</hi> And likewise 3. <hi>qu.</hi> 25. <hi>a.</hi> 3. in <hi>c.</hi> most Orthodoxly defends, That Stocks and Stones, I mean Images, are to be worshipped with <hi>Latria,</hi> the <hi>same Honour</hi> that is due to the Creator. <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Vasquez</hi> teach the same.</p>
            <p>To Conclude this Discourse. In the Church of <hi>England</hi> You will meet with all that is <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Warrantable</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> what ever is <hi>Necessary</hi> to Salvation: and that by the Confession of the Learnedest <hi>Romans.</hi> Let <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>

speak for all. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>de Verbo Dei. c.</hi> 11. 
<q>The Apostles themselves never used to Preach openly to the people (much less propounded as Articles of Faith) other things than the Articles of the Apostles Creed, the Ten Commandments, and some few of the Sacraments: because, saies he, These are simply <hi>Necessary</hi> and Profitable for All Men: the Rest besides are <hi>Such, as that a Man may be Saved without them.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This made <hi>Antonius de Dominis,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Spalatto,</hi> even at his Return to <hi>Rome,</hi> to acknowledg the <hi>English Church</hi> to be a <hi>True Apostolical Church.</hi> And Father <hi>Fulgentio</hi> the <hi>Venetian,</hi> Companion to Father <hi>Paul,</hi> the Famous Compiler of the History of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> had a most High value and Tender Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for this Church, as having in it all the Requisites for Faith, Manners and Discipline. And that Incomparable Man, <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> had so Venerable an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for her, above all other Reformed Churches, that he told our Embassador in <hi>France,</hi> That he Intended after his Return from <hi>Swedland,</hi> whither he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Embassador from the <hi>States General,</hi> to transport himself with his whole Family hither, on purpose to dye in the Bosome of the <hi>English</hi> Church. In such Repute is She even with Foreigners.</p>
            <p>And to speak one word to the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of <hi>England</hi> even in their own Language. By their own Concessions, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is safer to Communicate with than that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, To Believe onely what is in the Scripture, is as much as is necessary, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> Confesses. To worship God without an Image, is acknowledged by all both safe and acceptable. To pray immediately to God, and use the Lord's Prayer, without Repeating so many <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s; to perform the best works we can, and not stand on the point of Merit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so of the other matters in Controversie, is by both Sides granted secure: Whereas the other Things in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, are strongly disputed by very Learned and Pious Men. Now what would a Man require more than what all acknowledge to be in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> viz. Means effectually conducing and sufficient to <hi>Believe Well,</hi> to <hi>Pray Well,</hi> to <hi>Live Well,</hi> and to <hi>Dye Well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains onely, that the Truly Devout and Loyal Persons in our Nation that are of the <hi>Roman</hi> Persuasion, will but vouchsafe to take the Courage and Pains following Our Blessed Saviour's Advice, John 5. 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, 1 Thess. 5. 21. <hi>Prove all things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

God onely knowes how many Throes and Struglings I had to part with those, whom I so Earnestly affected. But Truth (at least as it seems to me) is Great, and will prevail. My Request to You All is, That You would not let us break in point of Charity, though our Opinions are not altogether Coincident: That You would, for the removing any scruples that may arise, believe me, as I shall answer at the Last Tribunal, That I was not onely <hi>Sincere</hi> but <hi>Zealous,</hi> while I remained among You: and that whatever I performed, was with the perfect <hi>Intention</hi> of, and Compliance with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and as Validly done as any Actions of that nature are capable of admitting. Lastly, I desire for God's, Religion's, and Your own sake, that we may refrain from All Contumelious Reflexions on one another.</p>
            <p>In that Long Converse and Great Familiarity I had with you, it is impossible, but Failings and Imperfections must be discovered on both sides. Let All be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed Under the Mantle of that Charity, which hides a multitude of Sins: still think of me as you ever found, One that <hi>sought not Yours, but You:</hi> an honest, plain down-right meaning Person. And as for my present Proceedings Leave me to stand or fall to that Great Judge, to whose, and his Churche's Censure, I with the most profound Obedience Submit, whatever I Write or Do.</p>
            <p>And Once more I recommend to your most impartial and serious Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this Important Quaery: Whether it be not Sufficient Ground to withdraw from the Communion of a Church, when She is convinced publickly to <hi>Teach, Practise</hi> and <hi>Command Treason</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> to its Members? <hi>Sicut Reputari cupiunt &amp; Haberi Fideles,</hi> (as the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council Thunders it out) as they desire to be Accounted and Treated as Christians.</p>
            <p>As to the Traiterous and Monstrous Plot now in Question; What Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> with the rest of the Informers Evidences are, I know not, nor am I much Inquisitive. His Sacred Majesty, and his Great Council are Judges of that. But of this I am as sure as I can be of any humane Transaction, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>Teaches</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> such Practices; That they have been frequently

               </hi> by his own Confession and Letters which he did not deny, was very Busie in attempting to Dissolve the Parliament, and in procuring As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from the <hi>French</hi> King, by the interposition of Monsieur <hi>le Chese</hi> the Jesuit, who was that King's Confessor (to use his own words) <q>To Carry on the Mighty Work in their hands, no less than the Conversion of Three Kingdoms, and the Utter Subduing of a Pestilential Heresie, which hath Domineer'd over a great part of this Northern World a long time; and that there never was such hopes of success since the days of their Q. <hi>Mury,</hi> as now in These days,â€”</q> And I am sure, that a most <hi>Worthy Justice of Peace</hi> was Barbarously Murder'd, who took the Examinations upon that occasion; and that many other Insolent Actions were committed by that Party. Nor can it be any satisfaction to the Nation for well-minded Persons to say they <hi>Disclaim</hi> and <hi>Detest</hi> such <hi>Actions;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they <hi>Kenounce</hi> the <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Disown</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> which have promoted and still are ready to prompt men to such Desperate Practices. God Almighty grant Us All his Grace to Consider in This Our Day the Things that Belong to Our Peace, before they be Hid from Our Eyes.</p>
