            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HIs Majeſty (though abridged of that Liberty as formerly) yet is merry ſometimes when occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is offered, There is little of News from Court, onely comments of what comes from other parts, and expectations of the events.</p>
            <p>Nor is there mourning here for the death of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Burley,</hi> who is hang'd, drawn, and quartered, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready almoſt forgotten) concerning whom there was uſed what meanes could be to worke him to ſight of his wicked and bloody crime (in that had not God prevented it) this poore Iſland might have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued in a bloody and ſad maſſacre, by his wicked deſigne, but yet he continued obſtinate.</p>
            <p>Divers Miniſters were with him before his death ſeverall times, but they could not worke upon him: And in the laſt Sermon before he was executed, that he heard ſome paſſages againſt that deſigne ſpoken off (as before at others) he carried himſelfe, as if hee had rather ſcorned, then been melted at it.</p>
            <p>And when he was brought our to the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and the Hangman ready to doe his office, (It
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161439:3"/>
is true, he ſeemed to have ſome fear of death, but) was ſtill obſtinate: And ſpoke to the effect of the incloſed paper.</p>
            <p>And having taken his leave of the world, and prayed a while, he prayed to God to receive his ſoul, and was then by the Hangman that came downe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turned off of the ladder, and after he had hanged a ſpace, cut downe, and quartered, after the uſuall manner.</p>
            <p>Sir, wee have nothing here new: his Majeſty is very reſerved in his ſpeeches, and chearfull at his meat; we are all quiet, deſiring a happy ſettlement: ſo prayes,</p>

            <p>CAptain <hi>Burley</hi> being on the ladder ready to dye, he was moved by a Miniſter and others to bee humbled, that the Lord might have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and confeſſe his ſinnes to God, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Treaſon for which he was to dye: hee ſaid, he was a ſinner, but no Traytor.</p>

            <p>MY ſervice preſented unto you, theſe are to certifie you of the riſing among us, you ſhall underſtand that about a weeke ſince there came a peſtilent booke to Towne amongſt us called <hi>Loyalty ſpeakes truth,</hi> purpoſely written againſt the Exciſe-men naming them by name, but ſo ſoone as the Country Troope was disbanded upon this day being Munday the people in the City roſe in very great numbers, and went directly to the Exciſe houſe which they moſt violently ranſaked and plundered, from morning till night breaking the windowes and as it was thought they would have laid the Houſe levell with the ground had not ſome made great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, they abuſed the Mayor and Aldermen, neither could the Mayor get any of the freemen at his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161439:4"/>
call, to come to his aſſiſtance, neither could the cheife Officers of the Souldiery that quarter in the Towne doe any thing for their aſſiſtance, but in my ſight was aſſalted by the people and had very much adoe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, they did not onely take away Stooles, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteds, Coffers and all away that was worth a groat; but that Wine and Beere which was in the Cellor which they could not drinke they let run about the Cellor, and laſtly tooke away the empty Caskes.</p>
            <p>About noone they cryed downe with the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, and for God and King Charles, when we heard them at that; at that time all our ſmall Party was out of the Towne, but ſome of them came home pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
            <p>Some Rogues gave out that the money belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing' to the Exciſe was carried to Mr.<hi>Moores</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, wherefore Mr, <hi>Moore</hi> exhorted every one that was or had beene for the Parliament to ſtand to it. At that, ſome few of us met in the Colledge Greene and made faſt the Gate, ſome fifteene well-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Townſ-men came in to our aſſiſtance, wee charged the Gunnes with ſmall ſhot, and ſo we keep a ſmall Garriſon yet, about ſix a clock the Mayor came to us, and informed us of the tumult, hoping that now night was come they begun to go home. They were about 2000. truely they ſeemed like the muſter of a Battaile ſo many men women and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren about this buſineſſe. We have made a great fire in the Hall in the Deanery and keepe our Court of Guard in that place, I for my part ſtole from among my fellowes about ten at night, and came as ſecure as I could to my houſe to write to you, meaning to returne about one of the clocke after midnight. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161439:4"/>
tumulters threaten hard that next Wedneſday they ſhall have the aſſiſtance of <hi>Witch</hi> and other places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and we as reſolutely intend to defend our ſelves.</p>
            <p>I heard ſome inkling of this buſineſſe before, but they ſpake ſo myſtically that I could not underſtand them, but now I ſee what they meant, I do moſt truely gather that except ſome part of the Army come downe to quiet thoſe Mutiners, it is very like to bee true which (they ſay) that not onely this County but <hi>Hereford</hi> and other places will doe the like, you ſhall alſo underſtand that this buſineſſe was plotted by ſome prime ones, and divers Souldiers that had beene Cavaliers were with them, and mightily incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and aſsiſted, there hath ſome layed wagers and made wonderfull. Proteſtations that the fate of things (as they call it) will change within theſe ſix weekes).</p>
            <p>I beleeve amongſt their party they durſt as freely buy the Parliament mens lands when they can get them, as any man the Biſhops lands, I judge this to be a thing they looke for, that when they can get a full riſing of the people to ſuprreſſe grieviances (as they call them) ſome wiſe heads amongſt them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſupernumeraries (that neither are nor will bee disbanded) they will make a Party againe of their owne. My Reaſons are theſe.</p>
