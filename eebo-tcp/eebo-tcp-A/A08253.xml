         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in a Treatise of his <hi>De vita
Plotini</hi> that when <hi>Plotinus</hi>
(a famous PHILOSOPHER
in <hi>Rome)</hi> entred into his
Schoole to performe his
accustomed vse of reading; casting his eyes
aside, he presently espyed <hi>Origen</hi> prepared to
be his hearer, At whose aspect <hi>rubore suffusus</hi>
blushing, <hi>Plotinus</hi> ceased to speake: which
<hi>Origen</hi> perceauing, requested him to proceed:
but the Philosopher replyed, that it was time
for a professor to holde his peace, when his
<pb facs="tcp:21670:4"/>
Auditours before hand knew what he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to teach.</p>
            <p>I make no doubt but the verie Title and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of this little Treatise giues good no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
&amp; inckling what shal be the subsequents,
wherin I might very well hold my peace with
<hi>Plotinus</hi> being an eye witnesse of so many
learned Philosophers &amp; others in place, that
could both <hi>ornatius dicere, &amp; concinius agere,</hi>
a matter of such worth then my selfe. But as in
<hi>causis vniuocis est semper verum,</hi> that <hi>nemo dat
quod non habet:</hi> So in officious performances
where there wants abilitie, the next degree
to well doing is to bee faithfully willing, and
desirous to doe well. For
<q>Bona pars est probitatis, toto pectore
velle fieri probum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore hauing bene a member of that
famous Vniuersitie, and fortunate Mother of
all learning, that from her fruitefull wombe,
hath sent foorth so many sufficient Schollers
to supporte her owne reputation, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the defects and imperfections of others: I
among the rest, (though the vnworthyest of
<pb facs="tcp:21670:4"/>
all) in gratefull remembrance of some former
benefits receiued from her, haue taken so vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
me to set downe the true Ioye which she
expressed by externall actions, as <hi>voice</hi> and
<hi>gestures</hi> (the signes of eternall loue and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.)
Through the windowes whereof a man
might easily passe with the sight of his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and discouer the secret affection and
gladnesse conceited by the approach of his
most excellent Majesty, the Queene, &amp; young
Prince, vnto that their worthie Cittie of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For vpon Tuesday the 27. of August laste,
his Maiestie comming from <hi>VVoodstocke</hi> to
<hi>Oxford,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Dorset</hi> Lord Chauncelor,
accompained with the Vice-Chauncelor, the
Doctors, Proctors &amp; certaine Senior Masters,
rode foorth vpon their foote-cloath Horses,
verie richlye furnished to meete the King,
whome they expected about <hi>Aristotles</hi> Well,
where hauing intention that the Vice-Chauncelor
should first salute his Majestie
with a speech, Maister Maior with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
passed by without regard to them, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:21670:5"/>
indeed that his Orator should first speak,
which when the Lord Chauncelor perceiued,
he presently sent to the Maior, and charged
him to surcease his purpose till the Vice-Chauncelor
had finished his Oration to the
King: with which message the Maior was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pleased, yet his mends were small, for hee
retired with speede, and had no better excuse
for himselfe, then to say hee did not see them,
notwithstanding they were hard by him, and
all in their Scarlet Gownes.</p>
            <p>After this, his Maiestie drawing neere, the
Lord Treasorer and the Vice-chauncelor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred
vnto him, who stayed his course, and
rayned his Horsse of State whereon he rode:
the Vice-chauncellor presenting him-selfe
with his speech vnto his Highnes, surrendring
vp the Keyes of the Vniuersitye, and the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
deposing their Staues, and laying them
downe at his Majesties feet: Further deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vnto him the New Testament in Greeke,
very fairely bound, and richly guilded: vnto
the Queene a Purse, &amp; to the young Prince a
paire of gloues. With which Oration at his
<pb facs="tcp:21670:5"/>
first meeting, and the seuerall guiftes presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto them, the King, Queene and Prince,
were so well pleased and delighted, that the
whole Vniuersitie receiued much content &amp;
comfort.</p>
            <p>After the Lord Chauncelors, and the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersites
salutation, Maister Maior addressed
himselfe towards the King: and by the mouth
of the Townes Orator, he &amp; his brethere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
an English speech to his Majestie,
and presented three seuerall Cuppes: the
one to the King, another to the Queene
and another to the Prince. Maister Maior
rendring vp his Mace, striued with himselfe
to doe all duetifull obeysance that might be
accepted, which the King discouering, verie
graciously encouraged, and gaue him great
and heartye thankes for his good will and
louing duetie towards him.</p>
            <p>This finished, his Majestie passed along till
hee came before Saint <hi>Iohns Colledge,</hi> where
three little Boyes comming foorth of a Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
made all of Iuie, drest like three Nimphes,
(the conceipt wherof the King did very much
<pb facs="tcp:21670:6"/>
applaude) and deliuered three Orations: first
in Latine to the King, then in english to
the Queene and young Prince; which beeing
ended, his Majestie proceeded towards the
East gate of the Citie, where the Townes-men
againe deliuered vnto him another speech in
english.</p>
            <p>That speech ended, the King with all his
traine of Noble men and others, entred the
Cittie, where in the after noone about one of
the clocke, by the ringing of a Bell at Saint
<hi>Maries</hi> Church, the Schollers in their formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
according to their seuerall degrees, were
gathered together and repaired towards
Christe-Church gates, where they began to
be placed and rancked. They stood all of one
side of the streete without any intermixion
eyther of strangers, Townes-men, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that were not Schollers of the Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and were of the left hand of the King as he
passed by. Next to the gates of Christ Church
(where his Majestie was receiued) stood the
Doctors of Diuinity in their Scarlet: next the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
the Doctors of Phisick, &amp; then the Doctors of
<pb facs="tcp:21670:6"/>
Lawe: next them the Batchelers of Diuinitie,
and the Senior Maisters of Arte in their silke
hoodes: then the Batchelers of Law, and the
Regent Masters in their Miniuer Hoods, and
then the Batchelers of Arte. All which gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
reached from Christes Church to aboue
<hi>Carefex.</hi> Next to those Graduates, stood the
vnder Graduates, whose rancke thus placed
in this seemely <hi>decorum,</hi> reached to St. <hi>Giles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Maiestie still passing along into the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
by the Easte gate of it, where (as is before
remembred) the Townes-men deliuered a
speech and the Schollers gaue him a <hi>viuat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Easte gate, his Majestie marched
along till he came to <hi>Carefex,</hi> where Doctor
<hi>Perin</hi> was placed in a Pue, and saluted him
with a Greeke Oration, which while hee was
pronouncing, the Queene asked the King
once or twise what hee said? and he answered
her, that he spake verie well and learnedly.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Carefex,</hi> the King with the Queene on
his left hand, &amp; the young Prince next before
them (all on their seueral great horses) march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
downe the streete, till they came to Christ-Church,
<pb facs="tcp:21670:7"/>
where at the gates, the Vniuersityes
Orator made an Oration vnto him.</p>
            <p>After the speech was ended, the Deane and
the Prebends with all the Students of Christ-Church,
were ready at the Gates in their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plesses
and Hoodes to receiue his Majestie:
and carrying a Canapie ouer him, they first
conducted him to the Church, at the entring
whereof there was an Oration deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: and in the Church the Deane himselfe
made another Oration, and so went to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
After which his Majestie accompained
with the Queene and the Prince, and a troope
of Lordes and Noblemen, was brought vnto
his lodging.</p>
            <p>The Prince hauing accompained the Kings
Majestie vnto the Chamber of Presence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted:
and betaking himselfe to his Coach,
went straight to <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, where
the President standing in the Gates, receiued
him with all joyfull reuerence and duety, and
passing into the Chappell, he had an Oration
pronounced vnto him. After which, the Prince
going vnto his lodging, heard disputations,
<pb facs="tcp:21670:7"/>
that were made before him by certaine No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemens
Sonnes, which at this time are Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, with the which
he outwardly shewed, how inwardly hee was
delighted.</p>
            <p>After Supper his Majestie, the Queene, and
Prince, with the Noblemen, had a <hi>Comedie</hi>
played before them in Latine in <hi>Christ-Church</hi>
Hall, which continued
the space of three
houres and
more.</p>

In these questions, his Majestie (as chiefe
Moderator) did speake some sixe or seauen
times in verie good Latine, and to verie good
purpose, and so sufficiently satisfied the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by of his learning &amp; wisdome, that they
highly applauded the same with exceeding
admiration: for at euery time his Majestie
spake, all the people clapt their hands, and
cryed <hi>viuat Rex Iacobus.</hi>

               <p>These disputations continued from two, till

Doctor <hi>Gentilis</hi> as Moderator, concluded
with a speech. Where obserue by the way,
that Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> (one of the Opponents)
after that he had giuen ouer disputing, and an

being forward to speake, and taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him, otherwise then was accustomed by
other Moderators to interpose his sentence,
and to answere to Arguments which were vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> (I say) not liking well of
Doctor <hi>Gentilis</hi> his answere which hee made
to his Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, did vpon a sudden rise vp, &amp;
began to dispute againe, saying that he might

               <p>In one of these questions, Doctor <hi>Paddy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
answerer, held against <hi>Tobacco,</hi> being a
great drinker of <hi>Tobacco</hi> himselfe. Heere his
Majesty was exceeding merrie &amp; pleasant, for
there were many jestes which ministred
laughter. For one in his speech did bring
forth a <hi>Tobacco</hi> Pipe, &amp; vrged the manner of
the Phisitions in <hi>India,</hi> which was that they
should be drunke with <hi>Tobacco,</hi> &amp; so goe to
their Patients: whereat the King laughing
heartily, said that our Phisitions should goe to
the <hi>Indians</hi> to be drunke, that so they might
minister Phisick. These disputations were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by Doctor <hi>VVarner,</hi> who made a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
judicious and well approued speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King, which his Majestie did very
much applaud, and commend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21670:11"/>
After Phisicke disputations were ended, the
Kinges Maiestie, the Queene, and the Prince,
with all the Noblemen, rode to <hi>New-Colledge</hi>
to Dinner, being inuited thither, by the Right
Honorable the Lord Treasorer, Lord
Chauncelor of the Vniuersity: who of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
minde, and loue to learning and her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
the same day sent to euerie Colledge a
Bucke, and twenty shillings a peece to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
in Wine, wherewith the Schollers did
so thankefully frolicke it, that by exterior
meanes they manifested their interior mindes
and gratitude for so great fauour fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and Honorable a personage: for as
<hi>virtus laudata crescit:</hi> Soe doe Schollers then
moste striue to prooue absolute, when they
finde the Nobilitie, to supporte their studies,
and to cherish their indeauors, as did <hi>Virgil</hi>
by the liberalitie extended by <hi>Mecoenas.</hi> And
what made <hi>Alexander</hi> by learned pennes so
eternized to succeeding ages, but his bountie
in giuing giftes, and bestowing benefits? and
his magnificent deportme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t in powring foorh
his treasures to the encouragement of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
<pb facs="tcp:21670:12"/>
This wonne him incomparable Loue of
all that dealt with him, and of the learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of his time. For the dignitie of any
principle, enchaunceth the effect. As a meane
worke proceeding from an excellent worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
winneth in regard of the Authour, farre
more credit, and reputation, then if it had
proceeded from an Artificer of lesser account.
So in like manner a smal guift comming from
the hands of a great person, carieth euer a sent
of a certaine greatnesse, and relisheth great
power to produce great effects in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and stirres him vp to a continuing desire
of deeper and further deseruing.</p>

heede, &amp; many times interposed his opinion

in Latine, which did so fill the Auditors with

               <p>In this also the King did speake with such

would pronounce him his <hi>Socrates,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in that question.</p>
               <q>An melius sit fines Imperij propagare, quam
tueri?</q>
               <p>Wherein hee many times vrged contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to finde out the certaintie, indeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:21670:14"/>
in knowledge to winne a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
perfection. And it seemeth that hee
had much accustomed himselfe to study and
disputations to attaine that inward comfort:
<hi>Quod nemo nouit nisi qui accipit.</hi> For as vse
had bred in him facilitie, and facilitie confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Nature; So his nature seemes stronglye
inclined to vertue, and that can hardly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
from her common course, but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
still her vertuous determination. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
greate hope (to a generall comfort) is
to bee conceiued of happinesse to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
where the King both by nature and
custome hath wrought in himselfe a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of vnderstanding, which once purchased
is not easily supplanted: Whereunto agreeth
that vulgar <hi>Axiome</hi> of Philosophers:
<q>Omnis habitus est difficile separabilis a
subiecto.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But these Disputations, by reason of the
shortnesse of the time, were verie compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:21670:14"/>
and briefe, For least his Majestie
should bee wearied with teadiousnesse or
prolixities, The Proctors did cut off the
Opponents verye suddainelye, insomuch
that before all the Opponents had dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they spoke to the Moderator that he
should conclude: which the King percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and that there was one left out, which
had not disputed, his Majestie gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
that hee should dispute also,
so desirous hee was of hearing.</p>
               <p>After that, the Senior Proctor, which was
Moderator in the Morrall Disputations,
made conclusion of all. The which being
ended, and that being the last of the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
&amp; exercises, his Maiestie did as heere
followeth make a moste gracious and pitthy
speech in Latine to the Vniuersitie, which did
so glad the hearts of the hearers, that euerie
man went away, and parted sorrowfull for
the Kinges so short tarryance and so sudden
departure. Which for that nothing is so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,

With this speech thus concluded, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
arose, and gaue vnto the Doctors and
the rest, manie thanks, for their paines that
they had taken: and vnto all he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so gracious, and with so louing a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
that by his outward appearaunce
might be well discouered, how inwardlie he
was satisfied, and pleased, with their learned
answeares vnto the seuerall questions: and
so returned backe againe to Christchurch.</p>
            <p>Where vppon Thursdaie at nighte after
supper there was a Comedie plaied by saint
Iohns men before his Maiestie. The subiect
whereof was the foure Complexions. This
comedie was so richlie set foorth and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
with such curious and quaint conceipts
and deuises, as that it made his Maiestie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
himselfe as muche delighted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
as with anie sight (of the like nature)
at anie time heretofore presented vnto him.</p>
            <p>The next morrowe, beeing Fridaie, the
thirtieth daie of August, was the daie of his
<pb facs="tcp:21670:18"/>
Maiesties departure from Oxforde, and as
soone as the Sunne had vailed the curtaine
of the night, he got vp, carrieng the opinion
of Caesar.</p>
            <q>

Nil actum credens,
cum quid superesset
agendum.</q>
            <p>That he had done nothing, when any thinge
was left vndone: and mounted himself with
diuers of his Nobles to see the Vniuersities
Librarie, which is in length all ouer the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
Schoole. The scituation whereof is so
pleasant, that the grounde whereon it is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
is Diapred with Floraes riches, yet is it
farre more glorious, hauing placed within
her circumference so famous a Monument
of such worke, and workemanshippe.</p>
            <p>Round about, in forme of an Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
are placed Colledges, and in the forefro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:21670:19"/>
thereof, in the place of Oakes, Elmes, and
Pine-trees, all which are comfortable trees
to defende her from the furious wrathe of
winde and weather, are planted the Schools
of the seauen liberall Sciences, to adorn and
beautifie her with the inward plenty of their
wisedome and treasure.</p>
            <p>As for the Lybrarie it selfe, it hath a verie
long, large, and spacious walke, ouer the
schoole of Diuinitie, inter-seamed on both
sides, from the one ende vnto the other, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thicke with seuerall Partitions, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
seates and Deskes before them to sitte
downe vpon and reade. These partitions are
in euerie place filled full of shelues, and vnto
the shelues are there many Bookes fastened
with chaines of Jron: euerie volume bearing
his name and title, written on paper or parch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment,
in faire Roman letters, and euerie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
hath an Jnscription of the Faculties,
As whether her bookes bee either of <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
Philosophie, Astronomie, Geometry,</hi> or any
other Art, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Bookes that are conteined within this
<pb facs="tcp:21670:19"/>
Lybrarie, are verie rare straunge and scarce,
seldome or not at all to be heard of or seene
in any place but there. All of them verie
richlie guilded, and manye of them bossed
either with Siluer or Golde.</p>
            <p>All these are so fairelie kept and maintaind,
as if the Goddesse of <hi>wisdome</hi> hadde selected
and reserued it a Paradice to entertaine the
Muses: Therefore J conclude of it thus, that
<q>Dignitatem eius, difficile est vt homo explicet sermone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This obiect being presented vnto the sight
of his Maiestie, did so sensiblie discouer his
delight therewith, that he reported it a most
admirable ornament to the Vniuersitie: and
gratiouslie promised himselfe, a royal friend
and Patron for euer.</p>
            <p>Whilst his Maiestie was thus busied in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of this suruey of the librarie; the queen
and Prince were in the meane space, as much
delighted with an English Comedie, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and plaide before them in Christ-church
hall, by certaine Schollers: which was as rich
lie set forth and perfourmed, as with as great
<pb facs="tcp:21670:20"/>
applause, and commendation as any of the
rest that had beene before since the Kinges
comming to Oxford.</p>
            <p>Jn the meane time also diuers of the Noble
men went to Saint Maries in their hoodes,
and formalities, and were presented, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corproated
Maisters of Arts. As

               <pb facs="tcp:21670:20"/>
with diuers others, of the Noblemen and
Knights, that came in so confusedly that as
yet there is not a perfect register gathered of
their names.</p>
            <p>After his sighte of the Vniuersities Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries,
he betooke himselfe towards Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen
Colledge, to see that also: accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with diuers of the Nobility, wheras the
president and diuers the rest of the fellowes,
stoode readye to receiue him, also at the
Chappell doore he was Royally entertained
and at his entrance, there was a Latine ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
pronounced vnto him.</p>
            <p>Which being ended, hee stoode a prettie
while reading the verses that were written in
Latine by certaine Noblemens sonnes stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in the same Colledges, and set thicke
on both sides of the chappell gate, as there
was also diuers others placed rounde aboute
the courts of other Schollers writings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21670:21"/>
Thus when his Maiestie had viewed the
Chappell, he was forth with conducted into
the Cloysters, and from thence into the squa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drant
Court within the Cloysters, wherehe
staied a good space, taking a thorow view of
all such seuerall Pictures as were there set vp
round about, and now against this entertain
were newly trimmed and painted, which cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
his Maiestie to demande the meaning of
them, wherein the President and others fully
resolued him.</p>
            <p>From thence he returned backe to Christ
church againe vnto the Queene and younge
Prince, and in the waie (as is credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
he woulde needes be guided to Brazen
Nose Colledge gate, that he might be made
an eie-witnesse of that, of which he hadde so
often heard, and that whereof the Colledge
carrieth the name.</p>
            <p>And both as he passed forth of Magdalen
Colledge gates, and so vpwardes all along,
the Schollers cried <hi>Viuat uiuat,</hi> &amp;c. and the
others of the multitude, with a loude voice,
God saue king Iames, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21670:21"/>
Much about twelue of the clocke the same
day he tooke his leave, and left the Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
addressing his course towardes Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore
Castle. And a little on this side Whayt
ley, some fiue or sixe miles from Oxford, his
Maiestie and the Queene parted, the King
purposing that night to lie at the Ladie Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
a little from Maiden-head, &amp; the Queen
at Sir Francis Stoners, a little from Henly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Thames.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21670:22"/>
Thus was Oxford left a mournefull place
for the suddaine departure of her most dread
Soueraigne. Crying,

other places also hapie and ioyfull at his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

his departure lefte the Vniuersitie thus
