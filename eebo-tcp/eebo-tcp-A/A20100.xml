            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>So, farewell the acquaintance of all the mad Deuils that
haunt Iealiousie, why should a man bee such an asse to play the
antick for his wiues appetite? Immagine that I, or any other great
man haue on a veluet Night-cap, and put case that this night-cap
be to little for my eares or forehead, can any man tell mee where
my Night-cap wringes me, except I besuch an asse to proclaime
it; Well, I do play the foole with my misfortune very hand som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
I am glad that I am certaine of my wiues dishonesty; for a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
strumpet, is like mines prepard to ruine goodly buildings.
Farewel my care, I haue told my wife I am going for Stoad; thats
not my course, for I resolue to take some shape vpon me, and to
liue disguised heere in the Citty; they say for one Cuckolde to
knowe that his friend is in the like head-ake, and to giue him
counsell, is as if there were two partners, the one to bee arrested,
the other to baile him: my estate is made oue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if her pulses haue beat, when I haue nam'd a suspected loue, yet all

I haue laine awake a thousand nights, thinking she wold haue

heart. But when wil your loue come, or what did hee say to thee
ouer the stall? Or what did he do to thee in the Garden-chamber?
Or when wil he send to thee any letters, or when wilt thou send to
him any mony, what an idle coxcombe iealousie wil make a man.
