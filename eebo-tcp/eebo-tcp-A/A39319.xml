         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>suming to offer this second to your <hi>Graces</hi> acceptance and pardon. Which presumption, although the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of your <hi>Graces</hi> favours towards me might almost excuse, yet it is the great insolence and great extravagance of <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>'s attempts, that makes me still seek out for protection from so gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t and eminent a Patron; who by his unaffected affability to all men, and his studious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the best, by his unwearied care for promoting true Religion, as well as securing the just Authority of his Prince, is alone able to live down many <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathans.</hi> And if there be any way to bring that haughty-concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-Philosopher
<pb facs="tcp:48558:3"/>
to a tolerable good nature, and to tie him up to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate prophaneness, it must be done by such as your <hi>Grace,</hi> defending and approving those that write against him: for as 'tis well known to your <hi>Grace,</hi> that he'l allow no man to speak truth but himself; so will he scarce ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>it of any man to be truly great, unless he is of his mind and opinions: and that makes him so angry with your <hi>Grace,</hi> because you are such an unanswerable Argument against all that he hath writ. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing does so nearly concern him, and almost convert him; as to see the name of a person, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous for Religion and Power, stand before a Book that doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Doctrine. And for this

reason I have once more taken the boldness to make this second Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to your <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If upon this review of <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> I had found that he had given his Readers sense and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument answerable to the mischi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For I am not so utterly given over to toying, nor so conceited of this way of writing, nor so indifferent about a good life and Religion, nor so careless of offending sober men, nor so bent and resolved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to presume upon your <hi>Grace</hi> after this kind, but that I think it possible, that upon a just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and a good subject, for a

            <p>But I must confess, that of all Triflers 'tis the set, the grave, the Philosophical, and Mathematical Trifler, to which I have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est averseness: whom when I meet very gravely making out all men to be Rational beasts both in Nature and Conversation; and every man when he pleases a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Rebel: and upon any fright or pinch, a Rational Atheist and Antichristian; and all this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with all demureness, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, quotation of Scripture, appeals to Conscience and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>History;

It is to be confessed, that there has been already so very much said (in Prefaces) of the bottomless de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts

            </p>

               </gap>t, a great <hi>Greek</hi> man, who was thrice asked what was most necessary to make an Orator: and 'tis known well enough, what his threefold answer was. Even so shouldst thou ask me three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times over what is the most-best Book that ever was, or will be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, buy this, and thou hast fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered thy self and my design. The
<pb facs="tcp:48558:6"/>
Book, it is to be acknowledged, is but a Book; and that's the least and worst thing that can be said of it. But why do I call it a Book: what am I mad? for in reality 'tis all Books: for it does not only faithfully relate what has been already done, but it foretells all that shall be done. Dost thou want, <hi>Reader,</hi> a just, true, and impartial History of the whole World; from the very beginning, to the very minute that thou buyest this Book? trouble not thy self, here 'tis. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins ten thousand years before the oldest Praeadamite, and holds good and firm ten thousand years after the World shall end. Dost thou want a true, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This very Book was at the first four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and in all the Persecutions. Hast thou a mind to a compleat body of the Law, Civil Law, Canon Law, Common Law, &amp;c? The twelve Tables were stollen out of this Book last week, when 'twas printing: I
<pb facs="tcp:48558:7"/>
met with the Rogue at <hi>Pye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Corner,</hi> but he out-ran me: and so were <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi>'s Laws, and <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: as for <hi>Littleton, Cook,</hi> &amp;c. 'tis plain they had all hence: and as <hi>London</hi>-Bridge stands upon several Wool-packs; so <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall it self, and all its proceedings, stand upon four of these Books. Dost thou want <hi>Galen, Hippocrates, Paracelsus, Helmont,</hi> &amp;c? want them still; for in effect thou hast them all. For here's that which cures all diseases; and teaches a most certain way how to make a compleat Gentleman, at one baking. Dost thou want a Book to measure the height of Stars, survey Ground, make a Dial, &amp;c? Look pag. 79. lin. 12. it tells thee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what's a Clock either by day or by night; next line thou hast full Moon and new, high Tide at <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and all the Bridges in the World. Turn down the fourth leaf of this Book when thou goest to bed; and 'twill go off just at that hour, and waken you as well as any Alarum. Immediately after which follows a
<pb facs="tcp:48558:7"/>
compleat and most wonderful Table of Consequences; which, if read one way, tells you all the Fairs and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; t'other way all the Battels that ever have been, or shall be fought; with the number of the slain, &amp;c. And besides, it doubles Cubes and Squares, Circles (better than <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>) only with an Oyster shell and a pair of Tobacco Tongs. And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> tell me, art thou so void of conscience, reason, and all sense of thy own benefit, as not to carry home this Book?</p>
            <p>Besides, read but five pages of it Spring and Fall, and for that year thou art certainly secured from all Feavers, Agues, Coughs, Catarrhs, &amp;c.

            <p>It were endless, <hi>Reader,</hi> to tell
<pb facs="tcp:48558:8"/>
thee all the uses and excellencies of this Treatise: which though it be a full Answer to all ill-natur'd, sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, heretioal, blasphemous Books that ever were written; yet, after a most peculiar manner, it does so horridly rout some silly-phantastical opinions of <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> that he'l be ashamed ever so much as to owne any one opinion again. <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a fancy that <hi>every thought was necessary: i. e.</hi> not one thought, <hi>Reader,</hi> that thou ever hadst since thou camest into the World, that thou couldst any more have avoided thinking, than that thy hair is black, or the Sky blue. Now, to that says my <hi>Author</hi> most wonderfully and judiciously; that if such a thing should ever come to pass, that is to say, that if ever any man at any time should chance to have but one thought crowded upon him, he would presently have a most huge Oak grow out of his Neck, and his left Leg would be turned into a Phoenix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This he proves at large. Again says
<pb facs="tcp:48558:9"/>
               <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> that <hi>every action that a man does is perfectly unavoidable:</hi> to that says our <hi>Author,</hi> very candidly and ingenuously: that if any one man should be forced willingly, to do any one action; the Moon would presently tumble into that mans mouth. In the next place, says <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> there's nothing in the World but matter. Ay, says our <hi>Author,</hi> nothing but matter! then has not any man, in his life, ever tasted of a Pudding. This, <hi>Reader,</hi> is plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration. Then for Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Language, Mathematicks, and Divinity; he brings him to such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, as you never heard of, nor are to be imagined. Only thus far I'le tell you, that if <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> has squared the Circle, then both <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and the seven Stars will be every one of them most certainly in the Counter, the next <hi>Friday</hi> after you buy this Book.</p>

            <p>IT is not the design of this following <hi>Dialogue,</hi> neither was it of the former, to make sport for idle peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: (though if I have written all those Books, that I am appointed to owne, thou mayst justly suspect that I never did, nor do intend any other thing;) but to preserve thee from being laughed at, by all who can distingnish sense from words. For though I cannot think how I should any ways be useful or service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Publick; yet (I thank God) I have not spent my time so very ill, as only to collect a few Tales and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs to make others merry. Nor was it my design either to please the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb facs="tcp:48558:11"/>
whose Office, Power, and Bible <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> cunningly hath disposed of; nor to oblige the Lords and Commons; who may all stay at home, if the Prince take his advice: but it was, if possible, to cure a Company of easie, giddy, small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated Gentlemen; who swagger that <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> hath said more for a bad life, and against any other life after this, than ever was pleaded by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher or Divine to the contrary. Now to effect this Cure, (at least amongst some of them) is ten times more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than to answer all <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>'s Works.</p>
            <p>For in the first place, there be a sort of people who were sturdy, resolved Practicants in <hi>Hobbianism;</hi> and would most certainly have been so, had there never been any such man as <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> in the World. But when they heard that ill Nature, Debauchery, and Irreligion was Mathematicks and Demonstration: and that he who reported this, was a very grave, studious, contemplative, and observing Gentleman; and yet writ as viciously and prophanely, as their own
<pb facs="tcp:48558:11"/>
vanity and lusts could tempt them to practise: then had these Gentlemen found out a Philosopher exactly sor their purpose, and the Philosopher had sound out as right Gentlemen for his. And these are the sure, the firm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Pit-friends; that clap, shout, and swear all that comes from <hi>Malmesbury.</hi> And to speak so plainly, as I might be understood, the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> have got these people so fast, that I have little hopes of retrieving them.</p>
            <p>The next shole that came into <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> are a sort of small, soft, little, pretty, fine Gentlemen: who having some little wit, some little modesty, some little remain of Conscience and Country Religion, could not tear and Hector it, as the former; but quickly learnt to chirp and giggle, when t'other clapt and shouted: and those were <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>'s Gallery-friends; who at first were coy and squeamish, and for a while stood aloof off, and made some little doubt, whether a Taylor's Bill was truly and legally satisfied, when he or his Bailiffs were sufficiently bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
<pb facs="tcp:48558:12"/>
but by degrees they came in, and in their kind proved very serviceable. And such as these <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> catch'd by his fame of being a Mathematician, by filling his Books with Schemes, by frequent using the word <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and calling all kind of vice and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, humane Nature, and obedience to the Civil Magistrate; and the like.</p>
            <p>There be ore sort still behind: and they are the solemn, the judi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> what I shall do or say to these men, I know not. As for the great Shouters and Clappers, who are resolved upon their course of life, you'l easily judge, that I can expect to
<pb facs="tcp:48558:12"/>
do but little upon them: they being so resolved, not for <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>'s sake, but only out of true and unfeigned love, to debauchery and wickedness. But yet one thing I would beg of them, that if they be thus determined and fixt; that they would e'en stick to the old true new <hi>English</hi> name of Knave and Ungodly; rather than (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>or the renown of being of a Philosophical Sect) to the new one of an <hi>Hobbist.</hi> For upon my word there is not the least credit and ingenuity in it, more than t'other: but if they be for variety, and that dull, blunt prophaneness won't down with them, but they must have it a little so modell'd and new phras'd, that upon occasion they may plead for't, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie it; let them not go to <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> for devices (but, when they have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, devise some of their own:) for his are so weak, so notoriously idle, that they are more scandalous and disparaging, than right down Roguery without any pretence or artifice.</p>
            <p>But as for the Gallery-Gentlemen,
<pb facs="tcp:48558:13"/>
most of whom, I suppose, infected by general fame, I have for their sakes, (because I thought them not much at leisure) read over most of <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>'s Writings. And what I learnt thou shalt hear. By his Logick I profited won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully: for it was there (and I must ever acknowledge it) that I first was instructed, to call Logick Computation: and there I learnt how to add and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract Logically: also how to make use of Triangles, Circles, Parabola's, and other Mathematical instances; instead of <hi>homo, lapis</hi> or <hi>canis:</hi> and that's, upon my word, all that I found there. Then I went to his natural Philosophy; and there I found the word <hi>Phantasm,</hi> as thick as ever it could stand; and that space, time, and every thing else was a Phantasm, but not any one thing tolerably explained, but what was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of <hi>Cartes,</hi> though he denies it. But indeed in those very things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he says he differs from him, he most exactly agrees with him; (as <hi>de corp. Ch. 29.</hi>) and knows it not. There is,
<pb facs="tcp:48558:13"/>
I must confess, a good lusty heap of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, about the middle of his natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hilosophy: but Dr. <hi>W.</hi> has taken such care about them, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they'l do thee but little good.</p>
            <p>I might tell thee also, <hi>Reader,</hi> of his Humane Nature; which carries a very good Title, and is called the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Elements of Policy: which Title has nothing at all to do with the Book, nor the Book scarce with any thing at all else: his Liberty and Necessity is a little, very feat Book: but there's nothing but a new Definition of Liberty to make it agree with Necessity; and he might e'en as well have made one Definition for Fire and Water. Of his Books <hi>de Cive</hi> and Leviathan, I need say nothing: because most of this, and the former Dialogues concerns them. And lastly, as to his Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, I leave them to be judged by others. But only, <hi>Reader,</hi> let me tell thee thus much, that if in that Science thou preferrest one doting, conceited Fellow, not only before all the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
<pb facs="tcp:48558:14"/>
of our own Nation; but also all in <hi>Europe</hi> (which thou must do, if thou admirest his Mathematicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) then I do look upon thee to have arrived to the height of the <hi>Hobbian</hi> Spirit; and thou mayst e'en continue in it. So that what is in it, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou hast left now to admire in thy Master. 'Tis a most plain Case, that he's neither Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, nor Philosopher, nor Moralist, nor Politician: and upon the credit of others, I'le presume him no Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician. Yes, I'le tell thee what he's good for, and truly that's just all <hi>viz</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, he is a very good <hi>English</hi> Grammarian; (and those that are skill'd in <hi>Latine,</hi> say he must not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend higher:) and knowing exactly the difference between <hi>do</hi> and <hi>doth, which</hi> and <hi>who,</hi> would have made a most absolute, unlimited, irresistible Soveraign of a Country-School; and upon Play days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we'll allow him t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereas it is plain, in his Common-wealth, there is nothing at all new; but only saucy impudent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the Laws, Constitutions, and Government of our Realm. And don't mistake your selves, he's every whit as much against the Civil Power,
<pb facs="tcp:48558:15"/>
as Ecclesiastical. And suppose that you are willing to excuse him; yet His Majesty likes such money, as is given him by the Parliament; and such Laws as they advise him to make; and thinks himself Prince enough, and is contented with his place; though, according to the strict Rules of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>'s definition of a Monarch, he can't make Bibles, nor turn God out of the World. As for the rest of his Politicks, they are such as are known to every Dragoon: and when he writ them, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, for the immortal Peace of his Country; he might e'en as well have put out a Regular System to tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>It is possible, <hi>Reader,</hi> that thou mayst now expect I should give thee some account of the following Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue: but I have no mind to't, only whereas some in a Book against <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> might look for close and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arguing; thou art to understand
<pb facs="tcp:48558:15"/>
that I was always ready for it, but never could find an opportunity. For when I had pulled a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pieces <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>'s Phrases, and changed his affected words into such as were familiar; I always found, that to confute him throughly, was only to understand him aright.

There are, thou knowest, several senses belonging to a man; which senses seldom lie long fallow; but are constantly busy'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48558:26"/>
and knock'd upon by this outward World: so that these knockings sav'd all together, and treasur'd up in the brain, in twenty years time, suppose, will amount to a vast bank of motion: hence now it comes about, that a man may easily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and oft-times seem to think <hi>Voluntier,</hi> when as he only filtches out of the common stock.</p>

               <p>In the first place I do say that 'tis not speech, or the uttering of words that does at all make a man; but the understanding those words he utters, and the applying the same aptly. For suppose you go to your Cage, and ask your <hi>Pye,</hi> how do you do this Morning? and the <hi>Pye</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, how do <hi>YOU</hi> do this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? now if you can but teach the <hi>Pye</hi> to lay the accent strong enough upon that same <hi>YOU</hi> which she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48558:27"/>
'tis then plain reparty, and the <hi>Pye</hi> shall presently put in for a place at <hi>Court.</hi> And as speech alone will never amount to reasoning; so by your good leave, <hi>Philautus,</hi> there may be reasoning without speech: that is, there may be demonstrative inferring or concluding without the use of words. For I don't imagine reasoning to consist in gaping or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, but in perceiving the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the effect from its causes; which deaf and dumb people by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances certainly do, as well as the lowdest disputant in the <hi>Schools.</hi> But of these things, <hi>Philautus,</hi> you and I may have further occasion to discourse, before we part.

               <p>But that, <hi>Tim,</hi> namely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of himself he can choose to come or stay at home, is the very controversie betwixt us; and against it I have two familiar Cases to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; one concerning the <hi>weather,</hi> t'other concerning <hi>dice:</hi> each of which will most effectually prove (if ever I prov'd any thing at all) the <hi>necessity</hi> of all kind of events what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, humane or not humane. And therefore the first thing I would know of thee is this: <hi>whether 'tis necessary that to morrow it shall rain, or not rain:</hi> what thinkest thou?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I believe 'tis.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis! 'tis what?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis most absolutely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48558:41"/>
                  <hi>necessary</hi> that <hi>to morrow it shall rain, or not rain.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But that's not my meaning, <hi>Tim:</hi> but, it being <hi>necessary</hi> that to morrow it shall rain or not rain, that, which I would know, is whether this very one, or that very one is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>necessary.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I care not much if (for a little while) I believe that also. For I always love to believe, as much as ever my skin will hold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Then farewell all <hi>contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and <hi>Freewill.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>As for contingencies, let the <hi>Poet</hi> and the <hi>Bees</hi> look to them: but as for my <hi>Freewill,</hi> I won't take ten groats for't yet. For the instance you give is no trial at all of <hi>Freewill.</hi> For I believe 'twill <hi>necessarily</hi> rain, or <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily</hi> not rain to morrow (as that the sun will rise or not rise) because the weather is not within a mans power; but falls out <hi>necessarily</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the course of the World: not for your silly reason, <hi>because 'tis a true disjunctive proposition: and</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48558:41"/>
                  <hi>therefore the whole being necessarily true, the parts or one of them should be so too:</hi> for do but try it, <hi>Philau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> in any other proposition, where the <hi>necessity</hi> of events may not be concern'd (that there may be no sculking advantage in the word <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>) and you shall see 'tis so querk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly and ignorantly said, that a very fresh-man but of a months standing, would have been asham'd to have been guilty of such a gross errour. For jnstance; Every number is odd or even, is a proposition so very good and laudable, that the <hi>Pope</hi> himself has not a better in all his budget: that is, if you serve it up all whole together: but take the same, and chop it into two Messes, <hi>viz.</hi> Every number is odd, ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ry number is even: and it makes two such deadly rappers as would choak <hi>old Nick</hi> himself. So again, to say that every man in the world is in <hi>London,</hi> or out of <hi>London,</hi> has no hurt at all in't. But pull this in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and it may so fall out, that there
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48558:42"/>
may be most deadly crowding for the Wall.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But these cases, that you have put <hi>Tim,</hi> being general; you only mean that some numbers are odd, and some even: and some men are in <hi>Town,</hi> and some are out.</p>

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>And if you suppose in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that to morrow my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> goes abroad or stays at home: you only mean that sometimes he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to go abroad and sometime he's pleased to stay at home. For though that same <hi>Omnis</hi> be a person of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful dispatch and presence, yet 'twould make the greatest individual <hi>Magistrates</hi> head in the world, to gigge again, to have so much busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon his hand, as to be fore'd all the day long to be abroad at home.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I know he can be but in one place: but wherever that be, 'tis upon necessity.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Because every proposition is true or false.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>That's right: if therefore
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48558:42"/>
every proposition in the world were true, or every proposition were false (which, <hi>Philautus,</hi> is your way of Computation) then I grant you, that he must needs go, that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> drives. But because there's Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room enough, and that some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are true, and some false; therefore I am resolv'd to enjoy my humour, and neither to go, nor drive, unless I have a mind to't. For in short, <hi>Philautus,</hi> that same old famous story of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s necessarily dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to morrow, or not, because every proposition is now true or false, has no more in't but just this; that 'tis true to day, that one of the two shall be true or come to pass to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; or 'tis true or false to day, that this or that particularly shall be true or come to pass to morrow: and sweat and shuffle as long as you will, you can never advance that querk any higher. And therefore to make an end of this same story of <hi>Socrates</hi> and the <hi>weather;</hi> seeing, <hi>Philautus,</hi> these same <hi>English</hi> men are most of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48558:43"/>
them a Company of clownish and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous dunces; the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> having no breeding, the <hi>Philosophers</hi> having not tasted of motion, and the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> being much o'rerun with the <hi>scab</hi> of ignorance, pride, and <hi>symbols;</hi> the best way will be to draw up your opinion concerning a disjunctive proposition (you may do it in half a sheet) and send it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea: where (as you very friendlily inform your self in your late <hi>lux Mathematica, &amp;c.) you are much read, understood, and admir'd:</hi> and if amongst all your acquaintance, you can get so much but as one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription to your Paper, by any body that knows what belongs to Logick (to which you appeal in this very Case) then shall it <hi>rain</hi> or <hi>not rain;</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> shall <hi>dispute</hi> or <hi>not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> whenever <hi>Philautus</hi> pleases.</p>

               <p>What dost tell me of <hi>Logick?</hi> dost think that I that began to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the very first day I went into breeches, will be bound up to your paltry, pimping, pedantick rules of

                  <hi>Logick?</hi> don't I know that <hi>Logick</hi> is the Mother of all Lyes, and the Nurse of your damn'd, confounded <hi>Metaphysical jargons?</hi>

               <p>No, no, Sir: you shan't be confuted: it does not at all become one of your <hi>age</hi> to be confuted: 'tis uncivil, Sir, 'tis not done at all like a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to confute you: You shall have a <hi>protection</hi> from his <hi>Majesty</hi> not to be confuted.</p>

               <p>You lye in your very throat. I never went about any such thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps so: but however having now done with the business of the <hi>weather;</hi> let's now if you please, Sir, have one <hi>throw</hi> at <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Necessity;</hi> that we may see, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48558:44"/>
the <hi>Dice</hi> will run on my side, or yours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Done: I would know then, suppose, I take a <hi>die,</hi> and throwing it upon the Table, there comes up such or such a cast: whether there was not an absolute <hi>necessity</hi> of that particular cast.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Most absolute.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Then have you perfectly <hi>gam'd</hi> away your <hi>Freewill.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: just as much as t'was <hi>rain'd</hi> away before. For supposing (as you do) that a <hi>die</hi> have (as they call them) so many chances, and such a chance to lie uppermost when 'tis thrown, and to be thrown with such or such a force, and upon a table of such or such a smoothness, then say I there will as necessarily come forth such or such a cast, as if there had been never another cast upon the <hi>die</hi> but that which came forth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Then there's <hi>necessity</hi> enough.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Enough: but nothing to your purpose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>That's strange.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:48558:44"/>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all: because all the several circumstances requir'd to such a cast, notwithstanding all that you have supposed, are wholy still in my own power; that is, I may choose which side I'le lay foremost, upon what I'le make the throw, and if need be I can have a spring with so many notches, that shall let go the <hi>die,</hi> and give it as many turns, as I please.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>You chuse! you please! 'tis a very hard matter, I see, to beat people out of the common track of non-sense. And therefore though there's nothing more seemingly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, or more proper to be insisted on, than the <hi>weather</hi> and <hi>dice;</hi> yet, because to give particular instances would be endless, I shall rather chuse to put all out of doubt, and settle the whole business by one <hi>general argument.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>That will be well indeed. For I love at my very heart those same <hi>general arguments;</hi> because they pretend to kill the old one
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48558:45"/>
in the Nest. How is it I pray, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis thus: <hi>there is, say I, a necessity or necessary cause of all events; because every event has a sufficient cause. For an event is that which is come to pass: and nothing can come to pass unless somewhat produce it: and produc'd it cannot be, but by that which is able or sufficient to produce it: that is to say, but by the meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all that's necessary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>And what then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Then every thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, is <hi>necessarily</hi> produc'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Because all is met together that was <hi>necessary.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore they <hi>necessarily</hi> met together: did they? O your Servant, Sir! because Fire, Water, and Oatmeal are <hi>requisite</hi> (that's all the meaning of <hi>necessary</hi> here) for the making of <hi>Water-gruell:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I must of necessity fall upon the operation at four of the Clock; and

'tis impossible for me to forbear, or imploy my self otherwise at that time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>So 'tis impossible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>To do what: to stab and kill a man, and then to unstab and unkill him again? that's all, <hi>Philautus:</hi> for seeing in our <hi>Country</hi> ther's no halfing or quartering of effects: therefore (say you) all effects are necessary: that is, you suppose the thing done, or (which is all one) to be in such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that 'tis impossible but that it should be done; and then you conclude 'twas <hi>necessary</hi> that it should be done. Whereas the question is not whether when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <sp>

               <p>Because no body could ever play at it.

               <p>Questionless there may be several: for suppose, the <hi>gamester</hi> chops at <hi>even:</hi> one <hi>sufficient cause</hi> of that choice may be, that, by so doing, it is an <hi>even</hi> case but that he wins: and certainly he's a very foul Gamester that desires any more than to <hi>win.</hi> In the next place, 'tis to be considered, that possibly the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d, I need not explain. Besides, it must
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48558:48"/>
not be omitted, that the choice which is propounded is not <hi>odd</hi> or <hi>even,</hi> but <hi>even</hi> or <hi>odd:</hi> so that <hi>even</hi> getting the start of <hi>odd,</hi> claps in <hi>physically</hi> upon the phansie, before <hi>odd</hi> can possibly get up. To all which (if need were) may be further added, that perhaps the <hi>Gentleman Elector</hi> by some means or other may have been prejudic'd against <hi>odd:</hi> either by having an <hi>odd</hi> Father, an <hi>odd</hi> Mother, or an <hi>odd</hi> kind of Wife; and many such an <hi>odd</hi> thing may have happen'd, that may have quite disoblidg'd him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispos'd him to <hi>odd.</hi> And as there may be many other <hi>sufficient causes</hi> that may thus jog and incline the will to <hi>even:</hi> so without doubt one that married but a small relation of <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> for a very little fee, could do as much for <hi>odd.</hi>

as they seem to be, give me leave to tell you, <hi>Philautus,</hi> that these same <hi>trifles</hi> and <hi>inconsiderables</hi> do ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroy not only all your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Necessity,</hi> but all that nothing that you have said against <hi>immaterial substances.</hi> For, if any one man since the world began, has but lifted up his finger meerly because he would do so: that is to say, when all <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward causes</hi> and <hi>considerations</hi> did equally solicite him to move it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, (were there no other) 'tis a <hi>demonstration</hi> to me, that there is somewhat in the world besides <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and that man is of that kind.</p>

               <p>I prithee don't tear me a pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now, with those <hi>contradictions</hi> of <hi>immaterial substances:</hi> but let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise thee not to be cheated with such phrases, as thou didst just now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>he would do so,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth: for we oft-times hear people say, <hi>they will</hi> do such a thing; I, that <hi>they will:</hi> as if the <hi>will</hi> were the only determining cause: whereas there's abominable Pride, Vain-glory, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48558:49"/>
perverseness in that expression. For example, you tell a man, suppose, that <hi>he shan't</hi> fling his <hi>Hat</hi> into the fire; no that <hi>he shan't.</hi> Say you so, says he?

               <p>And truly he's right enough serv'd, that gives a <hi>Gentleman</hi> such saucy language.

               <p>For my part, I keep to my old opinion: that <hi>every thing has a beginning: and that nothing can come to pass alone.</hi>

               <p>Most certainly nothing can: and therefore, doubtless the sufficient

cause of this whole business lie couch'd in the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>three.</hi> For, as the <hi>twenty third</hi> of <hi>April</hi> is to a <hi>silk Doublet</hi> cut into <hi>thirty nine pieces:</hi> so are those <hi>thirty nine pieces</hi> steep'd in <hi>Rhenish Wine</hi> till the <hi>first</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> to the <hi>Tamarisk Box,</hi> with the foresaid <hi>superscription,</hi> laid under the pillow the night before <hi>Full Moon.</hi>

               <p>I must confess, that the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and <hi>sufficient cause</hi> of some acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (especially of those which are call'd <hi>indifferent</hi>) lie oft-times very deep: but of all actions, I am from hence sure, there's always one at the bottom; because in all common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and concerns of life, it lies so very plain.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I grant you that the <hi>probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of many events lies very plain: but not the <hi>necessity</hi> of any one, that I know of. That is to say in other words, that man being a <hi>rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> for the most part is pleas'd (not constrain'd) to do that which is most <hi>reasonable:</hi> so if a <hi>Merchant,</hi> suppose, is promised an old debt of

                  <hi>five thousand pounds,</hi> for crossing the street: 'tis highly probable, that such news as this, will make the spirits to sally a little towards the Legs. But what if he stays at home only to suck his <hi>middle finger?</hi>

               <p>The cunning of that may be, <hi>Tim,</hi> to make such Fools as thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that man has dominion over his actions.

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>But how came he, Sir, to dote so much upon his <hi>middle finger:</hi> does the Doctrine of <hi>Freewill</hi> make the <hi>middle finger</hi> grow fatter than all the rest?</p>

            <sp>

                  <hi>Philautus,</hi> suppose a man be catch'd in a good <hi>lusty rain:</hi> there is such probability of some events, that I count it more than two to one, that he will choose to borrow a <hi>Cloak,</hi> rather than a <hi>Curry-comb</hi> or <hi>shooing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn.</hi>

               <p>And I can say it as often, that 'tis not.

For the same principle which impowers a man for to do any one thing upon no extrinsecal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48558:51"/>
at all; impowers him to <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear</hi> the doing of any other thing whatever, though he has a <hi>thousand reasons</hi> to do it. Against all which, you have no other sence, but only to pop in that lamentable engine of your <hi>sufficient cause.</hi> The sum of which is only this, that whatever is already done, can't be undone: and whatever is not yet done, is not done as yet.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>That great notion of a <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause</hi> (whereby I absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the necessity of all events) which you so saucily disdain, has stun'd all the great <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> Whereas all those <hi>inconveniencies</hi> and <hi>absurdities</hi> which they charge upon my Doctrine, of themselves vanish in a moment; they being chiefly grounded (as most er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are) upon nothing else but want of understanding of the true signification of words. It would be very tedious, <hi>Tim,</hi> to repeat many of their <hi>objections,</hi> they are so into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably silly: and therefore I shall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48558:52"/>
only give you a very short specimen of their folly. In the first place they'l tell you, that if there be a necessity of all humane actions, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose do we <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>commend</hi> one action; and <hi>blame</hi> and <hi>discommend</hi> another. Ignorant Souls! that should not understand, that <hi>to praise or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a thing, is only to say a thing is good: good I say for me, or for some body else, or for the State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> And in like manner to blame and discommend a thing, is no more than to say that 'tis bad and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. For instance, what more common, <hi>Tim,</hi> than for people, in cold weather, to say there's a <hi>very good</hi> fire: an <hi>excellent good</hi> fire: a <hi>special good</hi> fire: a <hi>most stately Princely</hi> fire (words big enough for the greatest exploits of the mightiest <hi>Hero</hi>) and yet, I suppose, very few think that the fire burns out of <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>discretion:</hi> and that it lies list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and gaping for <hi>commendations,</hi> and burns accordingly. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, what is it we mean when we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48558:52"/>
express our dislike and disgust? Be true now, and tell me, <hi>Tim;</hi> is there any thing more frequent than to say, that such an Horse is <hi>blind</hi> or <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd:</hi> that he <hi>starts, halts,</hi> or <hi>stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi> that he's a <hi>very Jade:</hi> a <hi>rotten, molten, confounded Jade;</hi> (words that do most passionately express blame and displeasure) and yet again we don't suppose that the Horse ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested the <hi>Blacksmith</hi> to drive a nail up to the hilts into his foot: or desir'd the <hi>Groom</hi> to thrust out one of his Eyes with the Pitch-fork, or to ride him so hard, as to melt or founder him? and therefore, in the fourty first page of my <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> I tell thee (hadst thou the wit to observe it) that, whereas people make such a great bustle about their sins; and are oft-times vex'd and can't sleep in their beds for their sins; <hi>sin is nothing else but halting or stumbling in the ways of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>

               <p>What, <hi>Tim,</hi> do you make sport and a mock of such a serious thing as <hi>sin?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>'Tis you and such as you, <hi>Philautus</hi> (whose very <hi>opinions</hi> make a mock of sin) that are the sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers: not those, who out of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere design to undeceive the World, are forc'd sometimes to condescend to very mean, and almost unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able expressions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I don't cheat or deceive any body: for 'tis plain from common Custom, and the consent of the best <hi>Authors,</hi> that <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>dispraise</hi> do equally belong to those things, that are never so far from all pretences of <hi>Freewill,</hi> as well as to men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>But then, <hi>Philautus,</hi> I would have people a little careful how, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48558:53"/>
upon what, they bestow their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations and reproofs. For though sometimes indeed they turn to very good accompt; yet at other times they have their inconveniencies. He therefore that overnight commended a <hi>diamond</hi> at such a rate, that by Morning it was grown from a <hi>Cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> to a <hi>Pippin,</hi> (besides a <hi>little young diamond</hi> it had foled, running by its side) must be granted to have spent his breath, and praises with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good discretion and profit. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the famous <hi>Miller</hi> of <hi>little Hingham</hi> much out of the way: who, when the wind did not blow to his mind, would so frown, and chide, and rattle over his Mill, that one would wonder to see, how pouring the meal came down, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. But, for all that, I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pity poor <hi>Sir Frederick.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>For what I prethee?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, he having in <hi>Christmass time</hi> (as most <hi>Gentlemen</hi> use to have) one of those same stately and Princely fires before-mention'd:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48558:54"/>
the neighbours that sat about it, fell into such lavish praises, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant admiration of the fire, that it grew so conceited, as to burn down the House. Therefore, if it must be so, that to praise or dispraise a thing is only to say that 'tis good or bad: yet however let people hence learn, that good words, as well as bad, are to be used with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. But truly, <hi>Philautus,</hi> (to deal plainly with you) as plausible as the conceipt seems to be, for my part, I much suspect whether it be true. For though we may praise a stone, tree or Horse, a mans foot or forehead, with the very same words and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in as good a stile as the best of humane actions: yet I can't but think that those commendations which are usually bestow'd upon that accompt, which we call <hi>desert,</hi> to be not only much larger, but quite of another kind from those which we give upon all other occasions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And though I don't at all doubt, but that such an one as <hi>Pliny,</hi> could
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48558:54"/>
have done very much upon the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable legs</hi> and <hi>renowned cod-piece</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth;</hi> yet I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he would have done much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>pious reign of Q. Elizabeth.</hi> But to make an end of this, <hi>Philautus,</hi> we do often indeed commend the sun for shining, and the Heavens for affording rain, and the like: but, at our end of the <hi>Town,</hi> (what you do I know not) we think hereby we praise <hi>God</hi> himself; who not out of his necessary, but free pleasure at first created, and still dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of all these things: and has made man like himself. So that still nothing is prais'd meerly because 'tis good or beneficial, but because it was contriv'd and brought about by that which need not have done it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But don't you hear people very ordinarily blame and find fault with bad winds and bad weather, as well as commend good: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of many things that could not be help'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: and I don't much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48558:55"/>
at it: for, such Fools as those, shall curse and bid the <hi>Devil</hi> take them ten thousand times over, for such things, as they could have help'd: and that's their gentile way of <hi>repentance.</hi> And therefore let us have no more concerning <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>dispraise;</hi> but let us see if they have any thing else to say against you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>They have nothing at all to say: but they think they have got somewhat by the end; when they tell you, that if there be a necessity of all humane actions; then many <hi>laws</hi> would be <hi>unjust,</hi> because the breach of them could not be avoided.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>This sounds, <hi>Philautus,</hi> as if it had somewhat in't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>That it does: and that's all. For whereas they talk of an <hi>unjust law,</hi> they had as good talk of a piece of iron burning cold. For, <hi>every Law is either divine or humane. As for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws, the irresistible power of God alone justifies all them.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Truly such a famous Broker
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48558:55"/>
for <hi>power</hi> (as you are known to be) may easily make that out. For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in your <hi>Animadversions,</hi> turn'd all the <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (as you use to do all things else) into <hi>power; making divine goodness, divine mercy, and divine justice to be nothing but power:</hi> you might securely say that <hi>divine power alone justifies all actions.</hi> That is, <hi>divine power</hi> alone together with all the rest, especially <hi>divine justice, justifies</hi> all actions. And now, I pray, a little concerning <hi>humane Laws.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Concerning them I do say al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that 'tis impossible that any one of them should be <hi>unjust.</hi> For, <hi>a humane Law is that which every subject has given his consent to: namely, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up his will to the will of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream: and no man can be unjust to himself. And therefore a Prince can't put upon his subjects any unjust Law.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose, he should put out a <hi>Law,</hi> that all that are <hi>born blind,</hi> shall have their <hi>fingers</hi> and <hi>toes</hi> cut off. There's abundance of <hi>power</hi> in this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48558:56"/>
same <hi>Law:</hi> but, in my mind, very little justice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Why, all the <hi>fingers</hi> and <hi>toes</hi> of the Nation are the <hi>supremes.</hi> And you have given up your consent as well to his <hi>pleasure,</hi> as his <hi>power.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Never in my life to such <hi>pleasure</hi> as this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>You have given your consent to all things, that he should do, be they what they will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>No but I han't. For if he has a mind to go a <hi>finger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hawking,</hi> or so; I desire to stay at home, and keep the Hogs out of the Pease. Because, long before I had bargain'd with him, I had preingaged my self to the Law of nature and reason (to which he, for all his greatness, is as much a <hi>subject</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>) never to use, or give my consent to such <hi>inhumane recreations.</hi> But, if I mistake not, <hi>Philautus,</hi> you and I had some little talk about these matters, when we met last at the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Pines.</hi> And therefore be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to consider a little those same <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments</hi> that are inflicted upon men,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48558:56"/>
for what they could not avoid. It seems a little severe, <hi>Philautus,</hi> to hang a man for <hi>stealing,</hi> suppose; when as he could not possibly help it: and to damn him for not <hi>repenting,</hi> when he could, as little help that also.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>As for <hi>damnation</hi> (if you mean your <hi>eternal damnation</hi>) I shall tell you a fine story about that by and by—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But, as for peoples being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd for what they could not avoid; the case, in short, stands thus: <hi>viz. When we say that such a one could not avoid the breaking of such a Law, we mean no more by it, but that he had a necessary will to break it. Now this same nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Just thus, Sir.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore I have sav'd the great business for the last: <hi>viz.</hi> the eternal <hi>decrees</hi> and <hi>prescience</hi> of <hi>God Almighty.</hi> I suppose it will take you some time to explain them, and to reconcile them to your <hi>Freewill.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>They are done the easiest of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48558:64"/>
any thing you have yet menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>How so, I prethee?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>How so? I don't believe any such thing at all: that's my way, Sir.—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>What, no <hi>decrees?</hi> no <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience?</hi> a most solid <hi>Divine</hi> without doubt!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Nay hold, Sir: 'tis only when I meet with one that has such a <hi>God</hi> as <hi>yours:</hi> for I believe always according to my Company: and when I meet with one that has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else for his God but <hi>omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thin matter,</hi> 'tis very idle in my opinion, to talk about his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing or determining before-hand what shall come to pass in this World. For the World may as well foreknow what God shall do, as God can what shall be done in the World: they both running into one another and so proving to be exactly the same.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But to say that God is the World is a most horrid opinion:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48558:64"/>
and therefore in my <hi>Leviathan</hi> I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reject it, as very unworthy to be spoken of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Then you must reject your <hi>omnipotent matter</hi> also. For if God be nothing else but matter; and this matter be in every particle of the World or Universe, that is (to speak according to your self) of all that is; either we have no God at all, or they are all one which you please.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But the <hi>thinness, Tim!</hi> and the <hi>omnipotency.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Never talk to me of <hi>thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> for <hi>thinness</hi> takes up as much room, as <hi>thickness.</hi> And <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> it self can never take away that incurable nusance that belongs to matter, <hi>viz.</hi> of one justling out another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But you make nothing to jumble mans <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> together, and never think then of any such clashing or enterfeiring.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore 'tis you that have help'd us to answer that difficulty: for the <hi>body</hi> of man being only flesh
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48558:65"/>
and bones, and the <hi>soul</hi> blood and spirits; their quarters (setting aside some few straglers) are e'en as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as the <hi>Oat-tub</hi> is from the <hi>Hay-Chamber.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But stay a little, <hi>Tim;</hi> you are, I perceive, very severe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding how that if God be meerly matter, the World and God should both stand together: now suppose I should grant the soul of man to be quite different from his body (which is a thing much too ridiculous to be so much as supposed) I pray, can't I, (seeing you are so very curious in your enquiring) enquire also, how contradictions can dwell together: that is, how matter and no matter can be join'd, and move one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? do you think it would not take much more time to remove and conquer such an absurdity as this, than any thing that is to be inferr'd from my opinion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing nigh so much, Sir: for though we cannot punctually tell you, by what Chains and Fetters,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48558:65"/>
matter and no matter (or spirit) are fasten'd together; yet by our senses we are so exactly acquainted with the lodgings, haunts, and all the powers of the former, and do so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well know that the most <hi>subtle</hi> and most <hi>refin'd</hi> of all must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the common incumbrances, as evidently to perceive, that <hi>matter alone</hi> can never do the business.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Because we don't only find several things very difficult to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, should there be nothing else; but somethings there be (especially <hi>two</hi>) which ever to explain is utterly impossible. And from the utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of their ever being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, we have abundance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe that there is somewhat else: the name of which we agree upon to be a <hi>spirit.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>And I prethee, <hi>Tim,</hi> may not I know what those <hi>two</hi> things be, which thou dost prophesie will never be explain'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I have told you them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48558:66"/>
                  <hi>Philautus.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> is, that God and the World are the very same; of which I desire no more may be now said. The <hi>other</hi> is, that a man can't chuse of himself to stroak his beard, when it would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Company every whit as much, if he cockt his Hat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>What a mighty business is that? to stroak a mans beard!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis such a trick, <hi>Philautus,</hi> which neither <hi>Prince Rupert</hi>'s famous Dog, that eat up the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Ammunition, nor <hi>Banks</hi>'s ingenious Horse could ever arrive to; as was before briefly hinted, in what was said about <hi>train of thoughts.</hi> And though it be not needful now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how far further; yet most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in this Man differs from all other Creatures whatever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>In this! in what I prethee?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>In Freewill, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I see not the least difference for my part. For, <hi>don't Horses, Dogs, and other bruit Beasts demur oft-times upon the way they are to take, the</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:48558:66"/>
                  <hi>Horse retiring from some strange figure that he sees, and coming on again to avoid the spur. And what is it I pray more that a man does when he delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: but one while he proceeds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action, another while retires from it, as the hope of greater good draws him, or the fear of greater evil drives him away.</hi> This I take to be the utmost that man can do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>This is nothing, Sir: for a Dog can do much more than this: for you may instruct him at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the word <hi>States,</hi> to <hi>bark</hi> and <hi>rouse</hi> as if (without the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>) he would pull 'em all down: and at the word <hi>King,</hi> to <hi>cringe</hi> and be as <hi>submissive</hi> as a <hi>Dutch-man</hi> in the days of <hi>Queen Elizabeth.</hi> But now comes the trick, Sir: I would have this same Dog two or three times in a week (not out of any Pique to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or favour to <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,</hi> but only out of pure inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent mirth and phansy) be a little cross and humoursom; and <hi>swagger</hi> when he should <hi>sneak,</hi> and <hi>sneak</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:48558:67"/>
when he should <hi>swagger.</hi> This is the Dog that I would have put into Doublet and Breeches too: and to be kept in the <hi>Tower</hi> for a <hi>precedent</hi> of <hi>Freewill.</hi> But, O the <hi>sufficient cause!</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>That's out of pure madness now: because you know well enough, that it utterly routs all that you can say either for <hi>Freewill,</hi> or <hi>immaterial substances.</hi> And therefore, seeing you make such a noise with your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities (or as you call them impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities) that you draw upon my opinion; the best way, <hi>Tim,</hi> will be to go to the poll: and then you shall see that, whereas you can find but two things impossible to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, should there be nothing in the World besides matter: I have no less than four or five impossibilities (and all swingers too) to stake down against there being any thing else.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I do, in part, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what kind of impossibilities they are. In a sun-shine day, you get into
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48558:67"/>
the <hi>Balcone</hi> in <hi>Queen-street,</hi> and there you cry <hi>Matter, Matter,</hi> nothing but <hi>Matter.</hi> And, when the people come to see what's to do, you have nothing to tell them, but only, <q>Truly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen you look like persons of parts: and 'tis great pity that such as you are should be abus'd and spoil'd for want of the knowledge of motion. Therefore might I advise you I would have you well acquainted with what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten concerning motion (of which no body has done any thing but my self,) and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And dost thou think, <hi>Tim,</hi> that I have fetch'd o're such brave men to my side, with nothing but so it is: verily so it is: Faith and troth, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, 'tis just so. Do you think Gentlemen that stand so much upon their honour and reputation, won't demand better satisfaction than this?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>They may demand what they will, but they'l find no better than what I tell you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Why, <hi>Tim,</hi> don't I, in the first place, plainly shew, that <hi>an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material substance is a meer dream and phantasm; an image or a thing behind the Looking-glass; a faiery and an old Wives tale; a small Creature of the brain, and a device of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkness?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>No truly; I never found that you did <hi>shew</hi> any such thing at all, any further than meerly by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Why, man, to say so, as the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48558:68"/>
case stands, is all one as <hi>shew</hi> it to be so. For an <hi>immaterial substance</hi> can't be <hi>shewn.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>But, by your bragging, I thought it might have been <hi>shewn,</hi> that there was no such thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>You don't at all take it, <hi>Tim.</hi> For upon that very account, that an <hi>immaterial substance can't be shewn,</hi> 'tis my <hi>second demonstration</hi> that there's no such thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Now, Sir, I think I have got it. Because an invisible thing is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wild, and can't endure to be star'd on long together (besides a great defluxion of rheum that it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions in the Spectators eyes); there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no such thing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I don't say so: but I say thus: <hi>whatever is (or rather we know to be) must some ways or other strike and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our senses. For to know is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by imagination; and to imagine is to perceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Delicate! delicate! the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is whether we have reason to believe that there's any substance in

the World, differing from such as do affect our senses.

               <p>Very right, Sir: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever pretends to be (or, which is all one, to be in the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>) must cease being a dream and

phantasm, and list it self under the notion and protection of <hi>matter.</hi> For the word <hi>Universe</hi> being made up of <hi>unum</hi> and <hi>versum:</hi> and <hi>unum</hi> being taken <hi>adverbially</hi> for <hi>only;</hi> and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi> by a kind of a figure, signifying <hi>matter</hi> (which, upon such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it may be perswaded to do) whoever talks of <hi>immaterial substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> being in the <hi>World</hi> or <hi>Universe,</hi> does most absolutely confute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: for thereby he confesses there's <hi>only matter</hi> in the World.

               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>So it does, <hi>Tim,</hi> (to the shame of all your <hi>spiritual men</hi>) for 'tis plain that never any of your <hi>Roman Authors</hi> did speak considerately of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they always stiled him <hi>Maximus,</hi> as well as <hi>Optimus.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>They do so: and if he be <hi>Maximus,</hi> to be sure he's <hi>Magnus,</hi> (and a great deal to spare) and every body knows of the alliance between <hi>magnitude</hi> and <hi>matter. Deus optimus Maximus.</hi> Most specially good! now if the <hi>Scripture</hi> proves but as well—.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis no other than that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place of the <hi>Apostle; for in him we live and move and have our being.</hi> Upon which, I do thus reason: <hi>if all men be in God, and live in God, and move in God (which the Apostle plainly affirms) and that to every man there belongs so much bulk or quantity: he ought to be sent to the Hospital, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48558:70"/>
                  <hi>God to have quantity, for he has got within himself all the quantity that men have, and his own quantity besides.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>So, so: Very well. Very well. Because the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that God created all men, and gave them life and power to move; and by his daily providence continues these blessings to them: therefore we feed upon God, and swim and fly in God: just as wild fowl do, in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park.</hi> I wish with all my heart that the basket was full.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>You need not wish for that, <hi>Tim:</hi> for I have one demonstration more against <hi>immaterial substances</hi> so very big, that 'tis enough to fill a basket alone. It lies in the very words themselves. Don't you see't, <hi>Tim?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Not in the least.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>That's strange. You'l grant, I suppose, that an <hi>incorporeal body</hi> is a good rousing contradiction. Won't you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir: 'tis one of the first head.</p>

               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>And, <hi>so is immaterial substance: for immaterial and incorporeal every man grants to be the same: and I'le undertake for body and substance being the same.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>You don't prove it, Sir: do you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>No, no: it need not, it need not; for I'll swear they are the same.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>troth</hi> would have come in excellently well there: for, by chance, all the controversie is, whether they be the same or not. (<hi>i. e.</hi> whether there be a substance distinct from body) but that's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for, it need not, it need not, no, no: it need not. For, <hi>Philautus</hi> is the man that has farm'd all the custom for the signification of <hi>words:</hi> and suffers none to go out of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but such as are seal'd: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your <hi>Apothecaries</hi> give out of the same pot, <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>quick-silver,</hi> which the customer pleases to call for: therefore <hi>Philau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore, say I, if any Gentlemen be so overkind and complemental, as to gobble down such things as these (and these are the very best that I can find) for demonstrations against <hi>immaterial substances,</hi> by all means, let <hi>Philautus</hi> take such <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> and <hi>Tim</hi> will be content with their <hi>Estates.</hi>

               <p>I'll take no Gentlemen on my side, but such as are convinc'd by solid reasons: and by your leave, <hi>Tim,</hi> I can tell you of several of my opinion, that scorn to be convinc'd with any thing less: and that are very ready to affirm, that what <hi>Philautus has said, against incorporeal substances, has not been without some reason.</hi>

               <p>Yes, I remember one, Sir: who, in a late Preface to a Play, tells us just so: <hi>viz. 'tis not,</hi> says he, <hi>without some reason, that</hi> Philautus <hi>thinks incorporeal substances to imply a contradiction.</hi>

               <p>O Sir very much: as much as any thing that you your self have said against <hi>immaterial substances.</hi> For the argument is taken out of the great art of <hi>Chymistry.</hi> Where, you know, nothing is at such variance with a <hi>spirit</hi> as <hi>phlegm.</hi> And there can happen no such scandal to a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as to have any <hi>phlegm</hi> upon its skirts.

I say, I don't think that this <hi>Poet</hi> of ours durst ever venture to meddle with any Father, except such as <hi>Father Horace, Father Juvenal,</hi> and the like: for alas, Sir, one page of a right true <hi>Phlegmatick Father</hi> would so fetter, and jade his phansie, that 'twould scarce get into a good <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick</hi> rhiming condition in a months time.

               <p>Yes, Yes, Sir: I had done it long ago: only you sent no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar directions; and so I deferr'd the business a little, least I should not have perform'd it according to your <hi>Philosophical mind.</hi> I pray, Sir, what do you mean by the word <hi>hanging?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>O by all means, Sir, for, such a nice matter as that, if it be not done with all the consideration and curiosity imaginable, a man may
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48558:78"/>
chance to do himself a mischief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be aware of it. And I am sure, <hi>Philautus,</hi> you can't but call to mind; that most of those tumults, and rebellions, deluges, and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes that have happen'd in former ages, were chiefly because they were ages of great <hi>equivocation: not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficiently mindful to signifie their meaning in</hi> setled words, <hi>which by the learned is call'd</hi> defining. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wonder, Sir, that a man so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act as you are, of all things, should omit to give us a definition of <hi>hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> it being a thing of so great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and besides in the <hi>18th</hi> page of your <hi>Leviathan</hi> you have laid so good a foundation sor't. For <hi>seeing politicks</hi> (as you there have it) <hi>are only the addition of pactions to find out mens duties: and Law is only the addition of Laws and facts, &amp;c.</hi> what else can hanging be, but only the <hi>concluding or summing up of a man from the premises:</hi> from whence we learn the exact difference between <hi>condemning</hi> and hanging: <hi>viz.</hi> to be
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48558:78"/>
condemned is only to be <hi>cast:</hi> but to be hang'd is to be <hi>summ'd</hi> or <hi>cast up.</hi> And though breaking a Leg or Arm be not altogether of such great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, as t'other thing we have been speaking of; yet, upon this accompt questionless it was, that the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Medicinal definitions</hi> (lest a man in distress should be <hi>equivocated,</hi> and send for the <hi>Joiner</hi> instead of the <hi>Bone setter</hi>) like a most safe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Artist,</hi> brands <hi>Chirurgery</hi> after an everlasting manner: <hi>Chirurgery</hi> (says he) <hi>is the quick motion of an intrepid hand join'd with experience: or an artificial action used by the hand in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick for some convenient intent.</hi>

                  <hi>definitions,</hi> and of my <hi>contriving curious characters;</hi> and, that I do this from one end to the other: I am confident that (had I patience to pose thee) thou dost not so much as understand either what 'tis to begin or end, or what is curiosity, or what 'tis to define: and yet this is <hi>Tim</hi> that accuses me of <hi>defining</hi> trifles.</p>

               <p>I beseech you, Sir, cast away one small bit of those <hi>thousand years,</hi> you have still to live (for, you know, <hi>'tis not good to be stinted</hi>) and hear me say. <hi>As for the bounds and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of beginning and end, I must step a little back, and consider there be two sorts of parts, middle and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream: which being granted I do then proceed to set them out after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. That part which is between two other parts is call'd the middle: and that which is not between two other parts, is call'd an extream. Now, of the extreams, that which is first reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd (I say of the extreams that there may be no mistake) that that very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream so first reckon'd, in strictness</hi>

                  <hi>of speech, is always to be look'd upon as the true beginning; and that which is last reckon'd to be the true ending. As for example, take me the number three: which is bounded on each side with an Unite: (for no number is actually infinite) now that Unite which stands before the middle Unite, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be first reckon'd) is to be look'd upon to be the beginning or first Unite of the number three: and that which stands after the middle Unite, the end or last unite of the number three.</hi> And now, <hi>Philautus,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that were you not wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with commending your self, as severe a Judge as you are, you your self would be ready to confess this first task to be very accurately perform'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>A definition that which explains a thing!</hi> that now is most horribly obscure, ridiculous, and absurd.

               <p>Truly, Sir, I must confess, that I never did much admire the temper of that wary Gentleman, who being requested to help to make an Inventory for his neighbour, would by no means be perswaded to engage in the business, till they had first agreed upon principles, and set down <hi>quid est</hi> fire shovel, <hi>quid</hi> tongs, and <hi>quid</hi> bellows. And very little better opinion have I of those, who obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> to chuse their own terms, and to give them what signification they pleased, shall vainly do the like in all kind of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48558:82"/>
discourses: defining things, that by custom have been long determin'd; or that have been sufficiently defin'd before. For my part, I always thought, that a man might have a very nigh ghessing, when he was in the <hi>Jail,</hi> and when not: till I look'd into the <hi>164th. page</hi> of your <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and then I found, that 'twas almost as hard for a man to understand what a <hi>Prison</hi> was, as to get out of it. For, <hi>imprisonment</hi> (to define it fully and exactly) <hi>is all restraint of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, caus'd by an enternal obstacle, be it a House, which is call'd by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral name of a Prison, or an Island.</hi> Thus <hi>Du Val</hi> and such others, have (upon occasion) been restrain'd by the <hi>external obstacle</hi> of <hi>Newgate</hi> for some <hi>convenient intent.</hi> And, you know, <hi>Jack Lambert</hi> is at this time <hi>obstacl'd</hi> up at the <hi>Isle</hi> of—</p>

               <p>Then I tell you, that though others may have observ'd, that a House may come under the notion

               <p>I do a little question it, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus:</hi> for now I think on't, in an <hi>old merry song,</hi> there's a very nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hint towards an <hi>Island</hi> being a <hi>Prison;</hi> and more than that too, there's direction given how, if need be, to break <hi>Prison.</hi> For the <hi>Poet</hi> does not only say, that <hi>the Land is a large Prison inclos'd with Sea:</hi> but adds further, that if we would but set lustily to't, and <hi>drink up the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Ocean) we may set our selves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Ay, and a thousand too. I'd fain see any body shew me, either in <hi>Book,</hi> or <hi>Manuscript</hi> any thing like what you have in that Chapter of yours, call'd <hi>the nutrition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of a Commonwealth.</hi>

               <p>What have you there? why, Sir, you have there, not only a most exact division of all commodities into <hi>Native</hi> and <hi>Foreign:</hi> but (lest people should loose their time a <hi>Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megging,</hi> or <hi>Cloving</hi> in <hi>Enfield,</hi> or <hi>Epping</hi> Forest) you are pleas'd to acquaint us besides with the very essence, and nature of each commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. <hi>A Native Commodity</hi> (say you, very gravely) <hi>is that which is to be had within the territory of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi> That sounds bravely. <hi>Within the territory of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> 'Twill almost furnish a shop alone. <hi>And a Foreign Commodity is that which is imported from without.</hi>

               <p>And is not this very true, and useful besides?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis so very true, that I much question whether it be useful at all.

such Ceremony, in such a trivial matter. And more than that, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus,</hi> I am very confident, that should any man go about solemnly (as you do) to advise and caution one of these same Youngsters, in what immediately follows; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver but his message in the common Town language, he would count himself so horribly abus'd, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to cry <hi>huzza,</hi> and break all the Windows of such an Instructor.</p>

               <p>The very bottom of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only this, Sir: <hi>viz.</hi> that if we have, suppose, here in our <hi>Country,</hi> more Pudding than Plums, and other people have got more Plums than Pudding; the best way will be for the Pudding and the Plums to hold a correspondence. But now, Sir, from the consideration of <hi>Native</hi> and <hi>Foreign Commodities,</hi> to biggen this spare and lean notion into a <hi>Sir John:</hi> 'tis thus. <hi>And because</hi> (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins as statelily, as a Preface to an Act of <hi>Parliament) there is no Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>

Sir, a <hi>Taylor</hi> makes a Gentleman a Suit of Cloths; but sees not a farth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of money, but only a very sweet promising countenance. And, upon the same terms, he proceeds to a second, a third, and a fourth. Most certainly this sweet promising coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance will take much better with a <hi>fresh Taylor,</hi> than with the old beaten Dog of <hi>much memory:</hi> for he has four very bad <hi>consequences,</hi> already upon the file. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (as you have it in the same <hi>page) as long as we live, we must note this; that, he that is most vers'd and studied in the matters he ghesses at, is certainly the best ghesser. And that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath most signs to go by. From whence it follows, that though no sign is absolutely certain; yet (we may take this for certain) that the oftner the Consequences have been observ'd, the less uncertain is the sign.</hi> As sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the Dun-Cow turns up her tail, and frisking about the Close im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon that we have a show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of rain: this being the first <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,</hi>

'tis possible that the Farmer may venture his Corn abroad, for all the Dun-Cow. But suppose her phansie continues; (for I can't think, that the meer motion of her tail can <hi>physically</hi> pull down the Clouds) and that the same <hi>consequence</hi> is strictly observ'd for a whole year together; <hi>Will. Lilly</hi> may send his <hi>Almanacks</hi> to <hi>Market,</hi> and so forth; but, upon my word, the Dun-Cow will send them home again with rattle.

               <p>Why, <hi>Tim,</hi> is it not highly reasonable and convenient, that if two parties disagree about matter of

               <p>Very reasonable and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, Sir. And accordingly you write it down for your <hi>fifteenth law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> But the divination lies in hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this <hi>fifteenth,</hi> a <hi>sixteenth law of nature. viz.</hi> that no man must be judge in his own cause. Which <hi>sixteenth law</hi> comes into the World, after this manner. <hi>Seeing that when two parties disagree about a matter of right, it is a law of nature that they should leave it to the determination of a third: we gather</hi> (say you) what? <hi>that this third must not be one of the two.</hi> No, no: that would be most horrible foul play indeed: that when <hi>two</hi> disagreeing parties had taken pains to chuse a <hi>third,</hi> and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken a very good Dinner: no sooner does this <hi>third</hi> get into the Chair, but whip goes he into one of the <hi>two;</hi> and there's all the fat in the fire.</p>

               <p>This now is so abominably

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>But hold a little, <hi>Philautus;</hi> you should have ask'd first, whose it was. For, in good truth, this same of <hi>the third being none of the two,</hi> is one of your own <hi>Mathematical gatherings.</hi> And because (I know) you love your own words, better than any bodies else; you shall have them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as they stand, <hi>p.</hi> 49. upon condition you'l trust me another time. <hi>But from this ground</hi> (say you) <hi>that an Arbiter or Judge is chosen by the differing parties to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Controversie, we gather</hi> (in <hi>Latin</hi> 'tis <hi>colligitur) that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter must not be one of the parties.</hi> Do you see <hi>Philautus?</hi> 'tis plainly your opinion, that the <hi>third</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that is chosen by the <hi>two</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties, must not be <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> that chose. For it takes <hi>two</hi> and <hi>one</hi> more, to make a <hi>third.</hi> And besides, 'twould be a very inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient thing; as you proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate it, in the same <hi>Article.</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:48558:89"/>
                  <hi>For,</hi> say you, <hi>every man is presum'd to seek what is good for himself natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and what is just only for peace sake and accidentally; and therefore cannot observe the same equallity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the law of nature, so exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a third man would do.</hi> No, no: he can't observe it: nothing near so exactly. For supposing the <hi>third</hi> should be <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>two,</hi> to be sure he, after a few Complements, would so utterly forget that he was a <hi>third,</hi> that he would e'en deal as archly for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>'Tis very demonstrable, Sir.

reason the <hi>Master</hi> only held forth the piece of bread, and did not orally say to the Dog; here, <hi>Jowler,</hi> skip over this stick, and thou shalt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have this piece of bread; or if he had said so, yet <hi>Jowler</hi> being not able to take him at his word, and to say <hi>done Master;</hi> (by which the right of the bread might be <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd</hi> upon performance of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants:) thereupon it is that, if the <hi>Master</hi> either eats the bread himself, or gives it to any other Dog (though never so little deserving) <hi>Jowler</hi> can never recover of his <hi>Master</hi> this piece of bread, or any other thing to the value of it, either at <hi>Common-Law,</hi> or <hi>Chancery.</hi> And why? <hi>because</hi> (as you very learnedly <hi>gather</hi> it, in the foremention'd place) <hi>seeing that bruits understand not our speech, they understand not:</hi> (all understanding being nothing but knowledge of words:) <hi>and if they don't unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Again, Sir, when you advise such as have the <hi>supream Authority</hi> to affix punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the breach of their laws, you do very well: but when you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise them further (<hi>Civ. p.</hi> 207.) to put those laws sometimes into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and withall so heartily prove the convenience thereof, I can't see, but that a man without either forgery or malice, may make shift to smile. <hi>The fear,</hi> say you, <hi>whereby men are</hi>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48558:92"/>
very accurate, but of extraordinary concernment. For it removes a very considerable objection against <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. viz.</hi> if it be so necessary for the Peace of Mankind, that men should confer all their power and strength upon one man, or one as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of men, that may reduce all their wills, by plurality of voices, unto one will; how comes it about then that <hi>Bees</hi> (and such like Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) live so quietly and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, without either chusing one <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream unlimited buzzer,</hi> or <hi>one As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Bees,</hi> that by <hi>plurality</hi> of <hi>buzzes</hi> may be brought to consent in one <hi>buz?</hi> Of this there be no less than six very remarkable reasons: (no body but <hi>Philautus</hi> could have found out half so many:) In the first place, 'tis to be considered, that amongst <hi>Bees</hi> there's no <hi>contestation of honour and preferment:</hi> if one <hi>Bee</hi> has a mind to be made <hi>Burgess</hi> or <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Shire;</hi> march on, say the rest: Honey is a very good thing. Now it is not honour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48558:93"/>
but the contestation that does all the mischief in a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> It being that alone which begets envy and hatred, and these beget sedition and quarrelling, and quarrelling begets War, and War in time spoils Peace. We may possibly, now and then, have observ'd a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Bees</hi> wrastling two or three falls or so; where sometimes one would be <hi>above,</hi> and sometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but we are to know, that in strictness of speech, this being <hi>above</hi> is not to be call'd <hi>preferment,</hi> nor this <hi>endeavouring</hi> to be <hi>above contestation of preferment:</hi> because preferment (to say no more of it now) is a kind of a notable business. In the next place, we are to consider, that, that which makes men to quarrel unless aw'd by some supream power, is their esteeming of those things only which have somewhat of <hi>eminence</hi> in the enjoyment. But 'tis not so with <hi>Bees:</hi> for suppose one of them grows fatter, or proves taller by the head and shoulders than all the rest;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48558:93"/>
notwithstanding this, there's no need o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> chusing a <hi>Hive-holder,</hi> to keep them from mutinying: they having no such as custom to <hi>register</hi> their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon the Wainscot, or Mantle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree; as man does, who is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Creature, and relishes nothing but <hi>Phoenixes</hi> and <hi>eminencies.</hi> In the third place, that which secures <hi>Bees</hi> from waging War is, that they don't keep any Scales in the House, to weigh how much Honey every <hi>Bee</hi> administers towards the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock: or if they did, they having not so much the use of reason, as men, are not able to weigh it. For to weigh is only to ponderate, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare reasons. But, in the Section be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was proved that man alone was a comparing Creature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bed <hi>Bees,</hi> for fighting is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Fourthly, though <hi>Bees</hi> have some use of voice to signifie their mutual affections, and to <hi>buz</hi> and <hi>hum</hi> out one another to publick duty; yet, they having never read either <hi>Seton</hi> or <hi>Keckerman,</hi> want the art of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48558:94"/>
disposing these <hi>buzzes</hi> and <hi>hums</hi> into <hi>propositions;</hi> and also of managing those <hi>propositions</hi> into eloquent and crafty <hi>orations.</hi> So that, suppose some factious, aspiring, innovating <hi>Bee</hi> should go about to disturb the Peace, and make an uproar; yet because this <hi>Bee</hi> has not a true humane tongue (which is as very a Trumpet of War and Sedition, as a <hi>Warming-pan</hi> is of Peace and settlement, to a swarm of those Creatures) though it be as big as an <hi>Elephant</hi> it can never like <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> by its elegant speeches so thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lighten as to confound the Hive. And therefore sleep on <hi>Bees.</hi> Fifthly, give but <hi>Bees</hi> their belly full, and set them out of the wind; and <hi>libel</hi> them, and <hi>lampoon</hi> them as long as you will, all this breeds no ill blood: and the reason is, because as yet they never read <hi>Philautus</hi>'s <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> and so can't distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>injury</hi> and <hi>harm.</hi> Hive and Honey! What times should we have, if these <hi>Stingers</hi> should once but find out the difference between injury
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48558:94"/>
and harm? Sixthly, and lastly (I am sorry for this lastly: what would I give for six such more) seeing that neither the present <hi>Bees,</hi> nor their Predecessors, did ever take either the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>th</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> or the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> or the <hi>Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or the <hi>Oath</hi> upon <hi>Triplow-heath</hi> (where they say there grows many a sweet bit) what need is there, or can there be, for these Creatures to chuse any <hi>supream Magistrate</hi> to keep them in awe; when as they did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either swear, or covenant or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to keep any thing at all? and therefore finally, good night <hi>Bees;</hi> for the Moon is in the Flock-bed.</p>

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>No no, Sir: I am so far from any such thing that, to give your reasons all possible advantage, I'll take in <hi>Preface</hi> and all. The <hi>point</hi> to be debated in the <hi>Margent</hi> stands thus, <hi>viz. why the government of some bruit Creatures stands firm in concord alone, and not so of men.</hi> To decide which we make this preparation. Aristotle <hi>reckons among those animals, which he calls politick, not man only, but divers others; as the Ant, the Bee, &amp;c. which though they be destitute of reason, by which they may contract, and submit to government, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by consenting, (that is to say) ensuing or eschewing the same things, they so direct their actions to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon end, that their meetings are not obnoxious unto any seditions. Yet is not their gathering together a civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and therefore those animals not to be termed political, because their Government is only a consent, or many wills concurring in one object, not (as is necessary in civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) one will. It is very true, that</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:48558:95"/>
                  <hi>in those Creatures, living only by sense and appetite, their consent of minds is so durable, as there is no need of any thing more to secure it, and (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence) to preserve peace among them, than barely their n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>tural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But among men the case is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi> Now begin the six reasons. <hi>For first among them there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of honour and preferment; among Beasts there is none: whence hatred and envy, out of which arise Sedition and War, is among men, among Beasts no such matter. Next, the natural appetite of Bees, and the like Creatures, is conformable, and they desire the common good which among them differs not from their private; but man scarce esteems any thing good which hath not somewhat of eminence in the enjoyment, more than that which others do possess. Thirdly, those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are void of reason, see no defect, or think they see none, in the administration of their Common-weals; but in a multitude of men there are many who supposing themselves wiser</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:48558:96"/>
                  <hi>than others, endeavour to innovate, and divers Innovators innovate divers ways, which is a meer distraction, and civil War. Fourthly, these Brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, howsoever they may have the use of their voice to signifie their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to each other, yet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nt they that same art of words which is necessarily required to those motions in the mind, whereby good is represented to it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better, and evil as worse than in truth it is; But the tongue of man is a Trumpet of War, and Sedition; and it is reported of</hi> Pericles, <hi>that he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by his elegant speeches thundered, and lightened, and confounded whole Greece it self. Fifthly, they cannot distinguish between injury and harm; Thence it happens that as long as it is well with them, they blame not their fellows: But those men are of most trouble to the republick, who have most leisure to be idle; for they use not to contend for publick places before they have gotten the Victory over hunger, and cold. Last of all, the consent of those brutal Creatures is natural, that</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:48558:96"/>
                  <hi>of men by compact only (that is to say) artificial; it is therefore no matter of wonder if somewhat more be needful for men to the end they may live in peace.</hi> Now am I as much taken with these six reasons, as the Gentleman was with his good piece of road. I profess, I have a great mind to ride 'em all over again: they are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably close, so smooth, and so pleasant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes, without doubt, <hi>Tim,</hi> set but such a one as thou art on Horse-back, and there will be riding. Thou talkest of close reasoning! thou never saidst in thy whole life one line of such deep sense, as that which just now thou didst repeat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>But you have said many things as deep, Sir; as one may plainly see by your <hi>Leviathan, p.</hi> 86. where you thought the mooting this point of the <hi>Bees</hi> to be so very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the understanding the causes, the <hi>Generation</hi> and the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Common-wealth that; with great delight to your self, we
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48558:97"/>
have all the foremention'd reasons over again. And seeing you are so very much delighted, I am as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable as any Bee;</hi> and am resolv'd to be delighted too. Thus then: <hi>It is true, that certain living Creatures; as Bees, and Ants, live sociably one with another, (which are therefore by</hi> Aristotle <hi>numbred amongst Political Creatures;) and yet have no other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, than their particular judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and appetites; nor speech, whereby one of them can signifie to another, what he thinks expedient for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit: and therefore some man may perhaps desire to know, why man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind cannot do the same.</hi> (I don't believe any man in the World had ever such an odd appetite, unless he had the <hi>green sickness:</hi>) <hi>To which I answer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, That men are continually in competition for honour and dignity, which these Creatures are not; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently amongst men there ariseth on that ground, envy and hatred, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally War; but amongst these not so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48558:97"/>
                  <hi>Secondly, That amongst these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the common good differeth not from the private; and being by nature enclined to their private, they procure thereby the common benefit. But man, whose joy consisteth in comparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>lf with other men, can relish nothing but what is eminent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, That these Creatures, having not (as man) the use of reason, do not see, nor think they see any fault, in the administration of their common busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: whereas amongst men, there are very many, that think themselves wiser, and abler to govern the publick, better than the rest; and these strive to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and innovate, one this way, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that way; and thereby bring it into distraction and civil War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, That these Creatures, though they have some use of voice, in making known to one another their desires, and other affections; yet they want that art of words, by which some men can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to others, that which is good, in the likeness of evil; and evil, in the likeness of good; and augment, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48558:98"/>
                  <hi>the apparent greatness of good and evil; discontenting men, and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their peace at their pleasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, Irrational Creatures cannot distinguish between injury, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; and therefore as long as they be at ease, they are not offended with their fellows: whereas man is then most troublesom, when he is most at ease: for then it is that he loves to shew his wisdom, and contro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>l the actions of them that govern the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly, The agreement of these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is natural; that of men, is by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant only, which is artificial: and therefore 'tis no wonder if there be somewhat else required (besides Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) to make their agreement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and lasting; which is a common power, to keep them in awe, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their actions to the common bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi> I wish, with all my heart, I could tell where to happen of these six reasons, but once more: for I am as fresh, methinks, as when I first set out. Never in my life did I meet with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48558:98"/>
such a Company of good words, so artificially put together, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And yet, now I think of it <hi>Camoraldo,</hi> the great <hi>Spanish Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> gave a friend of his six very good directions for <hi>Travelling.</hi> If (says he to his friend) you be not sufficiently content with such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Foreign Countries, as <hi>Maps</hi> and <hi>Historians</hi> do afford you; but that you have a mind to peruse the <hi>Countries</hi> themselves (or at least some of them) with your very own eyes; in the first place, I do advise that into such Countries, as you have a mind to peruse after the suppos'd manner, you send not your man, but go your self. In the next place, when you be once fix'd and determin'd to <hi>go;</hi> it will be very requisite then to <hi>think of going:</hi> and that either by the motion of your own feet, or by the motion of the feet of one Horse, or of more Horses (as by Tumbrell, Cart, Waggon, Coach,) or by no Horse; as by the motion of Boat, Ship, or by some other means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48558:99"/>
of <hi>motion.</hi> For, Native and Foreign being altogether oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, there's no possible passing from one extream to another without <hi>motion.</hi> Thirdly, When you be once come (according to the directions laid down in the foregoing Article) to that <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>City</hi> that you have most mind to see and remember; be sure you <hi>stay longest</hi> there: for the longer you stay, the more you may look; and the more you look, the more you'l see; and the more you see, the more you'l remember: as was said before, <hi>he that has most signs to ghess by, is certainly the best ghesser.</hi> Fourthly, such notices and informations of things as you intend to take in at the <hi>eye,</hi> chuse rather to do it in the <hi>day</hi> time, than in the <hi>night.</hi> For though the eye and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be full out as big, after as before the Sun is down; yet by reason of the many mists, vapours, Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins and Witches that trade in the night, the skie becomes much thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd; and thereupon observations
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48558:99"/>
are rendered much more weak and uncertain. Fifthly, If after particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar observations of <hi>Houses, Churches, Cathedrals, &amp;c.</hi> (made at the time above prescrib'd) you should have a mind, (the day, suppose, before you go out of <hi>Town</hi>) to sum up all, and at one view to take the dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your whole improvements; don't you go to Bed, and draw the Curtains Close about you: for they'l refract and scare the light; nor into the bottom of a well; (as some by equivocation have done, because Stars are thence best seen:) but climb you me some <hi>Steeple, Tower,</hi> or other <hi>high place:</hi> for though it must be granted that the higher you go, the further you'l be from the earth; yet the further you are from the earth (so you be not too far) the more you'l see, in all probability, of those things that are built upon the earth. Sixthly, and Lastly, Suppose you don't travel by a proxy, but go <hi>your self</hi> in person, and perform all according to the laws of <hi>motion,</hi> and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48558:100"/>
set a work those laws of motion more or less according as 'tis worth the while to <hi>stay,</hi> and that you don't make your observations at <hi>midnight,</hi> nor out of the Cellar; then, quoth <hi>Camoraldo</hi> to his friend, as a Crown to all, I do advise, that you take a <hi>Table-book</hi> in your pocket, or some other little portable instrument to <hi>register consequences:</hi> for though it be said of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> (who for a need could thunder and lighten as well as <hi>Pericles</hi>) that he never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat any thing but injuries; yet it does not, you know, fall to one mans share of fourty to be so great an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> as <hi>Julius Caesar:</hi> and though Paper, Parchment, and Velam be all subject to the teeth of time, envy, and rats; yet by no means is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory wholly to be trusted, being oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as treacherous, as a sieve or scummer.</p>

Thirdly, The Fairies have got but one Universal King, call'd King</hi> Oberon: <hi>the Ecclesiasticks have got a King Pope, that shall play, in the night, at push-pin with their King</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. <hi>Fourthly, The Fairies are Spirits and Ghosts: Ecclesiasticks outdo 'em there; for they are spiritual men and Ghostly Fathers. Fifthly, Fairies and Ghosts inhabit darkness, solitudes, and graves:</hi> Nay, if you be good at that, we can be as private as you: for, <hi>Ecclesiasticks walk in obscurity of doctrine, in Monasteries, Churches, Church-Yards,</hi> and dark colour'd Cloths. <hi>Sixthly, The Fairies have their enchanted Castles and certain</hi>

Eleventhly, Fairies marry not;</hi> there you get nothing; <hi>neither do Priests. Twelfthly, It is said of Fairies that they enter into the Dairies, and Feast upon the Cream which they skim from the milk.</hi> The <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> are very good at skiming: for <hi>what are the Church lands but the very Cream of Nations skim'd from the Estates of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, flotten, Gentlemen?

For,</hi> say you, <hi>in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place</hi> (Lev. p. 50.) <hi>the doctrine of right and wrong is perpetually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the Pen and Sword: whereas the doctrine of lines and figures is not so.</hi>

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Not much till you pretended to the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> But yet they are never the more free from dispute for your reason, <hi>viz. because men care not in that subject, what be truth, as a thing that crosses no mans ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, profit, or lust:</hi> (ah! woe's me; woe's me: for <hi>Philautus,</hi> upon my word, has cared very much ever since his <hi>Mathematical</hi> Girl gave him a clap from <hi>Oxford:</hi>) <hi>for I doubt not, but if it had been a thing contrary to</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:48558:114"/>
                  <hi>any mans right of dominion, or to the interest of men that have dominion, that the three Angles of a Triangle should be equal to two Angles of a Square; that doctrine should have been, if not disputed, yet by the burning of all Books of Geometry, suppressed as far as he whom it concerned was able.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Why, don't you think, <hi>Tim,</hi> if the soremention'd property of a <hi>Triangle</hi> should prove injurious to a Common-wealth, but that those who have the supream Authority would call a meeting, and take some speedy care about it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Care about it, Sir? they'd have a Session purposely, not only to turn out all <hi>Triangles</hi> out of Office, and places of trust and strength; but to banish them forthwith five miles from any Corporation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I say again (as I said, in the <hi>2d. page</hi> of the <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> to my Humane nature;) that <hi>the reason why Mathematicks, or that part of learning which consist in comparing of motion and figure, is free from contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:48558:114"/>
                  <hi>and dispute; is because there's nothing in that Science against a mans interest:</hi> i. e. <hi>there's nothing that crosses a mans ambition, profit, or lust.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Fie, fie! don't say it o're again, <hi>Philautus:</hi> you had better say you were at that time a little too much in love with the <hi>Mathematicks:</hi> and, you know, in that condition, a man may be somewhat abated as for speaking reason. And therefore if I were you I'd chuse to have it go for a sudden pang, rapture, or any thing else rather than sense: for you can't but have read, <hi>Philautus,</hi> what a World of Pens have been drawn and blunted in the great quarrels and Wars that have been about <hi>bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Stars, solid Orbs, the motion of the Earth,</hi> and such like points: and yet I don't remember that <hi>Copernicus</hi> or his Doctrine did ever whisk away any mans <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>honour,</hi> or ran away with his <hi>Estate</hi> into another Country, or chous'd him of his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress.</hi> And therefore don't let us
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48558:115"/>
talk any more of this, <hi>Philautus:</hi> for without doubt, when you writ those two places, you had had a sad night on't, and been in a most strong fit of the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>So, so: this is well: it seems then to thee, <hi>Tim,</hi> that my Book <hi>contra Geometras,</hi> or <hi>contra fastum, &amp;c.</hi> does contradict what I formerly said of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry.</hi> Therefore, prethee, do so much as answer me one question. What's the difference between <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metria</hi> and <hi>Geometra?</hi> they both end in a; and therefore have a care of being out.</p>

               <p>Yes: and being a Science, 'tis certainly a Science: but what then do you write against?</p>

               <p>What do I write against?

            <sp>

               <p>But have you not, <hi>Philautus,</hi> several Seats and Pews to place these <hi>Authors</hi> in? methinks, those same malicious Raskals, that answer <hi>Books,</hi>

               <p>I deny not but there may be some mean <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> wretches, that may pretend to <hi>Mathematicks:</hi> but my design, <hi>Tim,</hi> is not to take down the Crest of this or that small, pedantick <hi>Geometer;</hi> but I flie at the whole Covy: <hi>Geometrarum totam invado nationem;</hi> as I have it in my Dedication: and again <hi>p. 5. ipsa ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredior principia, &amp; interdum etiam demonstrationes.

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>For my life, I can't get it out of my mind, but that the price of Olives is certainly faln. For, till about the year 56. <hi>Philautus</hi> did not only think that <hi>Geometry,</hi> or the <hi>Lady</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:48558:116"/>
her self was the beauty and Cream of the Creation; but that the very <hi>men,</hi> the two-legg'd <hi>men</hi> that studied and admir'd her, were the most careful, the wisest, and most happy people that ever open'd Book. And, I am confident, that had not <hi>Philautus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self been a little disappointed in some of his Writings, by this time (had he believ'd any such things) they'd have proved all <hi>Angels.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Never did I intend any such thing at all: for whatever I have written to the honour and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Geometry;</hi> 'twas (as I said before) <hi>Geometry</hi> it self that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways meant, not those phantastical, conceited people that ignorantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>If this, <hi>Philautus,</hi> was always your opinion, in my mind you have a very crasty stile. For suppose one should take up your <hi>Book de Cive</hi>—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Then, do I say, that he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up one of the best <hi>Books</hi> that ever was written in the whole World: for, though I say it my self (as I do
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48558:117"/>
in the <hi>7th</hi> page of my Letter to Dr. <hi>W.) never was any Book more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied beyond the Seas; and therefore,</hi> as I my self say again (six Less. p. 56.) <hi>in French it carries the Title of Ethicks demonstrated:</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Very modest: 'tis pity any body should say so, but ones self: now, Sir, if you please to let this same honest Gentleman read the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth page of your <hi>Epistle Dedicatory,</hi> he'll find these words. <hi>And truly the Geometricians have very admirably performed their part.</hi> (do you see, Sir, they are the two legg'd <hi>Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that have done the feat:) <hi>for whatsoever assistance doth accrew to the life of man, whether from the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavens, or from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Earth, from the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of times, or from the remotest experiments of navigation; finally, whatsoever they are in which this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age doth differ from the rude sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleness of antiquity, we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be a debt which we owe meerly to Geometry.</hi>

               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Now, <hi>Tim,</hi> let me ask thee one thing: whether is a mans mind best to be ghess'd at from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a sentence or end of it? don't I conclude and say, that all those fine things are owing to <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi> it self, and (to keep out the pragmatical <hi>Geometricians</hi>) don't I say besides, <hi>meerly to Geometry?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meerly</hi> may do excellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice now, to hedge out the <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians;</hi> but when you writ that <hi>Book,</hi> you design'd no such thing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>How can you tell what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Very well: because you tell us your self, in the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following this great encomium of <hi>Geometry.</hi> viz. <hi>if,</hi> say you, <hi>the moral Philosophers had as happily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their duty,</hi> &amp;c. As what? as <hi>Geometry</hi> it self? <hi>Geometry</hi> it self was never upon duty; and knows no more how to discharge any duty, than to discharge a Musket. No, no, I am confident, <hi>Philautus,</hi> it must be the huffing and pragmatical <hi>Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:48558:118"/>
that you then meant. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you need not be at all concerned about it; for neither <hi>Geometry,</hi> nor the <hi>Geometricians</hi> can ever sue you, for those commendations; because you have in print revoked the whole sentence. And in law, you know, the last <hi>Will</hi> always voids the former.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I revoke in print? I have made many of my Adversaries to pull in their Horns, and hang their Ears: but never said any thing so hastily my self, as to recant, or repent of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>How it came about, I know not: (perhaps <hi>Poetry</hi> might send you a Basket of Chickens;) but all that same <hi>observation of the Heavens, the description of the Earth,</hi> and the rest of that rich treasure, and furniture which about 47. you gave to <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,</hi> in the year 50. you bequeath'd it all to <hi>Poetry;</hi> just as it stood, silk Curtains and all.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But how do you know, that by fancy I must needs mean the fancy of a <hi>Poet;</hi> and not that of a <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician?</hi> and again how do you know but that by <hi>Philosophy,</hi> I meant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Geometry.</hi>

               <p>I'll tell you, Sir, how I came to discover these two great secrets. The sentence I just now mention'd is in the 132. <hi>page</hi> of your Answer to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48558:119"/>
Sir <hi>William Davenant's Preface</hi> before <hi>Gondibert:</hi> which answer is so richly fraight with the History, nature and laws of <hi>Poetry,</hi> that I am more than pretty well assur'd, that by fancy you could not easily mean that of a <hi>Geometrician.</hi> And that by <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> likewise you meant not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Geometry,</hi> but <hi>Philosophy</hi> in general, I am as well assur'd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the very next words you advise <hi>Poets,</hi> to be well skill'd in the true doctrine of <hi>moral vertue; (that in their Heroick Poems they may exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite a venerable and amiable image of Heroick vertue</hi>) and (a little after) <hi>to consult the possibility of nature; and not to talk of their impenetrable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, inchanted Castles, invulnerable bodies, iron men, flying Horses, and a thousand other such things which</hi> (as you say) <hi>are easily feign'd by them that dare.</hi> But, now I think on't, why am I so mad as to trouble my self about this? 'tis better by half for me to let all pass for <hi>Geometry;</hi> for then have I two most tearing sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48558:119"/>
in praise of the <hi>Geometricians:</hi> for, as for Geometry it self giving any precepts for the guidance of the fancy, she is so modest and mealy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd, that I'll trust her for doing any such thing; unless she make use of the pen, or mouth of some Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oldy <hi>Geometrician.</hi>

               <p>You may catch, and carp, and wrest <hi>Tim,</hi> as long as you will: but you'l never be able to find any one place, wherein I do absolutely and positively affirm, that the Writings of <hi>Geometricians</hi> do any ways tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the Writings of other men.</p>

the setling the signification of their words; which setling of significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they call definitions, and place them in the beginning of their reckonings.</q> Do you mind it, Sir? they are those same men, that begin at the setling of the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their words; and they call such setling of significations definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and (by the blessing of <hi>God</hi> upon their extraordinary care and endeavours) the doctrine of lines and figures is so accurately perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, that that alone as yet deserves the name of Science.</p>

                  <hi>must in the first place determine what he will have to be understood by his words; which determination is called definition; whereby the significations of his words are so clearly set down, that there can creep in no ambiguity.</hi> Thus 'twas, <hi>Philautus,</hi> for many years together: write about <hi>Humane Nature, Ethicks, Politicks, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Necessity,</hi> or any thing else, still <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks</hi> was the word, and the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> were the only white boys. <q>I know that that part of Philosophy wherein are considered lines and figures, has been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us notably improved by the ancients.

(as I have at large proved it, both in my six Lessons, <hi>p.</hi> 56. and in my Letter to Dr. <hi>W. p.</hi> 57.) and he that neglects that piece of justice towards himself is a most pusillanimous sneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and (for ought I know) neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects a duty as great, as any of those that belong to the Clergy-mens two <hi>Tables.</hi> And thus it happen'd when I first put out my <hi>Book de Cive:</hi> some snarled at this, some looked askew upon that, and some found fault with the whole.

               <p>Oh Sir! of that same <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentissimis omnium temporum ingeniis exculta, &amp;c.</hi> I make very much: <hi>viz.</hi> that when you writ that same <hi>Book de corpore,</hi> you were so fully satisfied with what the man <hi>Euclid,</hi> the man <hi>Archimedes</hi> and the man <hi>Apollonius</hi> had done; (who were not three Sciences, but <hi>tres substantes viri</hi> in <hi>Geometry</hi>) that you did then think that there was nothing to be said against them; nor, as far as they had gone, any thing to be altered. <hi>Quor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum enim actum agere?</hi> ay <hi>quorsum</hi> indeed: <hi>ego tantum nova &amp; pauca, &amp;c.</hi> but now, <hi>Philautus,</hi> they are all Scoundrels, Hedg-hogs, and Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars; not knowing so much as what a point is, or what a line is, or
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48558:129"/>
what superficies is, or what an angle is nor any thing else: nay you don't certainly know (<hi>non videtur Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio illa universaliter vera,</hi> say you, <hi>sed dubitans nil pronuncio</hi>) but the famous <hi>47th</hi> Proposition it self may be false? so that I am afraid that the Gods must restore to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> all the Bullocks they have received for that Proposition. Now, I'll tell you, <hi>Philautus,</hi> how all this came about.—'twas just so: really 'twas.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Really 'twas, <hi>Tim?</hi> thou art really an Owl. 'Twas just so? how so was it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>You know, <hi>Philautus,</hi> you have written a <hi>Poem</hi> upon the <hi>Peak:</hi> and upon <hi>Ulisses.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Now I am very confident, that were those <hi>verses,</hi> as capable of being confuted, as your <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> are, and have been; if need were (as was said before about <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>) we should presently have a <hi>Book</hi> out <hi>contra Fastum Pecci, &amp; Ulissis:</hi> wherein it should be proved
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48558:129"/>
that there never was any such place as the <hi>Peak;</hi> nor any such man as <hi>Ulisses;</hi> but that the one was a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Phantasm</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire;</hi> 'tother was a <hi>Phantasm</hi> that <hi>travel'd.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell you two sayings of your own; and then you may apply your self. The one is <hi>Lev. p. 21. viz. who is so stupid as both to mistake in Geometry, and also to persist in it, when another detects his error to him?</hi> the other is <hi>Ep. Ded. Hum. nat. viz. as oft as reason is against a man, so oft will a man be against reason.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I meant that, <hi>Tim,</hi> only of other people: for I my self never forsook reason in my whole life; and therefore, suppose, I should grant that in former times I might speak a little too warmly in praise of the <hi>Geometricians:</hi> am I, <hi>Tim,</hi> oblig'd to be always of the same mind; when I had so many good reasons to alter it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Now, <hi>Philautus,</hi> you say
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48558:130"/>
somewhat indeed: if you had had any reasons to do so. But you never had any, nor are ever likely to have any. But only according as you have been bitten by the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and the <hi>teeth of time;</hi> so your distemper has constantly increas'd; and thereupon you invent new exceptions, and seek out new places of refuge. For it is very evident, that when you were first taken ill; 'twas a meer plain <hi>Wallisiophobia:</hi> but the <hi>Doctor</hi> getting deeper and deeper into you; 'tis heighten'd now into a most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <hi>Euclidophobia:</hi> which is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease almost as ill as that same <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophobia</hi> you spoke of before. And I am very much afraid if the rest of your <hi>Writings</hi> were as strictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, as your <hi>Mathematicks</hi> have been; that at last it may come to a perfect <hi>Philosophophobia;</hi> which is the most dreadful howling Disease that can possibly befal a man: ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Scepticks</hi> don't make half such a noise, as one man that has got the <hi>Philosophophobia.</hi> Therefore I pray,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48558:130"/>
Sir, have a care of it: for really I look upon you to be a going that way. And I perceive you your self are not without some apprehensions of danger; by what you say in your <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> to your <hi>contra Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum, &amp;c. For a certain,</hi> say you, <hi>either I am stark mad, or all the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians are so: for I differ from them all.</hi> Remember that, Sir; and, as I said, be careful of your self: for I believe, as for their parts, they all hold pretty sound as yet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Sound? Yes, so is a Tub with twenty great holes at the bottom. Their principles are all false; their demonstrations are many of them false; (and therefore you are likely to have a good reckoning:) as I have evidently made it out by most solid reasons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I wish, Sir, you'd tell me where those same solid reasons lie. For I can find nothing but only some <hi>Grammatical, Metaphysical</hi> small-shot: such as you formerly discharg'd at the <hi>Doctor,</hi> when you and <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:48558:131"/>
first fell out. 'Tother day, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus,</hi> I look'd upon a Book of yours, called <hi>Examinatio &amp; emendatio Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicae hodiernae;</hi> a very good Title: surely, think I, we shall have some notable Reformation.

For first of all, you seize upon all <hi>motion</hi> as yours; and neither man, nor nature can do any thing, unless you lend them a little of your <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Again all <hi>reasoning</hi> is plainly yours; you being the first that ever call'd <hi>Logick Computation.</hi> And most of the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> is also yours; you being the first that demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (<hi>de corp. p.</hi> 63.) <hi>the whole to be bigger than any one part.</hi> And I don't much question but that the <hi>Sun</hi> and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48558:134"/>
the <hi>Moon</hi> also (you may do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what or other to 'em) in time, may become yours. But no more of the Whore-<hi>Algebra.</hi> Now look to your self <hi>Euclid, Clavius</hi> and the rest of you: for <hi>Philautus</hi> is coming, and upon my word wherever he comes, he makes most dreadful work. You may think (and so did he once) that you were the only people upon whose endeavours the blessing of <hi>God</hi> had fallen. But he has sent back the blessing of <hi>God;</hi> and you have made such small progress in your <hi>profession</hi> of <hi>Geometry,</hi> that there is no one of you (besides himself) that knows so much as the <hi>definition</hi> of it. <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi> (says a famous man among you) <hi>is an art of measuring well.</hi> Neatly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for a Timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Merchant, or Dial maker! but there's very nigh as many absurdities as words in the definition. For first of all <hi>Geometry</hi> is not an <hi>Art,</hi> but a <hi>Science;</hi> and if that ben't sufficiently absurd, I know not what is. Secondly, 'Tis an Art of <hi>measuring well,</hi> says
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48558:135"/>
he: measuring well? measuring what well? <hi>Geometry</hi> well? is <hi>Geometry</hi> then an art of measuring <hi>Geometry</hi> well? Lastly, says he, 'tis an art of measuring well: but how does that art measure, and by what? by Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Beams, or Rain-bows? all which abominable absurdities I avoid (<hi>Less. p. 1. cont. fast. p. 7.</hi>) by saying, that <hi>'tis the Science of determining the quantity of any thing not measured, by comparing it with some other quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or quantities measured.</hi> Again say you, suppose we go and search for an exact accompt of a <hi>figure;</hi> which is a thing of such vast concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the whole business almost of <hi>Geometry</hi> is to consider nothing else but several <hi>figures:</hi> and yet, for all that, one had e'en as good turn to <hi>Rider</hi>'s Dictionary as <hi>Euclid</hi>'s Elements for any such thing. <hi>Figura,</hi> says <hi>Euclid, est quae sub aliquibus, &amp;c.</hi> How lubberly and Porter-like was that said? <hi>figura est quae?</hi> where's here any <hi>antecedent</hi> for the <hi>Relative quae? (cont. fast. p. 17.</hi>) if there be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48558:135"/>
any, it must be either <hi>est,</hi> or <hi>figura.</hi> As for <hi>est,</hi> surely no body will take that for an <hi>antecedent:</hi> and <hi>figura</hi> is e'en as bad a Bedfellow. For then it must be <hi>figura est figura quae, &amp;c.</hi> which sounds a little oddly out of a <hi>Geometricians</hi> mouth. I told the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clidists</hi> of this (for as I said before, 'tis of infinite concernment) in my <hi>six Lessons (p.</hi> 1.) and again in my <hi>Examinatio (p.</hi> 44.) and now again in my <hi>contra fastum, &amp;c.</hi> and yet I believe they are so stupid, that in some Copies one may still find <hi>figura est quae, &amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Philautus</hi> had not come, and comforted poor <hi>quae,</hi> by saying, <hi>figura est magnitudo quae &amp;c.</hi> doubtless by this time, she had pined away her self to skin and bones, for want of an <hi>Antecedent.</hi> And thus again, say you, they do in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>proportion.</hi> Which, says <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid, est mutua quaedam habitudo, &amp;c.</hi> that is in plain English (<hi>Less. p. 7.) proportion is a what-shall-I-call-it is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or soness;</hi> or, say you, (<hi>Less. p. 16.) a whatshicalt habitude of two</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:48558:136"/>
                  <hi>quantities.</hi> I wonder where the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty of these <hi>Euclidists</hi> lies, that they should not perceive the bawdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this <hi>quaedam:</hi> all which they might have easily avoided, if with me they had said <hi>proportio est relatio &amp;c.</hi> and truly 'twas worth the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>Book</hi> on purpose to leave out <hi>quaedam,</hi> and put in <hi>relatio</hi> instead of <hi>habitudo.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But you pick the worst and least of my exceptions against the <hi>Geometricians:</hi> for I rout them about a <hi>point,</hi> a <hi>line</hi> and every thing else of concernment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>How so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I hold, <hi>Tim,</hi> that a <hi>point</hi> and a <hi>line</hi> are both really bodies; though in <hi>Mathematical consideration</hi> they are not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>What need we then trouble our selves about such an old <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical</hi> nicety, as <hi>indivisibile and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibile in infinitum, &amp;c.?</hi> seeing
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48558:136"/>
(suppose they be bodies) we are not, say you, to take notice of that in <hi>Mathematical demonstration.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>Tim,</hi> there's a vast deal, a very vast deal depends upon a <hi>point</hi> having <hi>bigness,</hi> and a <hi>line breadth.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>A vast deal indeed! if you have but the carving it out. For seeing that your <hi>squaring</hi> the <hi>circle, &amp;c.</hi> don't well agree with the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Geometry;</hi> you'l shew'em a trick, and make the principles of <hi>Geometry,</hi> to comply with your <hi>squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> the <hi>circle:</hi> and then huff comes out <hi>contra fastum, &amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Did you ever know me to wrest, or force any thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> were you, <hi>Tim,</hi> at my elbow, when I squared the circle?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>No: nor any body else, that I can hear of; for though you have done it twelve times over, yet several people say, 'tis still all to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I say, I have done it; and have demonstrated it too</hi> (cont. fast.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48558:137"/>
p. 43.) <hi>as manifestly as any proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Euclid.</hi> And therefore why may not I be believed as well as other people, and why should I be said to wrest, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>As for your being believed, <hi>Philautus,</hi> I did never care for rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much upon any mans judgment, that looked upon self-conceit to be a moral vertue: but as for 'tother thing, I had it in part from your self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>From my self; how so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>In the 41. and 43. <hi>pages</hi> of your <hi>contra fastum, &amp;c.</hi> you tell us that had the business of <hi>punctum, linea,</hi> and some such principles of <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> been sooner examined and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; we had had <hi>squaring</hi> of <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> and many other admirable things long before this time. Now I have a phansie that this sentence ought to be thus turned: <hi>viz.</hi> seeing that <hi>squaring</hi> the <hi>circle</hi> is a most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, if it would but agree with the principles of <hi>Geometry;</hi> 'tis high time now e'en to make 'em agree. But, which is worse than all, <hi>Philau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:48558:137"/>
your dear friend tells you, that they won't agree yet. And whereas you have taken such vast pains to prove a <hi>point</hi> to have <hi>bigness,</hi> and a <hi>line</hi> to have <hi>breadth;</hi> he's of the mind (<hi>Heaut. p.</hi> 112.) that <hi>Cheapside is much too narrow to do the business.</hi> Therefore in my opinion, <hi>Philautus,</hi> you had much better have suffered <hi>quae, quaedam, punctum, linea,</hi> and the rest of them to have continued, as we had them from <hi>Euclid;</hi> unless the alterations you made had been more to your profit; and the grounds you went upon more considerable. A <hi>point,</hi> say you, is a body: and why? because <hi>(de corp. p. 59.) the whole earth is a point, in respect of the Heavens; Ergo.</hi> Again, a <hi>point</hi> is a body, for <hi>'tis a mark; and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a mark is to be visible: and if visible, then,</hi> say you, <hi>(Lux Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matica p. 11.) it must be divisible:</hi> and if <hi>divisible;</hi> then say I, it must be <hi>indivisible:</hi> for wee'l never stand out for one syllable. And then for a <hi>line</hi> having latitude, and being a body;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48558:138"/>
that's so very plain that if it ben't granted nothing, say you, (<hi>Lux Math. p.</hi> 12. 32.) can be demonstrated in <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> For there's no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating</hi> without <hi>Diagrams:</hi> and no <hi>Diagrams</hi> can be made without <hi>drawing</hi> of <hi>lines,</hi> and no <hi>lines</hi> can be <hi>drawn</hi> but they will have <hi>breadth.</hi> And by such niceties and whimsies as these, (of which I could give you many more instances) have you vainly endeavoured to preserve your credit, and make people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you had great skill in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks.</hi> And the very same shifts you have made use of, to secure your Carcass, in all that you have said about <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> being all plainly founded upon your three Cardinal vertues, <hi>Self-conceit, bad nature,</hi> and most <hi>irreligious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice.</hi>

               <p>No man ever writ two such Treatises of <hi>humane politicks,</hi> and <hi>Christian politicks,</hi> as I have done—</p>

               <p>In both which I have given the Prince such due Authority, and such a vast power as will be a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of perpetual Peace, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in his Kingdom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a vast power indeed, <hi>Philautus,</hi> that you have bestowed upon him; and he is very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you: for, at one stroke, it utterly destroys both <hi>himself</hi> and his <hi>Government.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>You allow him, you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to be the maker of all <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi>

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>I would only know which way you conferr'd that power upon him: did you send it him in a Basket, as a token of your pure love to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <hi>Soveraignty:</hi> or how was it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>That power was originally divided amongst all his Subjects; but they all join'd together, and turn'd over all their power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> to him.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Don't you believe that, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus:</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:48558:139"/>
that any man, that ever thought he had the power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good and evil, would so part with it, as not to reserve a little for private use; or at least to keep the <hi>Receit.</hi> And therefore you may make a noise about absolute <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and <hi>unlimited Soveraignty;</hi> and that if the <hi>Prince</hi> ben't able to raise <hi>money</hi> at his pleasure, he'l catch an <hi>Ague,</hi> as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as if he went into the <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds:</hi> and if he takes any advice about making of <hi>Laws, he'l have a man grow out of his side;</hi> and very tender you may seem to be of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi>'s health (with reflections bad enough upon our Government) but you are even with him for all your kindness: for you give him indeed a <hi>little money;</hi> but withal every sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject leave to take away his <hi>throne,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> also.</p>

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>How (according to you) is he bound? has he promised to keep his promise: or has he sworn to keep his promise; or how has he so fasten'd himself, but that your principles will unty him?</p>

The first <hi>Complement</hi> you pass upon your Prince is, that it would please his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> to umpire the business of the <hi>Creation:</hi> (a very pretty point indeed for the <hi>civil Magistrate</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide with his Sword:) <hi>i. e.</hi> whether the World was <hi>eternal,</hi> or whether it was <hi>created</hi> by God. Here's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour now for a Prince! The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> or so, if requested, may give his opinion concerning <hi>Flanders,</hi> or concerning <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>fishing:</hi> but <hi>Philautus's Prince</hi> is to have the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of Heaven and Earth: his <hi>Prince</hi> is to determine whose the whole World is; and to whom it belongs; whether to <hi>God Almighty,</hi> or to <hi>its own self.</hi>

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48558:141"/>
that <hi>all knowledge comes from Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms;</hi> and no man can have a <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm</hi> of that which is infinite: and seeing that it is very laborious, and would tire the best Philosopher to proceed from cause to cause, till he comes to the first and truly eternal cause: I say, upon these and such like accompts, I think it reasonable, that this of the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, and all such knotty points should be left to the determination of that Authority, which has right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all things.</p>

               <p>I think, <hi>Philautus,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand you: seeing that there's no man now living upon Earth, that was really and actually present at the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World; nor that did <hi>bonâ fide</hi> see, or speak face to face with any man that was: and seeing that the tallest subject, or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that any Prince has, can't stand upon his threshold, and from thence look to the furthest end of the World, unless he cuts down the great Pear-tree; nor can stand so long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

one leg, hopping from cause to cause, but that if he hops long enough he may be tired; therefore <hi>we Prince,</hi> by the Authority aforesaid, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and determine that the World had no <hi>beginning,</hi> but was <hi>eternal.</hi> Given at our Court—dasho.</p>

place <hi>de Corp.</hi> and you'l soon perceive it.

               <p>That's a very good hit: I perceive <hi>Philautus</hi> begins to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle angry; and when so, then a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,</hi> forsooth, in strictness of speech, signifies only some <hi>Officer</hi> of the <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> not the <hi>Soveraign</hi> himself.

and for all that walk religiously home; believing and trusting in God every step that I set; and praising him for all the good Victuals that I have eaten, and all the great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that I have obtain'd, over such as out of envy have endeavour'd to answer my <hi>Books?</hi>

               <p>And when you come there, he tells you that he has been that Morning running o're the World, and the affairs thereof; and, upon the whole, he can't find that there is any God besides himself. What would you then say, <hi>Philautus?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>I should beg his pardon as to that, as great as he is; and tell him plainly that I know what belongs to a God better than he; and I know that he is no more than Gods <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant;</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:48558:144"/>
and that I am more oblig'd to God (being more powerful) for the several kindnesses that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd srom him, and the great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that he may do me, than I ever was or can be to him.</p>

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; 'tis just so: come I'll tell you what you'd say, Sir:—<hi>truly says</hi> Philautus, <hi>Majesty is not to be put out of humour for every small matter: 'tis pity the Prince should spoil his Hat with cocking it; or his shoes with stamping, or his countenance with frowning: meekness becomes a subject; and therefore I'll be silent.</hi> But being silent, <hi>Philautus,</hi> won't serve your
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48558:145"/>
turn: for you must pronounce with a clear and lowd voice that he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom you now stand, is not Gods <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> but <hi>God himself:</hi> and not only so, but that he is the <hi>Almighty, Omnipotent</hi> and <hi>Eternal God;</hi> who, when you were asleep Created you, and all things else; but especially his own <hi>great Grandfather;</hi> you must say, pronounce, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe all this; or else—<hi>You need not go on,</hi> says <hi>Philautus, I am yours, I am yours, Sir: for what is a true Prince but one, to whom all the right and power of the whole Kingdom is transferr'd: and if he comes to his Soveraignty by right of succession I have (Lev. p. 99.) prov'd such Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty to be a kind of eternity. So that he understands nothing at all of the Generation of a Common-wealth that sticks in the least to grant every absolute Monarch to be Almighty, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent and Eternal.</hi> But you have not done yet, <hi>Philautus,</hi> for after all this you must engage to worship the Prince with the very same words, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48558:145"/>
same postures, as you use to do God Almighty: praying unto him for health, long life, rain, fair-weather and the like: and this you must do so lowd, that all your Neighbours may hear you; and besides, that they may think you to be in good earnest; you must take all publick occasions to curse and blaspheme God, in the most affronting and defying words that can be invented.—<hi>That's a little odd,</hi> says <hi>Philautus, that a Prince, let him be as absolute as he can, should be able to make it rain or hold up. But, now I think of it, by right of subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have made over my whole body, and every limb of it to his service: and therefore, if the Prince will send my tongue upon such an errand, it must not refuse to go, no more than my legs, if they were spoken to. And then,</hi> says <hi>Philautus, as for cursing, blaspheming, &amp;c. God knows my mind well enough as to that: i. e. how I worship him in my heart; and what honour and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I have done to his Church, to himself and the whole Trinity by my</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:48558:146"/>
                  <hi>several writings.</hi> But still, <hi>Philautus,</hi> the Prince is not so absolutely secure of you, but you may give him a bob at last. For you know there is a very strong report in this part of the World, that many years agon there was one, that called himself <hi>the Christ,</hi> that appear'd upon earth: and he taught that it was better to listen to him, than to the commands of Princes; and he said that he came from God, and that he was the true and only Son of God; and, by many things that he said and did, made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral to believe the same. Now, if this be so, <hi>Philautus,</hi> this will be a notable check and rebuff to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Authority of your Prince. And therefore, if you intend to be a Subject quite through, you must needs also renounce Christ: ('tis a small matter, for <hi>Christ,</hi> you know, <hi>is no more God the Son,</hi> than <hi>Moses was God the Father.</hi>) and believe there never was any such person; but that he was a meer Impostor, or a cheat of the Kingdom of darkness—
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48558:146"/>
to that, replies <hi>Philautus; I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, most unlimited and irresistible Sir, that of all things now visible upon ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>No: but above twenty years ago you promised to do them all in several places of your <hi>Leviathan.</hi> And I know you'l be as good as your word; because you desire Mr. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphin</hi> (in your <hi>Ep.

rid of <hi>Christ,</hi> or God the Son: <hi>if,</hi> say you, (<hi>Lev. p.</hi> 27.) <hi>a King, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or other Soveraign person forbid me to believe in Christ</hi> (if he does not hear me) I'll say he talks non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense; <hi>because belief and unbelief are not subject to mens commands.

But if the lawful Prince</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aware of such subtlety) <hi>urges further, that I should say with my tongue I believe not in Christ; I can he too cunning for him there also; for I still do but say so: and therefore rather than I'll displease my lawful Prince</hi> (O Heavens! how do I love and honour my self, and a lawful Prince!) <hi>it shall be done, and ought to be done.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48558:148"/>
words are but motion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Divine that talks of Blasphemy or Heresie coming out of a mans mouth, whose heart is truly firm; he may as well gape for Blasphemy or Heresie at thè spout of a pair of Bellows. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, says <hi>Philautus,</hi> people may prate against my professing with my tongue and so forth; but (to go to the bottom of the business) he that knows but the very first Elements of Government, knows that I have no Tongue at all: for 'tis one of the Princes Tongues that I wear in my mouth: and what's that to me, or any body else what the Prince does with his own tongue? and then, says <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus</hi> again: what wondring is here at my speaking two or three words? is speaking any thing more than a meer gesture of the tongue? and did <hi>Naaman,</hi> I pray (when he was allow'd to go into the House of <hi>Rimmon</hi>) leave his tongue at home? did not his tongue also
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48558:149"/>
bow together with his head? and did it not, as it were, nod and give consent to what his head and shoulders did? and then in the last place, says <hi>Philautus;</hi> as for the several places of <hi>Scripture</hi> which the Ecclesiasticks bring against me: such as those of our Saviour; <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever denyeth me before men, I will deny him before my Father which is in Heaven: and ye shall be brought before Governours and Kings for my sake, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis plain, that they don't at all understand the History of that Gospel, by which they live: for though our Saviour, at the first planting of Christianity, commanded his <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> that they should not be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor give in; but rather suffer any thing, than not stand to the Faith: yet, thanks be to God, says <hi>Philautus,</hi> such advice is now need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: for Christian Religion is very well spread and setled now; and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48558:149"/>
has got great footing in the World; and a man may either profess or renounce it (according as it lies for his hand) with a great deal less danger, and inconvenience than formerly: and therefore if two or three <hi>subjects</hi> in a Kingdom should utterly forsake Christ, there's still enow: and if two or three <hi>Kingdoms</hi> should do the like; there's still more <hi>Kingdoms:</hi> and if (the <hi>Turk</hi> prevailing) <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and the rest of the whole World should also do the same; yet Christ is still Christ: and he has had a fine time of it. And there will be a joyful meeting, and great doings about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at the general resurrection: and I hope to be as merry then, as the best of 'em. There be, continues <hi>Philautus,</hi> I know those who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding neither <hi>Grammar,</hi> nor the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> shall tell you that, let what will come, they'l not part with Christ; no not for a thousand Worlds. They'l dye, yea
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48558:150"/>
and that a thousand Deaths. Dye on, says <hi>Philautus;</hi> for this is meer Vain-glory, and affected <hi>Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> and all for want of a good <hi>Dictionary.</hi> For <hi>Martyr (Lev. p. 272.)</hi> is a Greek word; (which they, poor Creatures! suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be knock'd off the head, and never think of;) and signifies a witness, an eye-witness; and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially such an one as saw Christ be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I see this <hi>Martyrdom</hi> (or <hi>Greek</hi> affliction) won't down with you, <hi>Philautus;</hi> will you, if need be, for Christ's sake <hi>suffer</hi> a little in plain <hi>English?</hi> wee'l engage you shan't be abused, and call'd <hi>Martyr:</hi> nor have any such improper, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fashionable word written upon your Tomb.</p>

               <p>Suppose such a thing should

be, <hi>Philautus:</hi> according to <hi>Christian Politicks,</hi> you'l clearly be a saver by't; when you meet Christ at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> For when he comes to reign here upon Earth, he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, you know, to make very much of those (you may chance to be Chief <hi>Secretary</hi> of State) who are faithful to the end.

            <sp>

               <p>I believe indeed it may; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that childish, ridiculous, gross, prophane manner that you describe.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48558:152"/>
and besotted, as to turn Providence out of the World, to prevent tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and uproars; and to think to complement his <hi>Prince,</hi> by offering such saucy and witless affronts to God himself? I'll undertake, <hi>Philautus,</hi> give but a very small-wit sufficient impudence, prophaneness, and a Glass of Wine, he shall abuse the Scriptures, scoff at Heaven, and talk better and more reasonable <hi>Atheism ex tempore,</hi> than you have labour'd into all your grave Periods.</p>

               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Hey day! how huffing and swaggering is this <hi>Tim,</hi> because he has got a few of those same <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> on his side? who are for a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Common-wealth;</hi> not minding what I learn them (<hi>Lev. p.</hi> 317.) that <hi>there are no men on earth whose bodies are spiritual; and therefore there can be no spiritual Common-wealth amongst men that are yet in the flesh.</hi> I say, <hi>Tim,</hi> some such as these, that talk of a <hi>spiritual-body-politick</hi> you may have on your side; but I am sure all the great Wits, and the men of

depth, and business go all my way.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>And my <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> is your way too.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Yes very likely: for, says he, in his <hi>Essays, it is true, that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Philosophy inclineth mans mind to Atheism, but depth in Philosophy bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mens minds about to Religion.</hi>

               <p>This now is very scurrilous, and most uncharitably said: and if the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> were now alive—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>What should he do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>He should testifie, <hi>Tim,</hi> to the confusion of all my slanderers, (<hi>Ep. Ded.</hi> to his Majesty) how god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily I behav'd my self, when I was ready to dye: and what a sound and clear <hi>Conscience</hi> I had.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conscience?</hi> that's good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! <hi>Conscience,</hi> you know, is only when one looks over your shoulder, or in at the Key-hole. For, you remember, there must be two at
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48558:153"/>
least, to make up a true <hi>Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conscience;</hi> (because of <hi>cum</hi> and <hi>scio:</hi>) and as for any other <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (Lev. p.</hi> 31.) i. e. <hi>knowledge of ones own secret facts or thoughts, that's only a Metaphorical or Rhetorical Conscience.</hi> But I pray, <hi>Philautus,</hi> after what manner did you confess to the <hi>Bishop?</hi> did you confess with your tongue, or how?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>With my tongue? what, <hi>Tim,</hi> wouldst thou have men confess with their Legs, or Shoulders?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, <hi>Philautus,</hi> you are such a moveable, slippery, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical kind of Christian, that I think the <hi>Church</hi> ought to appoint a peculiar sort of confession for you. For if, after you were recovered, you had but met with any body that had a little scar'd you, you should have unconfessed all again; and have sworn, and curs'd, that you did but droll with the <hi>Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Under favour, <hi>Tim,</hi> that's a lye. For I only say that if my <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul Prince</hi> or the <hi>supreme Magistrate</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:48558:153"/>
require any such thing, for Peace sake, and to preserve my life I am bound to obey.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>And I say, that if the <hi>lawsul Ostler,</hi> or <hi>supream Magistrate</hi> of the <hi>Stables,</hi> should take you into his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and shew you but a <hi>switch</hi> (for that may Gangrene) I understand the Principles of your fidelity, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian courage so well, that, were he so wicked as to demand it, you should not only renounce all belief in Christ, but all allegiance to your <hi>lawsul Prince</hi> too: for a breathing time, you know, is very desireable, and whilst he has you in his power, he's to you as good a <hi>Lieutenant of God,</hi> as any Prince upon earth. And <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian (Lev. p.</hi> 271.) shall do for all; for the <hi>Ostler,</hi> as well as for the <hi>Prince</hi> himself.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>For my part, <hi>Tim,</hi> I can't see (when compelled) why I may not allow my self as much liberty, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> did to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>But how are you sure, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus,</hi> that the <hi>Prophet</hi> allow'd him
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48558:154"/>
any at all? for there be some, and those learned too, who question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>go in peace</hi> signifie <hi>Naaman</hi>'s waiting still upon his <hi>Master, &amp;c.</hi> or whether he should forthwith leave his service. But suppose it does; do you think, <hi>Philautus,</hi> that what <hi>Naaman</hi> did (which may several ways be imagin'd to be far enough from <hi>Idolatry</hi>) will countervail, or void all those several plain places of Scripture, that are most absolutely against your whimsycal, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane opinion? but <hi>Philautus</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity is like the Gentlemans, who (a little before he was to suffer for <hi>padding</hi>) being ask'd by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour how he came to follow that employment: told him, that he took it up from Gods advising the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> to spoil the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> which to him, he said, was a plain place for <hi>robbing</hi> at any time, and any where: whereas thou shalt not steal, and the like, were all <hi>typical</hi> and <hi>metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;</hi> and only true upon some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. But 'tis wonderfully strange
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48558:154"/>
to me that his <hi>Majesty</hi> should suffer it—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Suffer what, suffer me—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir: suffer his spightful, ambitious Priests to preach in his Chappel against you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>So 'tis, <hi>Tim:</hi> and I make bold to tell his <hi>Majesty</hi> to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, in an <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>And you did very well so to do, Sir: for <hi>Naaman</hi> will do against the whole <hi>Bible;</hi> and a line or two out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> (nothing to the purpose) against all the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> And seeing you are so firmly fixt in the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and are so condescending and dutiful to all lawful Princes, certainly they ought to be very careful to check and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the adversaries of such a dear and devout Subject. And therefore let's see if we can't find never ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Complement</hi> for the Prince. If I ben't mistaken (<hi>Lev. p.</hi> 205.) there is a pretty obliging one: <hi>viz.</hi> that if the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> please, he may
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48558:155"/>
take away the word of God (for we have had it e'en long enough) and instead thereof, give us <hi>Gusman,</hi> your <hi>Leviathan,</hi> or whatever else he thinks most convenient for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. For in the first place 'tis plain say you, that the <hi>Book</hi> which is now called the <hi>word of God</hi> is not really and grammatically the word of God: <hi>i. e.</hi> 'tis neither the <hi>Noun</hi> of God, nor the <hi>Verb</hi> of God, nor any other <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Speech</hi> of God. But, be it what it will, it obliges no further than the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> pleaseth: who by making it law, made it first to oblige; and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing that Law can make it not to oblige. The <hi>Old Testament</hi> indeed was a <hi>Law,</hi> but to the <hi>Jews</hi> only, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us. The <hi>New Testament</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a <hi>Law</hi> to any body at all, till 'twas made so by <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.</hi> For Christ was no Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver: neither (if he had made any Laws) had he any <hi>Kingdom</hi> to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in: neither did he by his civil Authority <hi>command</hi> any thing; but
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48558:155"/>
only <hi>advis'd</hi> and <hi>counsel'd, &amp;c.</hi> and sent out the <hi>Apostles</hi> to do the like; who were <hi>to fish and allure;</hi> (Lev. p. 270.) <hi>not like</hi> Nimrods <hi>by coerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and punishing to hunt men into Christianity.</hi>

               <p>Don't you remember, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus,</hi> what a huffing challenge you once sent to a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Divinity:</hi> how that <hi>you</hi> and your <hi>Leviathan</hi> should preach with <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> and that without any such <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious foolery</hi> as <hi>ordination;</hi> only the <hi>Soveraign</hi> should lend you one of his <hi>Life-guard</hi> to see you into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and to bang those that would not believe you. <hi>If,</hi> say you (as I take it 'tis in your <hi>Stigmai) the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power give me command (though without the ceremony of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands) to teach the doctrine of my Leviathan in the Pulpit, why</hi>

                  <hi>am not I, if my doctrine and life be as good as yours, a Minister as well as you.</hi> Right; why are you not? for 'tis plain that you have the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>command,</hi> as well as the <hi>Doctor;</hi> and a <hi>Minister</hi> has nothing more. And as for <hi>Authority,</hi> you are well enough with him; for if he swaggers, and produces the <hi>Bishops</hi> Orders; then can you bid your <hi>Life-guard</hi> man swagger too, and cock his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols: and then as to the <hi>Book</hi> that is preach'd out of, there's no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all between you. For you preaching out of your <hi>Leviathan</hi> preach out of a <hi>Bible,</hi> as well as he. For a <hi>Bible</hi> (in Greek) is only a <hi>Book:</hi> and most certainly your <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> is a <hi>Book:</hi> and a most rare one too. But I pray, <hi>Philautus,</hi> how came it into your mind that the <hi>word of God</hi> does not oblige as much, (if not a little more) than the <hi>word</hi> of a <hi>Prince?</hi> I must confess indeed that in the beginning of the <hi>36th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your <hi>Leviathan,</hi> you have a very notable observation concerning
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48558:157"/>
the word of God (as was just now hinted) which, I don't remember, I ever met with in any <hi>Author:</hi> but I don't see, but that it may oblige for all that, without the supream <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi>'s drawing his sword. <hi>When there is mention,</hi> say you, <hi>of the word of God, it doth not signifie a part of speech such as Grammarians call a Noun or a Verb, or any simple voice, without a contexture of other words to make it significative; but a perfect speech or discourse, whereby the speaker affirmeth, denieth, commandeth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, wisheth, or interrogateth:</hi> (I profess <hi>Philautus</hi> would have been a thundering Preacher: how he pours it out! affirmeth, denieth, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>&amp;c.) in which sense 'tis not vocabulum, that signifies a word</hi> (I pray, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> remember that, and turn down a proof;) <hi>'tis not voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum but sermo (in Greek</hi>

first <hi>holding forth.</hi> 'Tis a most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable introduction to a body of Divinity. But to proceed, <hi>Philau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> suppose the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (as you have most painfully and learnedly made it out) is neither <hi>Noun, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun, Verb, Participle,</hi> nor any of the rest, but only the <hi>speech</hi> or <hi>discourse</hi> of God: I pray do so much as let me know (I desire it once more) some of your best reasons why this same speech, or discourse of God (seeing you'l so have it) does not oblige us to believe it and practise it, unless it be authoriz'd by <hi>Kettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drums,</hi> and <hi>Trumpets.</hi>

               <p>I am such a fool, <hi>Philautus,</hi> that methinks I had much rather mind, and observe what our <hi>Saviour</hi> said, than any thing that can be commanded by the <hi>General</hi> of an <hi>Army.</hi>

               <p>You may mind and observe what you will; but (take that from me) you'l have little thanks for your labour. For it does not at all oblige, (<hi>Lev. p.</hi> 284, 285.) as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by him.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Canonical?</hi> did not Christ and they that followed him give Articles of Faith, and <hi>rules</hi> of an holy life?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: but neither he nor any of his Successours did ever lay down one <hi>obligatory Canon.</hi> For such a <hi>Canon</hi> is a Rule authoriz'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd by the Common-wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that only is truly said to be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical,</hi> which is allow'd of, and made <hi>Canonical</hi> by the <hi>Soveraign:</hi> that is to say which is made Law in

               <p>Really, <hi>Philautus,</hi> if you don't leave that trick, I'll get a new man to talk withal.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>What trick?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>You can't come near the word <hi>Law,</hi> but presently you spring forth—<hi>for a Law is the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that man or assembly, &amp;c.</hi> and when 'tis every whit to as little purpose, as 'tis here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>To as little purpose? by the definition alone of a Law, namely, <hi>that a Law is the commandment of that man, or</hi>—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>What, shall we have it again?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I say, by that definition of a Law it is very evident that not any one Rule or precept in the whole <hi>New-Testament</hi> was an <hi>obligatory Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: i. e.</hi> did really oblige any man living till the <hi>New-Testament</hi> was made <hi>Law.</hi> And I am sure it never was made <hi>Law</hi> till—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Till when? till 'twas made
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48558:159"/>
Law. That's all that <hi>Philautus</hi> will engage for: for he's a very wary Gamester, and he's as sure as can be that the Gospel was never publickly owned, nor appointed by any Prince to be read in any Kingdom or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; till that very day, hour, and minute that it was so own'd, and appointed, <hi>&amp;c. Philautus,</hi> I say, is very sure of this; and thus much he will certainly undertake for, and no more.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis false: for I undertake further to shew, that whatever our Saviour propounded to be done in order to Salvation (till obedience thereunto was commanded by the Soveraign-Ruler) was so far from obliging, that every man, <hi>without the least injustice,</hi> might refuse to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve—</p>

what I should have said: don't I know when to break of, and when to go on?</p>

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, Sir, I think that in all right the definition of injustice ought to have come in there: for then the business had been plainly demonstrated.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis plainly demonstrable, <hi>Tim,</hi> that any man might refuse to obey whatever our Saviour said (till 'twas made Law) without being <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just</hi> at all.</p>

to him are only <hi>twelve Legions</hi> of <hi>Phantasms;</hi> all to be discomfited with the brandishing of Horn-knifes, and the blast of Elder-Guns?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

               <p>I bless God, that I believe Christ to be his Son; and that I am more oblig'd to observe his Precepts (without your indulgent favouring them to be termed Laws) than the most immediate and direct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of all the Princes in the World: and he that believes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I suppose, is the man that justly deserves the title of <hi>prophane.</hi>

               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>You may believe what you will, <hi>Tim:</hi> but 'tis plain that Christ never took upon himself the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>And I pray, <hi>Philautus,</hi> what do you think might be the reason of it? don't you think it was for fear people should not only believe his doctrine, but count themselves oblig'd to practise it? was not that, <hi>Philautus,</hi> think you the business? was it not to prevent some such great absurdity and inconvenience that might have happen'd in the World? whereas now every one enjoys a most reasonable and blessed Liberty: and if the Gospel stands with a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, and be the <hi>fashionable Book</hi> at <hi>Court,</hi> it may then be read and practis'd not without some delight, and benefit: but when it either crosses my own particular interest, or the irresistible humour of my most <hi>dreadful Prince,</hi> thanks be to God, there be other judicious and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authors, in which a retired and studious Gentleman may make shift to spend his time, without any ways
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48558:163"/>
disobliging <hi>Gods second representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Jesus Christ.</hi> This, <hi>Philautus,</hi> is such a kind of devout meditation as, I suppose, you take bed-ward. And from hence any one, that is not utterly blind, may plainly perceive, what it is that you count <hi>obligation:</hi> that is, when a man is so chain'd, rop'd or chorded down to his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that he can't possibly avoid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to't; such a man and none else will you allow to be truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd. Neither must he be fasten'd with such Chains and Chords as the joys and terrors of another life; for they are at a great distance, and with <hi>Philautus,</hi> very metaphorical: but he is for visible Grammatical Hemp, and Iron, such as grow upon, and is digged out of the Earth. Where these things be, there's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, law, justice, and obligation; but where they are missing, a man is as free as any fish in the Ocean. Thus if a man, suppose, has an hundred pound weight of shackles about him, and be under good store of locks; I
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48558:164"/>
believe <hi>Philautus</hi> will grant such an one to be very properly and strictly oblig'd not to ride an Hunting: and if a man has half a dozen Pikes tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him at the tail, 'tis likely that he also may be look'd upon a sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to march on: but if I pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately without either witness or writings borrow a hundred pounds of a friend—</p>

               <p>I am sure that the Gospel would find but very little entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were it not for the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Justice.</hi>

               <p>Why what, I pray, does the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> towards the making the Gospel oblige? does the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> thrust down the <hi>Gospel</hi> into his Subjects bellies, with his <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Justice?</hi> if he did, 'twould do them but very little good. For 'tis plain, <hi>Philautus,</hi> to any one that knows
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48558:169"/>
what belongs to Religion; that this same <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> which is to make the <hi>Scriptures Canonical</hi> has so very little of any <hi>obliging</hi> vertue in it, that he that does not count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self oblig'd to obey the Precepts of Christ, only because Christ gave them (<hi>i. e.</hi> without your <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi>) is as far from salvation, as one that never heard of Christ at all.</p>

               <p>I suppose you don't imagine, <hi>Tim,</hi> the command of a <hi>lawful Prince</hi> to blast the obligation of the Gospel.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>No: but, I suppose, he that obeys the <hi>Gospel</hi> only out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance to his Prince, will obey any <hi>other Book</hi> out of the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>omplaisance; having no other God, nor Religion, but Power and the Sword.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a very strange thing to me that the commands of Princes should have such little vertue in them; whereas the chief thing that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48558:169"/>
our Saviour order'd his Disciples to Preach, was obedience to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Children to obey their Parents in all things;</hi> and <hi>servants in all things to obey their Masters:</hi> now, if it was Christs mind that such little Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, as Fathers and Masters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, should be obey'd in all things; what shall we say to <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>What shall we say? we must say that they must be obey'd in more than all things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>In more than all things? that's non-sense, <hi>Tim,</hi> and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But it was certainly our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours intention that they should be obey'd as far as was possible, <hi>i. e.</hi> in all things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt, Sir: and therefore when our Saviour Preach'd up obedience to <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and said that he came not to <hi>destroy</hi> but <hi>fullfil the Law,</hi> his meaning certainly, <hi>Philautus,</hi> must be this: <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48558:170"/>
I, who am the true Son of God, am come into the World to give Salvation, and the true means lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto; which are meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, sobriety, fidelity, charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet, not to deceive you, you are to know that at present, I am only in a private capacity; and this is no command, but only my private opinion, judgment and advice: and therefore if the supream Magistrate calls upon you to cheat, lye, swear, whore, sink, damn; and to despise and renounce me and my doctrine; never boggle or stand to consider of it; but do't, do't: mind not at all what I said: for I call'd in now, only by the by: and this is a time only of friendly counsel and invitation. My time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding is not as yet come. But I shall have a time of it afterwards; and that a very great one, when I come to be seated at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and then I shall have great strength and a long Retinue: but in the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48558:170"/>
mean while—<hi>obey in all things,</hi> whatever I say to the contrary.</q> This is the very truth and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, <hi>Philautus,</hi> of all your <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I am sure of this, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ nor his Apostles did any thing more than counsel and invite; never did he, or they impose, or command.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>That is, when Christ sent out his Disciples to preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, he did not bid them fire a Musket at every sentence: and when St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians to stand fast in the Faith;</hi> he did not bid them do't, in the <hi>Kings name.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>No; for according to you, they only went up and down the World <hi>crying</hi> the <hi>Gospel:</hi> for a Preacher (as you observe) in Latin is <hi>Praeco;</hi> that is, a <hi>Cryer</hi> or <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation-maker</hi> and as the <hi>Prophet Esay</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:48558:171"/>
(<hi>Lev. p.</hi> 286.) invites and calls: <hi>ho, every man that thirsteth, &amp;c.</hi> so they that were sent out to preach the Gospel did nothing more, but knock at mens doors, and cryed ho, will you have any Gospel within? or else got upon a stool in the Market, and made Proclamation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there; which, according to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus, (without any sin)</hi> need not be any more minded than the singing of a Ballad: for Christ has no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as yet; and where no Kingdom, there's no command, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no obligation. That a <hi>Philosopher</hi> and <hi>Poet</hi> should write this for sense or wit; or that any body else should take it for such in the reading! for, as for Religion, that's not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>

               <p>I am sure I have had many a serious thought about Religion: and have been very careful to keep a Conscience void of offence towards <hi>God,</hi> and towards my <hi>lawful Prince:</hi> for my lawful Prince is to be minded.</p>

               <p>Yes, Sir, your Prince must be minded: and truly you have complemented up a fine one. But let me tell you he's not absolute and perfect, till you have remov'd one <hi>objection.</hi>
