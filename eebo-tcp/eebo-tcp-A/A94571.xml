            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>HUMBLIE SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat ſeeing nothing is more manifeſt then that God is pleaſed often times to raiſe up the weakeſt means to work the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt effects, and inaſmuch as the holy Prophet <hi>David</hi> himſelfe was prevented, by the timely addreſſes of weak woman, from a moſt reſolved purpoſe of ſhedding of Blood: Although we have heard, to our no ſmall grief, that no word of comfort hath been drawn from you by all the many Petitions preſented unto you, in behalf of Mr. <hi>Lilburn,</hi> yea our hearts melting in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe towards ſo great and cauſeleſſe a ſufferer, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being aſtoniſhed with feare of the heavieſt wrath of God, if your new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhould lay its foundation in his innocent blood, whoſe life hath eſcaped, and innocency been manifeſted in the worſt of times, we could not forbeare to make this our humble application unto you, beſeeching you to conſider. Whether the ſparing of blood be not more ſuitable to the work before you, It being denyed unto <hi>David,</hi> becauſe his hands had been dipt in blood, to build a Temple for the Lord: and we humbly offer it unto you, Whether the ready proneneſſe to the ſpilling of blood in the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament all along, although the Cauſe were iuſt, being ſeldome without ſome hardneſſe of heart, too often with delight, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times with revenge, were not the maine cauſe that God forſook them, and gave them up to ſtrong deluſions, placeing their ſecurity in worldly policy and outward ſtrength, and upon confidence thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doing all kind of injuſtice, even as they did to Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> in their barbarous proceedings towards him, rather then in the wayes of Chriſt, who came not to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> but <hi>ſave</hi> mens lives, neither did it profit them at all either with God or man. Then their <hi>Voice was Iacobs,</hi> their tongues and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions filled ever with <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> or their frequent ſeeking of God, and holding daies of Prayer, whilſt <hi>their hands were the hands of Eſau,</hi> &amp; their feet were ſwift to ſhed blood, whilſt their ears were deaf to Petitioners and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, the Widdow and the Fatherleſs were neglected by them, making no conſcience of trampling all the known ancient Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Nation under their feet, and putting their Wills into Lawes, as the Act for baniſhing Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Lilburn,</hi> in a higher meaſure then all the tyrants that ever were before them, and for which they are now caſt out as <hi>unſavory Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that you have to ſay, as yet, for your ſelves, is, <hi>That they were broken oſſ, that you might be grafted in Well: becauſe of walking in the wayes of unbelief (ſuch are worldly policies) they were broken off: and you ſtand by faith and a good conſcience both towards God and Man: Be not high minded, but fear. For if God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not you: Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God: on them that fell, ſeverity: but towards you goodneſs, if you continue in his goodneſs, otherwiſe you alſo ſhall be cut off: For he is yeſterday, today, and the ſame for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Al which we crave leave to alude unto in your caſe, that, if it be poſſible, we may prevaile with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you to propoſe unto your ſelves to be unlike unto them in al things, not to walk in any way of their evil wayes, as in pride, in keeping at diſtance with other People, or in Apparel, Diet, houſing, and Fantaſtique Faſhions, complements, couches and congees, Cloathing in Scarlet, and Faring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly every day, or in covetouſneſſe, advancing their eſtates, Families, and Relations, upon the ruins of the People, taxing them without meaſure, laying alſo of heavy burdens upon them, whilſt <hi>Phariſee-like,</hi> they felt not the weight with one of their fingars: ſcorned <hi>information,</hi> and deſpiſed <hi>Petitions:</hi> yea, were come to that height, that none durſt epproach <hi>their</hi> doore with any word concerning the <hi>Liberoies of the Nation.</hi> Theſe things manifeſtly abounded <hi>in</hi> them; but, oſ any <hi>thing,</hi> we, beſeech you to watch over your ſelves againſt the ſpilling of Blood, eſpecially of the <hi>blood</hi> of the Innocent, which cryeth <hi>aloud</hi> for vengeance in the eares of God.</p>
            <p>
