            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> most properly imparted by the weekly <hi>Mercury;</hi> matters of higher consequence, and more neere concernment, deserve a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by themselves. And such is that we now have in hand of the QUEENES Majesties returne after so long <unclear>absence</unclear>, after so tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a <hi>divorce</hi> from her dearest LORD, a whole yeares <hi>banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> at least from Her sweetest Children, the common pledges of their loves. To this wee shall adjoyne a <hi>Briefe Relation</hi> of the repulse the <hi>Rebels</hi> had, the last weeke, at <hi>Newarke:</hi> partly because the story of so great a <hi>Princesse</hi> ought not to come into the world without some <hi>Attendant;</hi> partly because it was the most remarkable successe which befell His Majesty after Her arrivall: and finally, because the King received intelligence of both at the same time, and from the hands of the same Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger.</p>
            <p>First for the QUEENE, it cannot be unknowne to any upon what termes Shee tooke the oportunity to go for <hi>Holland,</hi> that She might see Her dearest daughter delivered safely to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63263:3"/>
hands of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange:</hi> her Majesties affaires here at that time being in such condition, that shee could neither stay with safety, nor yet be absent without danger. For who can possibly forget in so short a space, the seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string of her neerest servants, the <hi>Articles</hi> intended to be framed against her, the flight she was compelled to make (nothing the more secure because His Majesty did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the same fortune with her) from <hi>Whitehall</hi> unto <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton-Court,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Windsor.</hi> Nor need it be related what good offices shee did His Majesty during the time shee spent in those forraine parts, in furnishing him from time to time with <hi>Money, Armes</hi> and <hi>Ammunition:</hi> and that too from a State no great friend to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and where so strong a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had beene made against her, by the power and practice of those men, by whom His Majesties affaires had beene reduced to so great extremities. It is enough to say, that never King had a better <hi>Agent;</hi> and that as wee already do enjoy the benefit thereof, so shall posterity enjoy the story. Being wearied at the last with so long an exile, and finding that His Majesties affaires were in such prosperity, that she might venture safely upon his protection; she was resolved to come for <hi>England,</hi> and did accordingly put forth to sea on the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> last being well guarded and attended: the wind so favourable that there was little doubt of Her speedie landing, and thereupon a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger dispatched to the Court at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to give His Majesty notice of it. But the wind comming suddainely about, and the seas working very high, She was inforced at last to make sayle for <hi>Holland,</hi> after She had continued on the seas eight daies, and with a most invincible courage contended so long for the mastery with that furious Element.</p>
            <p>The newes of this being brought to <hi>London,</hi> and a report<note place="margin">In a Pamphlet called, <hi>Certaine informations. Num: 3.</hi>
               </note> withall, how many <hi>Souldiers and Commanders,</hi> what store <hi>of money, gunpowder, Armes, and horses,</hi> She had intended to bring with Her: occasioned great joy there for the ill successe which had befallen Her at the present; and put Her enemies (who have too great an influence on the two Houses of Parliament)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63263:3"/>
on some quick debates, how to prevent Her landing for the time to come; and if that might not be prevented, then how they should proceed against Her when they had Her here. Foure ships which had beene formerly appointed by the said two Houses, to lie before the haven of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> were ordered not to <hi>suffer Her to passe the barre at Tinmouth, unlesse She left</hi>

               <hi>Her Ordinance and ships behind Her.</hi> Upon occasion of a letter to the House of Commons from the Mayor of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> to know what entertainment he should give Her Majesty if She landed there, (such a report of Her intentions being brought unto him) Master <hi>Martin</hi> learnedly declaimes against that title, would not by any meanes allow that stile of MAJESTIE to belong unto Her, no not so much as in the right of participation with Her Royall Husband (a right which every married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this Kingdome doth lay claime unto) affirming with an impudent confidence (like that of <hi>Bessus</hi> in the play) that she was no other then their <hi>fellow Subject.</hi> This presently drew on a new debate (though not like that amongst the <hi>Brethren of the sword,</hi> in jest,) how they should handle Her amongst them, when she came again, some moved that a strict <hi>inquisition</hi> should be made into all Her Actions, during the time she staid in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and that according thereunto an <hi>impeachment</hi> should be drawne against Her for those ill offices which She had done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Kingdome, that is to say unto themselves. Others of a more cunning malice, and more wit to hide it, would not have it so, this being, as they said, no time to stirre that controversie. Better some course were taken to prevent Her comming, and that the ships they had at sea should have charge to hinder it, if She attempted to set foote upon English-ground. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this course was followed. And when intelligence was brought that two of Her ships laden with <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> were landed safely at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> under the conduct and command of <hi>Van-Trump,</hi> Admirall for the <hi>States Generall</hi> of the united provinces; it was ordered by the <hi>Close Committee</hi> that if the <hi>Queene</hi> or any of Her ships came againe that way, they should either keepe them from the land, or give fire upon

For being brought upon a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond setting out, within sight of <hi>England,</hi> with such a calme and gentle gale, as if both Sea and Windes repented of their former rudenesse; the Winde that studied her convenience, brought her being then within few leagues of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> (where she intended to have landed) to the Bay of <hi>Burlington:</hi> by meanes whereof her landing was more safe then it had beene otherwise, her passage shorter unto <hi>Yorke,</hi> where she meant to stay untill His Majestie should give order for Her removall; and the Kings forces nearer at hand to conduct her thither. Two dayes she lay at Anchor there e're she came on shore, dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence a Messenger to the Earle of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> to give him notice of her comming; that She might be attended on by His Majesties Army, for the security of Her Person when She came to land: Which, as it did one way advance Her safety, so did it in another keepe Her within reach of danger. For the foure ships which lay before the Barre at <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> not farre from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> either discerning the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet when they were at Sea, or being advertised from the place where she rode at Anchor, of Her landing there, made all the haste they could to fall on upon Her before the comming of the Kings Army. And though they came not soone enough to hinder her from land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as 'twas hoped they might; they did their best to <hi>kill Her in Her bed,</hi> as she was asleepe, and make the Land more cruell to Her, then the Seas had beene: Which being an attempt so barbarous, as would not easily finde beliefe from a

               <p>ASsoone as we came into <hi>England,</hi> the Queene dispatched <hi>Progers</hi> to you; but being this day informed that he was taken by the Enemy, She hath againe dispatched this Bearer to render You an accompt of Her arrivall, the which hath beene (thankes be to God) very happy. For as rough as the Sea was the first time we passed, at this time we came with a gentle gale, untill we were within 15 leagues of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> where upon that coast the winde began to change to <hi>North-west,</hi> which forced us to make for <hi>Burlington Bay;</hi> where after two dayes riding at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, the <hi>Cavalrie</hi> arrived; which perceiving, the Queene sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly landed, and the next morning the rest of the Army came to wait on Her. God, that was carefull to preserve.

But about an houre after the foure ships began to ply us so fast with their <hi>Ordinance;</hi> that it made us all to rise out of our beds with diligence, and leave the Village, at least the women; for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers staid very resolutely to defend the <hi>Ammunition,</hi> in case their farces should land. One of the Ships did Her the favour to flanck upon the house where the Queene lay, which was just before the Peere; and before She was out of Her bed, the <hi>Cannon bullets</hi> whistled so loud about Her, (which Musicke you may easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was not very pleasing to Her) that all the company pressed Her earnestly to goe out of the house, their <hi>Cannon</hi> having totally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63263:5"/>
beaten downe all the neighbouring houses, and two <hi>Cannon bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi> falling from the top to the bottome of the house where She was; so that (clothed as She could) She went on foot some little distance out of the Towne, under the shelter of a <hi>Ditch</hi> (like that of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market;</hi>) whither before She could get, the <hi>Cannon bullets</hi> fell thicke about us, and a <hi>Sergeant</hi> was <hi>killed</hi> within twenty paces of Her. We in the end gained the <hi>Ditch,</hi> and staid there two houres, whilest their <hi>Cannon</hi> plaid all the time upon us; the <hi>bullets</hi> flew for the most part over our heads, some few onely grazing on the <hi>Ditch</hi> where the Queene was, covered us with <hi>earth.</hi> At last the Admirall of <hi>Holland</hi> sent to the <hi>Parliament ships</hi> to tell them, that if they would not cease shooting, he would give fire upon them as enemies. (This was done somewhat late, but there is an excuse for it, by reason of a mist, as he saith.) Upon that they staid their shooting, and likewise being ebbing water, they could not stay longer neare the shore. Assoone as they were retired, the Queene returned to the house where She lay, being unwilling to allow them the vanity of saying. They made Her forsake the Towne. We went at noone to <hi>Burlington,</hi> whither we were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to goe before this accident; and all that day in the face of the enemie we dis-imbarqued our <hi>Ammunition.</hi> It is said that one of the Captaines of the <hi>Parliament ships</hi> had beene at the Towne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, to observe where the Queenes lodging was; and I assure you he observed it well, for he ever shot at it. I may truely say that both by Sea and Land the Queene hath beene in some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but God by his especiall grace and favour hath preserved Her: and the Queene saith, She hath great confidence in his goodnesse, that he will not forsake Her Majestie in other things, since in this he hath so protected Her. And She protested, that in that confidence she durst have marched against a <hi>Cannon,</hi> if She had not learned <hi>Thou shalt not tempt.</hi> This Bearer was witnesse of all that passed, yet I would not forbeare to make you this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is very punctuall.</p>

Compare the danger which His Majestie was in at the battell of <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> when the undistinguishing bullets fell so thicke about Him; with this, wherein the <hi>Cannon</hi> bent against the QUEENE, shot through the house in which She was, killed a man that stood so neare, and covered Her with earth even before Her buriall; and reade the Riddle he that can, whose life hath beene more eagerly sought after, either His or Hers; which of the two would fall the more acceptable Sacrifice to these angry Deities. If all things else should faile to <hi>undeceive and disabuse the seduced people</hi> of this Kingdome, who hitherto have beene taught, and perhaps believe, that there is nothing more endeavoured then the preservation of His Majesties Person, and the advancement of His Honour. I doubt not but this barbarous and bloudy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the life of the Queene, (for nothing else was or can possibly be pretended to be aimed at in it) will serve suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to doe it; else we have reason to suspect, that God hath laid that curse upon this Nation, whereof the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh in another sence; <hi>That hearing they shall heare, and shall not understand; that seeing they shall see, and shall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>

                  </note> to welcome and indeare the Messenger, yet found he some thing by the way which might have added (were it possible) to the generall joy which his first Message had occasioned. His way to <hi>Oxford</hi> was by <hi>Newarke,</hi> a place well knowne to those who use to travell the <hi>Northerne Roade,</hi> but at this time more notable for the <hi>Garrison</hi> there placed by the prudent foresight of the Earle of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> Generall of His Majesties forces in the <hi>Northerne parts;</hi> A Town at which the enemies of His Majesties peace have cast full many an envious eye, as being a great barre to their proceedings; and suffered it to sinke so deepe into their fancies and imaginations, that they have often <hi>taken</hi> it in their dreames, and sometimes in their printed <hi>Newes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bookes,</hi> but never durst appeare before it untill Munday last, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February.</hi> But then it pleased the Earle of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne,</hi> the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham,</hi> Colonell <hi>Ballard,</hi> and the other Chiefetaines of the Rebels in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> to thinke upon some course for satisfying the good people of <hi>London, Who had long mused amongst themselves, why being so well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and provided of all things necessary for that service, they had not set upon the Towne,</hi> as one of their <hi>Diurnals</hi> tells us.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63263:6"/>
Which being resolved upon amongst them, and fearing that they might not be able to effect the businesse without more helpe, they sent for Sir <hi>John Gell</hi> from <hi>Darbyshire,</hi> to meet them with his Rabble at the day appointed: if for no other reason (as there was not much) yet that they might be sure of some lucky hand to deface Tombes and Monuments, and to kill dead bodies, whereat <hi>Gell</hi> was excellent.</p>
               <p>Of this designe Colonell <hi>Henderson</hi> the watchfull Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Towne having timely notice, drew forth his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie,</hi> consisting of ten Companies some foure nights before, and went to <hi>Beckingham</hi> (a Towne of <hi>Lincolnshire</hi>) neare the Rebels Quarters: whereof having some intelligence by their Espials, they kept themselves such close and in so good order, that nothing could be done upon them to frustrate or divert the action; so that he made a leisurely and faire retreat to the Towne againe, there to expect their further determination<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Nor was it long before they let him know their resolution, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing on the day before remembred with all their Forces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 6000 and above, and ten Peeces of Ordinance (most of them shooting bullets of six pound a Peece) towards the <hi>Bekon-hill,</hi> a mile from <hi>Newarke:</hi> upon which hill the Governour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no <hi>Ordinance</hi> in the Towne to entertaine them, had placed his <hi>Cavalrie</hi> with the best advantage that he could. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my seeing him so planted, advanced upon him with the whole body of their Army, and still as they came forwards, caused him to retire by the advantage of their Cannon, which he wanted; till at the length by three removes he drew more neare unto his workes, and so at last into the Towne. And this was all that was done that day, the enemy retreating as the night came on, and quartering all their forces in two small Villages, about a mile distant from his trenches.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday morning the last of <hi>February,</hi> they drew up all their forces into one grosse body, and comming as neare unto his workes as they could with safety, sent a Trumpeter, and in the name of the <hi>King and Parliament</hi> (as their manner is) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his surrendrie of the Towne and Castle: Which being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63263:7"/>
answered with a <hi>negative,</hi> and that the Governour was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to keepe the Towne for His Majesties sole use, (with whom the <hi>two Houses of Parliament,</hi> were never thought to be <hi>joynt-tenants</hi> of the Kingdome) they planted their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, dividing their foot into three <hi>Brigades,</hi> tooke in the Earle of <hi>Exeters</hi> house (which was an Hospitall heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on the See of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> but now assured upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie by an Act of Parliament made this Session) discharging <unclear>80</unclear> shot into the Towne from their workes and batteries. At length the <hi>Nottinghamshire</hi> and <hi>Darbyshire</hi> forces, making one <hi>Brigade</hi> of themselves, advanced and tooke a Ditch within Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll shot of the Towne workes, and thence discharged against the Towne from eleven of the clocke at noone, untill six at night; but with more courage then successe: the Souldiers of the Garrison playing their parts exceeding valiantly, and being bravely seconded by the indefatigable paines of all the Officers, who behaved themselves both stoutly and discreetly, as they were directed. In the meane time the other two <hi>Brigades</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed themselves before some other of the workes, and finding them so strong, that there was little possibility of doing any good that way, retired with all their Foot, Horses, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, to <hi>Gells</hi> Post, hoping with their united Powers to force their entrance into the Towne, and obtaine the end of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Which being soone perceived by the wary Governour, he removed all his Forces as they did, which was about three of the clocke in the afternoone; holding them play, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them with an hotter service then they expected from that place, for three houres together. At length, it being then about six at night, discerning an abatement in the courage of the Enemy, who began to wax weary of the worke, he made a sally out upon them with such force and fury, that he drave all their Foot from their Post, or station, unto the shelter and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their <hi>Cavalrie,</hi> impatoned himselfe with three Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordinance, which he caused to be haled into the Towne: the whole body of the Rebels retiring in great disorder and confusion till they got the advantage of an hedge, and so stood
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63263:7"/>
with the <hi>Cavalrie</hi> before them, till darke night came on, and made an end at that time of the disputation.</p>
               <p>In this estate things stood, when the Messenger sent unto His Majestie, (whom before I spake of) came unto the Towne; Who though he staid no longer there then the necessity of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall rest did invite him to: yet staid he long enough to see the Enemies dislodged, and the Lords with their whole traine departed from such unhospitable hosts, who shewed no more civility to men of honour, which was assoone as they had light enough to see how to goe away. But being it was a service of such signall consequence, it was not thought fit to intrust the story and relation of it onely unto the wit and memory of the Messenger, who being no Actor in the businesse might possibly be subject to mistakings: and therefore Colonell <hi>Henderson</hi> the victorious Governour, sent an accompt thereof in writing to His Sacred Majestie, and from thence you have it.</p>
               <p>There were killed of the Kings side in this brave repulse, but one man onely, a common Souldier of the Garrison, and not many hurt. But of the Rebels there were slaine no fewer then 200 men; and many wounded, whereof the chiefe was Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Ballard,</hi> and no meane one neither. There were taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the sally about 60 Prisoners, many of which were found upon examination to be <hi>French Papists;</hi> whom the <hi>two Houses</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> thought it not unfitting to take into their pay, nor dangerous either to the Church or State to trust with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; their nation and religion notwithstanding. By which it seemes that <hi>Forreiners</hi> may be called in, if occasion be, in maintenance of the rights and liberties of the <hi>English</hi> subjects; and <hi>Papists</hi> may be armed for the defence and preservation of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> if the necessities and distresses of the Church require it. If so, then certainly His Majesty may far more warrantably make use of his Popish subjects, who serve him for defence of his prerogative and their owne native liberties, upon the conscience of that duetie and allegiance which they beare unto him; then the two Houses, whatsoever Priviledge they pretend unto, can call in <hi>Forreigne</hi> Nations of the <hi>Popish
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63263:8"/>
profession,</hi> who serve them on no other motive but for pay and pillage. But such is the infirmity of our humane nature, that we do commonly condemne that in others, which we indulge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our selves: and such the guilty courses of seditious persons, that they regard but little, if they do at all, what crooked lanes and passages they are forced upon, so they may come at last to their journeys end. Some <hi>Papists,</hi> but those <hi>English Papists,</hi> had before beene taken prisoners by His Majesty at the famous battaile of <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> which gave His Majesty occasion after their example, to enterteine some few <hi>Recusants</hi> of these His Kingdomes, for the defence and safety of His <hi>Royall Person.</hi> And should he call in <hi>Forreiners</hi> and those <hi>Papists</hi> too, to aid him in defence of His <hi>Royall Power,</hi> he did no more then what he had example for from their owne proceedings, who have affirmed it of themselves that they cannot <hi>erre.</hi>
