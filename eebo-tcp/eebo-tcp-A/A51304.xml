            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I be not ignorant of your Lordships aversness from all addresses of this kinde, (whether it be that your Lordship has taken notice of that usual vanity of those that dedicate Books, in endeavouring to oblige their Patrons by over-lavish praises, such as much exceed the worth of the party they thus unmeasurably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; or whether it be from a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral modesty that cannot bear, no not so much as a just representation of your own vertues and abilities; or lastly, from a most true observation, that there are very few Treatises writ which are any thing more then meer Transcriptions or Collections out of
<pb facs="tcp:55765:3"/>
other Authors, whose Writings have already been consecrated to the Name and Memory of some other worthy Persons long since deceased; so that they doe but after a manner rob the dead, to furnish themselves with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to offer to the living) Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this averseness of your Lordship, or whatever grounds there may be surmised thereof, I could not abstain from making this present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication. Not so much I confess to gratify your Lordship (though it be none of the best Complements) as for mine own satisfaction and content. For I doe not take so great pleasure in any thing as in the sense and conscience of the fitness &amp; sutableness of mine own actions; amongst which I can finde none more exactly just &amp; befitting then this; there being many considerations that give you a peculiar right and title to the Patronage of this present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. For besides your Lordships
<pb facs="tcp:55765:3"/>
skill in Philosophy &amp; real sense of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, two such endowments as are rarely to be found together (especially in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of high quality) and yet without which matters of this nature can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be read with any relish nor easily understood; there are also other things still more peculiar, &amp; which naturally doe direct and determine me to the choice I have made. For whether I consider the many civilities from your self &amp; nearest Relations, especially from your noble &amp; vertuous Lady, whom I can never think on but with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor mention without the highest respect: or whether I recollect with my self the first occasion of busying my thoughts upon this Subject, which was then when I had the honour and pleasure of reading <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions with your Lordship in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Luxenburg</hi> to pass away the time, (In which Treatise though there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is handsome and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:55765:4"/>
yet all did not seem so perfectly solid and satisfactory to me but that I was forced in some principal things to seek satisfaction from my self:) or lastly, call to minde that pleasant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement I enjoyed at <hi>Ragley</hi> during my abode with your Lordship; my civil treatment there, from that perfect and unexceptionable pattern of a truly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; Christian Matron, the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable your Mother; the solemness of the Place, those shady Walks, those Hills &amp; Woods, wherein often having lost the sight of the rest of the World, and the World of me, I found out in that hidden solitude the choicest The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories in the following Discourse: I say, whether I considered all these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, or any of them, I could not but judge them more then enough to determine my choice to so worthy a Patron.</p>
            <p>Nor could the above-mentioned surmises beat me from my design, as
<pb facs="tcp:55765:4"/>
not at all reaching the present case. For as for my part, I am so great a Lover of the Truth, and so small an Admirer of vulgar Eloquence, that neither the presage of any gross Advantage could ever make me stoop so low as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my self to the vile infamy or suspicion of turning Flatterer, nor yet the tickling sense of applause &amp; vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, to affect the puffy name &amp; title of an Orator. So that your Lord<hi rend="sup">p</hi> might be secure as touching the first surmise.</p>
            <p>And verily for the second, though I confess I might not be at all averse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> making a just &amp; true representation of your Lordships Vertues and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments, yet considering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of them, &amp; the meanness of mine own Rhetorick, I found it not so much as within my power, if I would, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon your Lordships modesty; and therefore I must leave it to some more able Pen to do you &amp; the World that right whether you will or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55765:5"/>
And lastly, for that scruple concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the theft or petty sacriledge of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> who, as it were, rob the Monuments of the dead to adorn the living; it is the onely thing that I can without vanity profess, that what I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to your L<hi rend="sup">p</hi> is properly my own, that is to say, that the invention, application and management of the Reasons and Arguments comprised in this Book, whether for confutation or confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the genuine result of my own anxióus and thoughtful mind, no old stuff purloined or borrowed from other Writers. What truth &amp; solidity there is in my Principles and Reasonings were too great a piece of arrogance for me to predetermine. This must be left to the judgements of such free &amp; discerning spirits as your Lordship: With whom if what I have writ may find acceptance or a favourable censure, it will be the greater obligation &amp; encouragement to,</p>

            <head>The Contents of the Preface.</head>
            <p>1. The Title of the Discourse how it is to be understood. 2. The Authors submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his whole Treatise to the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule of Sacred Writ. 3. A plain and compendious Demonstration that Matter consists of parts <hi>indiscerpible.</hi> 4. An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to an Objection touching his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration against the Suns superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency over the affairs of the Earth. 5. A confirmation of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Opinion, that Perception is really one with Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Motion and Reaction, if there be nothing but <hi>Matter</hi> in the World. 6. An Apologie for the Vehicles of <hi>Daemons</hi> and Souls separate. 7. As also for his so punctually describing the state of the other life, and so curiously defining the nature of a particular Spirit. 8. That his <hi>Elysiums</hi> he describes are not at all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, but Divine. 9. That he has not made the state of the wicked too easy for them in the other world. 10. That it is not one Universal Soule that hears, sees and reasons in every man, demonstrated from the Acts of Memory. 11. Of the <hi>Spirit of Nature;</hi> that it is no obscure Principle, nor unseasonably introduced. 12. That
<pb facs="tcp:55765:6"/>
he has absolutely demonstrated the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence thereof. 13. That the admission of that Principle need be no hinderance to the progress of <hi>Mechanick</hi> Philosophy. 14. The great pleasure of that study to pious and rational persons. 15. Of what concernment it would be if <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> were generally read in all the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Christendome. 16. An excuse of the prolixity of his Preface from his earnest desire of gratifying the publick, without the least offence to any rational or ingenuous Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THat the present Treatise may pass more freely and smoothly through the hands of men, without any offence or scruple to the good and pious, or any real exception or probable cavil from those whose Pretensions are greater to Reason then Religion, I shall endeavour in this Preface to prevent them, by bringing here into view, and more fully explaining and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whatever I conceive obnoxious to their mistakes and obloquies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>And indeed I cannot be well assured but that the very Title of my Discourse may seem liable to both their dislikes. To the dislike of the one, as being confident of the contrary conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and therefore secure That that cannot be demonstrated to be true, which they have long
<pb facs="tcp:55765:6"/>
since judged not worthy to be reckoned in the rank of things probable; it may be not so much as of things possible. To the dislike of the other, as being already perswaded of the truth of our conclusion upon other and better grounds: which would not be better, if the natural light of Reason could afford Demonstration in this matter. And therefore they may haply pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that so ambitious a Title seems to justle with the high Prerogative of Christianity, which has</hi> brought life and immortality to light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But of the former I demand, by what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty they are made so secure of their being wholly mortal. For unless they will ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously conceit themselves inspired, when as they almost as little believe there is either God or Spirit, as that they have in them an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soule, they must either pretend to the</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Sense, <hi>or the</hi> clearness of Reason. <hi>The former whereof is impossible; because these bold denyers of the Immortality of the Soule have not yet experienced whether we subsist after Death or no. But if they would have us believe they have thus concluded upon rational grounds; I dare appeale unto them, if they can produce any stronger reasons for their Cause then what I have set down</hi> (Lib. 3. Cap. 14.) <hi>and if I have not fully and fundamentally answered them. If they
<pb facs="tcp:55765:7"/>
will say their confidence proceeds from the weak arguings of the adverse party; I answer, it is weakly done of them, (their own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being as unconcluding as they can fancy their adversaries) to be so secure, that Truth is on their own part rather then on theirs. But this can touch onely such managements of this Cause as they have seen already and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured. But that is nothing to me, who could never think I stood safe but upon my own leggs. Wherefore I shall require them onely to peruse what I have written, before they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to judge thereof; and after they have read, if they will declare that I have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated the Cause I have undertook, I think it reasonable &amp; just, that they punctually shew in what part or joynt of my Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they discern so weak a coherence as should embolden them still to dissent from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to the other I answer with more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and submission, That the Title of my Book doth not necessarily imply any promise of so full and perfect a Demonstration, that</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>can be added for the firmer assurance of the Truth; but onely that there may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as clear a Proof as</hi> Natural Reason <hi>will afford us. From which they should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferre, that I doe acknowledge a further and a more palpable evidence comprehended
<pb facs="tcp:55765:7"/>
in</hi> Christian Religion, <hi>and more intelligible and convictive to the generality of the World, who have neither leisure nor inclination to deal with the spinosities and anxieties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reason and Philosophy. But I declined the making use of that Argument at this time; partly because I have a design to speak more fully thereof in my Treatise</hi> Of the Mystery of Christian Religion, <hi>if God so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and partly because it was unsutable to the present Title, which pretends to handle the matter onely within the bounds of natural Light, unassisted and unguided by any mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Which will be a pleasant spectacle to such as have a Genius to these kinde of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, and wholly without danger; they still remembring that it is the voice of Reason &amp; Nature (which being too subject to corruption may very well be defectuous or erroneous in some things) and therefore never trusting their dictates and suggestions, where they clash with the Divine Oracles, they must needs be safe from all seduction: though, I profess, I doe not know any thing which I assert in this Treatise that doth disagree with them. But if any quicker-sighted then my self do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any thing not according to that Rule, it may be an occasion of humble thankfulness to God for that great priviledge of our being
<pb facs="tcp:55765:8"/>
born under an higher and exacter light: whereby those that are the most perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd therein, are inabled as well to rectify what is perverse, as to supply what is defectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the light of Nature; and they have my free leave afore-hand to doe both through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all along the ensuing Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this may serve by way of a more general Defence. But that nothing may be wanting, I shall descend to the making good also of certain particulars, as many as it is of any consequence further to clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In the First Book there occurre onely these two that I am aware of. The one concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the</hi> Centre of a particular Spirit, <hi>whose Idea I have described, and demonstrated pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. The other concerns my Demonstration of the</hi> Impossibility of the Suns seeing any thing upon Earth, <hi>supposing him meerly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal. In the making good the former, I have taken the boldness to assert, That</hi> Matter <hi>consists of parts</hi> indiscerpible, <hi>understanding by</hi> indiscerpible <hi>parts, particles that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed real extension, but so little, that they cannot have less and be any thing at all, and therefore cannot be actually divided. Which minute extension, if you will, you may call</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential <hi>(as being such that without that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it, the very Being of</hi> Matter <hi>cannot
<pb facs="tcp:55765:8"/>
be conserved) as the extension of any Matter compounded of these you may, if you please, term</hi> Integral; <hi>these parts of this compounded Matter being actually and really separable one from another. The Assertion, I confess, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but seem paradoxical at first sight, even to the ingenious and judicious. But that there are such</hi> indiscerpible <hi>particles into which</hi> Matter <hi>is divisible,</hi> viz. <hi>such as have</hi> essential <hi>extension, and yet have parts utterly inseparable, I shall plainly and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously here demonstrate (besides what I have said in the Treatise it self) by this short Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which is actually divisible so farre as actual division any way can be made, is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible into parts indiscerpible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Matter (I mean that</hi> Integral <hi>or</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>Matter) is actually divisible as farre as actual division any way can be made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It were a folly to goe to prove either my Proposition or Assumption, they being both so clear, that no common notion in</hi> Euclide <hi>is more clear, into which all Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations are resolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It cannot but be confessed therefore, That Matter consists of</hi> indiscerpible <hi>particles, and that Physically and really it is not divisible</hi> in infinitum, <hi>though the parts that constitute an</hi> indiscerpible <hi>particle are real, but divisible
<pb facs="tcp:55765:9"/>
onely intellectually; it being of the very es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of whatsoever</hi> is, <hi>to have parts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension in some measure or other. For, to take away all Extension, is to reduce a thing onely to a Mathematical point, which is nothing else but pure Negation or Non-entity; and there being no</hi> medium <hi>betwixt extended and not-extended, no more then there is betwixt Entity and Non-entity, it is plain that if a thing be at all, it must be extended. And therefore there is an</hi> Essential <hi>Extension be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to these</hi> indiscerpible <hi>particles of Matter; which was the other property which was to be demonstrated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know unruly Fancy will make mad work here, and clamour against the Conclusion as impossible. For finite Extension (will she say) must needs have Figure, and Figure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberancy of parts at such a distance, that we cannot but conceive them still actually divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But we answer, that when Matter is once actually divided as farre as possibly it can, it is a perfect contradiction it should be divided any further; as it is also that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be divided actually as farre as it can actually be divided. And no stronger De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration then this against them can be brought against us by either Fancy or Reason: and therefore supposing we were but equal in our reasoning, this is enough to give me the
<pb facs="tcp:55765:9"/>
day, who onely contend for the possibility of the thing. For if I bring but fully as good Demonstration that it is, as the other that it is not, none can deny me but that the thing is possible on my side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to answer the above-recited Argument, though they can never answer ours, I say, those</hi> indiscerpible <hi>particles of Matter have no Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure at all: As infinite Greatness has no Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, so infinite Littleness has none also. And a Cube infinitely little in the exactest sense, is as perfect a contradiction as a Cube infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely great in the same sense of Infinity: for the angles would be equal in magnitude to the</hi> Hedrae <hi>thereof. Besides, wise men are assured of many things that their Fancy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but play tricks with them in; as in the Infinity of Duration and of Matter, or at least of Space. Of the truth whereof though they are never so certain, yet if they consider this infinite Matter, Space, or Duration, as divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, suppose, into three equal parts (all which must needs be infinite, or else the whole will not be so) the middle part of each will seem both finite and infinite; for it is bounded at both ends. But every thing has two handles, as</hi> Epictetus <hi>notes; and he is a fool that will burn his fingers with the hot handle, when he may hold safe by the other that is more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable and cool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:55765:10"/>
4. <hi>Concerning my Demonstration of the</hi> Impossibility of the Suns being a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of our particular affairs upon Earth, <hi>there is onely this one Objection,</hi> viz. <hi>That though the Sun indeed, by reason of his great distance, cannot see any particular thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, if he kept always in that ordinary shape in which we should suppose that, if he were devoid of sense, he would doe; yet he having life and perception, he may change some part of his Body (as we doe our Eye in contracting or dilating the pupil thereof) into so advantageous a Figure, that the Earth may be made to appear to him as bigge as he pleases. Though some would be more ready to laugh at, then answer to, so odde a surmise, which supposes the Sun blinking and peering so curiously into our affairs, as through a Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope; yet because it comes in the way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, I shall have the patience seriously to return this reply. First, that this Objection can pretend to no strength at all, unless the body of the Sun were Organical, as ours is; when as he is nothing but fluid Light: so that unless he hath a spiritual Being in him, to which this Light should be but the Vehicle, this arbitrarious figuring of his fluid Matter cannot be effected. But to grant that there is any such incorporeal Substance in the Sun, is to yield me what I contend for,</hi> viz. <hi>That
<pb facs="tcp:55765:10"/>
there are</hi> Immaterial Substances <hi>in the World. But that there is no such Divine Principle in him, whereby he can either see us, or aim at the producing any apparition on the Earth in reference to any one of us, by the activity of that Spirit in him, it is apparent from the scum and spots that lie on him. Which is as great an Argument that there is no such Divinity in him as some would attribute to him, (such as</hi> Pomponatius, Cardan, Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>and others) as the dung of Owls and Sparrows, that is found on the faces and shoulders of Idols in Temples, are clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that they are but dead Images, no true Deities. Lastly, though we should suppose he had a particular sentient and intelligent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in him, yet the consideration of the vast distance of the Earth from him, and the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her</hi> Atmosphere, <hi>with other disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages I have already mentioned in my Treatise, makes it incredible that he should be able to frame his Body into any Figure so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite as will compensate these insuperable difficulties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>In my Second Book the first Exception is concerning the 20. Axiome, which, say they, I have not proved, but onely brought in the testimony of Mr.</hi> Hobbs <hi>for the support thereof; which therefore onely enables me to argue with him upon his own Principles,
<pb facs="tcp:55765:11"/>
wherein others will hold themselves unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But I answer, first, that it will concern all his followers as well as himself, so that it is no contemptible victory to demonstrate against all those so confident Exploders of</hi> Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Substances, <hi>that their own acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Principles will necessarily inferre the Existence of them in the World. But in the next place, it will not be hard to produce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Reasons to evince the truth of the above-named Axiome, viz.</hi> That Sense and Perception in Matter, supposing nothing but Matter in the World, is really the same with Corporeal Motion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it is plain in</hi> Sensation, <hi>there being alwayes external motion from Objects when our Senses are affected. And that inward</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation <hi>is thus performed, appears from the heat that</hi> Thinking <hi>casts a man into: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generally all</hi> Cogitation <hi>is accompanied with motion corporeal. And if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but</hi> Body <hi>or</hi> Matter <hi>in the World,</hi> Cogitation <hi>it self is really the same thing with</hi> Corporeal Motion. <hi>Moreover as in Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Corporeal Motion is first, and Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion followes, so it is necessary that universally in all internal Cogitations also certain Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Motions immediately precede those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, though we did admit that Matter
<pb facs="tcp:55765:11"/>
moved it self: For no Sense would thence arise without resistence of something it his against. Insomuch that the subtilest Matter unresisted or not imprest upon, would be no more capable of Cogitation then a Wedge of Gold, or Pig of Lead. And therefore if we will but confess (what none but mad men will venture to deny) that a Pig of Lead or Wedge of Gold has not any Thought or Perception at all without some knock or allision proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their bigness and solidity, the subtilest Matter must likewise have none without some proportionable impression or resistance. Whence it is plain that alwaies corporeal Reaction or collision precedes Perception, and that every Perception is a kind of feeling, which lasts so long as this resistence or impress of motion lasts, but that ceasing is extinguish'd, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being then as stupid as in a Pig of Lead. And that therefore as in general there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies corporeal motion where there is Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, so the diversification of this motion and collision causes the diversification of cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and so they run hand in hand perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the one never being introduced without the fore-leading of the other, nor lasting longer then the other lasteth. But as heat is lost (which implies a considerable motion or agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of some very subtile Matter,) so our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Imagination decayes, and our
<pb facs="tcp:55765:12"/>
Senses themselves fail, as not being able to be moved by the impression of outward Objects, or as not being in a due degree of liquidity and agility, and therefore in death our bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as senseless as a lump of clay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Sensation therefore and Perception is really the same with Motion and Reaction of Matter, if there be nothing but Matter in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that every piece of Matter must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive according as it self is moved, whether by it self (if it were possible) or by corporeal impress from other parts, is plain, in that Matter has no subtile rayes, or any power or efflux streaming beyond it self, like that which the Schools call</hi> species intentionales, <hi>nor yet any union more mysterious then the meer</hi> Jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta-position <hi>of parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For hence it is manifest that there can be no communication of any impress that one part of the Matter receives or is affected with from another at a distance, but it must be by jogging or crouding the parts interjacent. So that in every regard corporeal Motion or Reaction, with sufficient tenuity of parts and due dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be the adaequate cause of all percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if there be nothing but Matter in the world. This I think may suffice to assure any indifferent man of the truth of this part of</hi> Mr. Hobbs <hi>his Assertion, if himself could
<pb facs="tcp:55765:12"/>
make the other part true, That there is nothing existent in Nature but what is purely corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real. But out of the former part, which is his own acknowledged Principle, I have unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably demonstrated that there is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The other Exception is against that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I seem to embrace touching the Vehicles of Daemons and Souls separate, as having herein offended against the authority of the Schooles. And I profess this is all the reason I can imagine that they can have against my Assertion. But they may, if they please, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the Schooles trespass against a more antient authority then themselves, that is to say, the</hi> Pythagoreans, Platonists, Jewish Doctours, <hi>and the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the Church, who all hold that even the purest Angels have corporeal Vehïcles. But it will be hard for the Schools to alledge any antient Authority for their Opinion. For</hi> Aristotle <hi>their great Oracle is utterly silent in this matter, as not so much as believing the existence of</hi> Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <hi>in the world (as</hi> Pomponatius <hi>and</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus <hi>his sworn disciples have to their great contentment taken notice of.) And therefore being left to their own dry subtilties, they have made all Intellectual Beings that are not grossly terrestrial, as Man is, purely immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. Whereby they make a very hideous Chasme or gaping breach in the order of things,
<pb facs="tcp:55765:13"/>
such as no moderate judgment will ever allow of, and have become very obnoxious to be foyled by Atheistical wits, who are forward and skilful enough to draw forth the absurd consequences that lye hid in false suppositions, as</hi> Vaninus <hi>does in this. For he does not foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly collect from the supposed pure Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality of</hi> Daemons, <hi>that they have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of particular things upon Earth; such purely Incorporeal Essences being uncapable of impression from Corporeal Objects, and therefore have not the Species of any particular thing that is corporeal in their minde. Whence he infers that all Apparitions, Prophecies, Prodigies, and whatsoever miraculous is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in antient History, is not to be attributed to these, but to the influence of the Stars, and so concludes that there are indeed no such things as Daemons in the Universe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By which kinde of reasoning also it is easy for the</hi> Psychopannychites <hi>to support their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the</hi> Sleep of the Soule. <hi>For the Soule being utterly rescinded from all that is corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, and having no vital union therewith at all, they will be very prone to infer, that it is impossible she should know any thing</hi> ad extrà, <hi>if she can so much as dream. For even that power also may seem incompetible to her in such a state, she having such an essential ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for vital union with Matter. Of so
<pb facs="tcp:55765:13"/>
great consequence is it sometimes to desert the opinion of the Schooles, when something more rational and more safe and useful offers it self unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>These are the main Objections my first and second Book seem liable unto. My last I cannot but suspect to be more obnoxious. But the most common Exception I foresee that will be against it, is, That I have taken upon me to describe the state of the other World so punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and particularly, as if I had been lately in it. For over-exquisiteness may seem to smel of art and fraud. And as there is a diffidency many times in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we hear something that is extremely sutable to our desire, being then most ready to think it too good to be true; so also in Notions that seem over-accurately fitted to our Intellectual faculties, and agree the most naturally therewith, we are prone many times to suspect them to be too easy to be true; especially in things that seemed at first to us very obscure and intricate. For which cause also it is very likely that the notion of a particular Spirit, which I have so accurately described in my First Book,</hi> Cap. 5, 6, 7. <hi>may seem the less credible to some, because it is now made so clearly intelligible, they thinking it utterly improbable that these things, that have been held alwaies such inextricable perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, should be thus of a suddain made manifest
<pb facs="tcp:55765:14"/>
and familiar to any that has but a competency of Patience and Reason to peruse the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for my own part, I shall not assume so much to my self, as peremptorily to affirm that the</hi> Indiscerpibility <hi>of a Spirit arises that way that I have set down, that is to say, that God has made a particular Spirit just in that manner that I have delineated. For his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is infinite, and therefore it were an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious piece of boldness to confine him to one certain way of framing the nature of a Being, that is, of endowing it with such attributes as are essential to it, as</hi> Indiscerpibility <hi>is to the Soule of Man. But onely to have said in general, it is possible there may be a particular Essence of its immediate nature</hi> penetrable <hi>&amp;</hi> indiscerpible, <hi>and not particularly to have described the manner how it may be so, might have seemed to many more slight and unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, Deceit lurking in Universals, as the Proverb has it. And therefore for the more fully convincing of the adverse party, I thought fit to pitch upon a punctual description of some one way, how the Soule of Man or of a</hi> Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>may be conceived necessarily</hi> indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible, <hi>though dilatable; not being very solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous whether it be just that way or no, but yet well assured that it is either that way or some better. But this one way shewes the thing
<pb facs="tcp:55765:14"/>
possible at large: (As that mean contrivance of an Indian Canoa might prove the possibility of Navigation.) And that is all that I was to aime at in that place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So in my description of the state of the other world, I am not very sollicitous whether things be just so as I have set them down, but because some men utterly misbelieve the thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they can frame no particular conceit what the Receptions and Entertains of those AErial Inhabitants may be, or how they pass away their time, with many other intricacies which use to entangle this Theory; I thought it of main concernment to take away this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against the Life to come (viz.</hi> That no man can conceive what it is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not at all, <hi>which is the ordinary Exception also against the Existence of all Incorporeal Substances) by a punctual and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Description of this future state. Which I exhibite to the world as an intelligible Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, and such as may very wel be, even according to the dictates of our own Faculties, being in the mean time fully assured, that things are either thus, or after a better or more exact order. But, as I said, to propound some particular probable way, I thought it of no small service to those who totally distrust all these things for that reason mainly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such as we can make no rational repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
<pb facs="tcp:55765:15"/>
of to the understandings of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>But there are also particular Objections. The first whereof is against our AErial and AEthereal</hi> Elysiums, <hi>which forsooth, to make their reproach more witty, they will parallel with the</hi> Mahometan <hi>Paradise. But besides that I doe in the very place where I treat of these things suspend my assent after the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of them, there is nothing there offered in their description, but, if it were assented to, might become the most refined spirit in the World. For there is nothing more certain then that the love of God and our Neighbour is the greatest happiness that we can arrive unto either in this life or that which is to come. And whatever things are there descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, are either the Causes, Effects, or Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants of that noble and divine Passion. Neither are the External incitements thereto, which I there mention, rightly to be deemed Sensual, but Intellectual: For even such is also sensible Beauty, whether it shew it self in Feature, Musick, or whatever graceful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments and comely Actions, as</hi> Plotinus <hi>has well defined. And those things that are not properly Intellectual, suppose Odours and Sapours, yet such a Spirit may be transfused into the Vehicles of these AErial Inhabitants thereby, that may more then ordinarily raise into act their Intellectual Faculties. Which
<pb facs="tcp:55765:15"/>
he that observes how our Thoughts and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations depend immediately on a certain sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Matter in our Bodies, will not at all stick to acknowledge to be true. And therefore whatever our</hi> Elysiums <hi>seem to the rash and injudicious, they are really no other thing then pure Paradises of intellectual pleasure, divine Love and blameless Friendship being the onely delight of those places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>The next Objection is concerning the state of the Wicked, as if I had made their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition too easy for them. But this methinks any man might be kept off from, if he would but consider, that I make the rack of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence worse then a perpetually-repeated death. Which is too too credible to come to pass there, when as we finde what execution Passions will doe upon us even in this life; the</hi> Sicilian <hi>Tyrants having not found out a more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site torture then they. And as for those Souls that have lost the sense of Conscience, if any can doe so, I have allotted other punishments that are more corporeal, and little inferiour to the fire of that great Hell that is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied of, as the portion of the Devils and the damned at the last Day. By which neither then nor before could they be tortured (if we appeal to humane Reason, whom alone we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to, as judge, in this Treatise) if they were not vitally united with corporeal Vehicles.</hi>

            <p n="10">
               <pb facs="tcp:55765:16"/>
10. <hi>The two last Exceptions are, the one touching the</hi> Soul of the World, <hi>the other the</hi> Spirit of Nature. <hi>The first is against our over-favourable representation of their Opinion, that make but</hi> one Soul <hi>in the whole Universe, induing her with Sense, Reason, and Understanding: which Soul they will have to act in all Animals,</hi> Daemons <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not excepted. In all which, say they, it is one and the same Universal Soul that Hears, Sees, Reasons, Understands, &amp;c. This Opinion I think I have confuted</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 16. <hi>as sufficiently as any one Error can be confuted in all Natural Philosophy. And that favourable representation I have made there of it,</hi> Sect. 4. <hi>has that in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, unless a man be very remiss and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, he may easily demonstrate the falsness of the Supposition. For though we may well enough imagine how, the Body being unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and this Soul of the Universe exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely the same every where, that though the party change place, and shift into another part of the Soul of the World, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the same Opinions, Imaginations and Reasonings, so farre forth as they depend not on Memory (this Universal Soul raising her self into the same Thoughts upon the same Occasions;) yet Memory is incompetible unto that part which has not had the perception be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:55765:16"/>
of what is remembred. For there is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily comprehended in Memory a Sense or Perception that we have had a Perception or Sense afore of the thing which we conceive our selves to remember.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be short therefore, and to strike this Opinion dead at one stroke; They that say there is but one Soule of the World, whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive Power is every where, they must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, that what one part thereof perceives, all the rest perceives; or else that perceptions in Daemons, Men and Brutes are confined to that part of this Soul that is in them, while they perceive this or that. If the former, they are confutable by Sense and Experience. For though all Animals lie steeped, as it were, in that subtile Matter which runs through all things, and is the immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Sense and Perception; yet we are not conscious of one anothers thoughts, nor feel one anothers pains, nor the pains and pleasures of Brutes, when they are in them at the highest. Nor yet doe the</hi> Daemons <hi>feel one anothers affections, or necessarily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to one anothers opinions, though their Vehicles be exceeding pervious; else they would be all</hi> Avenroists, <hi>as well as those that appeared to</hi> Facius Cardanus, <hi>supposing any were. Wherefore we may generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if there were such an Universal

Soul, yet the particular perceptions thereof are restrained to this or that part in which they are made: which is contrary to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Soul, as I have already said in its due place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let us grant the thing (for indeed we have demonstrated it to be so, if there be such an Universal Soule and none but it) then the grand absurdity comes in, which I was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating before, to wit, That that part of the Soule of the world that never perceived a thing, shall notwithstanding remember it, that is to say, that it shall perceive it has perceived that which it never perceived: And yet one at</hi> Japan <hi>may remember a countrieman arrived thither that he had not seen nor thought of for twenty years before. Nay, which is more to the purpose, supposing the Earth move, what I write now, the Earth being in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of</hi> Aries, <hi>I shall remember that I have written when she is in the beginning of</hi> Libra, <hi>though that part of the Soule of the World that possesses my Body then will be twice as distant from what does guide my hand to write now, as the Earth is from the Sun. Wherefore it is plain that such an Universal Soule will not salve all</hi> Phaenomena, <hi>but there must be a particular Soule in every man. And yet I dare say, this wilde opinion is more tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then theirs that make nothing but</hi> meer
<pb facs="tcp:55765:17"/>
Matter <hi>in the world. But I thought it worth the while with all diligence to confute them both, the better of them being but a more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned kinde of Atheisme, tending to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of all the Fundamentals of Religion and Piety amongst men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>As for the</hi> Spirit of Nature, <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est exceptions are, that I have introduced an obscure Principle for Ignorance and Sloth to take sanctuary in, and so to enervate or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slack the usefull endeavours of curious Wits, and hinder that expected progress that may be made in the Mechanick Philosophy; and this, to aggravate the crime, before a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent search be made what the Mechanical powers of Matter can doe. For what Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical solutions the present or foregoing Ages could not light upon, the succeeding may; and therefore it is as yet unseasonable to bring in any such principle into Natural Philosophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which I answer, That the principle we speak of is neither obscure nor unseasonable; nor so much introduced by me, as forced upon me by in vitable evidence of Reason. That it is no obscure Principle, the clear Description I have given of it,</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 12. <hi>will make good. Those that pretend that the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction thereof is unseasonable, I demand of them when they will think it to be seasonable. For this simple surmise, That although all the
<pb facs="tcp:55765:18"/>
Mechanical solutions of some</hi> Phaenomena <hi>which have been hitherto offer'd to the world be demonstrably false, yet future Ages may light upon what is true, can be held no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else by the judicious, but a pittiful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge of fearful Souls, that are very loath to let in any such affrightful Notion as an</hi> Immaterial <hi>or</hi> Spiritual Substance <hi>into the world, for fear the next step must be the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment also of a God; from whom they would fain hide themselves by this poore and precarious pretence. But I say, if the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of this Principle be not seasonable now, it will never be seasonable. For that admirable Master of Mechanicks</hi> Des-Cartes <hi>has impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this way to the highest, I dare say, that the wit of man can reach to in such</hi> Phaenomena <hi>as he has attempted to render the causes of. But how in sundry passages he falls short in his account, I have both in the forenamed and following Chapter, as also elsewhere, taken notice. I will instance here onely in the</hi> Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon <hi>of Gravity, wherein I think I have perfectly demonstrated that both he and Mr.</hi> Hobbs <hi>are quite out of the story, and that the causes they assign are plainly false. And that I have not mentioned the opinions of others in this way, it was onely because I lookt upon them as less considerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>But you'l say that though these be all
<pb facs="tcp:55765:18"/>
mistaken, yet it does not follow but that there may arise some happy Wit that will give a true Mechanical solution of this Probleme. But I answer, that I have not onely confuted their Reasons, but also from Mechanical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples granted on all sides and confirmed by experience, demonstrated that the descent sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of a Stone or Bullet or any such like heavy Body is enormously contrary to the Lawes of Mechanicks, and that according to them they would necessarily, if they lye loose, recede from the Earth, and be carried away out of our sight into the farthest parts of the Aire, if some power more then Mechanical did not curbe that Motion, and force them downwards towards the Earth. So that it is plain that we have not arbitrariously introduced a Principle, but that it is forced upon us by the undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence of Demonstration. From which to suspend our assent till future Ages have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this Mechanical Philosophy to greater height, is as ridiculous, as to doubt of the truth of any one plain and easy Demonstration in the first Book of</hi> Euclide, <hi>till we have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through the whole field of that immense study of Mathematicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Nor lastly needs the acknowledgment of this Principle to damp our endeavours in the search of the Mechanical causes of the</hi> Phaenomena <hi>of Nature, but rather make us
<pb facs="tcp:55765:19"/>
more circumspect to distinguish what is the result of the meer Mechanical powers of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion, and what of an higher Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. For questionless this secure presumption in some, that there is nothing but Matter in the world, has emboldned them too rashly to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on Mechanical solutions where they would not hold, because they were confident there were no other solutions to be had but those of this kinde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>Besides that to the rational and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious there is a double pleasure to carry them on in this way of Philosophy: The one from the observation how far in every thing the concatenation of Mechanical causes will reach, which will wonderfuly gratify their Reason; The other from a distinct deprehension where they must needs break off, as not being able alone to reach the Effect, which necessarily leads them to a more confirmed discovery of the Principle we contend for, namely the</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>of</hi> Nature, <hi>which is the vicarious power of God upon the Matter, and the first step to the abstrusest mysteries in Natural Theologie; which must needs highly gratify them in point of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>And truly for this very cause, I think it is the most sober and faithful advice that can be offered to the Christian World, that they would encourage the reading of</hi> Des-Cartes'
<pb facs="tcp:55765:19"/>
               <hi>in all publick Schools or Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. That the Students of Philosophy may be throughly exercised in the just extent of the mechanical powers of Matter, how farre they will reach, and where they fall short. Which will be the best assistance to Religion that Reason and the knowledge of Nature can afford. For by this means such as are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to serve the Church will be armed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with sufficient strength to grapple with their proudest Deriders or Opposers. Whenas for want of this, we see how liable they are to be contemned and born down by every bold though weak pretender to the Mechanick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</hi>

                  <p n="10">10. THE evidence of this Axiome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares from the former. For if the <hi>naked substance</hi> of a Thing be so utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable, there can be nothing depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended there to be a connexion betwixt it and it's first Properties. Such is <hi>Actuall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility</hi> and <hi>Impenetrability</hi> in Matter. By <hi>Actuall Divisibility</hi> I understand <hi>Discerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> gross tearing or cutting one part from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55765:26"/>
another. These are immediate properties of Matter, but why they should be there, rather then in any other Subject, no man can pretend to give, or with any credit aske the reason. For <hi>Immediate Attributes</hi> are indemonstrable, otherwise they would not be Immediate.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. So the Immediate Properties of a <hi>Spirit</hi> or Immateriall Substance are <hi>Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> and <hi>Indiscerpibility.</hi> The necessary cohaesion of which Attributes with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is as little demonstrable as the former. For supposing that, which I cannot but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, to be evidently true, That there is no Substance but it has in some sort or other the Three dimensions; This Substance, which we call <hi>Matter,</hi> might as well have been penetrable as impenetrable, and yet have been Substance: But now that it does so certainly and irresistibly keep one part of it self from penetrating another, it is so, we know not why. For there is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary connexion discernible betwixt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with three dimensions, and Impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability. For what some alledge, that it implyes a contradiction, That extended sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance should run one part into another; for so part of the Extension, and consequently of the Substance, would be lost; this, I say,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55765:26"/>
(if nearly looked into) is of no force. For the Substance is no more lost in this case, then when a string is doubled and redoubled, or a piece of wax reduced from a long figure to a round: The dimension of Longitude is in some part lost, but without detriment to the Substance of the wax. In like manner when one part of an extended Substance runs into another, something both of Longitude, Latitude and Profundity may be lost, and yet all the Substance there still; as well as Longitude lost in the other case without any loss<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Substance. And as what was lost in Longitude was gotten in Latitude or Profundity before, so what is lost here in all or any two of the dimensions, is kept safe in <hi>Essential Spissitude.</hi> For so I will call this Mode or Property of a Substance, that is able to receive one part of it self into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Which fourth Mode is as easy and familiar to my Understanding, as that of the Three dimensions to my Sense or Fancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For I mean nothing else by <hi>Spissitude,</hi> but the redoubling or contracting of Substance into less space then it does sometimes occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. And Analogous to this is the lying of two Substances of several kindes in the same place at once. To both these may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the termes of <hi>Reduplication</hi> and <hi>Satu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> The former when Essence or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55765:27"/>
is but once redoubled into it self or into another; the latter when so oft, that it will not easily admit any thing more. And that more extensions then one may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate, at the same time, to the same Place, is plain, in that Motion is coexten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Subject wherein it is, and both with Space. And Motion is not nothing; wherefore two things may be commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to one space at once.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Now then Extended Substance (and all Substances are extended) being of it self indifferent to Penetrability or Impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and we finding one kind of Substance so impenetrable, that one part will not enter at all into another (which with as much reason we might expect to find so irresistibly united one part with another that nothing in the world could dissever them.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THE greatest and grossest obstacle to the belief of the Immortality of the Soul, is that confident opinion in some, as if the very notion of <hi>a Spirit</hi> were a piece of Non-sense and perfect Incongruity in the conception thereof. Wherefore to proceed by degrees to our maine designe, and to lay our foundation low and sure, we will in the first place expose to view the genuine notion of <hi>a Spirit,</hi> in the generall acception thereof; and afterwards of <hi>several kindes</hi> of <hi>Spirits:</hi> that it may appear to all, how unjust that cavill is against Incorporeall substances, as if they were meer Impossibilities and contradictious Inconsistencies. I will define therefore <hi>a Spirit</hi> in generall thus, <hi>A sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance penetrable and indiscerpible.</hi> The fitness of which definition will be the better understood, if we divide Substance in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall into these first kindes, viz. <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55765:28"/>
and then define <hi>Body</hi> to be <hi>A Substance impenetrable and discerpible.</hi> Whence the contrary kind to this is fitly defined, <hi>A Substance penetrable and indiscerpible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now I appeale to any man that can set aside prejudice, and has the free use of his Faculties, whether every term in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a <hi>Spirit</hi> be not as intelligible and congruous to reason, as in that of a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> For the precise notion of Substance is the same in both, in which, I conceive, is comprised <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> either connate or communicated. For matter it self once moved can move other matter. And it is as easy to understand what <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable</hi> is, as <hi>Impenetrable,</hi> and what <hi>Indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible</hi> as <hi>Discerpible;</hi> and <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiscerpibility</hi> being as immediate to <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Impenetrability</hi> and <hi>Discerpibility</hi> to <hi>Body,</hi> there is as much reason to be given for the attributes of the one as of the other, by Axiome 9. And Substance in its precise notion including no more of <hi>Impenetrability</hi> then <hi>Indiscerpibility,</hi> we may as well won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how one kind of Substance can so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and irresistibly keep out another Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance (as Matter for example does the parts of Matter) as that the parts of another Substance hold so fast together, that they are by no means <hi>Discerpible,</hi> as we have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55765:29"/>
already intimated: And therefore this <hi>hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out</hi> in one being as difficult a business to conceive as the <hi>holding together</hi> in the other, this can be no prejudice to the notion of a Spirit. For there may be very fast union where we cannot at all imagine the cause thereof, as in such Bodies which are exceeding hard, where no man can fancy what holds the parts together so strongly; and there being no greater difficulty here, then that a man cannot imagine what holds the parts of a Spirit together, it will follow by Axiome 7. that the notion of a <hi>Spirit</hi> is not to be excepted against as an incongruous notion, but is to be admitted for the notion of a thing that may really exist.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be doubted, whether there may not be Essences of a middle condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these Corporeal and Incorporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances we have described, and that of two sorts, The one <hi>Impenetrable and Indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible,</hi> the other <hi>Penetrable and Discerpible.</hi> But concerning the first, if Impenetrability be understood in reference to Matter, it is plaine there can be no such Essence in the world; and if in reference to its own parts, though it may then look like a possible Idea in it self, yet there is no footsteps of the existence thereof in Nature, the Souls of men and Daemons implying contraction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55765:29"/>
in them. As for the latter, it has no priviledge for any thing more then Matter it self has, or some Mode of Matter. For it being Discerpible, it is plain it's union is by <hi>Juxtaposition</hi> of parts, and the more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable, the less likely to conveigh sense and motion to any distance. Besides the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sequel of this supposition, that will fill the Universe with an infinite number of shreds and rags of Souls and Spirits, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be reduced again to any use or order. And lastly, the proper notion of a Substance Incorporeal fully counter-distinct to a Corporeal Substance, necessarily inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in it so strong and indissoluble union of parts, that it is utterly Indiscerpible, whenas yet for all that in this general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof neither sense nor cogitation is implyed, it is most rational to conceive, that that Substance wherein they are must assuredly be Incorporeal in the strictest sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification; the nature of cogitation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of sense arguing a more perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of union then is in meer Indiscerpibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of parts. But all this Scrupulositie might have been saved; For I confidently promise my self, that there are none so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly given to tergiversations and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges, but that they will acknowledge, whereever I can prove that there is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

               <p n="2">2. The notion of God, though the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof be much prejudiced by the confoundedness and stupidity of either su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious or profane men, that please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their large Rhetorications, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55765:30"/>
the unconceiveableness and utter incomprehensibleness of the Deity; the one by way of a devotional exaltation of the transcendency of his nature, the other to make the belief of his exsistence ridiculous, and craftily and perversly to intimate that there is no God at all, the very conception of him being made to appear nothing else but a bundle of inconsistencies and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities; Nevertheless I shall not at all stick to affirm, that His Idea or Notion is as easy as any Notion else whatsoever, and that we may know as much of him as of any thing else in the world. For the very Essence or naked Substance of nothing can possibly be known by Axiome 8. But for His Attributes, they are as conspicuous as the attributes of any Subject or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whatever; From which a man may easily define him thus; <hi>God is a Spirit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, infinite in essence and goodness, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient, omnipotent, and of himself necessarily existent.</hi> I appeal to any man, if every term in this Definition be not sufficiently intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible. For as for <hi>Spirit,</hi> that has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready defined and explained. By <hi>Eternal</hi> I understand nothing here but Duration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end or beginning: by <hi>Infiniteness of essence,</hi> that his Essence or Substance has no bounds, no more then his Duration: by <hi>Infinite in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55765:31"/>
goodness,</hi> such a benign will in God as is carried out to boundless and innumerable benefactions: by <hi>Omnisciency</hi> and <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> the ability of knowing or doing any thing that can be conceived without a plain contradiction: by <hi>Self-existency,</hi> that he has his Being from none other: and by <hi>necessary Existence,</hi> that he cannot fail to be. What terms of any Definition are more plain then these of this? or what Subject can be more accurately defined then this is? For the naked Subject or Substance of any thing is no otherwise to be known then thus. And they that gape after any other Speculative knowledg of God then what is from his Attributes and Operations, they may have their heads and mouths filled with many hot scalding fancies and words, and run mad with the boysterousness of their own Imagination, but they will never hit upon any sober Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus have I delivered a very expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and intelligible notion of the nature of God; which I might also more compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously define, <hi>An Essence absolutely perfect,</hi> in which all the terms of the former Definition are comprehended, and more then I have named, or thought needful to name, much less to insist upon; as his <hi>power of Creation,</hi> and his <hi>Omnipresence</hi> or <hi>Ubiquity,</hi> which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55765:31"/>
are necessarily included in the Idea of <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection.</hi> The latter whereof some ancient Philosophers endeavoring to set out, have defined God to be <hi>a Circle whose Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is every where and Circumference no where.</hi> By which description certainly nothing else can be meant, but that the Divine Essence is every where present with all those ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Attributes of Infinite and absolutely perfect Goodness, Knowledg and Power, according to that sense in which I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained them. Which Ubiquity or Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence of God is every whit as intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the overspreading of Matter into all places.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if here any one demand, How the parts, as I may so call them, of the Divine Amplitude hold together, that of Matter being so discerpible; it might be sufficient to remind him of what we have already spoken of the general notion of a Spirit. But besides that, here may be also a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar rational account given thereof, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a contradiction, that an <hi>Essence abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect</hi> should be either limited in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or change place in part or whole, they being both notorious Effects or Symptoms of Imperfection, which is inconsistent with the nature of God. And no better nor more cogent reason can be given of any thing,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55765:32"/>
then that it implyes a contradiction to be otherwise.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That <hi>power</hi> also of <hi>creating things of nothing,</hi> there is a very close connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and the Idea of God, or of a Being absolutely perfect. For this Being would not be what it is conceived to be, if it were destitute of the power of Creation, and therefore this Attribute has no less cohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Subject, then that it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction it should not be in it, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served of the foregoing Attribute of Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpibilitie in God.

               <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Indiscerpibility</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> we have already given rational grounds to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it not impossible, it being an Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate attribute thereof, as <hi>Impenetrability</hi> is of a <hi>Body,</hi> and as conceivable or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, that one <hi>Substance</hi> of it's own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

may invincibly hold its parts together, so that they cannot be disunited nor disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as that another may keep out so stoutly and irresistibly another Substance from entring into the same space or place with it self. For this <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>Impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability</hi> is not at all contained in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise conception of a <hi>Substance as Substance,</hi> as I have already signified. But besides that Reason may thus easily apprehend that it may be so, I shall a little gratifie Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and it may be Reason too, in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the manner how it is so, in this kind of Spirit we now speak of. That ancient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Light and <hi>Intentional species</hi> is so far from a plain impossibility, that it has been heretofore generally, and is still by very many persons, looked upon as a Truth, that is, That <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Colour</hi> doe ray in such sort as they are described in the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Philosophie. Now it is observable in Light, that it is most vigorous towards its fountain, and fainter by degrees. But we will reduce the matter to one lucid point, which, according to the acknowledged Principles of Opticks, will fill a distance of space with its rays of light: Which rayes may indeed be reverberated back towards their center by interposing some opake body, and so this Orbe of light contracted; but, according to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55765:33"/>
the <hi>Aristotelean</hi> Hypothesis, it was alwayes accounted impossible that they should be clipt off, or cut from this lucid point, and be kept apart by themselves. Those whom dry Reason will not satisfy, may, if they please, entertain their Fancy with such a representation as this, which may a little ease the anxious importunity of their mind, when it too eagerly would comprehend the manner how this <hi>Spirit</hi> we speak of may be said to be <hi>Indiscerpible.</hi> For think of any ray of this orbe of light, it does sufficiently set out to the imagination how <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Indiscerpibility</hi> may consist together.

               <p n="3">3. But if any object, That the lucid Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this orbe, or the Primary substance, as I call it, in the forecited places, is either divisible or absolutely indivisible, and if it be divisible, that as concerning that <hi>Inmost</hi> of a Spirit, this representation is not at all serviceable to set off the nature thereof, by shewing how the parts there may hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so indiscerpibly, but if absolutely indivisible, that it seems to be nothing; To this I answer, what <hi>Scaliger</hi> somewhere has noted, <hi>That what is infinitely great or infinitely small, the imagination of man is at a loss to conceive it.</hi> Which certainly is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55765:34"/>
the ground of the perplexedness of that Probleme concerning Matter, whether it consists of points, or onely of particles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible <hi>in infinitum.</hi> But to come more closely to the business; I say that though we should acknowledg the Inmost Center of life, or the very first point, as I may so call it, of the primary Substance (for this primary Substance is in some sort gradual) to be purely indivisible, it does not at all follow, no not according to Imagination it self, that it must be nothing. For let us imagine a Perfect Plain, and on this Plain a perfect Globe, we cannot conceive but this Globe touches the Plain, and that in what we ordinarily call a point, else the one would not be a Globe, or the other not a Plain. Now it is impossible that one body should touch another, and yet touch one another in nothing. Wherefore this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Center of life is something, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so full of essential vigour and virtue, that though gradually it diminish, yet can fill a certain Sphere of Space with its own presence and activity, as a spark of light illuminates the duskish aire. Wherefore there being no greater perplexity nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty in the consideration of this <hi>Center of life</hi> or <hi>Inmost</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> then there is in the Atomes of Matter, we may by Axiome 7.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55765:34"/>
rightly conclude, That <hi>Indiscerpibility</hi> has nothing in the notion thereof, but what may well consist with the possibility of the existence of the Subject whereunto it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.</p>

                     <p>There may be a Substance of that high Vertue and Excellency, that it may produce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Substance by Emanative causality, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that Substance produced be in due graduall proportions inferiour to that which causes it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis is plain out of the foregoing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. For there is no contradiction nor impossibility of a Cause producing an Effect less noble then it self, for thereby we are the better assured that it does not exceed the capacity of its own powers: Nor is there any incongruity, that one Substance should cause something else which we may in some sense call Substance, though but <hi>Secondary</hi> or <hi>Emanatory;</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Primary Substance</hi> to be the more ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Object of divine Creation, but the <hi>Secondary</hi> to be referrible also to the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> or <hi>Centrall</hi> Substance by way of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall relation. For suppose God created the Matter with an immediate power of moving it self, God indeed is the Prime cause as well of the Motion as of the Matter, and yet nevertheless the Matter is rightly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55765:37"/>
said to move it self. Finally, this <hi>Secondary</hi> or <hi>Emanatory</hi> Substance may be rightly called <hi>Substance,</hi> because it is a Subject in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with certain powers and activities, and that it does not inhaere as an <hi>Accident</hi> in any other Substance or Matter, but could maintaine its place, though all Matter or what other Substance soever were removed out of that space it is extended through, provided its <hi>Primary Substance</hi> be but safe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From these four Principles I have here added, we may have not an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive but rationall apprehension of that part of a Spirit which we call the <hi>Secondary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> thereof. Whose Extension arising by graduall Emanation from the First and primest Essence, which we call the <hi>Center</hi> of the Spirit (which is no impossible supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the 16. 18. and 19. Axiomes) we are led from hence to a necessary acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of perfect <hi>Indiscerpibility</hi> of parts, though not intellectuall Indivisibility, by Axiome 17. for it implyes a contradiction that an Emanative effect should be disjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from its originall.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thus have I demonstrated how a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, considering the lineaments of it (as I may so call them) from the Center to the Circumference, is utterly indiscerpible. But
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55765:38"/>
now if any be so curious as to ask how the parts thereof hold together in a line drawn cross to these from the Center (for Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it may be, will suggest they lye all loose) I answer that the conjecture of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is here partly true and partly false, or is true or false as she shall be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For if she mean by loose, actually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united, it is false and ridiculous: but if only so discerpible, that one part may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united from another, that is not only true, but necessary; otherwise a Spirit could not contract one part and extend another, which is yet an Hypothesis necessary to be admitted. Wherefore this Objection is so far from weakning the possibility of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it gives occasion more fully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the exact concinnity thereof. To be brief therefore, a Spirit from the Center to the Circumference is utterly indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible, but in lines cross to this it is closely cohaerent, but not indiscerpibly; which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haesion may consist in an immediate union of these parts, and transverse penetration and transcursion of secondary substance tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough this whole Sphere of life which we call a <hi>Spirit.</hi> Nor need we wonder that so full an Orbe should swell out from so subtil and small a point as the Center of this Spirit is supposed. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="5">5. This is the pure Idea of a created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in general, concerning which if there be yet any cavill to be made, it can be none other then what is perfectly common to it and to Matter, that is, the unimaginableness of Points and smallest Particles, and how what is discerpible cannot at all hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but this not hindering <hi>Matter</hi> from actuall existence, there is no reason that it should any way pretend to the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the impossibility of the existence of a <hi>Spirit</hi> by Axiome 7. But the most lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous supposition that we goe upon here, is not altogether so intricate as those difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Matter.</hi> For if that be but granted, in which I find no absurdity, That a Particle of Matter may be so little that it is utterly uncapable of being made less, it is plain that one and the same thing, though intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectually divisible, may yet be really indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpible. And indeed it is not only possible, but it seems necessary that this should be true: For though we should acknowledg that Matter were discerpible <hi>in infinitum,</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55765:39"/>
yet supposing a Cause of Infinite distinct perception and as Infinite power, (and God is such) this Cause can reduce this capacity of infinite discerpibleness of Matter into act, that is to say, actually and at once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerp it or disjoyn it into so many particles as it is discerpible into. From whence it will follow, that one of these particles reduced to this perfect Parvitude, is then utterly indiscerpible, and yet intellectually divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, otherwise magnitude would consist of meer points, which would imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. We have therefore plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by reason, that Matter consists of parts indiscerpible; and therefore there being no other Faculty to give suffrage against it, for neither sense nor any common notion can contradict it, it remains by Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome 5. that the Conclusion is true.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What some would object from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that these <hi>perfect Parvitudes</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged still intellectually divisible, must still have parts into which they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, and therefore be still discerpible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this it is answered, That division into parts does not imply any discerpibility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the parts conceived in one of these <hi>Minima Corporalia</hi> (as I may so call them) are rather <hi>essentiall</hi> or <hi>formall</hi> parts then <hi>integrall,</hi> and can no more actually be disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55765:39"/>
then Sense and Reason from the Soul of a man. For it is of the very Essence of Matter to be divisible, but it is not at all included in the essence thereof to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible; and therefore where discerpibility fails there is no necessity that divisibility should faile also. See the Preface, Sect. 3.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As for the trouble of spurious sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions or representations from the Fancy, as if these <hi>perfect Parvitudes</hi> were round Bodyes, and that therefore there would be Triangular intervals betwixt, void of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they are of no moment in this case, she alwayes representing a <hi>Discerpible</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude instead of an <hi>Indiscerpible</hi> one. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she bringing in a false evidence, her te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony is to be rejected; nay if she could perplex the cause far worse, she was not to be heard, by Axiome the 4. Wherefore Fancy being unable to exhibite the object we consider, in its due advantages, for ought we know these perfect Parvitudes may lye so close together, that they have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals betwixt: nay it seems necessary to be so; For if there were any such intervalls, they were capable of particles less then these least of all, which is a contradiction in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and a thing utterly impossible. But if we should gratify Fancy so far as to admit of these intervals, the greatest absurdity
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55765:40"/>
would be, that we must admit an insensible <hi>Vacuum,</hi> which no Faculty will be able ever to confute. But it is most rationall to admit none, and more consonant to our determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation concerning these <hi>Minima Corporalia,</hi> as I call them, whose largeness is to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the least reall touch of either a Globe on a Plain, or a Cone on a Plain, or a Globe on a Globe; if you conceive any reall touch less then another, let that be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of these <hi>Minute Realities</hi> in Matter. From whence it will follow, they must touch a whole side at once, and therefore can never leave any empty intervals. Nor can we imagine any Angulosities or round pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberancies in a quantity infinitely little, more then we can in one infinitely great, as I have already declared in my Preface. I must confess, a mans Reason in this speculation is mounted far beyond his Imagination; but there being worse intricacies in Theories acknowledged constantly to be true, it can be no prejudice to the present Conclusion, by the 4. and 7. Axiomes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thus have we cleared up a full and distinct notion of a Spirit, with so unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable accuracy, that no Reason can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to assert it impossible, nor unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. But if the Theory thereof may seem more operose and tedious to impatient wits,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55765:40"/>
and the punctuality of the description the more hazardous and incredible, as if it were beyond our Faculties to make so precise a Conclusion in a subject so obscure, they may ease their understanding, by contenting themselves with what we have set down Cap. 2. Sect. 11, 12. and remember that that Wisdome and Power that created all things, can make them of what nature He pleases, and that if God will that there shall be a Creature that is penetrable and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpible, that it is as easy a thing for him to make one so of its own nature, as one impenetrable and discerpible, and indue it with what other properties he pleases, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own will and purpose: which induments being immediately united with the Subject they are in, Reason can make no further demand how they are there, by the 9. Axiome.</p>

Brass, Iron; yea this whole Earth would suddenly melt into a thinner Substance then the subtil Aire, or rather it never had been condensated together to this consistency we finde it. But this is to anticipate my future purpose of proving That there are Spirits existing in the world: It had been sufficient here to have asserted, That <hi>Self-motion</hi> or <hi>Self-activity</hi> is as conceivable to appertain to <hi>Spirit</hi> as <hi>Body,</hi> which is plain at first sight to any man that appeales to his own Faculties. Nor is it at all to be scrupled at, that any thing should be allowed to move it self, because our adversaries that say there is nothing but Matter in the world, must of necessity (as I have intimated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) confess that this Matter moves it self, though it be very incongruous so to affirm.</p>

The congruity and possibility of <hi>Self-penetration</hi> in a <hi>created</hi> Spirit is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, partly from the limitableness of the Subject, and partly from the foregoing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of <hi>Indiscerpibility</hi> and <hi>Self-motion.</hi> For <hi>Self-penetration</hi> cannot belong to God, because it is impossible any thing should belong to him that implyes imperfection, and Self-penetration cannot be without the lessening of the presence of that which does penetrate it self, or the implication that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55765:42"/>
some parts of that essence are not so well as they may be, which is a contradiction in a Being which is absolutely perfect. From the Attributes of <hi>Indiscerpibility</hi> and <hi>Self-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (to which you may adde Penetrability from the generall notion of a Spirit) it is plain that such a Spirit as we define, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power of Motion upon the whole extent of its essence, may also determine this Motion according to the Property of its own nature: and therefore if it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the motion of the exteriour parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they will return inward towards the center of essentiall power; which they may easily doe without resistance, the whole Subject being penetrable, and without da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, it being also indiscerpible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From this <hi>Self-penetration</hi> we doe not only easily, but necessarily, understand <hi>Self-contraction</hi> and <hi>dilatation</hi> to arise. For this <hi>self-moving</hi> Substance, which we call a Spirit, cannot penetrate it self, but it must needs therewith contract it self; nor restore it self again to it's former state, but it does thereby dilate it self; so that we need not at all insist upon these termes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That power which a Spirit has to <hi>penetrate Matter</hi> we may easily understand if we consider a Spirit only as a Substance, whose immediate property is <hi>Activity.</hi> For
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55765:42"/>
then it is not harder to imagine this Active Substance to pervade this or the other part of Matter, then it is to conceive the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading or disspreading of motion it self therein.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The greatest difficulty is to fancy how this Spirit, being so incorporeall, can be able to move the matter, though it be in it. For it seems so subtil, that it will pass through, leaving no more footsteps of it's being there, then the Lightening does in the Scabbard, though it may haply melt the sword, because it there findes resistance. But a Spirit can find no resistance any where, the closest matter being easily penetrable and pervious to an Incorporeall substance. The ground of this difficulty is founded upon the unconceivableness of any <hi>Union</hi> that can be betwixt the matter, and a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that can so easily pass through it. For if we could but once imagine an <hi>Union</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Matter and a Spirit, the activity then of the Spirit would certainly have influence upon Matter, either for <hi>begetting,</hi> or <hi>increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>directing</hi> the motion thereof. But notwithstanding the Penetrability and easy passage of a Spirit through matter, there is yet for all that a capacity of a strong union betwixt them, and every whit as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable as betwixt the parts of Matter
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55765:43"/>
themselves. For what glue or Cement holds the parts of hard matter in stones and metalls together, or, if you will, of what is absolutely hard, that has no pores or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, but is one continued and perfectly homogeneous body, not only to sense, but according to the exact Idea of Reason? what Cement holds together the parts of such a body as this? Certainly nothing but <hi>immediate Union and Rest.</hi> Now for <hi>Union,</hi> there is no comparison betwixt that of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Matter, and this of Spirit with Matter. For the first is only superficiall; in this latter the very inward parts are united point to point throughout. Nor is there any feare it will not take hold, because it has a capacity of passing through. For in this absolutely solid hard Body, which let be A, in which let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <figure/> some inward superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, suppose E. A. C, this superficies is so smooth as nothing can be conceived smoother: why does not therefore the upper E. D. C. slide upon the neather part E. F. C. upon the least motion imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, especially E. F. C. being supposed to be held fast whilst the other is thrust against? This facility therefore of one Body passing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55765:43"/>
upon another without any sticking, seeming as necessary to our fancy as a Spirits passing through all Bodies without taking hold of them, it is plain by Axiome 7. That a firm union of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> is very possible, though we cannot conceive the manner thereof. And as for <hi>Rest,</hi> it is competible also to this conjunction of Matter with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as well as of Matter with Matter. For suppose the whole body A. moved with like swiftness in every part, the parts of A. then are according to that sense of Rest, by which they would explain the adhaesion of the parts of Matter one with another, truly quiescent. So say I that in the Union of Matter and Spirit, the parts of the Matter receiving from the Spirit just such a velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of motion as the Spirit exerts, and no more, they both rest in firm Union one with another. That which comes to pass even then when there is far less immediate Union then we speak of. For if we doe but lay a Book on our hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> provided our hand be not moved with a swister motion then it communicates to the Book, nor the Book be pusht on faster then the swiftness of our hand; the Book and our Hand will most certainly retain their Union and goe together. So na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and easy is it to conceive how a Spirit may move a Body without any more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55765:44"/>
or contradiction then is found in the Union and motion of the parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it self. See the Appendix to my Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, Cap. 3.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The last Terme I put in the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> is the <hi>power of altering the Matter;</hi> which will necessarily follow from it's <hi>power of moving it</hi> or directing its motion. For <hi>Alteration</hi> is nothing else but the varying of either the Figures, or postures, or the degrees of motion in the particles; all which are nothing else but the results of locall motion. Thus have we cleared the intelligibility and possibility of all the Termes that belong to the Notion of a created Spirit in generall, at least of such as may be rationally conceived to be the causes of any visible Phaenomena in the world: We will now descend to the defining of the chief <hi>Species</hi> thereof.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE have enumerated <hi>four kindes of Spirits,</hi> viz. The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Seminall Formes, the Soules of Brutes, the Humane Soule, and that Soule or Spirit which actuates or informes the vehicles of Angels:</hi> For I look upon Angels to be as truly a compound Being, consisting of Soule and Body, as that of Men and Brutes. Their Existence we shall not now goe about to prove, for that belongs to another place. My present design is onely to expound or define the notion of these things, so far forth as is needful for the evincing that they are the Ideas or Notions of things which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55765:45"/>
imply no contradiction or impossibility in their conception; which will be very easy for us to perform: the chief difficulty ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that <hi>more General notion</hi> of a Spirit, which we have so fully explained in the foregoing chapters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now this <hi>General notion</hi> can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into <hi>Kindes,</hi> by no other <hi>Differences</hi> then such as may be called peculiar powers or properties belonging to one Spirit and excluded from another, by the 8. Axiome. From whence it will follow, that if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe these several kindes of Spirits by immediate and intrinsecall properties, we have given as good Definitions of them as any one can give of any thing in the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We will begin with what is most sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Seminal Formes</hi> of things which, for the present, deciding nothing of their existence, according to their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>possibilis,</hi> we define thus; <hi>A Seminal Forme is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit organizing duely prepared matter into life and vegetation proper to this or the other kind of plant.</hi> It is beyond my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation what can be excepted against this description, it containing nothing but what is very cohaerent and intelligible. For in that it is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> it can <hi>move Matter</hi> intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secally, or at least <hi>direct</hi> the motion thereof, But in that it is not an <hi>Omnipotent</hi> Spirit,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55765:45"/>
but <hi>Finite</hi> and Created, it's power may well be restrained to <hi>duely prepared Matter</hi> both for vital union and motion. He that has made these particular Spirits, varying their Faculties of Vital union according to the diversity of the preparation of Matter, and so limiting the whole comprehension of them all, that none of them may be able to be vitally joyned with any matter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and the same first Cause of all things, that gives them a power of uniting with and moving of <hi>matter duely prepared;</hi> may also set such lawes to this motion, that when it lights on matter fit for it, it will produce such and such a Plant, that is to say, it will shape the matter into such Figure, Colour and other properties, as we discover in them by our Senses.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is the first degree of Particular Life in the world, if there be any purely of this degree particular. But now, as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> has somewhere noted, the Essences of things are like Numbers, whose <hi>Species</hi> are changed by adding or taking away an Unite; adde therefore another <hi>Intrinsecall power</hi> to this of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> viz. <hi>Sensation,</hi> and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the <hi>Soule</hi> of a <hi>Beast.</hi> For in truth the bare Substance it self is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in explicite knowledg, it being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it self unconceivable, and therefore
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55765:46"/>
we will onely reckon upon the Powers. <hi>A Subject therefore from whence is both Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sensation is the general notion of the Soule of a Brute.</hi> Which is distributed into a number of kindes, the effect of every <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal power</hi> being discernible in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant shape and properties of every distinct kind of Brute Creatures.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we adde to <hi>Vegetation</hi> and <hi>Sensation Reason</hi> properly so called, we have then a setled notion of the Soule of Man; which we may more compleatly describe thus: <hi>A created Spirit indued with Sense and Reason, and a power of organizing terrestrial matter into humane shape by vital union therewith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. And herein alone, I conceive, does the Spirit or Soule of an Angel (for I take the boldness to call that <hi>Soule,</hi> what ever it is, that has a power of vitally actuating the Matter) differ from the Soule of a Man, in that the Soule of an Angel may vitally actuate an <hi>aëreal</hi> or <hi>aethereal</hi> body, but cannot be born into this world in a <hi>terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial</hi> one.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To make an end therefore of our Definitions: an <hi>Angelical Soule</hi> is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly described thus; <hi>A created Spirit indued with Reason, Sensation, and a power of being vitally united with and actuating of a Body of aire or aether onely.</hi> Which power
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55765:46"/>
over an <hi>aëreal</hi> or <hi>aethereal</hi> Body is very easily to be understood out of that general notion of a Spirit in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For it being there made good, that union with Matter is not incompetible to a Spirit, and consequently nor moving of it, nor that kind of motion in a Spirit which we call Contraction and Dilatation; these powers, if carefully considered, will neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily infer the possibility of the Actuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Union of an Angelical Soule with an aethereal or aiery Body.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Platonists</hi> write of other orders of Spirits or Immaterial Substances, as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But there being more Subtilty then either usefulness or assurance in such like Speculations, I shall pass them over at this time; having already, I think, irrefutably made good, That there is no incongruity nor incompossibility comprised in the Notion of Spirit or Incorporeal Substance.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But there is yet another way of infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the same, and it is the Argument of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> whereby he would conclude that there is <hi>de facto</hi> a <hi>Substance in us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from Matter,</hi> viz. our own <hi>Minde.</hi> For every Real affection or Property being the Mode of some Substance or other, and reall Modes being unconceivable without their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55765:47"/>
Subject, he inferres that, seeing we can doubt whether there be any such thing as Body in the world (by which doubting we seclude <hi>Cogitation</hi> from <hi>Body)</hi> there must be some other Substance distinct from the Body, to which Cogitation belongs. But I must confess this Argument will not reach home to <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his purpose, who would prove in Man a substance distinct from his body. For being there may be <hi>modes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to more Subjects then one, and this of <hi>Cogitation</hi> may be pretended to be such as is competible as well to substance Corporeal as Incorporeal, it may be conceived apart from either, though not from both. And therefore his argument does not prove that That in us which does <hi>think</hi> or <hi>perceive</hi> is a Substance distinct from our Body, but onely That there may be such a Substance, which has the power of thinking or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, which yet is not a Body. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible that there should be any real mode which is in no Subject, and we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceiving <hi>Cogitation</hi> independent for existence on Corporeal Substance; it is necessary, That there may be some other Substance on which it may depend; which must needs be a Substance Incorporeal.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. That it is of no small consequence to have proved the <hi>Possibility</hi> of the Existence of a Spirit. 2.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Have been, I believe, to admiration curious and sollicitous to make good, that the Existence of a <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Incorporeal Substance</hi> is possible. But there is no reason any one should wonder that I have spent so much pains to make so small and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a progresse, as to bring the thing only to a <hi>bare possibility.</hi> For though I may seem to have gained little to my self, yet I have thereby given a very signal overthrow to the adverse party, whose strongest hold seems to be an unshaken confidence, That the very notion of a <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Substance Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material</hi> is a perfect Incompossibility and pure Non-sense. From whence are insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated no better Consequences then these:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55765:48"/>
That it is impossible that there should be any God, or Soule, or Angel, Good or Bad; or any Immortality or Life to come. That there is no Religion, no Piety nor Impiety, no Vertue nor Vice, Justice nor Injustice, but what it pleases him that has the longest Sword to call so. That there is no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Will, nor consequently any Rational remorse of Conscience in any Being what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, but that all that is, is nothing but Matter and corporeal Motion; and that therefore every trace of mans life is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary as the tracts of Lightning, and the fallings of Thunder; the blind <hi>impetus</hi> of the Matter breaking through or being stopt every where, with as certain and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate necessity, as the course of a Torrent after mighty stormes and showers of Rain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And verily considering of what excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great consequence it is to root out this sullen conceit that some have taken up con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Incorporeal Substance,</hi> as if it bore a contradiction in the very termes, I think I shall be wanting to so weighty a Cause, if I shall content my self with a bare recita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reasons whereby I prove it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and not produce their Arguments that seem most able to maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And truly I doe not remember that I ever met with any one yet that may justly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55765:48"/>
be suspected to be more able to make good this Province then our Countreyman <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> whose inexuperable confidence of the truth of the Conclusion, may well assure any man that duely considers the excellency of his natural Wit and Parts, that he has made choice of the most Demonstrative Arguments that humane Invention can search out for the eviction thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that I may not incurre the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of mistaking his Assertion, or of misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the force of his Reasons, I shall here punctually set them down in the same words I find them in his own Writings, that any man may judge if I doe him any wrong. The first place I shall take notice of is in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Chap. 34. <hi>The word</hi> Body <hi>in the most general acceptation signifies that which filleth or occupieth some certain room, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined place; and dependeth not on the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but is a real part of that we call the Universe. For the Universe being the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of all Bodyes, there is no reall part thereof that is not also Body; nor any thing properly a Body, that is not also part of (that Aggregate of all Bodyes) the Universe. The same also, because Bodyes are subject to change, that is to say, to variety of appearance to the sense of living Creatures, is called Substance, that is to say, subject to various Accidents;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55765:49"/>
as sometimes to be moved, sometimes to stand still, and to seem to our senses sometimes Hot, sometimes Cold, sometimes of one Colour, Smell, Tast, or Sound, sometimes of another. And this diversity of seeming, (produced by the diversity of the operation of Bodyes on the Organs of our Sense) we attribute to altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Bodyes that operate, and call them Accidents of those Bodyes. And according to this acception of the word, Substance and Body signifie the same thing; and therefore Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance incorporeal are words which when they are joyned together destroy one another, as if a man should say an Incorporeal Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The second place is in his <hi>Physicks,</hi> Part 4. Chap. 25. Article 9. <hi>But it is here to be observed that certain Dreames, especially such as some men have when they are betwixt sleeping and waking, and such as happen to those that have no knowledg of the nature of Dreames, and are withall superstitious, were not heretofore nor are now accounted Dreames. For the Apparitions men thought they saw, and the voices they thought they heard in sleep, were not believed to be Phantasmes, but things subsisting of themselves, and Objects without those that Dreamed. For to some men, as well sleeping as waking, but especially to guilty men, and in the night, and in hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed places, Fear alone, helped a little with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55765:49"/>
the storyes of such Apparitions, hath raised in their mindes terrible Phantasmes which have been and are still deceitfully received for things really true, under the names of Ghosts and Incorporeal Substances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. We will adde a third out of the same book, Part 1. Chap. 5. Art. 4. <hi>For seeing Ghosts, sensible species, a shadow, light, colour, sound, space, &amp;c. appear to us no less sleeping then waking, they cannot be things without us, but onely Phantasmes of the mind that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. And a fourth out of his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Chap. 11. Art. 4. <hi>But Spirits super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall commonly signifie some Substance without dimension, which two words doe flatly contradict one another.</hi> And Article 5. <hi>Nor I think is that word Incorporeal at all in the Bible, but is said of the Spirit, that it abideth in men, sometimes that it dwelleth in them, sometimes that it cometh on them, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth, and goeth, and cometh, and that Spirits are Angels, that is to say, Messengers; all which words doe imply locality, and locality is Dimension, and whatsoever hath dimension is Body, be it never so subtile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The fifth Excerption shall be out of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Chap. 12. <hi>And for the Matter or Substance of the Invisible agents so fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed, they could not by naturall cogitation fall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55765:50"/>
upon any other conceit, but that it was the same with that of the Soule of Man, and that the Soule of Man was of the same Substance with that which appeareth in a Dream to one that sleepeth, or in a Looking-glass to one that is awake: Which, men not knowing that such Apparitions are nothing else but creatures of the Fancy, think to be reall and external Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and therefore call them Ghosts, as the Latines called them</hi> Imagines, <hi>and</hi> Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae; <hi>and thought them Spirits, that is, thin aereal bodies; and those invisible Agents, which they feared, to be like them, save that they appeare and vanish when they please. But the opinion that such Spirits were Incorporeal or Immateriall, could never enter into the minde of any man by nature; because, though men may put together words of contradictory signification, as</hi> Spirit <hi>and</hi> Incorporeal, <hi>yet they can never have the imagination of any thing answering to them.</hi> We will help out this further from what he writes in his Humane Nature, Cap. 11. Art. 5. <hi>To know that a Spirit is, that is to say, to have natural evidence of the same, it is impossible. For all evidence is conception, and all conception is imagination, and proceedeth from Sense; and Spirits we suppose to be those Substances which work not upon the Sense, and therefore are not conceptible.</hi>

8. The sixth, out of Chap. 45. where he writes thus: <hi>This nature of Sight having never been discovered by the ancient preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to naturall knowledg, much less by those that consider not things so remote (as that knowledg is) from their present use, it was hard for men to conceive of those Images in the Fancy and in the Sense, otherwise then of things really without us. Which some (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they vanish away they know not whether nor how) will have to be absolutely incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, that is to say, Immaterial, or Forms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Matter, Colour and Figure, without any coloured or figured body, and that they can put on aiery bodyes, (as a garment) to make them visible when they will to our bodily eyes; and others say, are Bodyes and living Creatures, but made of Aire, or other more subtile and aethereal matter, which is then, when they will be seen, condensed. But both of them agree on one general appellation of them,</hi> Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. <hi>As if the dead of whom they dreamed were not the Inhabitants of their own Brain, but of the Aire or of Heaven or Hell, not Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes but Ghosts; with just as much reason as if one should say he saw his own Ghost in a Looking-glass, or the Ghosts of the stars in a River, or call the ordinary Apparition of the Sun of the quantity of about a foot, the Daemon or Ghost of that great Sun that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55765:51"/>
the whole visible world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The seventh is out of the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the same book. Where he again ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to task that Jargon, as he calls it, of <hi>Abstract Essences</hi> and <hi>Substantial Formes,</hi> he writes thus: <hi>The world (I mean not the Earth onely, but the Universe, that is, the whole mass of all things that are) is corporeal, that is to say, Body, and hath the Dimensions of Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, namely Length, Breadth and Depth; also every part of Body is likewise Body, and hath the like dimensions; and consequently every part of the Universe is Body, and that which is not Body is no part of the Universe: And because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing, and consequently no where.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The eighth and last we have a little after in the same Chapter, which runs thus; <hi>Being once fallen into this errour of separated essences, they are thereby necessarily involved in many other absurdities that follow it. For seeing they will have these Formes to be real, they are obliged to assign them some place. But because they hold them incorporeal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all dimension of Quantity, and all men know that Place is Dimension, and not to be filled but by that which is corporeall, they are driven to uphold their credit with a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are not indeed any where</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscriptivè,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55765:51"/>
                  <hi>but</hi> Definitivé. <hi>Which termes, being meer words, and in this occasion insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, pass onely in Latine, that the vanity of them might be concealed. For the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of a thing is nothing else but the determination or defining of it's place, and so both the termes of distinction are the same. And in particular of the essence of man, which they say is his Soule, they affirm it to be all of it in his little finger, and all of it in every other part</hi> (how small soever) <hi>of his Body, and yet no more Soule in the whole Body then in any one of these parts. Can any man think that God is served with such Absurdities? And yet all this is necessary to believe to those that will believe the existence of an incorporeal Soule separated from the Body.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE have set down the chiefest pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the Writings of <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> that confident Exploder of <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Substances</hi> out of the world. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains now that we examine them, and see whether the force of his Arguments beares any proportion to the firmness of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or rather mis-belief, concerning these things. To strip therefore the first Excerp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that long <hi>Ambages</hi> of words, and to reduce it to a more plain and compendious forme of reasoning, the force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies thus: <hi>That seeing every thing in the Universe is Body (the Universe being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but an Aggregate of Bodies) Body and Substance are but names of one and the same thing; it being called Body as it fills a place, and Substance as it is the Subject of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55765:52"/>
severall Alterations and Accidents. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Body <hi>and</hi> Substance <hi>being all one,</hi> Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Substance <hi>is no better sense then an</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Body, <hi>which is a contradiction in the very termes.</hi> But it is plain to all the world that this is not to prove, but to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose what is to be proved, That the Universe is nothing else but an Aggregate of Bodyes: When he has proved that, we will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the sequel; till then he has proved nothing, and therefore this first argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation must pass for nought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us examine the strength of the Second, which certainly must be this, if any at all; <hi>That which has its originall meerly from Dreames, Feares and Superstitious Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyes, has no reall existence in the world. But Incorporeall Substances have no other Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</hi> The Proposition is a Truth indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable, but the Assumption is as weak as the other is strong; whether you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it of the reall Originall of these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, or of the Principles of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge That they are. And be their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall what it will, it is nothing to us, but so far forth as it is cognoscible to us by Axiome first. And therefore when he sayes, they have no other Originall then that of our own Fancy, he must be understood to affirme that there is no other principle of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55765:53"/>
the knowledge of their Existence then that we vainly imagine them to be; which is grossly false. For it is not the Dreams and Feares of Melancholick and Superstitious persons, from which Philosophers and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have argued the Existence of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Immaterial Substances, but from the evidence of Externall Objects of Sense, that is, the ordinary <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> in which there is discoverable so profound Wisdome and Counsell, that they could not but conclude that the order of things in the world was from a higher Principle then the blind motions and jumblings of Matter and meer Corporeall Beings. To which you may adde what usually they call <hi>Apparitions,</hi> which are so far from being meerly the Dreams and Fancyes of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, that they are acknowledged by such as cannot but be deemed by most men over Atheisticall, I mean <hi>Pomponatius</hi> and <hi>Cardan,</hi> nay by <hi>Vaninus</hi> himself, though so devoted to Atheisme, that out of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mad zeale to that despicable cause he died for it. I omit to name the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soule, which ever appeared to the wisest of all Ages of such a transcendent condition, that they could not judge them to spring from so contemptible a Principle as bare Body or Matter. Wherefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55765:53"/>
all these, and to make representation onely of Dreames and Fancyes to be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of the world's concluding that there are <hi>Incorporeall Substances,</hi> is to fancy his Reader a meer foole, and publickly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that he has a minde to impose upon him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third argumentation is this: <hi>That which appears to us as well sleeping as wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is nothing without us: But Ghosts, that is Immateriall Substances, appeare to us as well sleeping as waking.</hi> This is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est argument that has been yet produced: for both the Proposition and Assumption are false. For if the Proposition were true, the Sun, Moon, Stars, Clouds, Rivers, Meadows, Men, Women, and other living creatures were nothing without us: For all these appeare to us as well when we are sleeping as waking. But <hi>Incorporeall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> doe not appeare to us as well sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as waking. For the notion of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeall Substance</hi> is so subtile and refined, that it leaving little or no impression on the Fancy, it's representation is meerly supported by the free power of Reason, which seldome exercises it self in sleep, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less upon easy imaginable Phantasmes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The force of the fourth Argument is briefly this: <hi>Every Substance has dimensions; but a Spirit has no dimensions.</hi> Here I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55765:54"/>
deny the Assumption. For it is not the Characteristicall of a Body to have <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,</hi> but to be <hi>Impenetrable.</hi> All Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance has <hi>Dimensions,</hi> that is, Length, Breadth, and Depth: but all has not <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrability.</hi> See my Letters to Monsieur <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> besides what I have here writ, Cap. 2, and 3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the Excerptions belonging to the fifth place these Arguments are comprised. 1. <hi>That we have no principle of knowledge of any Immateriall Being, but such as a Dream or a Looking-Glasse furnisheth us withall.</hi> 2. <hi>That the word</hi> Spirit <hi>or</hi> Incorporeall <hi>implyes a contradiction, and cannot be conceived to be sense by a naturall Understanding.</hi> 3. <hi>That nothing is conceived by the Understanding but what comes in at the Senses, and therefore Spirits not acting upon the Senses must remain unknown and unconceivable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have already answered to the first in what we have returned to his second Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the second Excerption.</p>
               <p>To the second I answer, That <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Incorporeall</hi> implyes no contradiction, there being nothing understood thereby but <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Substance</hi> with <hi>Activity</hi> and <hi>Indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibility,</hi> leaving out <hi>Impenetrability:</hi> Which I have above demonstrated to be the notion of a thing possible, and need not repeat what I have already written.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:55765:54"/>
To the third I answer, That Spirits do act really upon the Senses, by acting upon Matter that affects the Senses; and some of these operations being such, that they cannot be rationally attributed to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone, Reason by the information of the Senses concludes, that there is some other more noble Principle distinct from the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And as for that part of the Argument that asserts that there is nothing in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding but what comes in at the Senses, I shall in it's due place demonstrate it to be a very gross Errour. But in the mean time I conclude, that the Substance of every thing being utterly unconceivable by Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome 8. and it being onely the <hi>Immediate properties</hi> by which a man conceives every thing, and the properties of <hi>Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiscerpibility</hi> being as easy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as of <hi>Discerpibility</hi> and <hi>Impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> and the power of communicating of motion to Matter as easy as the Matters reception of it, and the Union of Matter with Spirit, as of Matter with Matter; it plainly followes, that the notion of a <hi>Spirit</hi> is as naturally conceivable as the notion of a <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. In this sixth Excerption he is very copious in jearing and making ridiculous the opinion of <hi>Ghosts</hi> and <hi>Daemons;</hi> but the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55765:55"/>
strength of his Argument, if it have any, is this, viz. <hi>If there be any such things as Ghosts or Daemons, then they are (according to them that hold this opinion) either those Images reflected from water or Looking-glasses, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves in aiery garments, and so wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring up and down, or else they are living Creatures made of nothing but Aire or some more subtile and AEthereall Matter.</hi> One might well be amazed to observe such slight and vain arguing come from so grave a Philosopher, were not a man well aware that his peculiar eminency, as himself some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where professes, lies in <hi>Politicks,</hi> to which the humours and Bravadoes of Eloquence, especially amongst the simple, is a very effectuall and serviceable instrument. And certainly such Rhetorications as this cannot be intended for any but such as are of the very weakest capacity. Those two ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less conceits that he would obtrude upon the sober Assertors of Spirits and Daemons belong not to them, but are the genuine issue of his own Brain. For, for the former of them, it is most justly adjudged to him, as the first Author thereof; it being a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which neither my self nor (I dare say) any else ever met with out of <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his Writings. And the latter he does not onely not goe about to confute here,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55765:55"/>
but makes a shew of allowing it, for fear he should seem to deny Scripture, in Chap. 34. of his <hi>Leviathan.</hi> But those that assert the existence of Spirits, will not stand to <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his choice for defining of them, but will make use of their own Reason and Judgment for the setling of so concerning a Notion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In this seventh Excerption is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same Argument that was found in the first; but to deal fairly and candidly, I must confess it is better backt then before. For there he supposes, but does not prove, the chief ground of his Argument; but here he offers at a proof of it, couched, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in these words <hi>[and hath the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Magnitude, namely Length, Breadth and Depth]</hi> for hence he would infer that the whole Universe is corporeall, that is to say, every thing in the Universe, because there is nothing but has Length, Breadth and Depth. This therefore is the very last ground his Argument is to be resolved into. But how weak it is I have already intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it being not <hi>Trinall Dimension,</hi> but <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrability,</hi> that constitutes a <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. This last Excerption seems more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable then any of the former, or all of them put together: but when the force of the Arguments therein contained is duely
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55765:56"/>
weighed, they will be found of as little effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to make good the Conclusion as the rest. The first Argument runs thus; <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is reall, must have some place: But Spirits can have no place.</hi> But this is very easily answered. For if nothing else be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by <hi>Place,</hi> but <hi>Imaginary Space,</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Bodyes may be in the same imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Space, and so the Assumption is false. But if by <hi>Place</hi> be meant the <hi>Concave Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of one Body immediately environing another Body,</hi> so that it be conceived to be of the very Formality of a <hi>Place,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to environ the corporeall Superficies of that Substance which is said to be placed; then it is impossible that a <hi>Spirit</hi> should be properly said to be in a <hi>Place,</hi> and so the Proposition will be false. Wherefore there being these two acceptions of <hi>Place,</hi> that Distinction of being there <hi>Circumscriptivè</hi> and <hi>Definitivè</hi> is an allowable Distinction, and the terms may not signify one and the same thing. But if we will with <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> (and I know no great hurt if we should doe so) confine the notion of <hi>Place</hi> to <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Space,</hi> this distinction of the Schools will be needless here, and we may, without any more adoe, assert, that <hi>Spirits</hi> are as truly in Place as <hi>Bodyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His second Argument is drawn from that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55765:56"/>
Scholastick Riddle, which I must confess seems to verge too near to profound Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense, That the Soule of man is <hi>tota in toto and tota in qualibet parte corporis.</hi> This mad Jingle it seems has so frighted <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> sometime or other, that he never since could endure to come near the notion of a Spirit again, not so much as to consider whether it were a meer Bug-beare, or some reall Being. But if Passion had not surprised his better Faculties, he might have found a true setled meaning thereof, and yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded these wilde intricacies that the heedless Schools seem to have charged it with: For the <hi>Immediate properties</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> are very well intelligible without these aenigmaticall flourishes, viz. That it is <hi>a Substance Penetrable and Indiscerpible,</hi> as I have already shewn at large.</p>
               <p>Nor is that Scholastick AEnigme neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be believed by all those that would believe the existence of an Incorporeal Soul; nor do I believe <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Riddle to be so necessary. And it had been but fair play to have been assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Schools held such a perfect contradiction, before he pronounced the belief thereof necessary to all those that would hold the Soule of Man <hi>an Immateriall Substance, separable from the Body.</hi> I suppose
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55765:57"/>
they may mean nothing by it, but what <hi>Plato</hi> did by his making the Soule to consist <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> nor <hi>Plato</hi> any thing more by that <hi>divisible</hi> and <hi>indivisible</hi> Substance, then an Essence that is intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectually divisible, but really indiscerpible.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We have now firmly made good, that the notion of a Spirit implyes no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction nor incompossibility in it; but is the notion or Idea of a thing that may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be. Which I have done so punctually and particularly, that I have cleared every <hi>Species</hi> of Substances Incorporeall from the imputation of either obscurity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency. And that I might not seem to take advantage in pleading their cause in the absence of the adverse party, I have brought in the most able Advocate and the most assured that I have hitherto ever met withall; and dare now appeal to any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Judge, whether I have not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated all his Allegations to be weak and inconclusive. Wherefore having so clearly evinced the possibility of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of a Spirit, we shall now make a step further, and prove That it is not onely a thing possible, but that it is really and actually in Nature.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. Three grounds to prove the Existence of an Immateriall Substance, whereof the first is fetcht from the Nature of God. 2. The second from the Phaenomenon of Motion in the world. 3. That the Matter is not self-moveable. 4. An Objection that the Matter may be part self-moved, part not. 5. The first Answer to the Objection. 6. The second Answer. 7. Other Evasions answered. 8. The Conclusion, That no Matter is self-moved, but that a certain quantity of motion was impressed upon it at its first Creation by God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THere be three main Grounds from whence a man may be assured of the Existence of Spirituall or Immateriall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. The one is the consideration of the transcendent excellency of the nature of God; who being, according to the true Idea of Him, <hi>an Essence absolutely perfect,</hi> cannot possibly be <hi>Body,</hi> and consequently must be something <hi>Incorporeall:</hi> and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is no contradiction in the notion of a Spirit in generall, nor in any of those kinds of Spirits which we have defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55765:58"/>
(where the notion of God was set down amongst the rest) and that in the very notion of him there is contained the reason of his Existence, as you may see at large in my <hi>Antidote,</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 7. 8; certainly if we find any thing at all to <hi>be,</hi> we may safely conclude that He <hi>is</hi> much more. For there is nothing besides Him of which one can give a reason why it is, unless we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to be the Author of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though God be neither <hi>Visible</hi> nor <hi>Tangible,</hi> yet his very Idea representing to our Intellectuall Faculties the necessary reason of his Existence, we are by Axiome 5. (though we had no other Argument drawn from our Senses) confidently to conclude That He is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second ground is the ordinary <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, the most generall whereof is <hi>Motion.</hi> Now it seems to me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable from hence, that there is some Being in the world distinct from Matter. For Matter being of one simple homogeneal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; not distinguishable by specificall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, as the Schools speak, it must have every where the very same Essentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; and therefore of it self it must all of it be either without motion, or else be self-moving, and that in such or such a tenor, or measure of Motion; there being no
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55765:58"/>
reason imaginable, why one part of the Matter should move of it self lesse then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and therefore if there be any such thing, it can onely arise from externall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now I say, if Matter be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of Motion in it self, it is plain it has it's motion from some other Substance, which is necessarily a Substance that is not Matter, that is to say, a <hi>Substance Incorporeall.</hi> But if it be moved of it self, in such or such a measure, the effect here being an <hi>Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive effect,</hi> cannot possibly fail to be where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Matter is, by Axiome 17. especially if there be no externall impediment: And there is no impediment at all, but that the terrestriall parts might regain an activity very nigh equall to the aethereall, or rather never have lost it. For if the Planets had but a common <hi>Dividend</hi> of all the motion which themselves and the Sun and Stars, and all the AEthereall matter possess, (the matter of the Planets being so little in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of that of the Sun, Stars and AEther) the proportion of motion that will fall due to them would be exceeding much above what they have. For it would be as if four or five poor men in a very rich and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous city should, by giving up that estate they have, in a levelling way, get equall
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55765:59"/>
share with all the rest. Wherefore every Planet could not faile of melting it self into little less finer Substance then the purest <hi>AEther.</hi> But they not doing so, it is a signe they have not that Motion nor Agitation of themselves, and therefore rest content with what has extrinsecally accrued to them, be it less or more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the pugnacious, to evade the stroke of our Dilemma, will make any bold shift, and though they affront their own faculties in saying so, yet they will say, and must say, That part of the Matter is self-moving, part without motion of it self.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But to this I answer, That first this evasion of theirs is not so agreeable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; but, so far as either our Sense or Reason can reach, there is the same Matter every where. For consider the <hi>subtilest parts of Matter</hi> discoverable here below, those which for their Subtilty are invisible, and for their Activity wonderfull, I mean those particles that cause that vehement agitation we fell in <hi>Windes:</hi> They in time loose their motion, become of a visible va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous consistency, and turn to Clouds, then to Snow or Rain, after haply to Ice it self; but then in process of time, first melted into Water, then exhaled into

Vapours, after more fiercely agitated, do become Wind again. And that we may not think that this Reciprocation into <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> belongs onely to <hi>Terrestriall</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; that the <hi>Heavens</hi> themselves be of the same Matter, is apparent from the Ejections of <hi>Comets</hi> into our <hi>Vortex,</hi> and the perpetuall rising of those Spots and Scum upon the Face of the Sun.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But secondly, to return what is still more pungent. This <hi>Matter</hi> that is <hi>Self-moved,</hi> in the impressing of Motion upon other Matter, either looses of its own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or retains it still entire. If the first, it may be despoiled of all its motion: And so that whose immediate nature is to <hi>move,</hi> shall <hi>rest,</hi> the entire cause of its motion still remaining, viz. it self: which is a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction by Axiome 17. If the second, no meaner an inconvenience then this will follow, that the whole world had been tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into pure AEther by this time, if not into a perfect flame, or at least will be in the conclusion, to the utter destruction of all corporeall Consistencies. For, that these <hi>Self-moving parts of Matter</hi> are of a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable copiousness, the event does testify, they having melted almost all the world already into <hi>Suns, Stars</hi> and <hi>AEther,</hi> nothing remaining but Planets and Comets to be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55765:60"/>
dissolved: Which all put together scarce beare so great a proportion to the rest of the Matter of the Universe, as an ordinary apple to the ball of the Earth. Wherefore so potent a Principle of Motion still adding new motion to Matter, and no motion once communicated being lost, (for according to the laws of motion, no Body looses any more motion then it communicates to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other) it plainly follows, that either the world had been utterly burnt up ere now, or will be at least in an infinite less time then it has existed, nay, I may say absolutely in a very little time, and will never return to any frame of things again, which though it possibly may be, yet none but a mad-man will assert, by Axiome 2. And that it has not yet been since the first <hi>Epoches</hi> of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is a Demonstration this second Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis is false.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is yet another Evasion or two, which when they are answered there will be no scruple remaining touching this point. The first is, That the Matter is all of it homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall, of the like nature every where, and that it is the common property of it all to be of it self indifferent to <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Rest;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it is no wonder that some of it moves and other some of it <hi>rests,</hi> or <hi>moves</hi> less then other some. To which I answer, That
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55765:60"/>
this Indifferency of the <hi>Matter</hi> to <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Rest</hi> may be understood two wayes: Either <hi>privatively,</hi> that is to say, That it has not any reall or active propension to <hi>Rest,</hi> more then to <hi>Motion,</hi> or <hi>vice versâ,</hi> but is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passive and susceptive of what Motion or Fixation some other Agent confers upon it, and keeps that modification exactly and perpetually till again some other Agent change it; (in which sense I allow the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion to be true, but it makes nothing against us, but for us, it plainly implying that there is an <hi>Incorporeal Substance</hi> distinct from the <hi>Matter,</hi> from whence the <hi>Matter</hi> both is and must be moved.) Or else, this Indifferency is to be understood <hi>positively,</hi> that is to say, That the Matter has a reall and active propension as well to <hi>Motion</hi> as to <hi>Rest,</hi> so that it moveth it self and fixeth it self from its own immediate nature: From whence there are but these two Absurdities that follow: the first, That two absolutely contrary properties are immediately seated in one simple Subject; then which nothing can seem more harsh and unhandsome to our Logicall faculties; unless the second, which is, That <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> being thus the emanative effects of this one simple Subject, the Matter will both move and rest at once; or, if they doe not understand
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55765:61"/>
by <hi>Rest,</hi> Fixation, but a meer absence of motion, That it will both move and not move at once. For what is immediate to any Subject, will not cease to be, the Subject not being destroyed, by Axiome 17. Nor will they much help themselves by fancying that Matter necessarily exerting both these immediate powers or properties at once of <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> moves her self to such a measure and no swifter. For this position is but coincident with the second member of the Dilemma, Sect. 3. of this Chapter; and therefore the same Argument will serve for both places. The other Evasion is, by supposing part of the Matter to be <hi>Self-moving,</hi> and part of it <hi>Self-resting,</hi> in a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sense, or <hi>Self-fixing:</hi> Which is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly directed against what we have argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sect. 6. But that this supposition is false is manifest from experience. For if there be any such <hi>Self-fixing</hi> parts of Matter, they are certainly in Gold and Lead and such like Metalls; but it is plain that they are not there. For what is <hi>Self-fixing,</hi> will immediately be reduced to Rest, so soon as externall violence is taken off, by Axiome 17. Whence it will follow that though these <hi>Self-fixing parts of Matter</hi> may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by other matter while they are made fast to it, yet left free they will suddainly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55765:61"/>
rest, they having the immediate cause of Fixation in themselves. Nor can any one distrust that the change will be so suddain, if he consider how suddainly an externall force puts Matter upon motion. But a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of gold or lead put thus upon motion, swift or slow, does not suddainly reduce it self to rest. Whence it plainly appears that this last Evasion contradicts Experience, and therefore has no force against our former Arguments.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wherefore it is most rationall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That Matter of its own Nature has no active Principle of Motion, though it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive thereof, but that when God created it, he superadded an impress of Motion upon it, such a measure and proportion to all of it, which remains still much-what the same for quantity in the whole, though the parts of Matter in their various occursion of one to another have not alwayes the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of it. Nor is there any more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that God should reiterate this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press of Motion on the Matter created, then that he should perpetually create the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neither does his conservation of this quantity of Motion any thing more imply either a repetition or an augmentation of it, then the conservation of the Matter does the superaddition of new Matter thereunto.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55765:62"/>
Indeed he need but conserve the Matter, and the Matter thus conserved will faithfully retain, one part with another, the whole summe of Motion first communicated to it, some small moments excepted, which are not worth the mentioning in this place.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE have discovered out of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Existence of some Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall Essence distinct from the Matter: But there is a further assurance of this Truth, from the consideration of the Order and admirable Effect of this Motion in the world. Suppose Matter could move it self, would meere Matter, with Self-motion, amount to that admirable wise contrivance of things
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55765:62"/>
which we see in the world? Can a blind <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi> produce such effects, with that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and constancy, that, the more wise a man is, the more he will be assured <hi>That no Wisdome can adde, take away, or alter any thing in the workes of Nature, whereby they may be bettered?</hi> How can that therefore that has not so much as <hi>Sense,</hi> arise to the effects of the highest pitch of <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect?</hi> But of this I have spoke so fully and convincingly in the second Book of my <hi>Antidote,</hi> that it will be but a needless repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to proceed any further on this Subject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the evasion that I can imagine our Adversaries may use here, will be this: That Matter is capable of Sense, and the finest and most subtil of the most refined Sense, and consequently of Imagination too, yea haply of Reason and Understanding. For <hi>Sense</hi> being nothing else, as some conceit, but <hi>Motion,</hi> or rather <hi>Reaction</hi> of a Body pressed upon by another Body, it will follow that all the Matter in the world has in some manner or other the power of Sensation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us see now what this Position will amount to: Those that make <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Sensation</hi> thus really the same, they must of necessity acknowledg that no longer Motion no longer Sensation, as <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> has ingenuously confessed Physic. Chap. 25.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55765:63"/>
And that every <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Reaction</hi> must be a new Sensation, as well as every ceasing of Reaction a ceasing of Sensation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now let us give these busie active particles of the Matter that play up and down every where the advantage of Sense, and let us see if all their heads laid together can contrive the Anatomicall fabrick of any Creature that lives. Assuredly when all is summ'd up that can be imagined, they will fall short of their account. For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, has every one of these particles that must have an hand in the framing of the Body of an Animal, the whole design of the work by the impress of some Phantasme upon it, or, as they have severall offices, so have they severall parts of the design? If the first, it being most certain, even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their opinion whom we oppose, that there can be no knowledg nor percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Matter, but what arises out of the Reaction of one part against another, how is it conceivable that any one particle of Matter or many together (there not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting yet in Nature any Animal) can have the Idea impressed of that Creature they are to frame? Or if one or some few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have the sense of one part of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal (they seeming more capable of this, the parts being far more simple then the whole
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55765:63"/>
                  <hi>Compages</hi> and contrivement) and other some few of other parts; how can they confer notes? by what language or speech can they communicate their counsell one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? Wherefore that they should mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually serve one another in such a design, is more impossible, then that so many men blind and dumb from their nativity should joyn their forces and wits together to build a Castle, or carve a Statue of such a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as none of them knew any more of in several, then some one of the smallest parts thereof, but not the relation it bore to the whole.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Besides this, <hi>Sense</hi> being really the same with Corporeal Motion, it must change upon new impresses of Motion, so that if a particle by Sense were carried in this line, it meeting with a counterbuffe in the way, must have quite another Impress and Sense, and so forget what it was going about, and divert its course another way. Nay though it scaped free, Sense being Reaction, when that which it beares against is removed, Sense must needs cease, and perfect Oblivion succeed. For it is not with these particles as with the Spring of a Watch, or a bent Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, that they should for a considerable time retain the same Reaction, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the same Sense. And lastly, if
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55765:64"/>
they could, it is still nothing to the purpose; for let their Sense be what it will, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is necessary, it being meerly corporeall, and therefore the result of their motion cannot be from any kind of knowledg. For the corporeall motion is first, and is onely felt, not directed by feeling. And therefore whether the Matter have any Sense or no, what is made out of it is nothing but what results from the wild jumblings and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of one part thereof against another, without any purpose, counsell or direction. Wherefore the ordinary <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being guided according to the most<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Exquisite Wisdome imaginable, it is plain that they are not the effects of the meer motion of <hi>Matter,</hi> but of some <hi>Immateriall</hi> Principle, by Axiome 10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And therefore the Ignorance of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Causes is not so rightly said to be the Seed of <hi>Religion,</hi> (as <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> would have it) as of <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Atheisme.</hi> For if we did more punctually and particularly search into their natures, we should clearly discern their insufficiency for such effects as we discover to be in the world. But when we have looked so closely and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into the nature of Corporeall Beings, and can finde no Causality in them propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to these Effects we speak of, still
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55765:64"/>
to implead our selves rather of Ignorance, then the Matter and Corporeall motion of Insufficiency, is to hold an opinion upon humour, and to transgress against our first and second Axiomes.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THE Third and last ground which I would make use of, for evincing the Existence of Incorporeall Substances, is such extraordinary effects as we cannot well imagine any naturall, but must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some free or spontaneous Agent to be the Cause thereof, when as yet it is clear
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55765:65"/>
that they are from neither Man nor Beast. Such are speakings, knockings, opening of doores when they were fast shut, sudden lights in the midst of a room floating in the aire, and then passing and vanishing; nay, shapes of Men and severall sorts of Brutes, that after speech and converse have suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disappeared. These and many such like extraordinary effects (which, if you please, you may call by one generall terme of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions)</hi> seem to me to be an undeniable Argument, that there be such things as <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>Incorporeall Substances</hi> in the world; and I have demonstrated the sequel to be necessary in the last Chapter of the <hi>Appendix to my Treatise against Atheisme;</hi> and in the third Book of that Treatise have produced so many and so unexceptionable storyes concerning <hi>Apparitions,</hi> that I hold it superfluous to adde any thing here of that kind, taking far more pleasure in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising of my Reason then in registring of History. Besides that I have made so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full choice there already, that I cannot hope to cull out any that may prove more pertinent or convictive; I having pen'd down none but such as I had compared with those severe lawes I set my self in the first Chapter of that third Book, to prevent all tergiversations and evasions of gain-sayers.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:55765:65"/>
2. But, partly out of my own observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and partly by information from others, I am well assured there are but two wayes whereby they escape the force of such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent narrations. The first is a firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion that the very notion of a <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Immateriall</hi> Substance is an Impossibility or Contradiction in the very termes. And therefore such stories implying that which they are confident is impossible, the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the very first hearing must needs be judged to be false, and therefore they think it more reasonable to conclude all those that profess they have seen such or such things to be mad-men or cheats, then to give credit to what implyes a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But this Evasion I have quite taken away, by so clearly demonstrating that the notion of a Spirit implies no more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction then the notion of Matter; and that its Attributes are as conceivable as the Attributes of Matter: so that I hope this creep-hole is stopt for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The second Evasion is not properly an evasion of the truth of these stories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Apparitions,</hi> but of our deduction therefrom. For they willingly admit of these <hi>Apparitions</hi> and <hi>Prodigies</hi> recorded in History, but they deny that they are any
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55765:66"/>
Arguments of a truly Spirituall and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall Substance distinct from the Matter thus changed into this or that shape, that can walk and speak, &amp;c. but that they are speciall effects of the influence of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodyes upon this region of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Corruption.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And these that answer thus are of two sorts. The one have great Affinity with <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Avenroes,</hi> who look not upon the Heavenly Bodies as meer Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall Substances, but as actuated with Intelligencies, which are Essences separate and Immateriall. But this Supposition hurts not us at all in our present design; they granting that which I am arguing for, viz. a Substance Incorporeall. The use of this perverse Hypothesis is only to shuffle off all Arguments that are drawn from <hi>Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to prove that the Souls of men subsist after death, or that there are any such things as <hi>Daemons</hi> or <hi>Genii</hi> of a nature permanent and immortall. But I look upon this Supposition as confutable enough, were it worth the while to encounter it. That of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> is far more firm, they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be nothing else but the efficacy of the presence of God altering Matter into this or the other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, or Manifestation; as if there were
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55765:66"/>
but one Soule in all things, and God were that Soule variously working in the Matter. But this I have already confuted in my Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall Poems.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The other <hi>Influenciaries</hi> hold the same power of the Heavens as these; though they do not suppose so high a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in them, yet they think it sufficient for the salving of all Sublunary <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> as well ordinary as extraordinary. Truly it is a very venerable <hi>Secret,</hi> and not to be uttered or communicated but by some old <hi>Silenus</hi> lying in his obscure Grot or Cave, nor that neither but upon due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and in a right humour, when one may find him with his veins swell'd out with wine, and his Garland faln off from his head through his heedless drousiness: then if some young <hi>Chromis</hi> and <hi>Mnasylus,</hi> especially assisted by a fair and forward <hi>AEgle,</hi> that by way of a love-srollick will leave the tracts of her fingers in the blood of Mulberies on the temples and forehead of this aged Satyre, while he sleeps dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, and will not seem to see for fear he forfeit the pleasure of his feeling; then, I say, if these young lads importune him enough, he will again sing that old song of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean</hi> Philosophy, in an higher strain then ever, which I profess I should abhor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55765:67"/>
were it not to confute; it is so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and impious. But because no sore can be cured that is concealed, I must bring this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> into view also, which the Poet has briefly comprised in this summary.

And therefore these <hi>Celestiall powers</hi> being able to frame living shapes of earthly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the impress of their Imagination, it will be more easy for them to change the vaporous Aire into like transfigurations.

to be true that are recorded in Writers, it is no Argument of the Existence of any <hi>Incorporeall</hi> Principle in the world.

                  <p>1. That the Splendor of the Celestiall Bodies proves no Fore-sight nor Soveraignty that they have over us. 2. That the Stars can have no knowledg of us, Mathematically demonstrated. 3. The same Conclusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain demonstrated more familiarly. 4.

Principles laid down for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring that Conclusion. 7. A demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he cannot see us. 8. That he can have no other kind of knowledg of us, nor of the frame of any Animall on Earth. 9. That though the Sun had the knowledg of the right frame of an Animal, he could not transmit it into Terrestriall matter. 10. An Answer to that Instance of the Signature of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> 11. 12. Further Answers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. 13.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THat the <hi>Light</hi> is a very glorious thing, and the lustre of the <hi>Stars</hi> very lovely to look upon, and that the Body of the <hi>Sun</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55765:69"/>
is so full of splendour and Majesty, that without flattery we may profess our selves constrained to look aside, as not being able to bear the brightness of his aspect; all this must be acknowledged for Truth: but that these are as so many Eyes of Heaven to watch over the Earth, so many kinde and carefull Spectators and intermedlers also in humane affairs, as that phansifull Chymist <hi>Paracelsus</hi> conceits, who writeth that not onely Princes and Nobles, or men of great and singular worth, but even almost every one, near his death has some prognostick sign or other (as knockings in the house, the dances of dead men, and the like) from these compassionate Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers of his approaching Fate; this I must confess I am not so paganly Superstitious as to believe one syllable of, but think it may be demonstrated to be a meer fancy, especially upon this present Hypothesis, That the Sun and Stars have no immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Being residing in them, but are meer Matter consisting of the subtilest Particles and most vehemently agitated. For then we cannot but be assured that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them more Divine then what is seen in other things that shine in the dark, suppose rotten wood, glo-worms, or the flame of a rush-candle.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:55765:69"/>
2. This at least we will demonstrate, That let the Sun and Stars have what knowledg they will of other things, they have just none at all of us, nor of our affairs; which will quite take away this last Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. That the Stars can have no knowledg of us is exceeding evident. For whenas the <hi>Magnus Orbis</hi> of the Earth is but as a Point compared with the distance thereof to a fixed Star, that is to say, when as that Angle which we may imagine to be drawn from a Star, and to be subtended by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of the <hi>Magnus Orbis,</hi> is to Sense no Angle at all, but as a meer Line; how little then is the Earth it self? and how utterly invisible to any Star, when as her Diameter is above 1100. times less then that of her <hi>Magnus Orbis?</hi> From whence it is clear that it is perfectly impossible that the <hi>Stars,</hi> though they were endued with sight, could so much as see the <hi>Earth</hi> it self, (much less the inhabitants thereof) to be <hi>Spectators</hi> and <hi>Intermedlers</hi> in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires for good or evil; and there being no higher Principle to inspire them with the knowledg of these things, it is evident that they remain utterly ignorant of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or if this Demonstration (though undeniably true in it self) be not so intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible to every one, we may adde what is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55765:70"/>
more easy and familiar, viz. That the Stars being lucid Bodies, and those of the first magnitude near an hundred times bigger then the Earth, and yet appearing so small things to us, hence any one may collect, that the opake Earth will either be quite invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the Stars, or else at least appear so little, that it will be impossible that they should see any distinct Countries, much less Cities, Houses, or Inhabitants.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore we have plainly swept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this numerous Company of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall Senators from having any thing to doe to consult about, or any way to oversee the affairs of Mankind; and therefore let them seem to wink and twinkle as cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundly as they will, we may rest in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they have no plot concerning us, either for good or evill, as having no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of us. Nor if they had, could they communicate their thoughts to that great deemed Soveraign of the world, the <hi>Sun;</hi> they being ever as invisible to him, as they are to us in the day time. For it is nothing but his light that hinders us from seeing so feeble Objects, and this hindrance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in nothing else but this, That that motion which by his Rayes is caused in the Organ is so fierce and violent, that the gentle vibration of the light of the Stars
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55765:70"/>
cannot master it, nor indeed bear any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable proportion to it: What then can it do in reference to the very Body of the Sun himself, the matter whereof has the most furious motion of any thing in the world?</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is nothing now therefore left, but the Sun alone, that can possibly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have any knowledg of, or any superintendency over our terrestriall affairs. And how uncapable he is also of this office, I hold it no difficult thing to demonstrate. Whence it will plainly appear, that those <hi>Apparitions</hi> that are seen, whether in the Aire or on Earth (which are rightly looked upon as an Argument of Providence and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of some Incorporeall Essence in the world) cannot be attributed to the power and prevision of the Sun, supposing him purely corporeall.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For it is a thing agreed upon by all sides, That meer <hi>Matter</hi> has no <hi>connate Ideas</hi> in it of such things as we see in the world; but that upon Reaction of one part moved by another arises a kind of Sense, or Perception. Which opinion as it is most rationall in it self to conceive (supposing <hi>Matter</hi> has any sense in it at all) so it is most consonant to experience, we seeing plainly that Sense is ever caused by some outward
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55765:71"/>
corporeall motion upon our Organs, which are also corporeall. For that <hi>Light</hi> is from a corporeal motion, is plain from the reflexion of the rayes there of, and no Sound is heard but from the motion of the Aire or some other intermediate Body; no Voice but there is first a moving of the tongue; no Musick but there must either be the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wind, or the striking upon strings, or something Analogicall to these, and so in the other Senses. Wherefore if there be nothing but Body in the world, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Sense arises meerly from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one part of Matter against another, and that Motion is ever first, and perception followes, and that therefore perception must necessarily follow the laws of Motion, and that no <hi>Percipient</hi> can have any thing more to conceive then what is conveighed by corporeall motion. Now from these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples it will be easy to prove that, though we should acknowledg a power of percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Sun, yet it will not amount to any ability of his being either a Spectator, or Governor of our affairs here on Earth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. According to the Computation o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Astronomers,</hi> even of those that speak more modestly, the <hi>Sun</hi> is bigger then the <hi>Earth</hi> above an hundred and fifty times. But how little he appears to us every eye is able to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55765:71"/>
judge. How little then must the <hi>Earth</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him? If he see her at all, he will be so far from being able to take notice of any Persons or Families, that he cannot have any distinct discerning of Streets, nor Cities, no not of Fields, nor Countries; but whole Regions, though of very great Extent, will vanish here, as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> his Patrimony, in that Map of the world <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> shewed him, to repress the pride of the young Heire. The <hi>Earth</hi> must appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably less to him then the <hi>Moon</hi> does to us, because the <hi>Sun</hi> appears to us less then the <hi>Moon.</hi> It were easy to demonstrate that her <hi>discus</hi> would appear to the Sun near thirty, nay sixty times less then the Moon does to us, according to <hi>Lansbergius</hi> his computation. Now consider how little we can discern in that broader Object of sight, the <hi>Moon,</hi> when she is the nighest, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we be placed in the dark, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shadow of the <hi>Earth,</hi> whereby our sight is more passive and impressible. How little then must the fiery eye of that <hi>Cyclops</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is all Flame and Light, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in this lesser Object the <hi>Earth,</hi> his vigour and motion being so vehemently strong and unyielding? What effect it will have upon him, we may in some sort judge by our selves; For though our Organ be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55765:72"/>
but moved or agitated with the reflection of his Rayes, we hardly see the Moon when she is above the Horizon by day: What impress then can our Earth, a less Object to him then the Moon is to us, make upon the Sun, whose Body is so furiously hot, that he is as boyling Fire, if a man may so speak, and the Spots about him are, as it were, the scum of this fuming Cauldron? Besides that our <hi>Atmosphere</hi> is so thick a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering over us at that distance, that there can be the appearance of nothing but a white mist enveloping all and shining like a bright cloud; in which the rayes of the Sun will be so lost, that they can never return any distinct representation of things unto him. Wherefore it is as evident to Reason that he cannot see us, as it is to Sense that we see him; and therefore he can be no <hi>Overseer</hi> nor <hi>Intermedler</hi> in our actions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But perhaps you will reply That though the Sun cannot see the Earth, yet he may have a Sense and perception in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (for he is a fine glittering thing, and some strange matter must be presumed of him) that may amount to a wonderfull large sphere of Understanding, Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and Power. But this is a meer fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full surmise, and such as cannot be made good by any of our Faculties: Nay the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55765:72"/>
quite contrary is demonstrable by such Principles as are already agreed upon. For there are no <hi>connate Ideas</hi> in the <hi>Matter,</hi> and therefore out of the collision and agitation of these Solar particles, we cannot ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally expect any other effect in the Sun, then such as we experiment in the percus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our own eyes, out of which ordinarily followes the sense of a confused light or flame. If the Sun therefore has any sense of himself, it must be only the perception of a very vigorous <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Fire,</hi> which being still one and the same representation, it is a question whether he has a sense of it or no, any more then we have of our bones, which we perceive not, by reason of our accustomary and uninterrupted sense of them, as <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> ingeniously conjectures in a like supposition. But if you will say that there is a perception of the jogging or justling, or of what ever touch or rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of one Solar particle against another, the body of the Sun being so exceeding liquid, and consequently the particles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of never resting, but playing and moving this way and that way; they hitting and fridging so fortuitously one against another, the perceptions that arise from hence must be so various and fortuitous, so quick and short, so inconsistent, flitting and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55765:73"/>
that if any man were in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as the Sun necessarily is, according to this Hypothesis, he would both be, and appear to all the world to be, stark mad; he would be so off and on, and so unsetled, and doe, and think, and speak all things with such ungovernable rashness and teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In brief, that the Sun by this tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous agitation of his <hi>fiery Atoms,</hi> should hit upon any rationall contrivance or right Idea of any of these living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we see here on Earth, is utterly as hard to conceive, as that the Terrestriall particles themselves should justle together into such contrivances and formes, which is that which I have already sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And if the Sun could light on any such true frame or forme of any Animall, or the due rudiments or contrivance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is yet unconceivable how he should conveigh it into this Region of Generation here on Earth, partly by reason of the Earths Distance and Invisibleness, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because the deepest Principle of all being but meer Motion, without any superior power to govern it, this imagination of the Sun working on the Earth can be but a simple <hi>Rectilinear</hi> impress, which can never arise to such an inward solid organization
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55765:73"/>
of parts in living Creatures, nor hold toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these <hi>Spectres</hi> or <hi>Apparitions</hi> in the Aire, in any more certain form then the smoak of chymnies, or the fume of Tobacco.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Nor is that instance of the power of the Mothers fancy on the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the womb, any more then a meer flourish; for the disparity is so great, that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proves just nothing: For whereas the Mother has an Explicite Idea of the <hi>Foetus</hi> and every part thereof, the Sun and Stars have no distinct Idea at all of the parts of the Earth; nay I dare say that what we have already intimated will amount to a Demonstration, That though they had Sense, yet they do not so much as know whether this Earth we live on be <hi>in rerum Naturá</hi> or no.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Again, the mark that is impressed on the <hi>Foetus,</hi> the Mother has a clear and vivid conception of; but the curious contrivance in the Idea of Animals, I have shewn how incompetible it is to the fortuitous justling of the fiery particles of either Sun or Stars.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Thirdly, the impress on the <hi>Foetus</hi> is very simple and slight, and seldome so curious as the ordinary impresses of Seals upon Wax, which are but the modifications of the surface thereof; but this supposed impress of the Imagination of the Sun and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55765:74"/>
Stars is more then a solid Statue, or the most curious <hi>Automaton</hi> that ever was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the wit of man; and therefore impossible to proceed from a meer <hi>Rectili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>near</hi> impress upon the <hi>AEther</hi> down to the Earth from the Imagination of the Sun, no not if he were supposed to be actuated with an Intelligent Soule, if the Earth and all the space betwixt her and him were devoid thereof. Nor do I conceive, though it be an infinitely more slight business, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Signature of the <hi>Foetus</hi> upon such a part were to be performed by the Fancy of the Mother, notwithstanding the advantage of the organization of her body, were not both her self and the <hi>Foetus</hi> anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Creatures.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Wherefore we have demonstrated beyond all Evasion, from the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Universe, That of necessity there must be such a thing in the world as <hi>Incorporeall Substance;</hi> let inconsiderable Philosopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hoot at it, and deride it as much as their Follies please.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. TO this Truth <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> sets his seale with all willingness imaginable, or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55765:77"/>
rather eagerness, as also his followers, they stoutly contending that we have not the perception of any thing but the Phantasmes of materiall Objects, and of sensible words or Markes, which we make to stand for such and such Objects. Which certainly would be most true if there were nothing but <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the world; so that they speak very consonantly to their own Principles: I say, this is not only true in that School, but also rationall in it self, supposing nothing but <hi>Matter</hi> in the world, and that <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Reaction</hi> is really one. For that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action being in Brutes as well as in Men, there must not be any difference by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of quite another kind, but by an externall way of communication of their perceptions. And therefore the distinction betwixt Men and Beasts must consist onely in this, that the one can agree in some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mark, whether <hi>Voices</hi> or <hi>Characters,</hi> or whatever else, to express their perceptions, but the other cannot; but the perceptions themselves must be of one kind in both, they neither of them perceiving any thing but corporeall impressions, such as they feel by the parts of the Matter bearing one against another.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The distinct Impression of any considerable extent of variegated Matter cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a meer point of Matter.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="6">6. BY <hi>a meer point of Matter</hi> I doe not mean a meer Mathematicall point, but a <hi>perfect Parvitude,</hi> or the <hi>least Reality</hi> of which Matter can consist, concerning which I have already spoke Lib. 1. Cap. 6. This being the least quantity that discerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matter can consist of, no particle of Matter can touch it less then it self. This Parvitude therefore that is so little that it has properly no integrall parts, really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishable, how can it possibly be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject distinctly receptive of the view, haply, of half an Horizon at once? which sight is caused by reall and distinct motion from reall distinct parts of the Object that is seen.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I acknowledg indeed that the Pupill of the Eye is but small in comparison of those vast Objects that are seen through it, as also that through a Hole exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much less, made suppose in brass or lead, large Objects are transmitted very clearly; but I have observed with all that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55765:78"/>
you may lessen the hole so far, that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded day at noon will look more obscure then an ordinary moon-shine night. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nature has bounds, and reducing her to the least measure imaginable, the effect must prove insensible.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Again, this Object we speak of may be so variegated, I mean with such colours, that it may imply a contradiction, that one and the same particle of Matter (suppose some very small round one, that shall be the Cuspe of the visuall Pyramide or Cone) should receive them all at once; the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite kindes of those colours being uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to this round particle, otherwise then by contrarietie of Motions, or by Rest and Motion, which are as contrary; as is manifest out of that excellent Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem concerning Colours in <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his <hi>Meteors,</hi> which if it were possible to be false, yet it is most certainly true, that seeing Motion is the cause of Sight, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Objects for Colour must arise out of contrary modifications of Motion in this particle we speak of, that immediatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates the <hi>Object</hi> to the <hi>Sentient:</hi> which contrariety of Motions at the same time and within the same surface of the adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate place of a Body is utterly incompeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereto.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:55765:78"/>
9. Nor is that Evasion any thing avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That there is not any contrariety of reall Motion here, but that there is onely endeavour to Motion: For it is plain that Endeavour is as reall as Motion it self, and as contrary, because it does really affect the sight, and in a contrary manner. Besides, this Endeavour toward Motion is Motion it self, though of an exceeding small progress: But be it as little as it will, it is as great a contradiction, for example, <figure/> that the Globe A. should upon the same centre, and within the same superficies (which is its adaequate place according to the meaning of that Notion in <hi>Aristotles</hi> Schoole) be turned never so little from C. to B. and from B. to C. at once, as to be turned quite about in that manner. To which you may adde that some Colours imply the ones Motion, and the others Rest; but a Globe if it rest in any one part from turning, rests in all. From whence it will follow, That it is impossible to see <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>Black</hi> at once.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. This Subterfuge therefore being thus clearly taken away, they substitute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, viz. That the distinct parts of the Object doe not act upon this round particle, which is the Cuspe of the visuall Pyramide,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55765:79"/>
at once, but successively, and so swiftly, that the Object is represented at once; as when one swings about a fire-stick very fast, it seems one continued circle of fire. But we shall find this instance very little to the purpose, if we consider, that when one swings a fire-stick in a circle, it describes such a circle in the bottome of the Eye, not upon one point there, but in a considerable distance; and that the Optick Nerve, or the Spirits therein, are touched successively, but left free to a kind of <hi>Tremor</hi> or <hi>Vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as it were, (so as it is in the playing of a Lute) till the motion has gone round, and then touches in the same place again, so quick, that it findes it still vigorously moved: But there being but one particle to touch upon here, some such like inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will recurre as we noted in the former case.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For, as I demonstrated before, that some Colours cannot be communicated at once to one and the same round particle of Matter; so from thence it will follow here, That, such Colours succeeding one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the impress of the one will take off immediatly the impress of the other; from whence we shall not be able to see such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Colours as are discernible in a very large Object at once. For unless the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55765:79"/>
make some considerable stay upon that which receives it, there is no Sensation; insomuch that a man may wag his finger so fast that he can scarce see it: and if it doe make a due stay, suppose a large Object checkered with the most opposite Colours, it were impossible that we should see that checker-work at once in so large a compass as we doe, but we shall onely see it by parts, the parts vanishing and coming again in a competent swiftness, but very discernible.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Again; If we could possibly imagine the vicissitudes of the impresses, from the distinct parts of the Basis of the visuall Cone to the point of it, which we will suppose to be a very <figure/> small <hi>globulus,</hi> such as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his second element consists of, it being thus successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrust against, things must then be as I have represented them in the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing figure, where C. A. is the Object, G. H. the Sentient Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I. the <hi>Globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> which will be born from E. directly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55765:80"/>
toward F. where there will be received such a colour in the <hi>least Reality</hi> of the Sentient Matter in F. but from A. it will be borne towards B. and with a very short rowling touch in another <hi>Reality,</hi> or it may be more distantly from F. and impress such a colour from A. upon B. or thereabout, and so from C. upon D. so that hereby also it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that no one <hi>perfect Parvitude</hi> receives the whole Object C. E. A.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Lastly, this quick vicissitude of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse or impression would contaminate all the Colours, and make the whole Object as it were of one confounded colour, as a man may easily perceive in a painted Wheel; For what is it but a quick coming on of one colour upon the same part of the Optick nerve, upon which another was, immediately that makes the whole Wheel seem of one blended colour? But not to impose upon any one, this instance of the Wheel has a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar advantage above this present Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for making all seem one confounded colour, because the colours of the Wheel come not onely upon one and the same part of the Nerve, but in one and the same line from the Object; so that in this regard the instance is less accommodate. But it is shreudly probable, that fluid perceptive Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not fail to find the colours tinctured
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55765:80"/>
from one another in some measure in the whole Object here also, by reason of the instability of that particle that is plaied upon from all parts thereof. At least it is an unexceptionable confirmation of our first Demonstration of the weakness of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Evasion, from the necessity of a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable stay upon the percipient Matter, and that Sensation cannot be but with some leisurely continuance of this or that Motion before it be wiped out. We might adde also that there ought to be a due perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the Object that presses against the Organ, though no new impression suddenly succeeded to wipe out the former, as one may experiment in swiftly swinging about a painted Bullet in a string, which will still more fully confirme what we aime at. But this is more then enough for the making good of this 24. Axiome; whose evidence is so clear of it self, that I believe there are very few but will be convinced of it at the first sight.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE have now made our addition of such Axiomes as are most usefull for our present purpose. Let us therefore, according to the order we propounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55765:82"/>
we consider the fabrick and organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, see if <hi>such Operations</hi> as we find in our selves be competible to <hi>Matter</hi> looked upon in a more generall manner. That <hi>Matter</hi> from its own nature is uncapable of <hi>Sense,</hi> plainly appears from Axiome 20. &amp; 21. For <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> being really one and the same thing, it will necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that where ever there is <hi>Motion,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially any considerable duration thereof, there must be <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Perception:</hi> Which is contrary to what we find in a <hi>Catochus,</hi> and experience daily in dead Carkasses; in both which, though there be <hi>Reaction,</hi> yet there is no <hi>Sense.</hi> In brief, if any Matter have Sense, it will follow that upon <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi> all shall have the like, and that a Bell while it is ringing, and a Bow while it is bent, and every Jack-in-a-box that School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes play with, while it is held in by the cover pressing against it, shall be living Animals, or Sensitive Creatures. A thing so foolish and frivolous, that the meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall of the opinion may well be thought confutation enough with the sober. And indeed <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> himself, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve <hi>Sense</hi> meerly into <hi>Reaction</hi> of Matter, yet is ashamed of these odd consequences thereof, and is very loth to be reckoned in the company of those Philosophers,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55765:82"/>
(though, as he sayes, learned men) who have maintained that all Bodies are endued with Sense, and yet he can hardly abstain from saying that they are; onely he is more shie of allowing them <hi>Memory,</hi> which yet they will have whether he will or no, if he give them <hi>Sense.</hi> As for Example, in the ringing of a Bell, from every stroak there continues a <hi>tremor</hi> in the Bell, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying, must according to his Philosophie be <hi>Imagination,</hi> and referring to the stroak past must be <hi>Memory;</hi> and if a stroak over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it within the compass of this Memory, what hinders but <hi>Discrimination</hi> or <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may follow? But the conclusion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant enough to this absurd Principle, That there is nothing but Matter in the Universe, and that it is capable of perception. See <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his Elements of Philos. Chap. 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But we will not content our selves onely with the discovery of this one ugly inconvenience of this bold Assertion, but shall further endeavour to shew that the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis is false, and that <hi>Matter</hi> is utterly <hi>uncapable</hi> of <hi>such operations</hi> as we find in our selves, and that therefore there is <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in us Immateriall</hi> or <hi>Incorporeall.</hi> For we finde in our selves, that one and the same thing both heares, and sees, and tasts, and, to be short, perceives all the variety of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55765:83"/>
Objects that Nature manifests unto us. Wherefore Sense being nothing but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press of corporeall motion from Objects without, that part of Matter which must be the common <hi>Sensorium,</hi> must of necessity receive all that diversity of impulsions from Objects; it must likewise Imagine, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Reason, and be the fountain of sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Motion, as also the Seat of what the Greeks call the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>liberty of Will:</hi> Which supposition we shall finde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in unextricable difficulties.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For first, we cannot conceive of any <hi>Portion</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> but it is either <hi>Hard</hi> or <hi>Soft.</hi> As for that which is <hi>Hard,</hi> all men leave it out as utterly unlike to be endued with such Cognitive faculties as we are conscious to our selves of. That which is <hi>Soft</hi> will prove either <hi>opake, pellucid,</hi> or <hi>lucid.</hi> If <hi>opake,</hi> it cannot see, the exterior superficies being a bar to the inward parts. If <hi>pellucid,</hi> as <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> then indeed it will admit inwardly these <hi>Particles</hi> and that <hi>Motion</hi> which are the conveighers of the Sense, and distinction of <hi>Colours;</hi> and <hi>Sound</hi> also will penetrate. But this <hi>Matter</hi> being heterogeneall, that is to say consisting of parts of a different nature and office, the <hi>Aire,</hi> suppose, being proper for <hi>Sound,</hi> and those <hi>Round particles</hi> which <hi>Cartesius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55765:83"/>
for <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Light;</hi> the perception of these Objects will be differently lodged; but there is some one thing in us that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives both. Lastly, if <hi>lucid,</hi> there would be much-what the same inconvenience that there is in the <hi>opake,</hi> for its own fieriness would fend off the gentle touch of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall impresses; or if it be so milde and thin that it is in some measure diaphanous, the inconveniences will again recurre that were found in the <hi>pellucid.</hi> And in brief, any <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Matter</hi> has such variety of particles in it, that if the Whole, as it must, (being the common <hi>Sensorium)</hi> be affected with any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press from without, the parts thereof must be variously affected, so that no Object will seem homogeneall, as appeares from Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome 22. Which Truth I shall further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate by a homely but very significant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation. Suppose we should put Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Bullets and Spur-rowels in a Box, where they shall lye intermixedly, but close, one with another: upon any jog this Box receives, supposing all the stuffage thereof has Sense, it is evident that the severall things therein must be differently affected, and therefore if the common <hi>Sensorium</hi> were such, there would seem no homogeneall Object in the world. Or at least these severall particles shall be the severall <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptives</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:55765:84"/>
of the severall motions of the same kinde from without, as the Aire of Sounds, the <hi>Cartesian Globuli</hi> of Light and Colours. But what receives all these, and so can judge of them all, we are again at a loss for, as before: unless we imagine it some very fine and <hi>subtill</hi> Matter, so <hi>light</hi> and <hi>thinne,</hi> that it feels not it self, but so <hi>yielding</hi> and <hi>passive,</hi> that it easily feels the several as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults and impresses of other Bodies upon it, or in it; which yet would imply, that this Matter alone were <hi>Sensitive,</hi> and the others not; and so it would be granted, that not all <hi>Matter</hi> (no not so much as in <hi>Fluid</hi> Bodies) has <hi>Sense.</hi> Such a tempered Matter as this is analogous to the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> in Man, which, if Matter could be the Soule, were the very Soule of the Body, and <hi>common percipient</hi> of all Motions from within or without, by reason of the tenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, passivity and neare homogeneity and imperceptibility of any change or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the playing together of its own tenuious and light particles; and therefore very fit to receive all manner of impresses from others. Whence we may rationally conclude, That some such <hi>subtile Matter</hi> as this, is either the <hi>Soule,</hi> or her <hi>immediate instrument</hi> for all manner of perceptions. The <hi>latter</hi> whereof I shall prove to be true
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55765:84"/>
in its due place. That the <hi>former</hi> part is false I shall now demonstrate, by proving more stringently, That no <hi>Matter</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is capable of such <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> as we are conscious to our selves of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For concerning that part of Matter which is the Common <hi>Sensorium,</hi> I demand whether some one point of it receive the whole image of the Object, or whether it is wholly received into every point of it, or finally whether the whole <hi>Sensorium</hi> receive the whole image by expanded parts, this part of the <hi>Sensorium</hi> this part of the image, and that part that. If the first, seeing That in us which perceives the externall Object moves also the Body, it will follow, That one little point of Matter will give locall motion to what is innumerable millions of times bigger then it self, of which there cannot be found nor imagined any example in Nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the second, this difficulty presents it self, which also reflects upon the former Position, How so small a point as we speak of should receive the images of so vast, or so various Objects at once, without Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or Confusion; a thing impossible, as is manifest from Axiome 24. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not receiving them, cannot perceive them by Axiome 25. But if every point or particle of this Matter could receive the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55765:85"/>
whole image, which of these innumerable particles, that receive the Image entirely, may be deemed <hi>I my self</hi> that perceive this Image? For if I be all those Points, it will come to pass, especially in a small Object, and very neare at hand, that the line of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse coming to divers and distant Points, it will seem to come as from severall places, and so one Object will necessarily seem a Cluster of Objects. But if I be one of these Points, what becomes of the rest? or <hi>who</hi> are they?</p>
               <p n="6">6. There remains therefore onely the third way, which is that the parts of the image of the Object be received by the parts of this portion of Matter, which is supposed the common <hi>Sensorium.</hi> But this does perfectly contradict experience; for we finde our selves to perceive the whole Object, when in this case nothing could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the whole, every part onely perceiving its part; and therefore there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can judge of the whole. No more then three men, if they were imagined to sing a song of three parts, and none of them should heare any part but his own, could judge of the Harmony of the whole.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As concerning the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Memory,</hi> especially <hi>Memory,</hi> what kinde of matter can be found fit for this
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55765:85"/>
function? If it be <hi>Fluid,</hi> the images of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will be prone to vanish suddainly, as also to be perverted or turned contrary wayes. For example C. a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <figure/> of this fluid Matter receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an impress from B. must feel it as coming from B: but it toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tumbling up and down, as the particles of fluid Matter doe, turnes the side E. F. which received that impress from B. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards L. whence it will feel as if the impress had been from L. for it must feel it as from the place directly opposite to it self: and the same reason will be in other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this fluid Matter, which must needs force a great deal of preposterous confusion both upon the <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Memory.</hi> If it be <hi>Hard,</hi> it will soon be composed to rest, as in a Bell whose tremor is gone in a little time; but we remember things some years together, though we never think of them till the end of that terme.

               <p n="8">8. Lastly, we remember some things, of which there can be no <hi>Signatures</hi> in Matter to represent them, as for example, <hi>Wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Distance.</hi> For as for both of them, there is no note <figure/> can be made in the Matter E. by lines from the two Objects A.

that we have the perception of nothing but what is impressed from corporeall Objects.

naturall Sense of <hi>Remorse of Conscience</hi> is an evident and undeniable witness of. For when a man has done amiss, the paine, grief, or indignation that he raises in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or at least feels raised in him, is of another kind from what we finde from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes or affronts we could not avoid. And that which pinches us and vexes us so severely, is the sense that we have brought such an evill upon our selves, when it was in our power to have avoided it. Now if there be no sense nor perception in us, but what arises from the Reaction of Matter one part against another; whatever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of things, whatever Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Determination we fall upon, it will by Axiome 26. be <hi>purely necessary,</hi> there being upon this Hypothesis no more <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> while we deliberate or conclude, then there is in a paire of scales, which rests as necessarily at last as it moved before.

That the use of it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in Morall conflict. 18. That the Soule is not invincible there neither. 19. That Divine decrees either finde fit Instruments or make them. 20.

Which is sufficient to make good my last Argument against <hi>Mr. Hobbs.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. HIS first Argument runs thus (I will repeat it in his own words, as also the rest of them as they are to be found in his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55765:89"/>
Treatise of <hi>Liberty and Necessity) I conceive,</hi> (saith he) <hi>that nothing taketh beginning from it self, but from the action of some other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate agent without it self; and that therefore, when first a man hath an appetite or Will to something, to which immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had no appetite nor Will, the cause of his Will is not the Will it self, but something else not in his own disposing: So that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is out of controversy, that of voluntary actions the Will is the necessary cause, and by this which is said the Will is also caused by other things, whereof it disposeth not, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that voluntary actions have all of them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary causes, and therefore are necessitated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His second thus, <hi>I hold</hi> (saith he) <hi>that to be a sufficient cause, to which nothing is wanting that is needfull to the producing of the effect: The same also is a necessary cause. For if it be possible that a sufficient cause shall not bring forth the effect, then there wanteth somewhat which was needfull for the producing of it, and so the cause was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; but if it be impossible that a sufficient cause should not produce the effect, then is a sufficient cause a necessary cause, for that is said to produce an effect necessarily that cannot but produce it. Hence it is manifest, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is produced, is produced necessarily. For whatsoever is produced, hath had a sufficient
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55765:89"/>
cause to produce it, or else it had not been.</hi> What followes is either the same, or so closely depending on this, that I need not adde it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third Argument therefore shall be that which he urges from <hi>Future disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> For example, let the case be put of the Weather, 'Tis necessary that to morrow it shall rain, or not rain; <hi>If therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>it be not necessary it shall rain, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary it shall not rain, otherwise there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that the Proposition, It shall rain or not rain, should be true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. His fourth is this, <hi>That the denying of Necessity destroyeth both the Decrees and the Prescience of God Almighty. For whatsoever God hath purposed to bring to pass by man, as an Instrument, or foreseeth shall come to pass, a man, if he have liberty from necessitation, might frustrate, and make not to come to pass; and God should either not foreknow it, and not decree it, or he should foreknow such things shall be as shall never be, and decree that which shall never come to pass.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Entrance into his first Argument is something obscure and ambiguous, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing taketh beginning from it self:</hi> But I shall be as candid and faithfull an Interpreter as I may. If he mean by <hi>beginning,</hi> beginning of <hi>Existence,</hi> it is undoubtedly true, That no Substance, nor Modification of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55765:90"/>
taketh beginning from it self; but this will not infer the Conclusion he drives at. But if he mean, that <hi>Nothing taketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from it self,</hi> of <hi>being otherwise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or modified then before;</hi> he must either understand by <hi>nothing,</hi> no Essence, neither <hi>Spirit</hi> nor <hi>Body,</hi> or no <hi>Modification</hi> of Essence. He cannot mean <hi>Spirit,</hi> as admitting no such thing in the whole comprehension of Nature. If <hi>Body,</hi> it will not infer what he aims at, unless there be nothing but <hi>Body</hi> in the Universe, which is a meer precarious Principle of his, which he beseeches his credulous followers to admit, but he proves it no where, as I have already noted. If by <hi>Modification</hi> he mean the <hi>Modification of Matter</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> that runs still upon the former Principle, That there is nothing but <hi>Body</hi> in the world, and therefore he proves nothing but upon a begg'd Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, and that a false one; as I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where demonstrated. Wherefore the most favourable Interpretation I can make is, That he means by <hi>no thing,</hi> no Essence, nor Modification of Essence, being willing to hide that dearly-hug'd Hypothesis of his (That there is nothing but Body in the world) under so generall and uncertain termes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The words therefore in the other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55765:90"/>
having no pretence to conclude any thing, let us see how far they will prevail in this, taking <hi>no thing,</hi> for <hi>no Essence,</hi> or <hi>no Modification of Essence,</hi> or what will come nearer to the Matter in hand, <hi>no Faculty of</hi> an <hi>Essence.</hi> And from this two-fold meaning, let us examine two Propositions, that will result from thence, viz. <hi>That no Faculty of any Essence can vary its Operation from what it is, but from the action of some other immediate agent without it self;</hi> or, <hi>That no Essence can vary its Modification or Operation by it self, but by the action of some other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Agent without it.</hi> Of which two Propositions the latter seemes the better sense by far, and most naturall. For it is very harsh, and, if truly looked into, as false, to say, <hi>That the Mode or Faculty of any Essence changes it self,</hi> for it is the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence it self that exerts it self into these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations of Modes, if no externall Agent is the cause of these changes. And <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> opposing an <hi>Externall Agent</hi> to this <hi>Thing</hi> that he saies does not change it self, does naturally imply, That they are both not <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> but <hi>Substances</hi> he speakes of.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Wherefore there remains onely the latter Proposition to be examined, <hi>That no Essence of it self can vary its Modification.</hi> That some Essence must have had a power
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55765:91"/>
of moving is plain, in that there is Motion in the world, which must be the effect of some Substance or other. But that Motion in a large sense, taking it for mutation or change, may proceed from that very Essence in which it is found, seemes to me plain by Experience: For there is an Essence in us, whatever we will call it, which we find endued with this property; as appears from hence, that it has variety of percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Mathematicall, Logicall,</hi> and I may adde also <hi>Morall,</hi> that are not any impresses nor footsteps of Corporeall Motion, as I have already demonstrated; and any man may observe in himself, and discover in the writings of others, how the Minde has passed from one of these perceptions to another, in very long deductions of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration; as also what stilness from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Motion is required in the excogitation of such series of Reasons, where the Spirits are to run into no other posture nor motion then what they are guided into by the Mind it self, where these immateriall and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall Notions have the leading and rule. Besides in grosser Phantasmes, which are supposed to be somewhere impressed in the Brain, the composition of them, and disclusion and various disposall of them, is plainly an arbitrarious act, and implies
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55765:91"/>
an Essence that can, as it lists, excite in it self the variety of such Phantasmes as have been first exhibited to her from Externall Objects, and change them and transpose them at her own will. But what need I reason against this ground of <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> so sollicitously? it being sufficient to discover, that he onely saies, that <hi>No Essence can change the Modifications of it self,</hi> but does not prove it; and therefore whatever he would infer hereupon is meerly upon a begg'd Principle.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But however, from this precarious ground he will infer, that <hi>whenever we have a Will to a thing, the cause of this Will is not the Will it self, but something else not in our own disposing;</hi> the meaning whereof must be, <hi>That whenever we Will, some corporeall impress, which we cannot avoid, forces us thereto.</hi> But the Illation is as weak as bold; it being built upon no foundation, as I have already shewn. I shall onely take notice how <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> though he has rescued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the authority of the Schools, and would fain set up for himself, yet he has not freed himself from their fooleries in talking of <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> (and the absurditie is alike in both) as separate and distinct from the <hi>Essence</hi> they belong to, wich causes a great deal of distraction and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55765:92"/>
obscurity in the speculation of things. I speak this in reference to those expressions of his of the <hi>Will being the cause of willing,</hi> and of its being the necessary cause of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary actions, and of things not being in its disposing. Whenas, if a man would speak properly, and desired to be understood, he would say, <hi>That the Subject in which is this power or act of willing, (call it Man or the Soul of Man) is the cause of this or that volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary action.</hi> But this would discover his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry, wherewith haply he has entrapt himself, which is this, <hi>Something out of the power of the Will necessarily causes the Will; the Will once caused is the necessary cause of voluntary actions; and therefore all voluntary actions are necessitated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Besides that the first part of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation is groundless (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready intimated) the second is sophisticall, that sayes <hi>That the Will is the necessary cause of voluntary actions:</hi> For by <hi>necessary</hi> may be understood either <hi>necessitated,</hi> forced and made to act, whether it will or no; or else it may signify that the Will is a requisite cause of voluntary actions, so that there can be no voluntary actions without it. The latter whereof may be in some sense true, but the former is utterly false. So the Conclusion being inferred from assertions
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55765:92"/>
whereof the one is groundless, the other Sophisticall, the Illation cannot but be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously weak and despicable. But if he had spoke in the <hi>Concrete</hi> in stead of the <hi>Abstract,</hi> the Sophistry had been more grossly discoverable, or rather the train of his reasoning languid and contemptible. Omitting therefore to speak of the <hi>Will</hi> separately, which of it self is but a blind Power or Operation, let us speak of that <hi>Essence</hi> which is endued with Will, Sense, Reason, and other Faculties, and see what face this argumentation of his will bear, which will then run thus;</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Some externall, irresistible Agent does ever necessarily cause that Essence</hi> (call it Soule or what you please) <hi>which is endued with the faculties of Will and Understanding, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o Will. This Essence, endued with the power of exerting it self into the act of Willing, is the necessary cause of Voluntary actions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all voluntary actions are necessitated.</hi> The first Assertion now at first sight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a gross falshood, the Soule being endued with Understanding as well as Will, and therefore she is not necessarily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to will by externall impresses, but by the displaying of certain notions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions she raises in her self, that be pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intellectuall. And the second seems a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55765:93"/>
very slim and lank piece of Sophistrie. Both which my reasons already alledged doe so easily and so plainly reach, that I need add nothing more, but pass to his second Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the form whereof in brief is this;</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Every Cause is a sufficient cause, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it could not produce its effect: Every sufficient cause is a necessary cause, that is to say, will be sure to produce the effect, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise something was wanting thereto, and it was no sufficient cause: And therefore every cause is a necessary cause, and consequently every Effect or Action, even those that are termed Voluntary, are necessitated.</hi> This reasoning looks smartly at first view, but if we come closer to it, we shall find it a pittifull piece of Sophistry, which is easily detected by observing the ambiguity of that Proposition, <hi>Every sufficient cause is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary cause:</hi> For the force lyes not so much in that it is said to be <hi>Sufficient,</hi> as in that it is said to be <hi>a Cause;</hi> which if it be, it must of necessity have an <hi>Effect,</hi> whether it be <hi>sufficient</hi> or <hi>insufficient;</hi> which disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Sophisme. For these relative terms of <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> necessarily imply one another. But every Being that is <hi>sufficient</hi> to act this or that <hi>if it will,</hi> and so to become the <hi>Cause</hi> thereof, doth neither act, nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from acting <hi>necessarily.</hi> And therefore
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55765:93"/>
if it doe act, it addes <hi>Will</hi> to the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of its power; and if it did not act, it is not because it had not sufficient power, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it would not make use of it. So that we see that every <hi>sufficient</hi> Cause rightly understood without captiositie is not a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> cause, nor will be sure to produce the Effect; and that though there be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of power, yet there may be something wanting, to wit, the exertion of the Will; whereby it may come to pass, that what might have acted, if it would, did not: but if it did, Will being added to sufficient Power, that it cannot be said to be <hi>necessary</hi> in any other sense, then of that Axiome in Metaphysicks, <hi>Quicquid est, quamdiu est, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse est esse:</hi> The reason whereof is, because it is impossible that a thing should be and not be at once. But before it acted, it might have chosen whether it would have acted or no; but it did determine it self. And in this sense is it to be said to be a <hi>free Agent,</hi> &amp; not a <hi>necessary</hi> one. So that it is manifest, that though there be some prettie perversness of wit in the contriving of this Argument, yet there is no solidity at all at the bottome.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And as little is there in his third. But in this, I must confess, I cannot so much accuse him of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Sophistrie,</hi> as of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the rules of <hi>Logick;</hi> for he does
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55765:94"/>
plainly assert That the necessity of the truth of that Proposition there named depends on the necessity of the truth of the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; then which no grosser errour can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Art of reasoning. For he might as well say that the necessity of the truth of a <hi>Connex</hi> Axiome depends on the necessity of the truth of the parts, as of a <hi>Disjunct.</hi> But in a <hi>Connex,</hi> when both the parts are not onely false, but impossible, yet the Axiome is necessarily true. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>If Bucephalus be a man, he is endued with humane reason;</hi> this Axiome is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily true, and yet the parts are impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. For <hi>Alexanders</hi> horse can neither be a man, nor have the reason of a man, either radically or actually. The necessity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is only laid upon the connexion of the parts, not upon the parts themselves. So when I say, <hi>To morrow it will rain, or it will not rain,</hi> this <hi>Disjunct</hi> Proposition also is necessary, but the necessity lyes upon the <hi>Disjunction</hi> of the parts, not upon the parts themselves: For they being immediately disjoyned, there is a necessity that one of them must be, though there be no necessity that this must be determined rather then that. As when a man is kept under custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die where he has the use of two rooms only, though there be a necessity that he be found
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55765:94"/>
in one of the two, yet he is not confined to either one of them. And to be brief, and prevent those frivolous both answers and replyes that follow in the pursuit of this Argument in <hi>Mr. Hobbs;</hi> As the necessity of this <hi>Disjunct</hi> Axiome lyes upon the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> it self, so the truth, of which this necessity is a mode, must lye there too; for it is the <hi>Disjunction</hi> of the parts that is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and not the parts themselves, as any one that is but moderately in his wits must needs acknowledg.</p>
               <p n="13">13. There is a more dangerous way that <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> might have made use of, and with more credit, but yet scarce with better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, which is the consideration of an Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome that pronounces of a future Contingent, such as this, <hi>Cras Socrates disputabit.</hi> For every Axiome pronouncing either true or false, as all doe agree upon; if this Axiome be now true, it is impossible but <hi>Socrates</hi> should dispute to morrow; or if it be now false, it is impossible he should: and so his Action of disputing or the omission thereof will be necessary, for the Proposition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be both true and false at once. Some are much troubled to extricate themselves out of this Nooze; but if we more precisely enquire into the sense of the Proposition, the difficultie will vanish. He therefore that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55765:95"/>
affirms that <hi>Socrates</hi> will dispute to morrow, affirms it (to use the distinction of <hi>Futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> that <hi>Aristotle</hi> somewhere suggests) either as a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>either as a thing that is likely to be, but has a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being otherwise,</hi> or <hi>else as a thing certainly to come to pass.</hi> If this latter, the Axiome is false; if the former, it is true: and so the liberty of <hi>Socrates</hi> his action, as also of all like contingent effects, are thus easily rescued from this sophistical entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement. For every <hi>Future</hi> Axiome is as incapable of our judgment, unless we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the sense of it by one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named modes, as an <hi>Indefinite</hi> Axiome is, before we in our minds adde the notes of <hi>Universality</hi> or <hi>Particularity:</hi> Neither can we say of either of them, that they are true or false, till we have compleated and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined their sense.</p>
               <p n="14">14. His fourth Argument he proposes with some diffidence and dislike, as if he thought it <hi>not good Logick</hi> (they are his own words) to make use of it, and adde it to the rest. And for my own part, I cannot but approve of the consistency of his judgment, and coherency with other parts of his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie: For if there be nothing but <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> in the whole comprehension of things, it will be very hard to find out any
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55765:95"/>
such <hi>Deity</hi> as has the knowledg or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of any thing: And therefore I suspect that this last is onely cast in as <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ad hominem,</hi> to puzzle such as have not dived to so profound a depth of naturall knowledg, as to fancy they have discovered there is no God in the world.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But let him vilifie it as he will, it is the only Argument he has brought, that has any tolerable sense or solidity in it; and it is a Subject that has exercised the wits of all Ages, to reconcile the <hi>Liberty</hi> of mans Will with the <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Praescience</hi> of God. But my <hi>Freeness,</hi> I hope, and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> shall make this matter more easy to me, then it ordinarily proves to them that venture upon it. My Answer therefore in brief shall be this;</p>
               <p n="16">16. That though there be such a Faculty in the Soule of man as <hi>Liberty of Will,</hi> yet she is not alwaies in a state of acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. For she may either <hi>degenerate so far,</hi> that it may be as certainly known what she will doe upon this or that occasion, as what an hungry Dog will doe when a crust is offered him; which is the generall condition of almost all men in most occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies of their lives: or else she may be so <hi>Heroically good,</hi> though that happen in very few, that it may be as certainly known
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55765:96"/>
as before what she will doe or suffer upon such or such emergencies: and in these cases the use of <hi>Liberty of Will</hi> ceases.</p>
               <p n="17">17. That the use of the Facultie of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will</hi> is properly there, where we finde our selves so near to an <hi>AEquiponderancy,</hi> being toucht with the sense of Vertue on the one side, and the ease or pleasure of some vitious action on the other, that we are conscious to our selves that we ought, and that we may, if we will, abandon the one and cleave to the other.</p>
               <p n="18">18. That in this Conflict the Soule has no such absolute power to determine her self to the one or the other action, but Temptation or Supernaturall assistance may certainly carry her this way or that way; so that she may not be able to use that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of going indifferently either way.</p>
               <p n="19">19. That Divine <hi>Decrees</hi> either find men sit, or make them so, for the executing of whatever is absolutely purposed or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied concerning them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. That the <hi>Praescience</hi> of God is so vast and exceeding the comprehension of our thoughts, that all that can be safely said of it is this, That this knowledg is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and exquisite, accurately representing the Natures, Powers and Properties of the thing it does foreknow. Whence it must
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55765:96"/>
follow, that if there be any Creature free and undeterminate, and that in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and at such a time he may either act thus or not act thus, this perfect Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge must discern from all eternity, that the said Creature in such circumstances may either act thus, or so, or not. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to declare the perfection of this Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and Omniscience of God; as His <hi>Omnipotence</hi> ought to exten so far, as to be able to doe whatsoever implyes no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to be done; so his <hi>Praescience</hi> and <hi>Omniscience</hi> ought to extend so far, as to know precisely and fully whatever implies no contradiction to be known. To conclude therefore briefly; <hi>Free</hi> or <hi>Contingent</hi> Effects doe either imply a contradiction to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, or they doe not imply it. If they imply a contradiction to be foreknown, they are no Object of the Omniscience of God, and therefore there can be no pretence that his Foreknowledg does determinate them, nor can they be argued to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined thereby. If they imply no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to be foreknown, that is to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that divine Praescience and they may very well consist together. And so either way, notwithstanding the divine Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Actions of men may be free.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The sum therefore of all is this, That
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55765:97"/>
mens actions are sometimes free and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not free; but in that they are at any time free, is a Demonstration that there is a faculty in us that is incompetible to meer Matter: which is sufficient for my purpose.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. <hi>An Enumeration of sundry Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Seat of Common Sense.</hi> 2. <hi>Upon supposition that we are nothing but meer Matter, That the whole Body cannot be the Common</hi> Sensorium; 3. <hi>Nor the Orifice of the Stomack;</hi> 4. <hi>Nor the Heart;</hi> 5. <hi>Nor the Brain;</hi> 6. <hi>Nor the Membranes;</hi> 7. <hi>Nor the</hi> Septum lucidum; 8. <hi>Nor</hi> Regius <hi>his small and perfectly solid Particle.</hi> 9. <hi>The proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the</hi> Conarion <hi>being the common Seat of Sense.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Have plainly proved, that neither those more Pure and Intellectual faculties of <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> nor yet those less pure of <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> are competible to meer <hi>Bodies.</hi> Of which we may be the more secure, I having so convincingly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, That not so much as that which we call <hi>Externall Sense</hi> is competible to the same: all which Truths I have concluded concerning <hi>Matter generally considered.</hi> But
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55765:97"/>
because there may be a suspicion in some, which are over credulous concerning the powers of <hi>Body,</hi> that <hi>Organization</hi> may doe strange feats (which Surmise notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is as fond as if they should imagine, that though neither Silver, nor Steel, nor Iron, nor Lute-strings, have any Sense apart, yet being put together in such a manner and forme, as will (suppose) make a compleat Watch, they may have Sense; that is to say, that a Watch may be a living creature, though the severall parts have neither Life nor Sense) I shall for their sakes goe more particularly to work, and recite every opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that I could ever meet with by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with either men or books concerning <hi>the Seat of the Common Sense,</hi> and after trie whether any of these Hypotheses can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be admitted for Truth, upon supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we consist of nothing but meer modified and organized Matter. I shall first recite the Opinions, and then examine the possibility of each in particular, which in brief are these. 1. That the whole Body is theSeat of Common Sense. 2. That the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Stomack. 3. The Heart. 4. The Brain. 5. The Membranes. 6. The <hi>Septum lucidum.</hi> 7. Some very small and perfectly solid particle in the Body. 8. The <hi>Conarion.</hi> 9. The concurse of the Nerves about the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55765:98"/>
fourth ventricle of the Brain. 10. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in that fourth ventricle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the first Opinion is false is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from hence, That upon supposition we are nothing but <hi>meer Matter,</hi> if we grant the <hi>whole Body</hi> to be one common <hi>Sensori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> perceptive of all Objects, Motion which is impressed upon the Eye or Eare, must be transmitted into all the parts of the Body. For Sense is really the same with commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Motion, by Axiome 20. And the variety of Sense arising from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of Motion, which must needs be variously modified by the different temper of the parts of the Body, by Axiome 22. it plainly followes that the Eye must be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise affected by the motion of Light, then the other parts to which this motion is transmitted. Wherefore if it be the <hi>whole Body</hi> that perceives, it will perceive the Object in every part thereof severall wayes modified at once; which is against all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. It will also appear in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in severall places at once, by reason of the many windings and turnings that must happen to the transmission of this Motion, which are likely to be as so many Refractions or Reflections.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>the Orifice of the Stomack</hi> cannot be <hi>the seat of Common Sense,</hi> is apparent
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55765:98"/>
from hence, That that which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Sentient</hi> does not only perceive all Objects, but has the power of moving the Body. Now besides that there is no orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization in the mouth of the Stomack, that can elude the strength of our Arguments laid down in the foregoing Chapters, which took away all capacity from Matter of having any perception at all in it, there is no Mechanicall reason imaginable to be found in the Body, whereby it will appear possible, that supposing the mouth of the Stomack were the <hi>common Percipient</hi> of all Objects, it could be able to move the rest of the members of the Body, as we finde something in us does. This is so palpably plain, that it is needless to spend any more words upon it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The same may be said concerning <hi>the Heart.</hi> For who can imagine, that if the <hi>Heart</hi> were that <hi>common Percipient,</hi> that there is any such Mechanical connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and all the parts of the Body, that it may, by such or such a perception, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the motion of the Foot or little Finger? Besides that it seems wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the performance of its <hi>Systole</hi> and <hi>Diastole,</hi> which causes such a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the situation of the Heart by turns, that if it were that Seat in which the sense
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55765:99"/>
of all Objects center, we should not be able to see things steddily resting in the same place.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How uncapable the <hi>Brain</hi> is of being so active a Principle of Motion as we find in our selves, the <hi>viscidity</hi> thereof does plainly indicate. Besides that Physitians have discovered by experience, that the <hi>Brain</hi> is so far from being the <hi>common Seat</hi> of all senses, that it has in it none at all. And the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that say it has, have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished it into such severall offices of <hi>Imagination, Memory, Common Sense,</hi> &amp;c. that we are still at a loss for some one part of Matter, that is to be the <hi>Common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient</hi> of all these. But I have so clearly demonstrated the impossibility of the Brains being able to perform those functions that appertain truly to what ordinarily men call the <hi>Soule,</hi> in my <hi>Antidote against Atheisme,</hi> that it is enough to refer the Reader thither.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As for the <hi>Membranes,</hi> whether we would fancy them <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Seat of Common Sense,</hi> or <hi>some one</hi> Membrane, or <hi>part</hi> there of; the like difficulties will accur as have been mentioned already. For if <hi>all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,</hi> the difference and situation of them will vary the aspect and sight of the Object, so that the same things will appear to us in several hues and severall places at once,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55765:99"/>
as is easily demonstrated from Axiome 22. If <hi>some one Membrane,</hi> or <hi>part</hi> thereof, it will be impossible to excogitate any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall reason, how this <hi>one</hi> particular Membrane, or any <hi>part</hi> thereof, can be able so strongly and determinately to move upon occasion every part of the Body.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And therefore for this very cause cannot the <hi>Septum lucidum</hi> be the <hi>Common Percipient</hi> in us, because it is utterly unima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, how it should have the power of so stoutly and distinctly moving our exteriour parts and limbs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As for that new and marvelous Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Henricus Regius,</hi> that it may be <hi>a certain perfectly solid, but very small particle of Matter in the Body,</hi> that is the seat of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perception; besides that it is as boldly asserted, that such an <hi>hard</hi> particle should have sense in it, as that the filings of Iron and Steel should; it cannot be the spring of Motion: For how should so small at Atome move the whole Body, but by moving it self? But it being more subtile then the point of any needle, when it puts it self upon motion, especially such strong thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as we sometimes use, it must needs passe through the Body and leave it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The most pure Mechanical Invention is that of the use of the <hi>Conarion,</hi> proposed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55765:100"/>
by <hi>Des-Cartes;</hi> which, considered with some other organizations of the Body, bids the fairest of any thing I have met withall, or ever hope to meet withall, for the resolution of the Passions and Properties of living Creatures into meer corporeall motion. And therefore it is requisite to insist a little upon the explication thereof, that we may the more punctually confute them that would abuse his Mechanicall contrivances to the exclusion of all Principles but Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall, in either Man or Beast.</p>

How Perception of externall Objects, Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Motion, Memory and Imagination, are pretended to be performed by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narion,</hi> Spirits and Muscles, without a Soule. 2.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 THE sum of this Abuse must in brief be this, That the <hi>Glandula Pinealis</hi> is the <hi>common Sentient</hi> or <hi>Percipient of all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> and without a Soule, by vertue of the Spirits and Organization of the Body, may doe all those feats that we ordinarily conceive to be performed by Soule and Body joyned together. For it being <hi>one,</hi> whenas the rest of the Organs of Sense are <hi>double,</hi> and so handsomely seated as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the <hi>Spirits</hi> as well of the posteriour as anteriour Cavities of the <hi>Brain;</hi> by their help all the motions of the <hi>Nerves</hi> (both those that transmit the sense of outward Objects, and of inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Body, such as Hunger, Thirst and the like) are easily conveighed unto it: and so being variously moved, it does variously determine the course of the <hi>Spirits</hi> into
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55765:101"/>
such and such <hi>Muscles,</hi> whereby it moves the Body. Moreover that the transmission of Motion from the Object, through the Nerves, into the inward concavities of the Brain, and so to the <hi>Conarion,</hi> opens such and such Pores of the Brain, in such and such order or manner, which remain as tracts or footsteps of the presence of these Objects after they are removed. Which tracts, or signatures, consist mainly in this, that the Spirits will have an easier passage through these Pores then other parts of the Brain. And hence arises <hi>Memory,</hi> when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be determined, by the inclining of the <hi>Conarion,</hi> to that part of the Brain where these tracts are found, they moving then the <hi>Conarion</hi> as when the Object was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, though not so strongly. From the hitting of the Spirits into such like tracts, is also the nature of <hi>Imagination</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; in which there is little difference from <hi>Memory,</hi> saving that the reflection upon time as past, when we saw or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such or such a thing, is quite left out. But these are not all the operations we are conscious to our selves of, and yet more then can be made out by this Hypothesis, That <hi>Perception of Objects, Spontaneous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Memory</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> may be all performed by vertue of this <hi>Glandula,</hi> the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55765:101"/>
Animal Spirits, and meer organization of the Body; as we shall plainly find, though but upon an easy examination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For that the <hi>Conarion,</hi> devoid of a Soule, has no perception of any one Object, is demonstrable from the very description <hi>Cartesius</hi> makes of the transmission of the image, suppose through the Eye to the Brain, and so to the <hi>Conarion.</hi> For it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from what he sets down in the 35. Article of his <hi>Treatise of the Passions of the Soule,</hi> that the Image that is propagated from the Object to the <hi>Conarion,</hi> is impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thereupon in some latitude of space. Whence it is manifest that the <hi>Conarion</hi> does not, nor can perceive the whole Object, though severall parts may be acknowledged to have the perception of the severall parts thereof. But something in us perceives the whole, which therefore cannot be the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narion.</hi> And that we doe not perceive the external Object double, is not so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Image is united in the Organ of Common Sense, as that the lines come so from the Object to both the Eyes, that it is felt in one place; otherwise if the Object be very near, and the direction of our Eyes be not fitted to that nearness, it will seem double however. Which is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that a man may see with both
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55765:102"/>
eyes at once; and for my own part, I'me sure that I see better at distance, when I use both, then when one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for <hi>Spontaneous Motion,</hi> that the <hi>Conarion</hi> cannot be a sufficient Principle thereof, with the Spirits and organization of other parts of the Body, though we should admit it a fit seat of Common Sense, will easily appear, if we consider, that so weak and so small a thing as that <hi>Glandula</hi> is, seems utterly unable to determine the spirits with that force and violence we find they are determined in running, striking, thrusting and the like; and that it is evident, that sometimes scarce the thousandth part of the <hi>Conarion</hi> shall be directer of this force; viz. when the Object of Sight, suppose, is as little as a pin's point, or when a man is prick'd with a needle, these receptions must be as little in the <hi>Glandula</hi> as in the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Sense. But suppose the <hi>whole Conarion</hi> alwaies did act in the determining the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits into this or that Muscle; it is impossible that such fluid Matter as these Spirits are, that upon the noddings of the <hi>Conarion</hi> forward may easily recede back, should ever determine their course with that force and strength they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. But haply it will be answered, That such subtile and fluid bodies as the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55765:102"/>
Animall Spirits, that are in a readiness to be upon Motion any way, the least thing will determine their course, and that the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles themselves, being well replenisht with Spirits, and framed with such <hi>Valvulae</hi> as will easily intromit them from the Brain, and also conveigh them out of one opposite Muscle into another upon the least redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Spirits in the one above the other, and so shut them in; that that force we find in spontaneous Motion may very well be salved by this Mechanicall Artifice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the insufficiency of this answer may appear, let us more accurately consider the contrivance in the following Figure, which must be some such <figure/> thing as <hi>Regius</hi> has, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop. Natural. Lib. 4. cap. 16. and which may serve for the more easy understanding of what <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> writes in his book of Passions Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. II. Here B. C. are two opposite Muscles, the known Instruments of spontaneous Motion; K. some part of the Body to be moved; D. E. and F. G. are the Nerves through which Spirits are transmitted from the Brain
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55765:103"/>
into the foresaid Muscles; D. and F. two <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulae</hi> to let pass the Spirits from the Brain into the Muscles, but stop them if they would regurgitate; G. is a Valve that lets the Spirits out of the Muscle C. into B, and E. another Valve that lets the Spirits out of B. into C. Now in brief, the result of this Mechanicall contrivance is this, viz. That the Spirits being determined by the <hi>Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> never so little more copiously into B. then into C, those in C. will pass through the Valve G. into B, and so B. swelling, and consequently shortning it self, it must needs bring up the member K.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We will not here alledge that this may be onely a meer fancy, these <hi>Valvulae</hi> in the Nerves not being yet discovered by any Anatomist to be part of the Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of the Body of any Animal; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shew, that they would not effect what is aimed at, though they were admitted. For first it does not appear that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will make more hast out of C. into B, then the pressure caused in B. by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Spirits from the <hi>Conarion</hi> forces them to. For all places being alike to them to play in, they will goe no further then they are driven or pressed, as Wind in a Bladder. And how the <hi>Conarion</hi> should drive or press the Spirits into B, so as to make
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55765:103"/>
it press those in C, and force them out so quick and smart as we find in some Actions, is a thing utterly unconceivable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Besides, admit that the <hi>Conarion</hi> could determine them with some considerable force so into B, that they would make those in C. come to them through the Valve G, there being the Valve E. to transmit them into C. again, it is impossible but that the Tenth part of that force which we ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily use to open a mans hand against his will, should whether he would or no easily open it. For a very ordinary strength move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing K. from B. towards C. must needs so press the Spirits in B, that they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly pass by E. into C, if our Body be nothing but Matter Mechanically organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. And therefore it is the meer <hi>Imperium</hi> of our Soule that does determine the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to this Muscle rather then the other, and holds them there in despite of externall force. From whence it is manifest that brute Beasts must have Soules also.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Concerning <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> that the meer Mechanical reasons of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> will not reach them, we shall clearly understand, if we consider that the easy aperture of the same Pores of the Brain, that were opened at the presence of such an Object, is not sufficient to represent the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55765:104"/>
Object, after the <hi>Conarion</hi> has by inclining it self thitherward determined the course of the Spirits into the same Pores. For this could onely represent the Figure of a thing, not the Colours thereof. Besides a man may bring an hundred Objects, and expose them to our view at the same distance, the Eye keeping exactly in the same posture, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it shall be necessary for these images to take up the very same place of the Brain, and yet there shall be a distinct remembrance of all these; which is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible if there be no Soule in us, but all be meer Matter. The same may be said of so many Names or Words levell'd if you will out of a Trunk into the Eare kept accurately in the same posture, so that the Sound shall beat perpetually upon the same parts of the Organ, yet if there be five hundred of them, there may be a distinct memory for every one of them; which is a power per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly beyond the bounds of meer Matter, for there would be a necessary confusion of all.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Lastly, for those imaginations or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations that are of no one Object that we ever see, but made up of severall that have taken their distinct places in the Brain, how can the <hi>Conarion</hi> joyn these together? Or rather in one and the same Object, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55765:104"/>
this Man or that House, which we see in a right posture, and has left such a signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or figure in the Brain as is fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it so, how can the <hi>Conarion</hi> invert the posture of the image, and make it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the House and Man with the heels upwards? Besides the difficulty of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the Distance of an Object, or the Breadth thereof, concerning which we have spoken already. It is impossible the <hi>Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> if it be meer Matter, should perform any such operations as these. For it must raise motions in it self, such as are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily conveighed by any corporeall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press of another Body, which is plainly against Axiome 26.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And therefore that sober and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wit <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> dares not stretch the power of Mechanicall organization thus far, but doth plainly confess, that as there are <hi>some Functions</hi> that belong to the <hi>Body</hi> alone, so there are others that belong to the <hi>Soule,</hi> which he calls <hi>Cogitations;</hi> and are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him of two sorts, the one <hi>Actions,</hi> the other <hi>Passions.</hi> The <hi>Actions</hi> are all the operations of our Will, as in some sense all <hi>Perceptions</hi> may be termed Actions. And these Actions of the Will are either such as are meer Intellectuall Operations, and end in the Soule her self, such as her stirring up
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55765:105"/>
her self to love God, or contemplate any Immateriall Object; or they are such as have an influence on the Body, as when by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our Will we put ourselves upon going to this or that place.</p>
               <p>He distinguishes again our <hi>Perceptions</hi> into two sorts, whereof the one has the Soule for their cause, the other the Body. Those that are caused by the Body are most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what such as depend on the Nerves. But besides these there is one kind of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is to be referred hither, and that properly has the Body for its cause, to wit, that Imagination that arises meerly from the hitting of the Animall Spirits against the tracts of those Images that externall Objects have left in the Brain, and so repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting them to the <hi>Conarion;</hi> which may happen in the day-time when our Fancy roves, and we doe not set our selves on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to think on things, as well as it does in sleep by night. Those <hi>Perceptions</hi> that arrive to the Soule by the interposition of the Nerves, differ one from another in this, that some of them refer to <hi>outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> that strike our Sense, others to <hi>our Body,</hi> such as <hi>Hunger, Thirst, Pain,</hi> &amp;c. and others to the <hi>Soule</hi> it self, as <hi>Sorrow, Joy, Fear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Those <hi>Perceptions</hi> that have the Soule
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55765:105"/>
for their cause, are either the <hi>Perceptions</hi> of her own <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Will,</hi> or else of her <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of things purely intelligible,</hi> or else of <hi>Imaginations made at pleasure,</hi> or finally of <hi>Reminiscency,</hi> when she searches out something that she has let slip out of her Memory.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That which is observable in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution is this, That all those <hi>Cogitations</hi> that he calls <hi>Actions,</hi> as also those kind of <hi>Perceptions,</hi> whose cause he assignes to the Soule, are in themselves (and are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him) of that nature, that they cannot be imitated by any creature by the meer organization of i'ts Body. But for the other, he holds they may, and would make us believe they are in Bodies of Brutes, which he would have meer <hi>Machina's,</hi> that is, That from the meer Mechanical frame of their Body, outward Objects of Sense may open Pores in their Brains so, as that they may determine the Animall Spirits into such and such Muscles for spontaneous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That the course of the Spirits also falling into the Nerves in the Intestines and Stomack, Spleen, Heart, Liver, and other parts, may cause the very same effects of Passion, suppose of Love, Hatred, Joy, Sorrow, in these brute <hi>Machina's,</hi> as we feel in our Bodies, though they, as being sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55765:106"/>
feel them not; and so the vellication of certain Tunicles and Fibres in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and Throat, may affect their Body as ours is in the Sense of Hunger or Thirst; and finally that the hitting of the Spirits into the tracts of the Brain, that have been signed by Externall Objects, may act so upon their Body as it does upon ours in Imagination and Memory.</p>
               <p>Now adde to this <hi>Machina</hi> of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> the capacity in Matter of Sensation and Perception, (which yet I have demonstrated it to be uncapable of) and it will be exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely as much as <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> himself can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to arise from meer Body, that is, All the Motions thereof being purely Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, the perceptions and propensions will be fatall, necessary, and unavoidable, as he loves to have them.</p>
               <p>But being all <hi>Cogitations</hi> that <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> terms <hi>Actions,</hi> as also all those kind of <hi>Perceptions</hi> that he acknowledges the Soule to be the cause of, are not to be resolved into any <hi>Mechanicall</hi> contrivance; we may take notice of them as a peculiar rank of Arguments, and such, as that if it could be granted, that the Soules of Brutes were nothing but sentient Matter, yet it would follow that a Substance of an higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and truly <hi>Immateriall,</hi> must be the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55765:106"/>
Principle of those more noble Operations we find in our selves, as appears from Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome 20. and 26.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. That no part of the Spinall Marrow can be the Common <hi>Sensorium</hi> without a Soule in the Body. 2. That the Animal Spirits are more likely to be that <hi>Common Percipient.</hi> 3. But yet it is demonstrable they are not: 4. As not being so much as capable of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; 5. Nor of directing Motion into the Muscles; 6. Much less of Imagination and rationall Invention; 7. Nor of Memory. 8. An answer to an Evasion. 9. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors reason, why he has confuted so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly all the suppositions of the Seat of <hi>Common Sense,</hi> when few of them have been asserted with the exclusion of a Soule.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THere remain now onely Two Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be examined: the one, <hi>That place of the Spinall Marrow where</hi> Anatomists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there <hi>is the nearest concurse of all the Nerves of the Body;</hi> the other, <hi>the Animall Spirits in the fourth Ventricle of the Brain.</hi> As for the former, viz. <hi>That part of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55765:107"/>
Spinall Marrow, where the concurse of the Nerves are conceived to be,</hi> as I have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in like case, so I say again, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that I have already demonstrated, that Matter is uncapable of Sense, and that there is no modification thereof in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Marrow,</hi> that will make it more likely to be indued with that Faculty then the pith of Elder or a mess of Curds; we are also to take notice, that it is utterly inept for Motion, nor is it conceivable how that part of it, or any other that is assigned to this office of being the <hi>Common Percipient</hi> in us of all Thoughts and Objects, (which must also have the power of moving our members) can, having so little agitation in it self, (as appearing nothing but a kind of soft Pap or Pulp) so nimbly and strongly move the parts of our Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this regard the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> seem much more likely to perform that office; and those, the importunity of whose gross fancyes constrains them to make the Soule Corporeall, doe nevertheless usually pitch upon some <hi>subtile thin Matter</hi> to constitute her nature or Essence: And therefore they imagine her to be either Aire, Fire, Light, or some such like Body; with which the <hi>Animall Spirits</hi> have no small affinity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But this opinion, though it may seem
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55765:107"/>
plausible at first sight, yet the difficulties it is involved in are insuperable. For it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that all the Arguments that are brought Chap. 2. Sect. 3. will recur with full force in this place. For there is no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is so perfectly <hi>liquid</hi> as the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> but consists of particles onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous one to another, and actually upon Motion playing and turning one by another, as busy as Atomes in the Sun. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us consider whether that Treasury of pure Animall Spirits contained in <hi>the Fourth Ventricle</hi> be able to Sustain so noble an office as to be the <hi>common Percipient</hi> in our Body, which, as I have often repeated, is so complex a Function, that it does not onely contain the perception of externall Objects, but Motion, Imagination, Reason and Memory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now at the very first dash, the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the image of the Object into this crowd of particles cannot but hit variously upon them, and therefore they will have severall Perceptions amongst them, some haply perceiving part of the Object, others all, others more then all, others also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it in one place, and others in another. But the <hi>Percipient in us</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting no such confusion or disorder in our beholding of Objects, it is plain that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55765:108"/>
it is not the <hi>Animall Spirits</hi> that is it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, that which is so confounded a <hi>Percipient,</hi> how can it be a right Principle of directing Motion into the Muscles? For besides what disorder may happen in this function upon the distracted representation of present Objects, the power of thinking, excogitating and deliberating, being in these <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> also, (and they having no means of communicating one with another, but justling one against another; which is as much to the purpose, as if men should knock heads to communicate to each other their conceits of Wit) it must needs follow that they will have their perceptions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and deliberations apart; which when they put in Execution, must cause a marvelous confusion in the Body, some of them commanding the parts this way, others driving them another way: or if their factions have many divisions and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions, every one will be so weak, that none of them will be able to command it any way. But we find no such strugling or countermands of any thing in us, that would act our Body one way when we would another; as if when one was a going to write
<q>
                     <l>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>—</l>
                  </q>
something stronger in him, whose conceits
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55765:108"/>
he is not privy to, should get the use of his hand, and, in stead of that, write down
<q>
                     <l>Arma virúmque cano.</l>
                  </q>
And the like may be said of any other <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Motion,</hi> which being so constantly within our command as it is, it is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Argument to prove that it is not such a lubricous Substance as the <hi>Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> nor so disunited; but something more <hi>perfectly One</hi> and <hi>Indivisible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. We need not instance any further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the power of <hi>Invention</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> how every particle of these <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> has a liberty to <hi>think</hi> by it self, and <hi>consult with</hi> it self, as well as to <hi>play</hi> by it self, and how there is no possible means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their Thoughts one to another, unless it should be, as I have said, by hitting one against another: but that can onely communicate <hi>Motion,</hi> not their determinate <hi>Thought;</hi> unless that these particles were conceived to figure themselves into the shape of those things they think of, which is impossible by Axiome 26. And suppose it were possible one particle should shape it self, for example, into a <hi>George on Horse-back</hi> with a Lance in his hand, and another into an <hi>Inchanted Castle;</hi> this <hi>George on Horse-back</hi> must run against the <hi>Castle,</hi> to make the <hi>Castle</hi> receive his impress and similitude.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55765:109"/>
But what then? Truly the encounter will be very unfortunate. For <hi>St. George</hi> indeed may easily break his Lance, but it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that he should by justling against the Particle in the form of a <hi>Castle</hi> conveigh the entire shape of himself and his Horse thereby, such as we find our selves able to imagine of a man on horse-back. Which is a Truth as demonstrable as any Theorem in Mathematicks, but so plain at first sight, that I need not use the curiosity of a longer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration to make it more firm. Nor is there any colourable evasion by venturing upon a new way, as if this particle having transformed it self into a Castle, and that into an Horse-man, all the others then would see them both. For by <hi>what light,</hi> and <hi>how little</hi> would they appear, and in <hi>what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent places,</hi> according to the different po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the particles of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> and with what <hi>different faces,</hi> some seeing one side, others another? But besides this, there is a further difficulty, that if such <hi>Sensible representations</hi> as these could be conveighed from one particle to another by corporeall encounters and justlings, or by that other way after alledged; <hi>Logicall</hi> and <hi>Mathematicall notions</hi> can not. So that some of the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> may think of one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> or of part of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55765:109"/>
that Demonstration, and others of another: insomuch that if a <hi>Mathematician</hi> be to write, while he would write one thing upon the determination of these <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> others may get his hand to make use of for the writing something else, to whose Thoughts and Counsell he was not at all privy; nor can tell any thing, till those other <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> have writ it down. Which Absurdities are so mad and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, that a man would scarce defile his pen by recording them, were it not to awaken those that dote so much on <hi>the power of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (as to think it of it self sufficient for all <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the world) into due shame and abhorrence of their foolish Principle.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The last Faculty I will consider is <hi>Memory,</hi> which is also necessarily joyned with the rest in the <hi>Common Percipient;</hi> of which not onely the <hi>fluidity</hi> of parts, but also their <hi>dissipability,</hi> makes the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> utterly uncapable. For certainly, the Spirits by reason of their <hi>Subtilty</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> are very <hi>dissipable,</hi> and in all likelihood remain not the same for the space of a week together; and yet things that one has not thought of for many years, will come as freshly into a mans minde, as if they were transacted but yesterday.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The onely Evasion they can excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55765:110"/>
here is this, That as there is a continuall supply of Spirits by degrees, so, as they come in, they are <hi>seasoned, fermented,</hi> and <hi>tinctured</hi> with the same notions, percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and propensions that the Spirits they find there have. These are fine words, but signifie nothing but this, that the Spirits there present in the Brain communicate the Notions and Perceptions they have to these new-comers; which is that which I have already proved impossible in the foregoing Sections. And therefore it is impossible that the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> should be that <hi>Common Percipient,</hi> that <hi>hears, sees, moves, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, understands,</hi> and does other functions of life that we perceive performed in us or by us.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We have now particularly evinced, that neither the <hi>whole Body,</hi> nor any of those <hi>parts</hi> that have been pitched upon, if we exclude the presence of a <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Immaterial Substance,</hi> can be the <hi>Seat of Common Sense.</hi> In which I would not be so understood, as if it implyed that there are none of these parts, but some or other have affirmed might be the <hi>common Sensorium,</hi> though we had no Soule; but because they have been stood upon, all of them, by some or other to be the <hi>Seat of Common Sense,</hi> supposing a Soule in the Body, that there might no
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55765:110"/>
imaginable doubt or scruple be left behind, I have taken the pains thus punctually and particularly to prove, that none of them can be the place of Common Sense without one. And thus I have perfectly finished my main design, which was to demonstrate <hi>That there is a Soule or Incorporeall Substance residing in us, distinct from the Body.</hi> But I shall not content my self here, but for a more full discovery of her <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Faculties,</hi> I shall advance further, and search out her <hi>chief Seat in the Body,</hi> where and from whence she exercises her most noble Functions, and after enquire whether she be confined to that part thereof alone, or whether she be spred through all our members; and lastly consider after what manner she sees, feels, hears, imagines, remembers, reasons, and moves the Body. For beside that I shall make some good use of these discoveries for further purpose, it is also in it self very pleasant to have in readiness a rationall and cohaerent account, and a determinate appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of things of this nature.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. His enquiry after the Seat of Common Sense, upon supposition there is a Soule in the Body. 2. That there is some particular part in the Body that is the Seat of Common Sense. 3. A generall division of their Opinions concerning the place of Common Sense. 4. That of those that place it out of the Head there are two sorts. 5. The Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of <hi>Helmont's</hi> reasons whereby he would prove the Orifice of the Stomack to be the principall Seat of the Soule. 6.

A further confutation out of his own concessions. 8. <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, that makes the Heart the Seat of Common Sense. 9. A further confutation thereof from Experience. 10. That the Common Sense is seated somewhere in the Head. 11. A caution for the choice of the particular place thereof. 12. That the whole Brain is not it; 13. Nor <hi>Regius</hi> his small solid Particle; 14. Nor any externall Membrane of the Brain, nor the <hi>Septum Lucidum.</hi> 15. The three most likely places. 16. Objections against <hi>Cartesius</hi> his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the <hi>Conarion</hi> answered. 17. That the <hi>Conarion</hi> is not the Seat of

Common Sense; 18. Nor that part of the Spinall Marrow where the Nerves are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to concurre, but the Spirits in the fourth Ventricle of the Brain.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. IT will therefore be requisite for us to resume the former Opinions, altering the Hypothesis; and to examine which of them is most reasonable, supposing there be a <hi>Substance immateriall</hi> or <hi>Soule</hi> in man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is <hi>some particular</hi> or restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Seat of the Common Sense,</hi> is an Opinion that even all Philosophers and Physitians are agreed upon. And it is an ordinary Comparison amongst them, that the <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Senses</hi> and the <hi>Common Sense</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together are like a Circle with five lines drawn from the Circumference to the Centre. Wherefore as it has been obvious for them to finde out particular Organs for the externall Senses, so they have also attempted to assign some distinct part of the Body for to be an Organ of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense; that is to say, as they discovered Sight to be seated in the Eye, Hearing in the Eare, Smelling in the Nose, &amp;c. so they conceived that there is some part of the Body wherein Seeing, Hearing and all other Perceptions meet together, as the lines of a circle in the centre: and that there the

Soule does also judge and discern of the difference of the Objects of the outward Senses. They have justly therefore excluded all the Externall parts of the Body from the lightest suspition of any capacity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing such a function as is thus generall, they being all employed in a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar task, which is to be the Organ of some one of these five outward Senses; and to be affected no otherwise, then by what is impressed upon themselves, and chiefly from their proper Objects, amongst which five, <hi>Touch</hi> properly so called has the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est share, it being as large as the Skin that covers us, and reaching as deep as any Membrane and Nerve in the limbs and trunk of the Body, besides all the Exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parts of the Head. All which can no more see, then the Eye can hear, or the Eare can smell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Besides this, all those Arguments that doe so clearly evince that the place of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense is somewhere in the Head, is a plain demonstration that the whole Body cannot be the Seat thereof, and what those Arguments are you shall hear anon. For all those Opinions that have pitched on any one Part for the Seat of Common Sense, being to be divided into two Ranks, to wit, either such as assign some particular place
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55765:112"/>
in the <hi>Body,</hi> or else in the <hi>Head,</hi> we will proceed in this order; as first to confute those that have made choice of any part for the Seat of Common Sense out of the Head; and then in the second place we will in generall shew, that the common <hi>Senso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> must be in some part of the Head; and lastly, of those many opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what part of the Head this common <hi>Sensorium</hi> should be, those which seem less reasonable being rejected, we shall pitch upon what we conceive the most unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Those that place the Common <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorium</hi> out of the Head, have seated it either in the <hi>upper Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Stomack,</hi> or in the <hi>Heart.</hi> The former is <hi>Van-Helmont's</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the other <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As for <hi>Van-Helmont,</hi> there is nothing he alledges for his Opinion but may be easily answered. That which mainly imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him was the <hi>exceeding Sensibility</hi> of that part, which Nature made so, that, as a faithfull &amp; sagacious Porter, it might admit nothing into the Stomack that might prove mischievous or troublesome to the Body. From this <hi>tender Sensibility,</hi> great offences to it may very well cause Swoonings, and Apoplexies, and cessations of Sense. But Fear and Joy and Grief have dispatched
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55765:113"/>
some very suddainly, when yet the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of that deadly stroak has been at the Eare or the Eye, from some unsupportable ill newes or horrid spectacle. And the harsh handling of an angry Sore, or the treading on a Corn on the Toe, may easily cast some into a swoon, and yet no man will ever imagine the Seat of the Common Sense to be placed in the Foot. In fine, there is no more reason to think the Common <hi>Senso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> is in the mouth of the Stomack, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>Sensible Commotions</hi> we feel there, then that it is seated in the Stars, because we so clearly perceive their Light, as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> has well answered upon like occasion. Nor can <hi>Phrensies</hi> and <hi>Madnesses,</hi> though they may sometimes be observed to take their rise from thence, any more prove that it is the Seat of the Common Sense, then the <hi>Furor uterinus,</hi> Apoplexies, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsies, and Syncopes proceeding from the Wombe, doe argue that the common <hi>Senso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> of Women lyes in that part.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And if we consider the great <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> betwixt the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Stomack</hi> and the <hi>Heart,</hi> whose <hi>Pathemata</hi> are so alike and conjoyned, that the Ancients have given one name to both parts, calling them promiscuously <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the pains of the Stomack <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55765:113"/>
as also that the <hi>Heart</hi> is that part from which manifestly are the supplyes of life, whence the <hi>Pulse</hi> ceasing life cannot long continue for want of warmth and Spirits; here is an evident reason, how it may happen that a Wound about the mouth of the Stomack may dispatch a man more suddainly then a wound in the Head, they being both supposed mortal, though the seat of the Sensitive Soule be not chiefly in the aforesaid Orifice. For partly the naturall Sympathy betwixt the Orifice of the <hi>Stomack</hi> and the <hi>Heart,</hi> and partly the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and pain perceived by the Soule in the common <hi>Sensorium,</hi> which we will suppose in the <hi>Head,</hi> does so dead the <hi>Heart,</hi> that, as in the suddain Passions above named, it ceases to perform the ordinary functions of Life, and so Pulse and Sense and all is gone in short time; when as the <hi>Head</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded mortally, Perception is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by so diminished, that the <hi>Heart</hi> scapes the more free from the force of that lethiferous passion; and so though Sense be gone, can continue the Pulse a longer time: which is a perfect answer to <hi>Helmont's</hi> stories he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites in his <hi>Sedes Animae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. To all which I may adde, That him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self does acknowledg in the end of that Treatise, that the power of Motion, of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55765:114"/>
Will, Memory and Imagination, is in the Brain; and therefore unless a man will say and deny any thing, he must say that the Common Sense is there also.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Opinion of <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> bears more credit and countenance with it, as having been asserted heretofore by Philosophers of great fame, <hi>Epicurus, Aristotle,</hi> and the School of the <hi>Stoicks:</hi> but if we look closer to it, it will prove as little true as the other; especially in his way, that holds there is no <hi>Soule</hi> in a Man, but that all is but <hi>organized Matter.</hi> For let him declare any Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reason whereby his <hi>Heart</hi> will be able to move his Finger. But upon this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis I have confuted this Opinion already. It is more maintainable, if there be granted a Soule in the Body, that the <hi>Heart</hi> is the chief Seat thereof, and place of <hi>Common Sense,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and others would have it, as also the spring of Spontaneous Motion. But it is very unlikely, that that part that is so continually employed in that naturall Motion of <hi>contracting and dilating</hi> it self, should be the Seat of that Principle which commands Free and Spontaneous progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: <hi>Perceptions</hi> also would be horribly disturbed by its squeezing of it self, and then flagging again by vicissitudes. Neither would Objects appear in the same place
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55765:114"/>
when the <hi>Heart</hi> is drawn up and when it is let down again, as I have above intimated: the extream heat also of it could not admit that it be affected with the gentle motions of the Objects of Sense, the Blood being there in a manner scalding hot. And it is in this sense that that Aphorisme in <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> is to be understood, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That which must receive the variety of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall impresses, must not be it self in any high temper or agitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Wherefore it is a very rash thing to assert, that the <hi>Heart</hi> is the Seat of <hi>Common Sense,</hi> unless by some plain experience it could be evinced to be so, whenas indeed Experiments are recorded to the contrary. As, that if we bind a Nerve, Sense and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be betwixt the Ligature and the Brain, but not betwixt the Heart and the Ligature. And that the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> his Heart being cut cut, will live for a considerable time, and fight, and defend himself. The like is observed of the <hi>Sea-Tortoise,</hi> and the <hi>wild Goat,</hi> as <hi>Calcidius</hi> writes. To which you may adde what <hi>Galen</hi> relates of sacrificed Beasts, that their Hearts being taken out and laid upon the Altar, they have been seen in the mean time not onely to breath, and roar aloud, but also to run away, till the expence of Blood has made them fall down.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55765:115"/>
Which Narrations to me are more credible, I having seen with mine own eyes a <hi>Frog</hi> quite exenterated, heart, stomack, guts and all taken out by an ingenious friend of mine, and dexterous Anatomist, after which the <hi>Frog</hi> could see, and would avoid any object in its way, and skipped as freely and nimbly up and down, as when it was entire, and that for a great while. But a very little wound in the <hi>Head</hi> deprives them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly of Life and Motion. Whence it is plain that the derivation of Sense and spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Motion is not from the <hi>Heart.</hi> For if the Motion be intercepted betwixt the <hi>Brain</hi> and the <hi>Heart,</hi> by <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his own concession, there will be no perception of the Object. And there is the same reason of the <hi>Orifice of the Stomack:</hi> so that this one Experiment does clearly evince these two Opinions to be erroneous.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And that no man hereafter may make any other unhappy choice in the parts of the Body, we shall now propose such Reasons as we hope will plainly prove, That the common <hi>Sensorium</hi> must needs be in the <hi>Head;</hi> or indeed rather repeat them: For some of those whereby we proved that the <hi>Heart</hi> is not the Seat of Common Sense, will plainly evince that the <hi>Head</hi> is. As that out of <hi>Laurentius,</hi> that a Nerve being
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55765:115"/>
tied, Sense and Motion will be preserved from the ligature up towards the <hi>Head,</hi> but downwards they will be lost. As also that experiment of a Frog, whose brain if you pierce will presently be devoid of Sense and Motion, though all the Entrals being taken out it will skip up and down, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise its senses as before. Which is a plain evidence that Motion and Sense is derived from the <hi>Head;</hi> and there is now no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to trace any Motion into a farther fountain, the <hi>Heart</hi> (from whence the <hi>Nerves</hi> were conceived to branch by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and from whence certainly the <hi>Veins and Arteries</hi> doe, as appears by every Anatomie) being so justly discharged from that office. To which it may suffice to adde the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those diseases that seize upon all the Animal functions at once, such as are the Lethargie, Apoplexie, Epilepsie, and the like, the causes of which Physicians find in the Head, and accordingly apply remedies. Which is a plain detection that the Seat of the Soule, as much as concerns the Animal Faculties, is chiefly in the <hi>Head.</hi> The same may be said of Phrensy and Melancholy, and such like distempers, that deprave a mans Imagination and Judgment; Physitians alwaies conclude something amiss within the <hi>Cranium.</hi> Lastly, if it were nothing but
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55765:116"/>
the near attendance of the outward Senses on the <hi>Soule,</hi> or her <hi>discerning Faculty,</hi> being so fitly placed about her in the <hi>Head;</hi> this, unless there were some considerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the contrary, should be sufficient to determine any one that is unprejudiced, to conclude that the Seat of Common Sense, Understanding, and command of Motion, is there also.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But now the greatest difficulty will be to define <hi>In what part thereof it is to be placed.</hi> In which, unless we will goe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldly and carelesly to work, we are to have a regard to Mechanicall congruities, and not pitch upon any thing that, by the advantage of this Supposall, <hi>That there is a Soule in man,</hi> may goe for possible; but to chuse what is most handsome and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That the <hi>whole Brain</hi> is not the Seat of Common Sense, appears from the wounds and cuts it may receive without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of that Faculty; for they will not take away <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> unless they pierce so deep as to reach the <hi>Ventricles of the Brain,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> has observed.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Nor is it in <hi>Regius</hi> his <hi>small solid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</hi> For besides that it is not likely the <hi>Centre of Perception</hi> is so minute, it is very incongruous to place it in a Body so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55765:116"/>
solid, more hard then Marble, or Iron. But this Invention being but a late freak of his petulant fancy, that has an ambition to make a blunder and confusion of all <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his Metaphysicall Speculations, (and therefore found out this rare quirk of wit to shew, how though the Soule were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Matter, yet it might be incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and immortal) it was not worth the while to take notice of it here in this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, which we have demonstrated to be true, viz. <hi>That there is a Soule in the Body, whose nature is immateriall or incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Nor are the <hi>Membranes in the Head</hi> the common <hi>Sensorium;</hi> neither those that envelop the Brain, (for they would be able then to see the light through the hole the <hi>Trepan</hi> makes, though the party Trepan'd winked-with his eyes; to say nothing of the conveyance of the Nerves, the Organs of externall Sense, that carry beyond these exteriour Membranes, and therefore point to a place more inward, that must be the <hi>Recipient</hi> of all their impresses) nor any <hi>Internall membrane,</hi> as that which bids fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest for it, the <hi>Septum Lucidum,</hi> as being in the midst of the upper Ventricle. But yet if the levell of Motion through the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Senses be accurately considered, some
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55765:117"/>
will shoot under, and some in a distant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, so that this Membrane will not be struck with all the Objects of our Senses. Besides that it seems odd and ridiculous that the centre of Perception should be either driven out so into plates, or spread into hollow convexities, as it must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, if we make either the externall or internall Membranes of the Brain the Seat of Common Sense.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The most likely place is some one of those that the three last Opinions point at, viz. either the <hi>Conarion,</hi> or the <hi>Concurse of the Nerves in the fourth Ventricle,</hi> or <hi>the Animal Spirits there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. The first is <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> Opinion, and not rashly to be refused, neither doe I find any Arguments hitherto that are valid enough to deface it. Those that are recited out of <hi>Bartholine,</hi> and subscribed to by the learned Author of <hi>Adenographia,</hi> in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension have not the force to ruin it: we will first repeat them, and then examine them.</p>
               <p>The first is, that this <hi>Glandula</hi> is too little to be able to represent the Images of all that the Soule has represented to her.</p>
               <p>The second, that the externall Nerves doe not reach to the <hi>Glandula,</hi> and that therefore it cannot receive the impress of sensible Objects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:55765:117"/>
The third, that it is placed in a place of excrements which would soile the species of things.</p>
               <p>The fourth, that the species of things are perceived there where they are carried by the Nerves. But the Nerves meet about the beginning or head of the <hi>Spinall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> a more noble and ample place then the <hi>Glandula pinealis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the first I answer, That the amplitude of that place where the Nerves meet in the <hi>Spinall Marrow,</hi> is not large enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the distinct impresses of all the Objects the mind retains in Memory. Besides, that the other parts of the Brain may serve for that purpose, as much as any of it can. For it is the Soule it self alone that is capable of retaining so distinct and perfect representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though it may make an occasionall use of some private marks it impresses in the Brain; which haply may be nothing at all like the things it would remember, nor of any considerable magnitude nor propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, such as we observe in the words <hi>Arx</hi> and <hi>Atomus,</hi> where there is no correspondency of either likeness or big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, betwixt the words and the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by them.</p>
               <p>To the second, That though there be no continuation of <hi>Nerves</hi> to the <hi>Conarion,</hi> yet
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55765:118"/>
there is of <hi>Spirits;</hi> which are as able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh the impresses of Motion from exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sense to the <hi>Conarion,</hi> as the Aire and <hi>AEther</hi> the impress of the Stars unto the Eye.</p>
               <p>To the third, That the <hi>Glandula</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently enough placed, so long as the Body is sound, for no excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours will then overflow it or besmeare it. But in such distempers wherein they doe, Apoplexies, Catalepsies, or such like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases will arise; which we see doe fall out, let the seat of <hi>Common Sense</hi> be where it will.</p>
               <p>To the last I answer, that the <hi>Nerves,</hi> when they are once got any thing far into the Brain, are devoid of Tunicles, and be so soft and spongy, that the motion of the Spirits can play through them, and that therefore they may ray through the sides, and so continue their motion to the <hi>Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> whereever their extremities may seem to tend.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But though these Arguments doe not sufficiently confute the Opinion, yet I am not so wedded to it, but I can think something more unexceptionable may be found out, especially it being so much to be suspected, that all Animals have not this <hi>Conarion;</hi> and then, that what pleased
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55765:118"/>
                  <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> so much in this Invention, was that he conceited it such a marvelous fine instrument to beat the Animal Spirits into such and such Pores of the Brain, a thing that I cannot at all close with for reasons above alledged. Besides that Stones have been found in this <hi>Glandula,</hi> and that it is apparent that it is environ'd with a net of veines and arteries, which are indications that it is a part assigned for some more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour office. But yet I would not dismiss it without fair play.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Wherefore that opinion of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Author, who places the Seat of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense in that part of the <hi>Spinall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> where the Nerves are suspected to meet, as it is more plain and simple, so it is more irrefutable, supposing that the Soul's <hi>Centre of perception</hi> (whereby she does not onely apprehend all the Objects of the externall Senses, but does imagine, reason, and freely command and determine the Spirits into what part of the Body she pleases) could be conveniently seated in such dull pasty Matter as the Pith of the Brain is; a thing, I must needs profess, that pleases not my Palate at all, and therefore I will also take leave of this opinion too, and adventure to pronounce, <hi>That the chief Seat of the Soule, where she perceives all Objects, where she
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55765:119"/>
imagines, reasons, and invents, and from whence she commands all the parts of the Body, is those purer Animal Spirits in the fourth Ventricle of the Brain.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. The first reason of his Opinion, the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Situation of these Spirits. 2. The second, that the Spirits are the immediate instrument of the Soule in all her functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 3. The proof of the second Reason from the generall Authority of Philosophers, and particularly of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> 4. From our Sympathizing with the changes of the Aire; 5.

From the recovery of Motion and Sense into a stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied part; 12. And lastly from what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in swooning fits, of paleness and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55765:119"/>
sharpness of visage, &amp;c. 13. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from all this, That the Spirits in the fourth Ventricle are the seat of Common Sense, and that the main use of the Brain and Nerves is to preserve the Spirits.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THat which makes me embrace this Opinion rather then any other is this, That first, this situation of the common <hi>Sensorium</hi> betwixt the Head and the trunk of the Body, is the most exactly conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to receive the impresses of Objects from both, as also to impart Motion to the Muscles in both the Head and in the Body. In which I look upon it as equall with the last Opinion, and superiour to all them that went before. For whatever may be objected is already answered in what I have said to the last Objection against <hi>Des-Cartes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But now in the second place, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this opinion of mine has a notorious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage above all else that I know) It is most reasonable that that Matter, which is the immediate instrument of all the Animal functions of the Soule, should be the chiefest Seat from whence and where she exercises these functions, and if there be any place where there is a freer plenty of the purest sort of this Matter, that her <hi>peculiar resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:55765:120"/>
should be there. Now the immediate instrument of the functions of the Soule is that <hi>thinner Matter</hi> which they ordinarily call Animal Spirits, which are to be found in their greatest purity and plenty in the <hi>fourth Ventricle of the Brain.</hi> From whence it must follow that that precious and choice part of the Soule which we call <hi>the Centre of perception</hi> is to be placed in that Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, not in any pith of the Brain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, but in the midst of these Spirits themselves; for that is the most naturall situation for the commanding them into the parts of the Head and Body, besides a more delicate and subtile use of them at home, in pursuing various imaginations and inventions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this <hi>thin and Spirituous Matter</hi> is the immediate engine of the Soule in all her operations, is in a manner the generall opinion of all Philosophers. And even those that have placed the Common <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorium</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> have been secure of the truth of this their conceit, because they took it for granted, that the left Ventricle thereof was the fountain of these pure and subtile Spirits, and please themselves very much, in that they fancied that Oracle of Physitians, the grave and wise <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> to speak their own sense so fully and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is to say, <hi>That the mind of man is in the left Ventricle of his Heart, and that it is not nourished from meats and drinks from the belly, but by a clear and lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Substance that redounds by separation from the blood:</hi> which is that which happens exactly in the Brain. For the Spirits there are nothing else but more pure and subtill parts of the blood, whose tenuity and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation makes them separate from the rest of the mass thereof, and so replenish the Ventricles of the Brain.</p>

Moreover our <hi>sympathizing</hi> so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly with the <hi>changes</hi> of the <hi>Aire,</hi> which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> also takes notice of, that in clear Aire our thoughts are more clear, and in cloudy more obscure and dull, is no slight indication that that which conveighs Sense, Thoughts and Passions immediately to the Soule, is very tenuious and delicate, and of a nature very congenerous to the Aire with which it changes so easily.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The strange <hi>Agility</hi> also of <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Cogitations</hi> that we find in our selves, has forced the most sluggish witts, even such as have been so gross as to deem the Soule
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55765:121"/>
                  <hi>Corporeall,</hi> yet to chuse the freest, subtilest and most active Matter to compound her of, that their imaginations could excogitate. And <hi>Lucretius,</hi> the most confident of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Sect, thinks he has hit the naile on the head in his choice, <hi>De rerum Nat. lib.</hi> 3. where he concludes thus,
<q>
                     <l>Nunc igitur quoniam est animi natura reperta</l>
                     <l>Mobilis egregie, per quam constare necesse est</l>
                     <l>Corporibus parvis &amp; laevibus atque rotundis:</l>
                  </q>
whose testimony I account the better in this case, by how much the more crass Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher he is, the necessity of the tenuity of particles that are to pervade the Body of a Man being convinced hence to be so plain, that the dimmest eyes can easily discover it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But we will advance higher to more forcible Arguments, amongst which this, I think, may find some place, That we cannot discover any immediate operation of any kind of Soule in the world, but what it first works upon that Matter which participates in a very great measure of this fineness and tenuity of parts, which will easily yield and be guided; as may be universally observed in all <hi>Generations,</hi> where the Body is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies organized out of thin fluid liquor, that will easily yield to the plastick power of the Soule. In which I doe not doubt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55765:121"/>
but it takes the advantage of moving the most subtile parts of all first, such as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his first and second element, which are never excluded from any such humid and tenuious substance: which elements of his are that true <hi>Heavenly</hi> or <hi>AEthereal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> which is every where, as <hi>Ficinus</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where saith Heaven is; and is that fire which <hi>Trismegist</hi> affirms is the most inward vehicle of the minde, and the instrument that God used in the forming of the world, and which the Soul of the world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she acts, does most certainly still use.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And to make yet a step further, That ocular demonstration that <hi>Henricus Regius</hi> brings <hi>Philos. Natur. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. seems to me both ingenious and solid. It is in a Snail, such as have no shells, moving in a glass: so soon as she begins to creep, certain Bubbles are discovered to move from her tail to her head; but so soon as she ceases moving, those Bubbles cease. Whence he concludes, That a gale of spirits that circuit from her head along her back to her tail, and thence along her belly to her head again, is the cause of her progressive motion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That such thin Spirits are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate instruments of Sense, is also discovered by what is observed in a <hi>Vertigo.</hi> For the Brain it self is not of such a fluid substance
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55765:122"/>
as to turn round, and to make external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects seem to doe so. Wherefore it is a sign that the immediate corporeal instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conveying the images of things is the Spirits in the Brain.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And that they are the chief Organ of Sight is plain in the exteriour parts of the Eye; for we may easily discern how full they are of that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>pure and lucid substance</hi> which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> speaks of, though he seat it in a wrong place; and how upon the passions of the minde these Spirits ebbe or flow in the Eye, and are otherwise wonderful-significantly modified, insomuch that the Soul even seems to speak through them, in that silent voice of Angels, which some fancy to be by nothing but by dumb shews, but I doe not at all believe it. It is also plain enough, that dimness of sight comes from deficiency of these Spirits, though the parts of the Eye otherwise be entire enough. The wider opening also of the pupill of one Eye upon the shutting of the other does indicate the flux and more copious presence of Spirits there, as <hi>Galen</hi> has ingeniously collected.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To which we may adde that in those more noble operations of the Minde, when she meditates and excogitates various Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems, that either she uses some part of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55765:122"/>
the Body as an Instrument then, or acts free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and independently of the Body. That the latter is false is manifest from hence, that then the change of Air, or Distemper and Diseasedness, could not prejudice her in her Inventive and purely Intellectuall O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations; but it is manifest that they doe, and that a mans Minde is much more cloudy one time then another, and in one Country then another, whence is that proverbiall Verse,
<q>
                     <l>Boeotûm crasso jurares aere natum.</l>
                  </q>
If she uses any part of the Body, it must be either these animal Spirits, or the Brain. That it is not the Brain, the very consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof so clammy and sluggish is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstration, which will still have the more force, if we consider what is most certainly true, That the Soul has not any <hi>power,</hi> or else exceeding little, <hi>of moving Matter;</hi> but her peculiar priviledge is of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Matter in motion;</hi> which the more subtile and agitated it is, the more easily by reason of its own mobility is it determined by her. For if it were an immediate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Soul to contribute motion to any matter, I doe not understand how that faculty never failing nor diminishing no more then the Soul it self can fail or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, that we should ever be weary of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55765:123"/>
In so much that those nimble-footed <hi>Maenades</hi> or she-Priests of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> with other agile Virgins of the Country, which <hi>Dionysius</hi> describes dancing in the flowry meadows of <hi>Maeander</hi> and <hi>Cayster,</hi> might, if life and limbs would last, be found dancing there to this very day, as free and frolick as wanton Kids (as he pleases to set out their activity) and that without any lassitude at all. For that immediate <hi>motive</hi> faculty of the Soul can still as fresh as ever impart mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the Body, and sooner consume it into air or ashes by heating and agitating it, then make her self weary or the Body seem so. Wherefore it is plain that that motion or heat that the Soul voluntarily confers upon the Body is by vertue of the Spirits, which she, when they are playing onely and gently toying amongst themselves, sends forth into the exteriour members, and so agitates and moves them: but they being so subtile and dissipable, the Soul spends them in using of them; and they being much spent, she can hardly move the Body any longer, the sense whereof we call <hi>Lassitude.</hi> These are the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the Souls immediate engine of <hi>motion</hi> through all the parts of the Body.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As they are also of <hi>Sense</hi> in the more
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55765:123"/>
remote parts, as well as in the Head, as <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelius</hi> handsomely insinuates by that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary example of a mans legge being stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or asleep, as some call it, by compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or whatever hinderance may be of the propagation of the Spirits into that part. For as sense and motion is restored, a man may plainly feel something creep into it tingling and stinging like Pismires, as he compares it; which can be nothing but the Spirits forcing their passage into the part. Wherein what they suffer is made sensible to the Soul, they being her immediate Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle of life and sense.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Lastly, in <hi>swooning fits,</hi> when <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> fails, the exteriour parts are <hi>pale</hi> and <hi>fallen,</hi> the Face looking more <hi>lean</hi> and <hi>sharp;</hi> of which there can be no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then that that benign gale of vital air, that fill'd up the parts before, is now absent and retreated from them; that is, that the <hi>fluid Spirits</hi> are retired, without which no <hi>sense</hi> nor <hi>motion</hi> can be performed: whence it is apparent that they are the immediate instrument of both.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I have proved that the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are the Souls immediate organ for <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>motion.</hi> If therefore there be any place where these Spirits are in the fittest plenty and purity, and in the most convenient si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55765:124"/>
for Animal functions; that in all reason must be concluded the chief seat and <hi>Acropolis</hi> of the Soul. Now the <hi>Spirits</hi> in the <hi>middle ventricle of the brain</hi> are not so indifferently situated for both the <hi>Body</hi> and the Head, as those in the <hi>fourth</hi> are; nor so pure. The upper Ventricles, being two, are not so fit for this office, that is so very much one and singular. Besides that the sensife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous impresses of motion through the eyes play under them; to say nothing how the Spirits here are less defaecate also then in the <hi>fourth</hi> Ventricle. Wherefore there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>sufficient plenty,</hi> and <hi>greatest purity,</hi> and <hi>fittest situation</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> in this <hi>fourth</hi> Ventricle, it is manifest that in these is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Centre of Perception,</hi> &amp; that they are the <hi>common Sensorium</hi> of the Soul. And that as the <hi>Heart</hi> pumps out <hi>Blood</hi> perpetually to supply the whole Body with nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to keep up the bulk of this edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Soul to dwell in, as also from the more subtile and agile parts thereof, to replenish the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Nerves</hi> with <hi>Spirits,</hi> which are the immediate instrument of the Soul for Sense and Motion; so it is plain likewise that the main use of the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Nerves</hi> is to keep these <hi>subtile Spirits</hi> from over speedy dissipation, and that the Brain with its Caverns is but one great round

               <argument>
                  <p>1. Several Objections against Animal Spirits. 2. An Answer to the first Objection touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Porosity of the Nerves. 3. To the second and third from the Extravasation of the Spirits and pituitous Excrements found in the Brain. 4.

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Demonstrations that there are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall Spirits in the Ventricles of the Brain.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BEfore we proceed to our other two Enquiries, we are forced to make a stop a while, and listen to some few Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made by some late Authours, who against the common stream of all other Philosophers, Physitians and Anatomists, are not ashamed to deny that there are any such things as <hi>Spirits</hi> in the Body; or at least that there are any in the Ventricles of the Brain. For as for the Nerves, say they,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55765:125"/>
they have no Pores or Cavities to receive them; and besides, it is plain that what is fluid in them is nothing but a milky white juice, as is observed in the pricking of a Nerve. And as for the Ventricles of the Brain, those Cavities are too big, and the Spirits if they issue into them, will be as extravasated Blood, whence they must needs be spoiled and corrupt. Besides that they will evaporate at those passages through which the mucous or pituitous excrements pass from the Brain. Whose appearance there is, say they, another great argument that these Ventricles were intended onely for receptacles and conveyances of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious Humours which the Brain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges it self of. Lastly, if Spontaneous Motion be made by means of these Spirits, it could not be so extremely sudden as it is, for we can wagge our finger as quick as thought, but corporeal Motion cannot be so swift. And if the Spirits be continued from the Head to the Finger, suppose, in the ligation of the Nerve there would be sense from the Ligature to the Fingers end; which is, say they, against Experience. These are the main Objections I have met withall in <hi>Hofman</hi> and others; but are such as I think are very easily answered: and indeed they doe in some sort clash some of them one with another.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:55765:125"/>
2. For how can the Nerves derive juice if they have no Pores, or are not so much as passable to these thin active Spirits we speak of? or from whence can we better conceive that juice to arise, then from these Spirits themselves, as they loose their agitation, and flag into a more gross consistency?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither can the Spirits be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as extravasated in the Ventricles of the Brain, more then the Blood in the Auricles or Ventricles of the Heart. Nor is there any fear of their sliding away through the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> the pituitous excrements having no passage there but what they make by their weight, as well as their insinuating moistness, which always besmearing these parts makes them more impervious to the light Spirits, whose agility also and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderancy with the outward Aire renders them uncapable of leaving the Caverns in which they are. That arguing from the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous excrements found there, that they were made onely for a Receptacle of such useless redundancy, is as ineptly inferred, as if a man should argue from what is found in the <hi>Intestinum rectum,</hi> that the Stomack and all the Intestines were made for a Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacle of Stercoreous excrement. The Spirits in the Ventricles of the Brain, playing about and hitting against the sides
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55765:126"/>
of the Caverns they are in, will in process of time abate of their agitation, the grosser parts especially; and so necessarily come to a more course consistency, and settle into some such like moist Sediment as is found at the bottome of the Ventricles, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dischargeth through fit passages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Spirits are left more pure. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this necessary faeculency is found in these Cavities, to conclude that that is the onely use of them, is as ridiculous as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre That because I spit at my Mouth, and blow my Nose, that that was the chief end and use of these two parts of my Body, or that my Eyes were not made for seeing, but weeping.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The nature of the swiftness of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in these Spirits is much like that of Light, which is a Body as well as they. But that Lucid Matter in the Sun does not, so soon as he appears upon the Horizon, fly so many thousand miles in a moment to salute our eyes; but Motion is propagated as it were at once from the Sun to our Eye through the aethereal Matter betwixt. Or suppose a long Tube, as long as you will, and one to blow in it; in a moment, so soon as he blows at one end, the Motion will be felt at the other, and that downwards as well as upwards, and as easily; to satisfie
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55765:126"/>
that other frivolous Objection I find in <hi>Hofman,</hi> as if it were so hard a business that these Spirits should be commanded downwards into the Nerves. But the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of this ancient and solid Opinion are very simple and careless.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That of the <hi>Ligature</hi> proves nothing. For though the Nerve betwixt the Ligature and the Finger be well enough stored with Spirits, yet the <hi>Centre of Perception</hi> being not there, and there being an interruption and division betwixt the Spirits that are continued to their Common <hi>Sensorium,</hi> and these on the other side of the Ligature; 'tis no more wonder, that we feel nothing on this side of the Ligature, then that we see nothing in our neighbours garden, when a wall is betwixt, though the Sun shine clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on both sides of the wall.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We see how invalid their Arguments are against this received Opinion of almost all both Physitians and Philosophers: It is needless to produce any for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, those which we have made use of for proving that the Spirits are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Instrument of the Soule, being of equall force most of them to conclude their existence in the Body. And yet for an overplus I will not much care to cast in a brief suggestion of the use of the <hi>Lungs,</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:55765:127"/>
which the best Physitians and Anatomists adjudge to be chiefly for conveighing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared aire to the Heart; as also of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te mirabile</hi> and <hi>Plexus Choroides,</hi> whose bare situation discover their use, that they may more plentifully evaporate the thinner and more agile particles of the Blood into the Ventricles of the Brain. The <hi>Diastole</hi> also of the Brain keeping time with the Pulse of the Heart, is a manifest indication, what a vehement steam of Spirits, by the direct and short passage of the <hi>Arteriae Carotides,</hi> are carried thither. For if one part of the Blood be more fiery and subtill then another, it will be sure to reach the Head. From whence considering the sponginess &amp; laxness of the Brain, and thinness of the Tunicles in the little Arteries that are there; it will follow by Mechanical necessity that the Ventricles thereof will be filled with that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> so fitly describes, though he fancy the Seat of it in an unfitting place. But the purest of these Spirits being in the fourth Ventricle, as <hi>Bartholine</hi> and others have judiciously concluded, it follows plainly from what has been alledged, <hi>That the</hi> Common Sensorium <hi>is to be placed in the midst of these purer Spirits of the fourth Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Brain.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. That the Soule is not confined to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sensorium.</hi> 2. The first Argument from the <hi>Plastick</hi> power of the Soule. 3.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE are now at leisure to resume the two remaining Enquiries; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer whereof is, whether the Soule be so in this fourth Ventricle, that it is essentially no where else in the Body, or whether it be spread out into all the Members. <hi>Regius</hi> would coup it up in the <hi>Conarion,</hi> which he believes to be the Common <hi>Sensorium,</hi> and so by consequence it should be confined to the fourth Ventricle, and not expatiate at all thence, supposing that the Seat of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense. The reason of this conceit of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55765:128"/>
his is this, That whatever is in the rest of the Body, may come to pass by powers meerly Mechanical; wherein he does very superstitiously tread in the footsteps of his Master <hi>Des-Cartes.</hi> But for my own part, I cannot but dissent, I finding in neither any sufficient grounds of so novell an Opinion, but rather apparent reasons to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As first the <hi>Frame of the Body,</hi> of which I think most reasonable to conclude the <hi>Soule</hi> her self to be the more particular <hi>Architect</hi> (for I will not wholly reject <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> his opinion;) and that the <hi>Plastick power</hi> resides in her, as also in the Soules of Brute animals, as very learned and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Writers have determined. That the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi> of the Body is out of the concurse of <hi>Atomes,</hi> is a meer precarious Opinion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground or reason. For Sense does not discover any such thing, the first rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life being out of some liquid ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneall Matter; and it is against reason, that the tumbling of Atomes or corporeall particles should produce such exquisite frames of creatures, wherein the acutest wit is not able to find any thing inept, but all done exquisitely wel everywhere, where the foulness and courseness of Matter has not been in fault. That God is not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Maker of these Bodyes, the particular
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55765:128"/>
miscarriages demonstrate. For there is no Matter so perverse and stubborn but his Omnipotency could tame; whence there would be no Defects nor Monstrosities in the generation of Animals. Nor is it so congruous to admit, that the <hi>Plastick</hi> faculty of the <hi>Soul of the World</hi> is the sole contriver of these Fabricks of particular creatures (though I will not deny but she may give some rude preparative stroaks towards Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:) but that in every particular world, such as Man is especially, his own Soule is the peculiar and most perfective Architect thereof, as the Soule of the World is of it. For this vitall Fabrication is not as in artificiall Architecture, when an external person acts upon Matter, but implies a more particular and near union with that Matter it thus intrinsecally shapes out and organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes. And what ought to have a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and close union with our Bodies then our Souls themselves? My opinion is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That the Soule, which is a Spirit, and therefore contractible and dilatable, begins within less compass at first in Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the fitly-prepared Matter, and so bears it self on in the same tenour of work till the Body has attained its full growth; and that the Soule dilates it self in the dilating of the Body, and so possesses it
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55765:129"/>
through all the members thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The congruity of this Truth will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discover it self, if we consider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the faculties of the Soule (of which you may read more fully in <hi>Enthusiasmus Triumphatus</hi> Artic. 3, 4, 5.) in what a natural graduality they arise till they come to the most free of all. The <hi>deepest</hi> or <hi>lowest</hi> is this <hi>Plastick power</hi> we have already spoke of, in virtue whereof is continued that perpetuall <hi>Systole</hi> and <hi>Diastole</hi> of the Heart, as I am more prone to think then that it is meerly Mechanical, as also that <hi>Respiration</hi> that is performed without the command of our Will: For the <hi>Libration</hi> or <hi>Reciprocation</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> in the <hi>Tensility</hi> of the <hi>Muscles</hi> would not be so perpetuall, but cease in a small time, did not some more mysticall Principle then what is meerly Mechanical give Assistance, as any one may understand by observing the insufficiency of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that <hi>Henricus Regius</hi> propounds for adaequate causes of such motions in the Body. These I look upon as the <hi>First Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> of the Soule, which may be bounded by this generall character, That the exercise of them does not at all imply so much as our Perception.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next to these is the <hi>Sensation of any externall Object,</hi> such as <hi>Hearing, Seeing,

Feeling,</hi> &amp;c. All which include <hi>Perception</hi> in an unresistible necessity thereof, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject being present before us, and no exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Obstacle interposing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Imagination</hi> is more free, we being able to avoid its representations for the most part, without any externall help; but it is a degree on this side <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> by which we correct and silence unallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fancies. Thus we see how the <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the Soule rise by <hi>Degrees;</hi> which makes it still the more easy and credible, that the <hi>lowest</hi> of all is competible to her as well as the <hi>highest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Moreover, <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Sympathies,</hi> in my judgment, are more easily to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into this Hypothesis of the Souls per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the whole Body, then in restraining its essentiall presence to one part thereof. For to believe that such an horrible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as, suppose, a Bear or Tiger, by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Motion from it through the eyes of an Animal to the <hi>Conarion,</hi> shall so reflect thence, as to determine the Spirits into such Nerves as will streighten the Orifice of the Heart, and lessen the Pulse, and cause all other symptomes of Fear; seems to me little better then a meer piece of <hi>Mechanical Credulity.</hi> Those Motions that represent the Species of things, being turned this way or
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55765:130"/>
the other way, without any such <hi>impetus</hi> of Matter as should doe such feats as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> speaks of in his Book of Passions. And that which he would give us as a pledg of this Truth is so false, that it does the more animate me to dis-believe the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, Artic. 13. For the wafting of one's hand neare the Eye of a mans friend, is no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof That externall Objects will necessarily and Mechanically determine the Spirits into the Muscles, no Faculty of the Soule intermedling. For if one be fully assured, or rather can keep himself from the fear of any hurt, by the wafting of his friends Hand before his Eye, he may easily abstain from winking: But if fear surprise him, the Soule is to be entitled to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not the meer <hi>Mechanisme</hi> of the Body. Wherefore this is no proof that the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Passions, with their conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, may be salved in brute Beasts by pure Mechanicks; and therefore neither in Men: but it is evident that they arise in us <hi>against</hi> both our <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Appetite.</hi> For who would bear the tortures of <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,</hi> if he could avoid it? And therefore the Soule sends not nor determines the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits thus to her own Torture, as she resides in the Head. Whence it is plain that it is the effect of her as she resides in the <hi>Heart</hi> and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55765:130"/>
                  <hi>Stomack,</hi> which sympathize with the horrid representation in the Common <hi>Sensorium,</hi> by reason of the exquisite unity of the Soul with her self, &amp; of the continuity of Spirits in the Body, the necessary instrument of all her Functions. And there is good reason the <hi>Heart</hi> &amp; <hi>Stomack</hi> should be so much affected, they being the chief Seats of those Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that maintain the life of the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the danger whereof is the most eminent Object of Fear in any Animal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. From this Principle, I conceive that not onely the <hi>Sympathy of parts</hi> in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Subject, but of <hi>different and distant Subjects,</hi> may be understood: such as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the party wounded, and the Knife or Sword that wounded him, besmeared with the Weapon-salve, and kept in a due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: Which certainly is not purely Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, but Magical, though not in an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sense; that is to say, it is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into meer Matter, of what thinness or subtilty soever you please, but into the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Soul of the Universe,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of the subtile Matter,</hi> which answers to our <hi>Animal Spirits.</hi> And in this sense it is that <hi>Plotinus</hi> sayes, that the World is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the grand</hi> Magus or <hi>Enchanter.</hi> And I doe not question, but that upon this score meerly, without the association of any
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55765:131"/>
Familiar Spirit, several odde things may be done, for evil as well as good. For this <hi>Spirit of the World</hi> has Faculties that work not by Election, but fatally or naturally, as several Gamaitus we meet withall in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seem somewhat obscurely to subindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Of this Principle we shall speak more fully in its due place.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But we have yet a more clear disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that our Soul is not confined to any one part of the Head, but possesses the whole Body, from the Perception of <hi>Pain</hi> in the parts thereof: For it is plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that so high a torture as is felt but in the pricking of a Pin, can be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the <hi>Centre of Perception</hi> upon a meer Mechanical account. For whether the <hi>immediate Instrument of Sense</hi> be the <hi>Pith of the Nerves,</hi> as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> would have it, or whether it be the <hi>Spirits,</hi> as is most true; it is ridiculous to think, that by the forcible parting of what was joyned together at ease (when this case is not communicated to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Pith of the Nerves,</hi> from the place of the Puncture, to the very seat of Common Sense) that the Soul there sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted should feel so smart a torment, unless that her very Essence did reach to the part where the pain is felt to be. For then the reason of this is plain, that it is the <hi>Unity of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55765:131"/>
Soul</hi> possessing the whole Body, and the <hi>Continuity of Spirits</hi> that is the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And it is no wonder, if the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation and natural composure of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be Rest and Ease to the Soul, that a violent disjoyning and bruising of them, and baring the Soul of them, as I may so speak, should cause a very harsh and torturous sense in the <hi>Centre of Perception.</hi> This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument bears undeniable Evidence with it, if we doe but consider the fuzziness of the <hi>Pith of the Nerves,</hi> and the fluidity of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and what little stress or crouding so small a thing as a Pin or Needle can make in such soft and liquid Matter.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Lastly, unless the very Essence of the Soul reach from the Common <hi>Sensorium</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> there will be very great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties how there should be so distinct a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of any visible Object: for it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to conceive that the <hi>Colours</hi> will not be confounded, and the bigness of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject diminished, and indeed that the image will not be quite lost before it can come to the Soul, if it be onely in the Common <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorium.</hi> For it is plain, and experience will demonstrate that there is a very perfect Image of the Object in the bottome of the Eye, which is made by the decussa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lines of Motion from it, thus:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55765:132"/>
The Line A. B. from the Object A. C. bears against that point in the bottome of <figure/> the Eye in B, and the line C. D. against the point D; whereby C. and A. are felt in their place, and in such a distance as they are in the Object C. A: and so of all the lines which come from the Object C. A. into the bottome of the Eye B. D. From whence the Object is felt in such a length and bredth as it is capable of being perceived in at such a distance from the Eye. And as the Motion that is conveyed from A. to B, and from C. to D, is felt there; so the modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it, whereby the Object in those parts may seem red, yellow, green, or any other colour, is felt there also. Whence it is plain that there will be an exquisite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, according to all circumstances of the Object, in the bottome of the Eye: so that if the Soul receive it there, and convey it thence to her <hi>Centre of Perception</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55765:132"/>
in the same circumstances, the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation will be compleat. But if the Soul be not there, but the conveyance thereof must be left to the bare laws of Matter, the Image will be much depraved, or lost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can come to the Common <hi>Sensorium.</hi> For this Motion must be propagated from B and D, till it come to the hole E, and so pass into the Optick Nerve, to be carried into the Brain, and so to the seat of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense: but betwixt B and E, or D and E, there may be the depainture of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry colours, whence it will be necessary that F be tinctured with the colour D, and G with the colour of both D and F; and so of the rest of the Lines drawn from the Object to the Eye: so that all their colours would be blended before they came to E. Now at that harsh flexure at E, where the visual Line is as crooked as B E R, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the experiments of Reflection and Refraction, the breadth or length of the Object C A. would be lost. For we must needs expect, that as it is in Reflections and Refractions, where the Object will appear in that Line that immediately conveys the sense of it, so here it must be also, and therefore the point C and A must appear about Q, whence the Object will shrivel up in a manner into nothing. And suppose
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55765:133"/>
it might appear in some tolerable latitude, for all this, the Brain being an opake sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, so soon as the Motion comes thither, it would be so either changed or lost, that the Image could not pass the opacity of it, in any splendour or entireness. Wherefore I do not doubt but that the Image which the Soul perceives is that in the Eye, and not any other corporeally producted to the inside of the Brain (where <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> would be so strangely depraved, if not quite obliterated) I mean it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the <hi>lucid Spirits</hi> in the bottome of the Eye, with the outward Light conveyed through the Humours thereof (which is the best sense of the Platonick <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>1. That neither the Soul without the Spirits, nor the Spirits without the presence of the Soul in the Organ, are sufficient causes of Sensation. 2. A brief declaration how Sensation is made. 3. How Imagination. 4. Of Reason and Memory, and whether there be any Marks in the Brain. 5. That the Spirits are the immediate Instrument

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AFter our evincing that the Soul is not confined to the Common <hi>Sensorium,</hi> but does essentially reach all the Organs of the Body; it will be more easy to determine the <hi>Nature of Sensation</hi> and other Operations we mentioned. For we have already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated these two things of main conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; <hi>That the Spirits are not sufficient of themselves for these Functions; nor the Soul of her self, without the assistance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi> as is plain in the interception or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Spirits by Ligature or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; whence it is, that Blindness some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens meerly for that the Optick Nerve is obstructed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:55765:134"/>
2. Wherefore briefly to dispatch our third Querie; I say in general, That <hi>Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is made by the arrival of motion from the Object to the Organ; where it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all the circumstances we perceive it in, and conveyed by vertue of the Souls presence there, assisted by her immediate Instrument the <hi>Spirits,</hi> by vertue of whose continuity to those in the Common <hi>Senso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> the Image or Impress of every Object is faithfully transmitted thither.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for <hi>Imagination,</hi> there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but that Function is mainly exercised in the chief seat of the Soul, those purer A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits in the fourth Ventricle of the Brain. I speak especially of that Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is most free, such as we use in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Inventions,</hi> or such as accompany the more severe Meditations and Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Philosophy, or any other Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all entertainments. For Fasting, fresh Aire, moderate Wine, and all things that tend to an handsome supply and depuration of the Spirits, make our thoughts more free, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and clear.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Reason</hi> is so involved together with <hi>Imagination,</hi> that we need say nothing of it apart by it self. <hi>Memory</hi> is a Faculty of a more peculiar consideration; and if the Pith of the Brain contribute to the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55765:134"/>
of any power of the mind, (more then by conserving the Animal Spirits) it is to this. But that the <hi>Brain</hi> should be stored with <hi>distinct images</hi> (whether they consist of the Flexures of the supposed <hi>Fibrillae,</hi> or the orderly puncture of Pores, or in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued modified Motion of the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, some in this manner, and others in that) is a thing, as I have already proved, utterly impossible. If there be any <hi>Marks</hi> in it, it must be a kind of <hi>Brachygraphie,</hi> some small dots here and there standing for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to Memory a series of things that would fill, it may be, many sheets of paper to write them at large. As if a man should tie a string about a friends finger to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a business, that a whole daies discourse, it may be, was but little enough to give him full instructions in. From whence it is plain that the <hi>Memory</hi> is in the Soule, and not in the <hi>Brain.</hi> And if she doe make any such Marks as we speak of, she having no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of them distinct from the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of those things which they are to remind her of, she must not make them by any <hi>Cognitive power,</hi> but by some such as is Analogous to her <hi>Plastick Faculty</hi> of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizing the Body, where she acts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But whether the Soule act thus or no
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55765:135"/>
upon the Brain, is a Matter of uncertain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; nor can it be demonstrated by any experiment that I know. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we will contain our selves within the capacities of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> which I have so often affirmed to be the immediate instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soule in all her operations, that Position will be more unexceptionable. And truly I doe not understand but that they and the Soule together will perform all the Functions of Memory that we are conscious to our selves of. And therefore I shall conclude that Memory consists in this, That the Soule has acquired a greater <hi>Promptitude</hi> to think of this, or that Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm, with the circumstances thereof, which were raised in her upon some occasion. Which <hi>Promptitude</hi> is acquired by either the often representation of the same Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasme to her; or else by a more vivid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press of it from its novelty, excellency, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievousness, or some such like condition that at once will pierce the Soule with an extraordinary resentment; or finally by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary attention, when she very carefully and on set purpose imprints the Idea as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as she can into her inward Sense. This <hi>Promptitude</hi> to think on such an Idea will lessen in time, and be so quite spent, that when the same Idea is represented again to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55765:135"/>
the Soule, she cannot tell that ever she saw it before. But before this inclination thereto be quite gone, upon this proneness to return into the same conception, with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, the <hi>Relative Sense</hi> of having seen it before (which we call <hi>Memory)</hi> does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily emerge upon a fresh representation of the Object.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But <hi>Forgetfulness</hi> arises either out of meer <hi>Desuetude</hi> of thinking on such an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or on others that are linked in with it, in such a Series as would represent it as past, and so make it a proper Object of Memory. Or else for that the <hi>Spirits,</hi> which the Soule uses in all her Functions, be not in a due temper; which may arise from overmuch <hi>Coolness,</hi> or <hi>Waterishness</hi> in the Head, to which alone <hi>Sennertus</hi> ascribes <hi>Obliviousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The last thing we are to consider is <hi>Spontaneous Motion.</hi> Which that it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the continuation of the <hi>Spirits</hi> from the Seat of Common Sense to the <hi>Muscles,</hi> which is the gross Engine of Motion, is out of doubt. The manner how it is, we partly feel and see; that is to say, we find in our selves a power, at our own pleasure to move this or the other member with very great force, and that the <hi>Muscle</hi> swels that moves the part; which is a plain indication of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Spirits, thither directed or there
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55765:136"/>
guided by our meer Will: a thing admirable to consider, and worth our most serious meditation. That this direction of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse of Motion is made by our meer Will, and Imagination of doing so, we know and feel it so intimately, that we can be of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more sure. That there is some fluid and subtile Matter, which we ordinarily call <hi>Spirits,</hi> directed into the <hi>Muscle</hi> that moves the Member, its swelling does evidence to our sight; as also the experience, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate use of wine which supplyes Spirits apace, will make this motion the more strong. As for the manner, whether there be any such <hi>Valvulae</hi> or no in the Nerve, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the opposite <hi>Muscles,</hi> as also in those that are proper to each, it is not materiall. This great <hi>priviledge</hi> of our Soules <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion of Matter thus,</hi> is wonderfull enough in either Hypothesis. But I look upon the <hi>Fibrous</hi> parts of the <hi>Muscle</hi> as the main engine of motion; which the Soule moistning with that subtil liquor of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, makes them swell and shrink, like Lute-strings in rainy weather: And in this chiefly consists that notable strength of our Limbs in spontaneous motion. But for those conceived <hi>Valvulae</hi> that Experience has not found out yet, nor sufficient Reason, they are to wait for admission till they bring
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55765:136"/>
better evidence. For the presence of the Animal Spirits in this Fibrous flesh, and the command of the Soule to move, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to salve all <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this kind. For upon the Will conceived in the <hi>Common Sensorium,</hi> that part of the Soule that resides in the <hi>Muscles,</hi> by a power near a-kin to that by which she made the Body and the Organs thereof, guides the Spirits into such Pores and parts, as is most requisite for the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the use of this excellent Fabrick.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And in virtue of some such power as this, doe we so easily <hi>walk,</hi> though we think not of it, as also <hi>breath,</hi> and <hi>sing,</hi> and <hi>play</hi> on the Lute, though our Mindes be taken up with something else. For Custome is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature: and though the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as being meerly corporeall, cannot be capable of any habits; yet the Soule, even in that part thereof that is not <hi>Cognitive,</hi> may, and therefore may move the Body, though <hi>Cogitation</hi> cease; provided the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be well replenished with Spirits, whose assistance in naturall motions of Animals is so great, that their Heads being taken off, their Body for a long time will move as before: as <hi>Chalcidius</hi> relates of <hi>Wasps</hi> and <hi>Hornets,</hi> who will fly about, and use their wings, a good part of an houre after they have lost their Heads: which is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb facs="tcp:55765:137"/>
to the residence of their Soule in them still, and the intireness of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, not easily evaporating through their crustaceous Bodies. For it is but a vulgar conceit to think, that the Head being taken off, the Soule must presently fly out, like a Bird out of a Basket, when the Lid is lifted up. For the whole World is as much throng'd with Body, as where she is; and that <hi>Tye</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> as yet not being lost, it is a greater engagement to her to be there then any where else. This motion therefore in the <hi>Wasp,</hi> that is so perfect and durable, I hold to be <hi>vitall;</hi> but that in the parts of dismembred creatures, that are less perfect, may be usually <hi>Mechanicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. We have now, so far forth as it is requisite for our design, considered the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Functions of the Soule;</hi> and have plainly demonstrated, that she is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance distinct from the Body, and that her very Essence is spread throughout all the Organs thereof: as also that the generall instrument of all her Operations is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>Spirits;</hi> which though they be not in like quantity and sincerity every where, yet they make all the Body so pervious to the impresses of Objects upon the externall Organs, that like Lightning they pass to the Common <hi>Sensorium.</hi> For it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55765:137"/>
that the Medium be so fine and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious as the Matter where the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile motion begins. Whence Light passes both Aire and Water, though Aire alone is not sufficient for such a motion as Light, and Water almost uncapable of being the Seat of the fountain thereof. This may serve to illustrate the passage of Sense from the Membranes (or in what other seat so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Spirits are most subtil and lucid) through thicker places of the Body to the very <hi>Centre of Perception.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Lastly, we have discovered a kind of <hi>Heterogeneity</hi> in the Soule; and that she is not of the same power every where. For her <hi>Centre of Perception</hi> is confined to the <hi>Fourth Ventricle</hi> of the Brain; and if the <hi>Sensiferous Motions</hi> we speak of be not faithfully conducted thither, we have no knowledg of the Object. That part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Soule is to be looked upon as most precious; and she not being an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Mass, as <hi>Matter</hi> is, but one part resulting from another, that which is the noblest is in all reason to be deemed the cause of the rest. For which reason (as <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesius</hi> calls God, on whom all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55765:138"/>
if we consider that from the highest <hi>Life,</hi> viz. the <hi>Deity,</hi> there does result that which has no <hi>Life</hi> nor <hi>Sense</hi> at all, to wit the <hi>stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Matter.</hi> Wherefore in very good Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie we may admit, that that pretious part of the Soule in which resides <hi>Perception, Sense,</hi> and <hi>Understanding,</hi> may send forth such an <hi>Essential Emanation from it self,</hi> as is utterly devoid of all Sense and Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which you may call, if you will, the <hi>Exteriour branches</hi> of the Soule, or the <hi>Rayes of the Soule,</hi> if you call that nobler and diviner part the <hi>Centre;</hi> which may very well merit also the appellation of the <hi>Eye of the Soule,</hi> all the rest of its parts being but meer darkness without it.

               <argument>
                  <p>1. An Answer to an Objection, That our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments will as well prove the Immortality of the Souls of Brutes, as of Men. 2. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objection inferring the Praeexistence of Brutes Souls, and consequently of ours. 3. The first Answer to the Objection. 4. The second Answer consisting of four parts. 5. First, That the Hypothesis of Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence is more agreeable to Reason then any other Hypothesis. 6. And not onely so, but that it is very solid in it self. 7. That the Wisdome and Goodness of God argue the truth thereof. 8. As also the face of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the World. 9. The second part of the second Answer, That the Praeexistence of the Soul has the suffrage of all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in all Ages, that held it <hi>Incorporeal.</hi> 10. That the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> the <hi>Indian Brachmans,</hi> the <hi>Persian Magi,</hi> and all the learned of the <hi>Jews</hi> were of this Opinion. 11. A Catalogue of particular famous persons that held the same. 12. That <hi>Aristotle</hi> was also of the same minde. 13. Another more clear place in <hi>Aristotle</hi> to this purpose, with <hi>Sennertus</hi> his Interpretation. 14. An Answer to an
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55765:139"/>
evasion of that Interpretation. 15. The last and clearest place of all out of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Writings.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. HAving thus discovered the Nature of the Soul, and that she is a <hi>Substance distinct from the Body;</hi> I should be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to treat of her <hi>Separation from it,</hi> did I not think my self obliged first, to answer an envious Objection cast in our way, whereby they would make us believe, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which we have used, though they be no less then Demonstrations, are meer Sophisms, because some of them, and those of not the least validity, prove what is very absurd and false, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Souls of Brutes</hi> also are <hi>Substances Incorporeal,</hi> distinct from the Body: from whence it will follow, that they are <hi>Immortal.</hi> But to this I have answered already in the <hi>Appendix to my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. and in brief concluded, That they are properly <hi>no more Immortal</hi> then the <hi>stupid Matter,</hi> which <hi>never perishes,</hi> and that out of a terrestrial Body they may have no more sense then it. For all these things are as it pleases the first Creatour of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To this they perversly reply, That if the Souls of Brutes subsist after death, and are then sensless and unactive, it will neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55765:139"/>
follow that they must come into Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies again. For it is very ridiculous to think that these Souls, having a Being yet in the world, and wanting nothing but fitly-prepared Matter to put them in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of living again, should be always neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and never brought into play, but that new ones should be daily created in their stead: for those innumerable Myriads of Souls would lie useless in the Universe, the number still increasing even to infinity. But if they come into Bodies again, it is evident that they <hi>praeexist:</hi> and if the Souls of Brutes <hi>praeexist,</hi> then certainly the Souls of Men doe so too. Which is an Opinion so wilde and extravagant, that a wry mouth and a loud laughter <hi>(the Argument that every Fool is able to use)</hi> is sufficient to silence it and dash it out of countenance. No <hi>wise man</hi> can ever harbour such a conceit as this, which every <hi>Idiot</hi> is able to confute by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting but with his own Memory. For he is sure, if he had been before, he could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber something of that life past. Besides the unconceivableness of the Approach and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of these praeexistent Souls into the Matter that they are to actuate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To this may be answered two things. The first, That though indeed it cannot be well denied, but that the concession of the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55765:140"/>
                  <hi>Praeexistence</hi> of the Souls of Brutes is a very fair introduction to the belief of the <hi>Praeexistence</hi> of the Souls of Men also; yet the sequel is not at all <hi>necessary,</hi> but one may be without the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The second is this, That if the sequel were granted, that no Absurdity can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from thence in Reason, if the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of Education, and the blinde suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of unconcerned Faculties, that have no right to vote here, be laid aside. To speak more explicitely, I say, This consequence of our Souls <hi>Praeexistence</hi> is more agreeable to Reason then any other Hypothesis what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; has been received by the most learned Philosophers of all Ages, there being scarce any of them that held the Soul of man <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi> upon the meer light of Nature and Reason, but asserted also her <hi>Praeexistence;</hi> That <hi>Memory</hi> is no fit Judge to appeal to in this Controversy; and lastly, That <hi>Tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Creation</hi> are as intricate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable as this opposed Opinion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I shall make all these four parts of my Answer good in order. The truth of the first we shall understand, if we compare it with those Opinions that stand in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with it, which are but two that are considerable. The one is of those that say, the Soule is <hi>ex traduce;</hi> the other of those
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55765:140"/>
that say it is <hi>created,</hi> upon occasion. The first Opinion is a plain contradiction to the <hi>notion</hi> of a Soul, which is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of an <hi>Indivisible,</hi> that is of an <hi>Indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible,</hi> Essence. The second Opinion implies both an Indignity to the Majesty of God, (in making Him the chief assistant and actour in the highest, freest, and most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way that the Divinity can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to act, in those abominable crimes of Whoredome, Adultery, Incest, nay Bugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it self, by supplying those foul coitions with new created Souls for the purpose:) and also an injury to the Souls themselves; that they being ever thus created by the immediate hand of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pure, innocent and immaculate, should be imprisoned in unclean, diseased and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Bodies, where very many of them seem to be so fatally over-mastered, and in such an utter incapacity of closing with what is good and vertuous, that they must needs be adjudged to that extreme calamity which attends all those that forget God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these two opinions being so incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, what is there left that can seem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but the <hi>Praeexistency</hi> of the Soul?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But I shall not press the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Opinion onely from comparing it with others, but also from the concin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55765:141"/>
that is to be found in it self. For as it is no greater wonder that every particular mans Soul that lives now upon Earth should be <hi>à mundo condito,</hi> then the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Matter of their Bodies should (which has haply undergone many Millions of Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Modifications, before it lighted into such a contexture as to prove the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Body of any one person in the world, has been in places unimaginably distant, has filed, it may be, through the triangular passages of as many Vortices as we see Stars in a clear frosty night, and has shone once as bright as the Sun (as the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Hypothesis would have all the Earth to have done) in so much that we eat, and drink, and cloath our selves with that which was once pure Light and Flame;) so that <hi>de facto</hi> they do bear the same date with the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World, that unavoidable cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Praeexistence of the Souls of Brutes does, according to the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of our Adversaries, fairly insinuate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But this is not all. Both the <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> of God, and Face of things in the world, out of which his <hi>Providence</hi> is not to be excluded, are very strong Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof to Reason unprejudiced. For first, if it be good for the Souls of men to be at all, the <hi>sooner</hi> they are the <hi>better.</hi> But
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55765:141"/>
we are most certain that the <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of God will doe that which is the <hi>best;</hi> and therefore if they can enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before they come into these terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Bodies (it being better for them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy themselves then not) they must <hi>be</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come into these Bodies; that is, they must be in a capacity of enjoying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without them for long periods of time, before they appeared here in this Age of the World. For nothing hinders but that they may live before they come into the Body, as well as they may after their going out of it: the latter whereof is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged even by them that deny the <hi>Praeexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Praeexistence</hi> of Souls is a necessary result of the Wisdome and Goodness of God, who can no more fail to <hi>doe</hi> that which is <hi>best,</hi> then he can to <hi>understand</hi> it: for otherwise his <hi>Wisdome</hi> would <hi>exceed</hi> his <hi>Benignity;</hi> nay there would be less hold to be taken of his Goodness, then of the Bounty of a very benign and good man, who, we may be well assured, will slip no opportunity of doing good that lies in his power, especially if it be neither <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> nor <hi>trouble</hi> to him; both which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances are incompetible to the Deity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Again, the face of <hi>Providence</hi> in the World seems very much to suit with this
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55765:142"/>
Opinion; there being not any so naturall and easy account to be given of those things that seem the most harsh in the affairs of men, as from this Hypothesis, <hi>That their Soules did once subsist in some other state; where, in severall manners and degrees, they forfeited the favour of their Creatour. And so according to that just Nemesis that He has interwoven in the constitution of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and of their own natures, they undergoe several calamities and asperities of fortune, and sad drudgeries of Fate, as a punishment inflicted, or a disease contracted from the severall Obliquities of their Apostasie.</hi> Which key is not onely able to unlock that recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite mystery of some particular Mens almost fatal aversness from all Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, their stupidity and dulness and even invincible slowness to these things from their very child-hood, and their uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible propension to all manner of Vice; but also of that squalid forlorneness and brutish Barbarity, that whole Nations for many Ages have layen under, and many doe still lye under at this very day. Which sad Scene of things must needs exceedingly cloud and obscure the wayes of Divine providence, and make them utterly unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible; unless some light be let in from the present Hypothesis we speak of. It is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55765:142"/>
plain therefore that there are very weighty Reasons may be found out, to conclude the <hi>Praeexistence of Soules.</hi> And therefore this Opinion being so demonstrable from this Faculty, and there being no other that can contradict it, (for that the verdict of <hi>Memory</hi> in this case is invalid I shall prove anon) we are according to the Light of Nature undoubtedly to conclude, that the Soules of Men doe praeexist, by Axiome 5.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And as this Hypothesis is Rationall in it self, so has it also gained the suffrage of all Philosophers of all Ages, of any note, that have held the Soule of Man <hi>Incorporeal</hi> and <hi>Immortall.</hi> And therefore I am not at all sollicitous what either the <hi>Epicureans</hi> or <hi>Stoicks</hi> held concerning this Matter; this contest being betwixt those onely that agree on this Truth, <hi>That the Soule is a Substance Immateriall.</hi> And such amongst the Philosophers as held it so, did unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously agree <hi>that it does Praeexist.</hi> This is so plain, that it is enough onely to make this challenge; every one in the search will satifie himself of the Truth thereof. I shall onely adde, for the better countenance of the business, some few instances herein, as a pledge of the Truth of my generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. Let us cast our Eye therefore into what corner of the World we will, that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55765:143"/>
has been famous for Wisdome and Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, and the wisest of those Nations you shall find the Assertours of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In <hi>Egypt,</hi> that ancient Nurse of all hidden Sciences, that this Opinion was in vogue amongst the wise men there, those fragments of <hi>Trismegist</hi> doe sufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For though there may be suspected some fraud and corruption in severall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in that Book, in reference to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Christianity; yet this Opinion of the <hi>Praeexistency of the Soule,</hi> in which Christianity did not interest it self, cannot but be judged, from the Testimony of those Writings, to have been a Branch of the Wisdome of that Nation: of which Opinion not onely the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> and other wise men of <hi>Egypt</hi> were, but also the <hi>Brachmans</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> and the <hi>Magi</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Persia;</hi> as you may plainly see by those <hi>Oracles</hi> that are called either <hi>Magicall</hi> or <hi>Chaldaicall,</hi> which <hi>Pletho</hi> and <hi>Psellus</hi> have commented upon. To these you may adde the abstruse Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which they call their <hi>Cabbala,</hi> of which <hi>the Soules Praeexistence</hi> makes a considerable part; as all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the <hi>Jewes</hi> doe confess. And how naturally applicable this Theory is to those three first mysterious chapters of <hi>Genesis,</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:55765:143"/>
I have, I hope, with no contemptible success, endeavoured to shew in my <hi>Conjectura Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. And if I should particularize in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of this Opinon, truly they are such, of so great fame for depth of Understanding and abstrusest Science, that their testimony alone might seem sufficient to bear down any ordinary modest man into an assent to their doctrine. And in the first place, if we can believe the <hi>Cabbala</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> we must assign it to <hi>Moses,</hi> the greatest Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher certainly that ever was in the world; to whom you may adde <hi>Zoroaster, Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Epicharmus, Empedocles, Cebes, Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides, Plato, Euclide, Philo, Virgil, Marcus Cicero, Plotinus, Iamblicus, Proclus, Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius, Psellus,</hi> and severall others which it would be too long to recite. And if it were fit to adde <hi>Fathers</hi> to <hi>Philosophers,</hi> we might enter into the same list <hi>Synesius</hi> and <hi>Origen:</hi> the latter of whom was surely the greatest Light and Bulwark that antient Christianity had; who unless there had been some very great Matter in it, was far from that <hi>levity</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> as to entertain an Opinion so vulgarly slighted and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by other men: and the same may be said of others that were Christians, as <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius, Psellus,</hi> and the late learned <hi>Marsilius
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55765:144"/>
Ficinus.</hi> But I have not yet ended my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue: that admirable Physitian <hi>Johannes Fernelius</hi> is also of this perswasion, and is not content to be so himself onely, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers those two grand Masters of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> to be so too; as you may see in his <hi>De abditis rerum cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. Cardan</hi> also, that famous Philosopher of his Age, expresly concludes, that the <hi>Rationall Soule</hi> is both a distinct Being from the <hi>Soule of the World,</hi> and that it does <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exist</hi> before it comes into the Body: and lastly <hi>Pomponatius,</hi> no friend to the Soules Immortality, yet cannot but confess, that the safest way to hold it, is also therewith to acknowledg her Praeexistence.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And that nothing may be wanting to shew the frivolousness of this part of the Objection, we shall also evince that <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that has the luck to be believed more then most Authors, was of the same opinion, in his Treatise <hi>De Anima</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 3. Where he speaks of the necessity of the qualification of the Body that the Soule is to actuate; and blaming those that omit that consideration, sayes, that they are as careless of that Matter, as if it were possible that, according to the <hi>Pythagorick fables,</hi> any Soule might enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Body. Whenas every Animall, as it has its proper species, so it is to have its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55765:144"/>
form. But those that define otherwise, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>They speak as if one should affirm that the skil of a Carpenter did enter into a Flute or Pipe; for every Art must use its proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and every Soule its proper Body.</hi> Where (as <hi>Cardan</hi> also has observed) <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> does not find fault with the opinion of the Soules going out of one Body into another, (which implies their Praeexistence:) but that the Soule of a Beast should goe into the Body of a Man, and the Soule of a Man into a Beasts Body; this is the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity that <hi>Aristotle</hi> justly rejects, the other Opinion he seems tacitely to allow of.</p>
               <p n="13">13. He speaks something more plainly in his <hi>De Generat. Animal.</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 11. <hi>There are generated,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the Earth, and in the moisture thereof, Plants and living Creatures; because in the Earth is the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and in the moisture Spirit, and in the whole Universe an Animal warmth or heat; insomuch that in a manner all places are full of Soules,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Adeò ut modo quodam omnia sint Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum plena,</hi> as <hi>Sennertus</hi> interprets the place: <hi>Aristotle</hi> understanding by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the same that he does afterwards by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that Principle we call <hi>Soule,</hi> according to the nobility whereof he asserts, that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are more or less noble; which assertion therefore reaches Humane Soules as well as these of Beasts.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Nor can this Text be eluded by being so injurious to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as to make him to assert that there is but one Soule in the world, because he sayes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For the text admitting of <hi>Sennertus</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position as well as this other; that which is most reasonable is to be attributed to him. Now if his meaning was, that there is but One Soule in the World that goes through all things, and makes the Universe one great Animal, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> would have it, he need not say that all places are <hi>in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> full of this Soule, but <hi>absolutely</hi> full of it, as our Body is <hi>wholly</hi> actuated by the Soule in it. And therefore the Sense must be, that all places indeed are in a manner full of Soules: not that they have opportunity to actuate the Matter, and shew their presence there by vitall operation; but are there dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mient as to any visible energie, till <hi>prepared Matter</hi> engage them to more sensible actions.</p>
               <p n="15">15. We will adde a third place still more clear, Lib. 2. Chap. 3. where he starts this very question of the <hi>Praeexistency of Soules,</hi> of the Sensitive and Rationall especially;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55765:145"/>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both kindes doe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is <hi>praeexist,</hi> before they come into the Body, or whether the Rationall onely; and he concludes thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i. e. <hi>It remains that the rationall or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Soule onely enter from without, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely of a nature purely divine, with whose actions the actions of this gross Body have no communication.</hi> Concerning which point he concludes like an Orthodox Scholar of his excellent Master <hi>Plato;</hi> to whose footsteps the closer he keeps, the less he ever wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the truth. For in this very place he does plainly profess, what many would not have him so apertly guilty of, that the Soule of man is immortall, and can perform her proper Functions without the help of this terrestriall Body. And thus I think I have made good the two first parts of my answer to the proposed Objection; and have clearly proved, that the <hi>Praeexistence of the Soule</hi> is an opinion both in it self the most rationall that can be maintained, and has had the suffrage of the renownedst Philosophers in all Ages of the World; and that therefore this sequel from our arguments for the Immortality of the

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AS for the two last Difficulties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Soules Memory of her former state,</hi> and <hi>the manner of her coming into the Body;</hi> I hope I shall with as much ease extricate my self here also, especially in the former. For if we consider what things they are that either quite <hi>take away,</hi> or exceedingly <hi>diminish</hi> our <hi>Memory</hi> in this
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55765:146"/>
life; we shall find the concurse of them all, and that in a higher degree, or from stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger causes, contained in our descent into this earthly Body, then we can meet with here: they none of them being so violent as to dislodge us out of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now the things that <hi>take away our Memory here,</hi> are chiefly these; either <hi>the want of opportunity of being reminded of a thing,</hi> as it happens with many, who rise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident they slept without dreaming such a night, and yet before they goe to bed again, recover a whole Series of representations they had in their last sleep, by something that sell out in the day, without which it had been impossible for them to recall to minde their Dream. Or else, in the second place, <hi>Desuetude of thinking of a Matter;</hi> whereby it comes to pass, that what we have earnestly meditated, laboured for, and pen'd down with our own hands when we were at Schoole, were it not that we saw our names written under the Exercise, we could not acknowledg for ours when we are grown men. Or lastly, <hi>some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable change in the frame and temper of our Body,</hi> whether from some externall mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, or from some violent Disease, or else from old age, which is disease enough of it self: which often doe <hi>exceedingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:55765:147"/>
if not <hi>quite take away,</hi> the <hi>Memory,</hi> though the Soule be still in the <hi>same</hi> Body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now all these Principles of Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, namely <hi>the want of something to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minde us, Desuetude of thinking, and an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary change in the Body,</hi> are more eminently to be found in the <hi>Descent</hi> of the Soule into these Earthly prisons, then can happen to her for any time of her <hi>abode</hi> therein. For there is a greater <hi>difference,</hi> in all probability, betwixt that Scene of things the Soule sees out of the Body and in it, then betwixt what shee sees sleeping and waking: and the perpetuall occursions of this present life continue a long <hi>Desue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of thinking on the former. Besides that their descent hither in all likelihood scarce befalls them but in their state of <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Inactivity,</hi> in which myriads of Soules may haply be for many Ages, as the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of this Opinion may pretend, by reason of the innumerable expirations of the <hi>aëreal periods of life,</hi> and the more narrow Lawes of <hi>preparing terrestrial Matter.</hi> And lastly, her coming into this Earthly Body is a greater and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous change, for the utter spoiling of the memory of things she was acquainted with before, then any Mischance or Disease can be for the bringing upon her a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55765:147"/>
of what she has known in this life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And yet that <hi>Diseases and Casualties</hi> have even utterly taken away all memory, is amply recorded in History. As that <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sala Corvinus</hi> forgot his own name; that one, by a blow with a stone, forgot all his learning; another, by a fall from an Horse, the name of his Mother and kinsfolks. A young Student of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> by a wound, lost his Memory so, that he was fain to be taught the letters of the Alphabet again. The like befell a <hi>Franciscan</hi> after a Feaver. And Thucydides writes of some, who after their recovery from that great Pestilence at <hi>Athens,</hi> did not onely forget the names and persons of their friends, but themselves too, not knowing who themselves were, nor by what name they were called:
<q>
                     <l>Atque etiam quosdam cepisse oblivia rerum</l>
                     <l>Cunctarum, ne<expan>
                           <am>

                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> se possent cognoscere ut ipsi;</l>
                  </q>
as the Poet <hi>Lucretius</hi> sadly sets down in his description of that devouring Plague, out of the fore-named Historian.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore without a miracle it is impossible the Soule should remember any particular circumstance of her former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, though she did really <hi>praeexist,</hi> and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55765:148"/>
was in a capacity of acting before she came into this Body, (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> plainly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges she was) her change being far greater by coming into the Body then can ever be made while she staies in it. Which we haply shall be yet more assured of, after we have considered <hi>the manner of her descent,</hi> which is the last Difficulty objected.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I might easily decline this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, by pleading onely, that the entrance of the Soule into the Body, supposing her <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> is as intelligible as in those other two wayes, of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Traducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For how this <hi>newly-created</hi> Soule is <hi>infused</hi> by God, no man knowes; nor how, if it be <hi>traducted</hi> from the Parents, both their Soules contribute to the making up a new one. For if there be decision of part of the Soule of the Male, in the injection of his seed into the matrix of the Female, and part of the Female Soule to joyn with that of the Males; besides that the decision of these parts of their Soules makes the Soule a <hi>Discerpible essence,</hi> it is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable how these <hi>two parts</hi> should make up <hi>one Soule</hi> for the Infant: a thing ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous at first view. But if there be no decision of any parts of the Soule, and yet the Soule of the Parent be the cause of the Soule of the Childe, it is perfectly an act of <hi>Creation;</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:55765:148"/>
a thing that all sober men conclude incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible to any particular Creature. It is therfore plainly unintelligible, how any Soul should pass from the Parents into the Body of the seed of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> to actuate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it: which might be sufficient to stop the mouth of the Opposer, that pretends such great obscurities concerning the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of <hi>Praeexistent Souls</hi> into their <hi>Bodies.</hi>

                  <p>1. The knowledge of the difference of <hi>Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and the Soules Union with them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the understanding how she enters into this Earthly Body. 2.

That <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes onely two Vehicles, <hi>Terrestriall</hi> and <hi>AEthereall;</hi> which is more then sufficient to prove the Soul's Oblivion of her former state. 6. That the ordinary Vehicle of the Soule after death is Aire. 7. The duration of the Soule in her severall Vehicles. 8. That the Union of the Soule with her Vehicle

In what <hi>Vital congruity</hi> of the Soule consists, and how it changing, the Soule may be free from her aiery Vehicle, without violent precipitation out of it. 11. Of the manner of the descent of Souls into Earthly Bodies. 12. That there is so little Absurdity in the <hi>Praeexistence of Soules,</hi> that the concession thereof can be but a very small prejudice to our Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of her Immortality.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BUT I shall spend my time better in clearing the Opinion I here defend, then in perplexing that other that is so gross of it self, that none that throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the nature of the Soule, can so much as allow the possibility thereof: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the better conceiving, how a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent Soule</hi> may enter this <hi>Terrestriall Body,</hi> there are two things to be enquired into; <hi>the difference of the Vehicles of Soules,</hi> and <hi>the cause of their union with them.</hi> The <hi>Platonists</hi> doe chiefly take notice of <hi>Three</hi> kindes of <hi>Vehicles, AEthereal, AEreal,</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial,</hi> in every one whereof there may be several degrees of purity and impurity, which yet need not amount to a new Species.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This notion of <hi>Vehicles,</hi> though it
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55765:149"/>
be discoursed of most in the School of <hi>Plato,</hi> yet is not altogether neglected by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as appears in his <hi>De Generat. Animal.</hi> Lib. 2. Cap. 3. where, though he does not use the Name, yet he does expresly acknowledge the Thing it self: For he does plainly affirm, that every Soule partakes of a Body distinct from this organized terrestriall Body, and of a more divine nature then the Elements so called; and that as one Soule is more noble then another, so is the difference of this diviner Body; which yet is nothing else with him then that warmth or heat in the seed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is not fire, but a Spirit contained in the spumeous seed; and in this Spirit a nature analogous to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stars.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of which neither <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself had, nor any one else can have, so explicite an apprehension as those that understand the first and second Element of <hi>Des-Cartes;</hi> which is the most subtill and active Body that is in the World, &amp; is of the very same nature that the Heaven and Stars are, that is to say, is the very Body of Light, (which is to be understood chiefly of the first Element) though so mingled with other Matter here below that it does not shine, but is the Basis of all that naturall warmth in all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55765:150"/>
and the immediate instrument of the Soule, when it organizeth any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the figure or shape of an Animall; as I have also intimated elsewhere, when I proved, <hi>that the Spirits are the immediate instrument of the Soule in all Vital and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal functions.</hi> In which Spirits of necessity is contained this <hi>Coelestiall</hi> Substance, which keeps them from congealing, as it does also all other liquid bodies, and must needs be in the Pores of them; there being no <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the whole comprehension of Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The full and express meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Aristotles</hi> text must be this, that in the spumeous and watry or terrene moisture of the seed is contained a Body of a more spirituous or aëreal consistency, and in this aëreal or spirituous consistency is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a nature that is analogous or like to the Element of the stars,</hi> namely that is of it self <hi>aethereal</hi> and <hi>lucid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And it is this <hi>Vehicle</hi> that <hi>Aristotle</hi> seems to assert that the Soule does act in, separate from the Body; as if she were ever either in this <hi>terrestrial</hi> Body, or in her <hi>aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> one: which if it were true, so vast a change must needs obliterate all <hi>Memory</hi> of her former condition, when she is once
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55765:150"/>
plunged into this earthly prison. But it seems not so probable to me, that Nature admits of so great a Chasme; nor is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to suppose it, for this purpose: the descent of the Soule out of her <hi>aiery</hi> Vehicle into this terrestrial Body, and besmearing moisture of the first rudiments of life, being sufficient to lull her into an eternall oblivion of whatever hapned to her in that other condition; to say nothing of her long state of <hi>Silence</hi> and Inactivity before her turn come to revive in an earthly body.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore not letting go that more orderly conceit of the <hi>Platonists;</hi> I shall make bold to assert, that the Soule may live and act in an <hi>aëreal</hi> Vehicle as well as in the <hi>aethereal;</hi> and that there are very few that arrive to that high happiness, as to acquire a <hi>Coelestial</hi> Vehicle immediatly upon their quitting the <hi>terrestrial</hi> one: that <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Chariot</hi> necessarily carrying us in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to the greatest happiness the Soule of man is capable of: which would arrive to all men indifferently, good and bad, if the parting with this earthly Body would sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly mount us into the heavenly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by a just <hi>Nemesis,</hi> the Soules of Men that are not very Heroically vertuous, will finde themselves restrained within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of this caliginous Aire, as both Reason
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55765:151"/>
it self will suggest, and the <hi>Platonists</hi> have unanimously determined.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We have competently described the difference of those <hi>three kinds</hi> of <hi>Vehicles,</hi> for their <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>consistency.</hi> The <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> adde to this the difference of <hi>duration,</hi> making some of them of that nature as to entertain the Soule a longer time in them, others a shorter. The shortest of all is that of the <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Vehicle. In the <hi>Aëreal</hi> the Soule may inhabit, as they define, many Ages, and in the <hi>AEthereal</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But this makes little to the clearing of the <hi>manner of their descent</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which cannot be better understood, then by considering their Union with the Body ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, or indeed with any kinde of Body whatever, where the Soul is held captive, and cannot quit her self thereof by the free <hi>imperium</hi> of her own Imagination and Will. For what can be the cause of this cohaesion, the very essence of the Soul being so easily penetrative of Matter, and the dimensions of all Matter being alike penetrable every where? For there being no more <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> in a Vessel filled with <hi>Lead</hi> then when it is full of <hi>Water,</hi> nor when full with <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> then when with <hi>Aire,</hi> or what other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler Body soever that can be imagined in the Universe; it is manifest that the <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:55765:151"/>
of Matter is every where alike, and alike penetrable and passable to the Soul. And therefore it is unconceivable how her Union should be so with any of it, as that she should not be able at any time to glide free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from one part thereof to another as she pleases. It is plain therefore, that this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul with Matter does not arise from any such gross Mechanical way, as when two Bodies stick one in another by reason of any toughness and viscosity, or straight commissure of parts; but from a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi> of another nature, which I know not better how to term then <hi>Vital:</hi> which <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> is chiefly in the Soul it self, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the noblest Principle of Life; but is also in the Matter, and is there nothing but such modification thereof as fits the <hi>Plastick</hi> part of the Soul, and tempts out that Faculty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Not that there is any <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> with which this in the Soul should sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize and unite; but it is termed <hi>Vital</hi> because it makes the <hi>Matter</hi> a congruous Subject for the Soul to reside in, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the functions of life. For that which has no life it self, may tie to it that which has. As some men are said to be tied by the teeth, or tied by the ear, when they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the pleasure they are struck with
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55765:152"/>
from good Musick or delicious Viands. But neither is that which they eat alive, nor that which makes the Musick, neither the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, nor the Air that conveys the sound. For there is nothing in all this but meer Matter and corporeal motion, and yet our vital functions are affected thereby. Now as we see that the <hi>Perceptive</hi> part of the Soul is thus vitally affected with that which has no life in it, so it is reasonable that the <hi>Plastick</hi> part thereof may be so too; That there may be an Harmony betwixt Matter thus and thus modified, and that Power that we call <hi>Plastick,</hi> that is utterly devoid of all Perception. And in this alone consists that which we call <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> in the prepared Matter, either to be organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or already shaped into the perfect form of an Animal.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And that <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> which is in the Soul, I mean in the <hi>Plastick</hi> part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is analogous to that Pleasure that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Sense, or rather to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of receiving it, when the Sense is by agreeable motions from without or in the Body it self very much gratified, and that whether the Minde will or no. For there are some Touches that will in their Perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption seem pleasant, whether our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have them so or not. What
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55765:152"/>
this is to the <hi>Perceptive</hi> part of the Soul, that other Congruity of Matter is to the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick.</hi> And therefore that which ties the Soul and this or that Matter together, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible and unperceptible pleasure, if I may so call it, arising from the <hi>congruity</hi> of Matter to the <hi>Plastick</hi> faculty of the Soul: which Congruity in the Matter not failing, nor that in the Soul, the Union is at least as necessary as the continuation of eating and drinking, so long as Hunger and Thirst continues, and the Meat and Drink proves good. But either satiety in the Stomack, or some ill tast in the Meat may break the congruity on either side, and then the action will cease with the pleasure thereof. And upon this very account may a Soul be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to quit her <hi>aiery</hi> Vehicle within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain period of Ages, as the <hi>Platonists</hi> hold she does, without any violent precipitation of her self out of it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. What are the strings or cords that tie the Soul to the Body, or to what Vehicle else soever, I have declared as clearly as I can. From which it will be easy to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the manner of her descent. For assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, the same cords or strings that tie her there, may draw her thither: Where the carcass is, there will the Eagles be gathered. Not that she need use her <hi>Perceptive</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55765:153"/>
in her descent, as Hawks and Kites by their sight or smelling fly directly to the lure or the prey: but she being within the <hi>Atmosphear</hi> (as I may so call it) of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so her <hi>Plastick</hi> power being reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and toucht by such an invisible reek, (as Birds of prey are, that smell out their food at a distance;) she may be fatally carried, all Perceptions ceasing in her, to that Matter that is so fit a receptacle for her to exercise her efformative power upon. For this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick-sphere,</hi> as I may so term it, that has this power of conjuring down Souls into earthly Bodies, the nearer the Centre, the vertue is the stronger; and therefore the Soul will never cease till she has slided into the very Matter that sent out those rays or subtile reek to allure her. From whence it is easy to conceive that the Souls of Brutes also, though they be not able to exercise their <hi>Perceptive</hi> faculty out of a terrestrial body, yet they may infallibly finde the way again into the world, as often as Matter is fitly prepared for generation. And this is one Hypothesis, and most intelligible to those that are pleased so much with the opinion of those large Sphears they conceive of <hi>emissary Atomes.</hi> There is also another, which is the Power and Activity of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nature</hi> or <hi>Inferiour Soul of the World,</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:55765:153"/>
who is as fit an Agent to transmit particular Souls, as she is to move the parts of Matter. But of this hereafter.</p>
               <p n="12">12. What has been said is enough for the present to illustrate the pretended obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and unconceivableness of this Mystery. So that I have fully made good all the four parts of my Answer to that Objection that would have supplanted the force of my strongest Arguments for the Souls Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and have clearly proved, that though this sequel did necessarily result from them, <hi>That the Souls both of Men and Beasts did Prae-exist,</hi> yet to unprejudiced reason there is no Absurdity nor Inconvenience at all in the Opinion.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. COncerning the <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>local</hi> Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Soul from the Body, it is manifest that it is to be understood of this <hi>Terrestrial Body.</hi> For to be in such a separate state, as to be where no Body or Matter is,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55765:154"/>
is to be out of the World: the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse being so thick set with Matter, or Body, that there is not to be found the least vacuity therein. The question therefore is onely, whether upon death the Soul can pass from the Corps into some other place. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus Regius</hi> seems to arrest her there by that <hi>general law of Nature,</hi> termed the <hi>law of Immutability;</hi> whereby every thing is to continue in the same condition it once is in, till something else change it. But the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this law is very grosly injust in this case. For as I have above intimated, the Union of the Soul with the Body is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain terms; neither is every peece of Matter fit for every Soul to unite with, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> of old has very solidly concluded. Wherefore that condition of the Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not kept, the Soul is no longer engaged to the Body. What he here says for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of himself, is so arbitrarious, so chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish and ridiculous, that, according to the merit thereof, I shall utterly neglect it, and pass it by, not vouchsafing of it any Answer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others are much puzled in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, how the Soul can get out of the Body, being imprisoned and lockt up in so close a Castle. But these seem to forget both the nature of the Soul, with the tenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of her Vehicle, and also the Anatomy of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55765:155"/>
the Body. For considering the nature of the Soul her self, and of Matter which is alike penetrable every where, the Soul can pass through solid Iron and Marble as well as through the soft Air and AEther; so that the thickness of the Body is no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her. Besides, her Astral Vehicle is of that tenuity, that it self can as easily pass the smallest pores of the Body, as the Light does Glass, or the Lightning the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard of a Sword without tearing or scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. And lastly, whether we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that principal seat of the <hi>Plastick</hi> power, the <hi>Heart,</hi> or that of <hi>Perception,</hi> the <hi>Brain;</hi> when a man dies, the Soul may collect her self and the small residue of Spirits (that may haply serve her in the inchoation of her new Vehicle) either into the Heart, whence is an easy passage into the Lungs, and so out at the Mouth; or else into the Head, out of which there are more doors open then I will stand to number. These things are very easily imaginable, though as invisible as the Air, in whose element they are transacted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But that they may still be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly understood, I shall resume again the consideration of that Faculty in the <hi>Plastick</hi> part of the Soul, which we call <hi>Vital Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity.</hi> Which according to the number of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55765:155"/>
Vehicles, we will define to be threefold, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial, AEreal,</hi> and <hi>AEthereal</hi> or <hi>Coelestial.</hi> That these <hi>Vital Congruities</hi> are found, some in some kinde of Spirits, and others in othersome, is very plain. For that the <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial</hi> is in the Soul of Brutes and in our own is without controversie; as also that the <hi>AEreal</hi> in that kinde of Beings which the Ancients called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and lastly, that the <hi>Heavenly</hi> and <hi>AEthereal</hi> in those Spirits that Antiquity more properly called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as being Inhabitants of the Heavens. For that there are such <hi>AEreal</hi> and <hi>AEthereal Beings</hi> that are analogous to <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Animals; if we compare the nature of God with the Phaenomena of the world, it cannot prove less then a Demonstration. For this Earth that is replenisht with living Creatures, nay put in all the Planets too that are in the world, and fancy them inhabited, they all joyned together bear not so great a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the rest of the liquid Matter of the Universe (that is in a nearer capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vehicle of Life) as a single Cumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed to the Globe of the Earth. But how ridiculous a thing would it be, that all the Earth beside being neglected, onely one peece thereof no better then the rest, nor bigger then the smallest seed, should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited? The same may be said also of the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:55765:156"/>
compass of the Aire; and therefore it is necessary to enlarge their Territories, and confidently to pronounce there are <hi>AEthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Animals,</hi> as well as <hi>Terrestrial</hi> and <hi>AEreal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is plain therefore that these three <hi>Congruities</hi> are to be found in severall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but that which makes most to our purpose, is to finde them in one, and that in the Soule of Man. And there will be an easy intimation thereof, if we consider the vast difference of those Faculties that we are sure are in her <hi>Perceptive</hi> part, and how they occasionally emerge, and how upon the laying asleep of one, others will spring up. Neither can there be any greater difference betwixt the highest and lowest of these <hi>Vitall congruities</hi> in the <hi>Plastick</hi> part, then there is betwixt the highest and lowest of those Faculties that result from the <hi>Perceptive.</hi> For some Perceptions are the very same with those of <hi>Beasts;</hi> others little inferiour to those that belong to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> as we ordinarily call them; some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly brutish, others purely divine: why therefore may there not reside so great a Latitude of capacities in the <hi>Plastick</hi> part of the Soule, as that she may have in her all those three <hi>Vitall Congruities,</hi> whereby she may be able livingly to unite as well
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55765:156"/>
with the <hi>Coelestial</hi> and <hi>AEreal Body,</hi> as with this <hi>Terrestrial</hi> one? Nay, our nature being so free and multifarious as it is, it would seem a reproach to Providence, to deny this capacity of living in these several Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles; because that <hi>Divine Nemesis</hi> which is supposed to rule in the world, would seem defective without this contrivance. But without controversy, Eternall Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Justice has forecast that which is the best: and, unless we will say nothing at all, we having nothing to judge by but our own Faculties, we must say that the Forecast is according to what we, upon our most accurate search, doe conceive to be the best. For there being no Envy in the Deity, as <hi>Plato</hi> somewhere has noted, it is not to be thought but that He has framed our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties so, that when we have rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared our selves for the use of them, they will have a right correspondency with those things that are offered to them to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate in the world. And truly if we had here time to consider, I doe not doubt but it might be made to appear a very rationall thing, that there should be such an <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion</hi> as the Soule of man, that had a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city (as some Creatures have to live either in the Water or on the Earth) to change her Element, and after her abode here in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55765:157"/>
this <hi>Terrestrial Vehicle</hi> amongst Men and Beasts, to ascend into the company of the <hi>AEreal Genii,</hi> in a Vehicle answerable to their nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Supposing then this triple capacity of <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> in the Soule of Man, the manner how she may leave this Body is very intelligible. For the Bodies fitness of temper to retain the Soule being lost in Death, the lower <hi>Vitall Congruity</hi> in the Soule looseth its Object, and consequently its Operation. And therefore as the letting goe one thought in the <hi>Perceptive part</hi> of the Soule is the bringing up another; so the ceasing of one <hi>Vitall Congruity</hi> is the wakening of another, if there be an Object, or Subject, ready to entertain it; as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is, partly in the Body, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without it. For there is a vitall Aire that pervades all this lower world, which is continued with the life of all things, and is the chiefest Principle thereof. Whence <hi>Theon</hi> in his <hi>Scholia</hi> upon <hi>Aratus</hi> interprets that Hemistich
<q>
                     <l>—<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</l>
                  </q>
in a secondary meaning as spoken of the Aire, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the naturall <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in whom, in an inferiour sense, we may be said <hi>to live, and move,</hi> and <hi>have our Being:</hi> for without
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55765:157"/>
Aire, neither Fishes, Fowls, nor Beasts can subsist, it administring the most immediate matter of life unto them, by feeding &amp; refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Animal Spirits. Wherefore upon the cessation of the lowest <hi>Vitall Congruity,</hi> that AEreal capacity awakening into Act, and finding so fit Matter every where to employ her self upon, the Soule will not faile to leave the Body; either upon choice, by the power of her own Imagination &amp; Will; or else (supposing the very worst that can happen) by a naturall kinde of Attraction, or Transvection, she being her self, in that stound and confusion that accompanies Death, utterly unsensible of all things. For the Aire without being more <hi>whole some</hi> and <hi>vitall</hi> then in the corrupt caverns of the dead Body, and yet there being a continuation thereof with that without; it is as easy to understand, how (that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of joyning therewith in the <hi>Plastick</hi> part of the Soule being once excited) she will naturally glide out of the Body into the free Aire, as how the Fire will ascend upwards, or a Stone fall downwards: for neither are the motions of these meerly Mechanicall, but vitall or Magicall, that cannot be resolved into meer Matter, as I shall demonstrate in my Third Book.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And being once recovered into this
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55765:158"/>
vast Ocean of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>sensible Spirit of the world,</hi> so full of enlivening Balsame; it will be no wonder if the Soule suddainly regain the use of her <hi>Perceptive</hi> faculty, being, as it were in a moment, regenerate into a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power of Life and Motion, by so happy a concurse of rightly-prepared Matter for her <hi>Plastick</hi> part vitally to unite withall. For grosser generations are performed in almost as inconsiderable a space of time; if those Histories be true, of extemporary Sallads, sowne and gathered not many hours before the meale they are eaten at: and of the suddain ingendring of Frogs upon the fall of rain, whole swarms whereof that had no Being before, have appeared with perfect shape and liveliness in the space of half an houre, after some more unctuous droppings upon the dry ground; as I find not onely recited out of <hi>Fallopius, Scaliger,</hi> and others, but have been certainly my self informed of it by them that have been eye-witnesses thereof; as <hi>Vaninus</hi> also professes himself to have been by his friend <hi>Johannes Gino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> who told him for a certain, that in the month of <hi>July</hi> he saw with his own eyes a drop of rain suddenly turned into a Frog. By such examples as these it is evident, that the reason why Life is so long a compleating in Terrestrial generations, is onely the slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishness
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55765:158"/>
of the Matter the Plastick power works upon. Wherefore a Soule, once united with Aire, cannot miss of being able, in a manner in the twinckling of an eye, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise all <hi>Perceptive functions</hi> again, if there was ever any intercessation of them in the astonishments of Death.</p>
               <p n="7">7. How the Soule <hi>may</hi> live and act sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Body, may be easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood out of what has been spoken. But that she does so <hi>de facto,</hi> there are but two wayes to prove it; the one by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>History,</hi> the other by <hi>Reason.</hi> That of History, is either of persons <hi>perfectly dead,</hi> or of those that have been subject to <hi>Ecstasies,</hi> or rather to that height thereof which is more properly called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when the Soule does really leave the Body, and yet return again. Of this latter sort is that example that <hi>Pliny</hi> recites of <hi>Hermoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Clazomenius,</hi> whose Soule would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten quit her Body, and wander up and down; and after her return tell many true stories of what she had seen during the time of her disjunction. The same, <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> report of <hi>Aristaeus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connesius. Marsilius Ficinus</hi> adjoyns to this rank that narration in <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a Priest, who in an Ecstasie saw the Battel fought betwixt <hi>Caesar</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:55765:159"/>
and <hi>Pompey</hi> in <hi>Thessalie,</hi> his Body being then at <hi>Padua;</hi> and yet could, after his return to himself, punctually declare the Time, Order and Success of the Fight. That in <hi>Wierus</hi> of the <hi>Weasell</hi> coming out of the Souldiers mouth when he was asleep, is a more plain example: which, if it were true, would make <hi>Aristaeus</hi> his <hi>Pigeon</hi> not so much suspected of fabulosity as <hi>Pliny</hi> would have it. Severall Relations there are in the world to this effect, that cannot but be loudly laughed at by them that think the Soule inseparable from the Body; and ordinarily they seem very ridiculous also to those that think it is separable, but as firmly believe that it is never, nor ever can be, separate but in Death.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Bodinus</hi> has a very great desire, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it is so incredible to others, that the thing should be true; it being so evincing an argument for the Soules Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. And he thinks this Truth is evident from innumerable examples of the <hi>Ecstasies</hi> of Witches: which we must confess with him not to be natural; but that they amount to a perfect <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or carrying away the Soule out of the Body, the lively sense of their meeting, and dancing, and adoring the Devill, and the mutuall remembrance of the persons that meet one another there
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55765:159"/>
at such a time, will be no infallible <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> that they were there indeed, while their Bodies lay at home in Bed. Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their Confessions concerning the same Conventicle is onely a shrewd proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, if it once could be made good, that this leaving their Bodies were a thing pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. For when they are out of them, they are much-what in the same condition that other <hi>Spirits</hi> are, and can imitate what shape they please; so that many of these Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations into Wolves and Cats, may be as likely of the Soule having left thus the Body, as by the Devils possessing the Body and transfiguring it himself. And what these aiery Cats or Wolves suffer, whether cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of their limbs, or breaking the Back, or any such like mischief, that the Witch in her Bed suffers the like, may very well arise from that <hi>Magick Sympathy</hi> that is seated in the Unity of the Spirit of the World, and the continuity of the subtill Matter dispersed throughout. The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in some sense being, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Platonists</hi> define it, one vast entire <hi>Animal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Now that this reall Separation of the Soule may happen in some <hi>Ecstasies,</hi> will be easily admitted, if we consider that the Soule in her own Nature is separable from the Body, as being a Substance really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55765:160"/>
therefrom; and that all Bodies are alike penetrable and passable to her, she being devoid of that corporeall property which they ordinarily call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and therefore can freely slide through any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatsoever, without any <hi>knocking</hi> or <hi>resistance;</hi> and lastly, that she does not so properly impart Heat and Motion to the Body, as Organization: and therefore when the Body is well organized, and there be that due temper of the Blood, the Heart and Pulse will in some measure beat, and the Brain will be replenish't with Spirits, and therewith the whole Body, though the Soule were out of it. In which case (saving that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> cannot be excluded thence) it would be perfectly <hi>Cartesius</hi> his <hi>Machina</hi> without Sense; though seemingly as much alive as any animate Creature in a deep sleep. Whence it appears, that if the Soule could leave the Body, that she might doe it for a certain time without any detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereto, that is, so long as she might well live without Repast. Which fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers their fears, who conceit that if the Soule was but once out of the Body, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Death must necessarily ensue, and all possible return thither be precluded.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But all the difficulty is to understand how the Soul may be loosned from the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55765:160"/>
Body, while the Body is in a fit condition to retain her. That is a very great Difficulty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and in a manner impossible for any power but what is supernatural. But it is not hard to conceive that this vital fitness in the Body may be changed, either by way of <hi>natural Disease,</hi> or by <hi>Art.</hi> For why may not some certain Fermentation in the Body so alter the Blood and Spirits, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the <hi>Plastick</hi> part of the Soul may cease to operate, as well as sometimes the <hi>Perceptive</hi> faculties doe, as in <hi>Catalepsies, Apoplexies,</hi> and the like? Wherefore this passing of the Soul out of the Body in Sleep, or Ecstasie, may be sometime a certain Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, as well as that of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>those that walk in their sleep.</hi> Now if it should happen that some such distemper should arise in the Body, as would very much change the <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> thereof for a time, and in this Paroxysm that other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of the <hi>Noctambuli</hi> should surprise the party; his Imagination driving him to walk to this or that place, his Soul may very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be conceived in this loosned condition it lies in, to be able to leave the Body, and pass in the Aire, as other Inhabitants of that Element doe, and act the part of separate Spirits, and exercise such Functions of the <hi>perceptive</hi> faculty, as they do that are quite
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:55765:161"/>
released from Terrestrial Matter. Onely here is the difference, That that damp in the Body that loosned the Union of the Soul being spent; the Soul, by that natural <hi>Magick</hi> I have more then once intimated, will certainly return to the Body, and unite with it again as firm as ever. But no man can when he pleases pass out of his Body thus, by the <hi>Imperium</hi> of his Will, no more then he can walk in his Sleep: For this capacity is pressed down more deep into the lower life of the Soul, whither neither the <hi>Liberty of Will,</hi> nor <hi>free Imagination</hi> can reach.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Passion</hi> is more likely to take effect in this case then either of the other two Powers, the seat of Passions being originally in the Heart, which is the chief Fort of these lower Faculties; and therefore by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity can more easily act upon the first Principles of Vital Union. The effect of these has been so great, that they have quite car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Soul out of the Body, as appears in sundry Histories of that kinde. For both <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant died suddainly upon the news of a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Victory; as <hi>Polycrita</hi> also a Noble-Woman of the Isle of <hi>Naxus,</hi> the Poet <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippides,</hi> and <hi>Diagoras</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> upon the like excess of <hi>Joy.</hi> We might adde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of sudden <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi> but it is
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:55765:161"/>
needless. It is a known and granted Truth, that <hi>Passion</hi> has so much power over the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal temper of the Body, as to make it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit mansion for the Soul; from whence will necessarily follow her disunion from it. Now if <hi>Passion</hi> will so utterly change the Harmony of the Blood and Spirits, as quite to release the Soul from the Body by a perfect Death; why may it not sometime act on this side that degree, and onely bring a present <hi>intemperies,</hi> out of which the Body may recover, and consequently regain the Soul back again, by virtue of that <hi>Mundane Sympathy</hi> I have so often spoke of?</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now of all <hi>Passions</hi> whatever, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Desire</hi> is fittest for this more harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and momentany ablegation of the Soul from the Body; because the great strength thereof is so closely assisted with the imagination of departing to the place where the party would be, that upon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union not amounting to perfect Death, the power of Fancy may carry the Soul to the place intended; and being satisfied and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, may rekindle life in the Body to the same degree it had before it was infested by this excess of Desire. This is that, if any thing, that has made dying men visit their friends before their departure, at many miles distance, their Bodies still keeping their sick
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55765:162"/>
bed; and those that have been well, give a visit to their sick friends, of whose health they have been over-desirous and solicitous. For this <hi>Ecstasie</hi> is really of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and not of the <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Animal Spirits;</hi> neither of which have any Sense or Perception in them at all. And therefore into this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is to be resolved that Story which <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Del-Rio</hi> reports of a Lad who, through the strength of Imagination and Desire of seeing his Father, fell into an <hi>Ecstasie;</hi> and after he came to himself, confidently affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he had seen him, and told infallible cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his being present with him.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That <hi>Cardan</hi> and others could fall into an <hi>Ecstasie</hi> when they pleased, by force of <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi> to fall into it, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded and believed by very grave and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Writers: but whether they could ever doe it to a compleat <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or local dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Soul from the Body, I know none that dare affirm; such events being rather the chances of Nature and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, as in the <hi>Noctambuli,</hi> then the effects of our Will. But we cannot assuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude but that <hi>Art</hi> may bring into our own power and ordering that which natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses put upon us sometimes without our leaves. But whether those <hi>Oyntments</hi> of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55765:162"/>
Witches have any such effect, or whether those unclean Spirits they deal with, by their immediate presence in their Bodies, cannot for a time so suppress or alter their <hi>Vital fitness</hi> to such a degree as will loosen the Soul, I leave to more curious Inquisitors to search after. It is sufficient that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated a very intelligible possibility of this actual separation without Death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called. From whence the perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory Confessions of Witches, and the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the story which they tell in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as well those that are there bodily, as they that leave their Bodies behinde them, especially when at their return they bring something home with them, as a permanent sign of their being at the place, is (though it may be all the delusion of their <hi>Familiars)</hi> no contemptible probability of their being there indeed where they declare they have been. For these are the greatest evidences that can be had in humane affairs: And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, so much as the supposed Impossibility thereof, has deterred men from believing the thing to be true.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. That Souls departed communicate Dreams. 2. Examples of Apparitions of Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased. 3. Of Apparitions in fields where pitcht Battels have been fought; as also of those in Churchyards, and other vaporous places. 4. That the Spissitude of the Air may well contribute to the easiness of the appearing of <hi>Ghosts</hi> and <hi>Spectres.</hi> 5. A further proof thereof from sundry examples. 6. Of <hi>Marsilius Ficinus</hi> his appearing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. 7. With what sort of people such examples as these avail little. 8. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to perswade the unprejudiced that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily those Apparitions that bear the shape and person of the deceased, are indeed the Souls of them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THE Examples of the other sort, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>appearing of the Ghosts of men after death,</hi> are so numerous and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in all mens mouths, that it may seem superfluous to particularize in any. This <hi>appearing</hi> is either by <hi>Dreams,</hi> or <hi>open Vision,</hi> In <hi>Dreams,</hi> as that which hapned to <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar Albumaron</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Physitian, to whom his lately-deceased friend suggested in his sleep a very soverain Medicine for
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55765:163"/>
his sore Eyes. Like to this is that in <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> concerning <hi>Isis</hi> Queen of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> whom he reports to have communicated remedies to the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> in their sleep after her death, as well as she did when she was alive. Of this kinde is also that memorable story of <hi>Posidonius</hi> the <hi>Stoick,</hi> concerning two young men of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> who being come to <hi>Megara,</hi> and lying the one at a Victuallers, the other in an Inne; he in the Inne while he was asleep dream'd that his Fellow-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller earnestly desired him to come and help him, as being assaulted by the Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and in danger to be killed by him: But he, after he was perfectly awake, finding it but a Dream, neglected it. But faln asleep again, his murdered friend appeared to him the second time, beseeching him, that though he did not help him alive, yet he would see his Death revenged; telling him how the Victualler had cast his Body into a Dung-cart, and that if he would get up timely in the morning, and watch at the Town-gate, he might thereby discover the murder: which he did accordingly, and so saw Justice done on the Murderer. Nor does the first Dream make the second imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to our purpose: For as that might be from the strength of Imagination, and desire of help in the distressed <hi>Arcadian,</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:55765:164"/>
impressed on the <hi>Spirit of the World,</hi> and so transmitted to his friend asleep (a condition fittest for such communications;) so it is plain that this after his Death must fail, if his Soul did either cease to be or to act. And therefore it is manifest that she both was and did act, and suggested this Dream in revenge of the Murder. Of which kinde there be infinite examples, I mean of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders discovered by Dreams, the Soul of the person murdered seeming to appear to some or other asleep, and to make his complaint to them. But I will content my self onely to adde an Example of <hi>Gratitude</hi> to this of <hi>Revenge.</hi> As that of <hi>Simonides,</hi> who light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by chance on a dead Body by the Sea side, and out of the sense of Humanity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing Burial upon it, was requited with a Dream that saved his life. For he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisht to desist from his Voyage he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Sea, which the Soul of the deceased told him would be so perillous, that it would hazard the lives of the Passengers. He believed the Vision, and abstaining was safe: those others that went suffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We will adjoyn onely an Example or two of that other kind of <hi>Visions,</hi> which are ordinarily called the Apparitions of the dead. And such is that which <hi>Pliny</hi> relates at large
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55765:164"/>
in his Epistle to <hi>Sura,</hi> of an house haunted at <hi>Athens,</hi> and freed by <hi>Athenodorus</hi> the Philosopher, after the Body of that person that appeared to him was digged up, and interred with due solemnity. It is not a thing unlikely, that most houses that are haunted, are so chiefly from the Soules of the deceased; who have either been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, or some way injured, or have some hid treasure to discover, or the like. And persons are haunted for the like causes, as well as houses; as <hi>Nero</hi> was after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his Mother; <hi>Otho</hi> pull'd out of his bed in the night by the Ghost of <hi>Galba.</hi> Such instances are infinite: as also those wherein the Soule of ones friend, suppose Father, Mother, or Husband, have appeared to give them good counsell, and to instruct them of the event of the greatest affairs of their life. The Ghosts also of deceased Lovers have been reported to adhere to their Paramours, after they had left their Bodies; taking all opportunities to meet them in Solitude, whether by day or by night.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There be also other more fortuitous occursions of these deceased Spirits; of which one can give no account, unless it be, because they find themselves in a more easy capacity to appear. As haply it may be
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55765:165"/>
in Fields after great slaughters of Armies, and in publick Buriall-places. Though some would ridiculously put off these Apparitions, by making them nothing but the reek or vapour of the Bodies of the dead, which they fancy will fall into the like stature and shape with the man it comes from: Which yet <hi>Cardan</hi> playes the fool in as well as <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> and others; as he does also in his account of those <hi>Spectra</hi> that appear so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in <hi>Iseland,</hi> where the Inhabitants meet their deceased friends in so lively an Image, that they salute them and embrace them for the same persons; not knowing of their death, unless by their suddain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearing, or by after-information that they were then dead. This he imputes partly to the <hi>Thickness</hi> of the Aire, and partly to the foule food and gross spirits of the <hi>Islanders;</hi> and yet implies, that their fancies are so strong, as to convert the thick vaporous aire into the compleat shape of their absent and deceased acquaintance, and so perswade themselves that they see them, and talk with them, whenas it is nothing else but an aiery Image made by the power of their own Fancy. But certainly it had been better flatly to have denied the Narration, then to give so slight and unprobable reason of the <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:55765:165"/>
4. That the <hi>Spissitude</hi> of the Aire in that place may contribute something to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of these <hi>Spectra,</hi> is rationall enough. For it being more thick, it is the more easily reduced to a visible consistency: but must be shaped, not by the fancy of the Spectatour, (for that were a monstrous power) but by the Imagination of the Spirit that actuates its own Vehicle of that gross Aire. For the same reason also in other places these Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions haply appear oftner in the Night then in the Day, the Aire being more clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and thick after the Sun has been some while down then before. To which also that custome of the <hi>Lappians,</hi> a people of <hi>Scandia,</hi> seems something to agree; who, as <hi>Caspar Peucerus</hi> relates, are very much haunted with Apparitions of their deceased friends. For which trouble they have no remedy but burying them under their Hearth. Which Ceremony can have no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall influence upon these <hi>Lemures,</hi> unless they should hereby be engaged to keep in a warmer aire, &amp; consequently more rarified, then if they were interred elsewhere, Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because their Bodies will sooner putrify by the warmth of the hearth; whenas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the coldness of that Clime would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to be sound a longer time, and consequently be fit for the Souls of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55765:166"/>
to have recourse to and replenish their Vehicle with such a <hi>Cambium</hi> or gluish moisture, as will make it far easier to be commanded into a <hi>visible consistence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That this facilitates their condition of <hi>appearing,</hi> is evident from that known re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course these infestant Spirits have to their dead Bodies. As is notorious in the History of <hi>Cuntius,</hi> which I have set down at large in my <hi>Antidote,</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 9. and of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesian</hi> Shoomaker and his Maid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter. To which you may adde what <hi>Agrippa</hi> writes out of the <hi>Cretian</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, How there the <hi>Catechanes,</hi> that is the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the deceased Husbands, would be very troublesome to their Wives, &amp; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to lye with them, while they could have any recourse to their dead Bodies. Which mischief therefore was prevented by a Law, that if any Woman was thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, the Body of her Husband should be burnt, and his Heart struck through with a stake. Which also put a speedy end to those stirs and tragedies the Ghost of <hi>Cuntius</hi> and those others caused at <hi>Pentsch</hi> and <hi>Breslan</hi> in <hi>Silesia.</hi> The like disquietnesses are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have hapned in the year 1567. at <hi>Trawtenaw</hi> a city of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by one <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus Hubener,</hi> who was to admiration grown rich, as <hi>Cuntius</hi> of <hi>Pentsch,</hi> and when
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55765:166"/>
he died, did as much mischief to his fellow-Citizens. For he would ordinarily appear in the very shape he was when he was alive, and such as he met would salute them with so close embraces, that he caused many to fall sick and several to die by the unkinde huggs he gave them. But burning his Body rid the Town of the perilous occursations of this malicious Gobling. All which instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe prove not onely the <hi>appearing</hi> of Souls after they have left this life, but also that some thickning Matter, such as may be got either from Bodies alive, or lately dead, or as fresh as those that are but newly dead (as the Body of this <hi>Hubener</hi> was, though it had lyen 20 weeks in the Grave,) or lastly from thick vaporous Air, may facilitate much their appearing, and so invite them to play tricks, when they can doe it at so cheap a rate; though they have little or no end in doing them, but the pleasing of their own, either ludicrous, or boisterous and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering, humour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But of any private person that ever appeared upon design after his death, there is none did upon a more noble one then that eximious Platonist <hi>Marsilius Ficinus;</hi> who having, as <hi>Baronius</hi> relates, made a solemn vow with his fellow-Platonist <hi>Michael Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus</hi> (after they had been pretty warmly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55765:167"/>
disputing of the Immortality of the Soul, out of the Principles of their Master <hi>Plato)</hi> that whether of them two died first should appear to his friend, and give him certain information of that Truth; (it being <hi>Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his fate to die first, and indeed not long after this mutual resolution) he was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his promise when he had left the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For <hi>Michael Mercatus</hi> being very intent at his Studies betimes on a morning, heard an horse riding by with all speed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that he stopped at his window; and therewith heard the voice of his friend <hi>Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> crying out aloud, <hi>O Michael, Michael, vera, vera sunt illa.</hi> Whereupon he suddenly opened the window, and espying <hi>Marsilius</hi> on a white Steed, called after him; but he vanisht in his sight. He sent therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to <hi>Florence</hi> to know how <hi>Marsilius</hi> did; and understood that he died about that hour he called at his window, to assure him of his own and other mens Immortalities.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Examples I have produced of the <hi>appearing</hi> of the Souls of men after death, considering how clearly I have demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>separability</hi> of them from the Body, and their capacity of Vital Union with an <hi>aiery Vehicle,</hi> cannot but have their due weight of Argument with them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced. But as for those that have their
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55765:167"/>
minds enveloped in the dark mist of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, that lazy and Melancholy saying which has dropt from the careless pen of that uncertain Writer <hi>Cardan, Orbis magnus est, &amp; aevum longum, &amp; error ac timor mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in hominibus possunt,</hi> will prevail more with them then all the Stories the same Authour writes of <hi>Apparitions,</hi> or whatever any one else can adde unto them. And others that doe admit of these things, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceptions from Education, That the Soul when she departs this life, is suddenly either twitched up into the <hi>Coelum Empyreum,</hi> or hurried down headlong towards the Centre of the Earth, makes the Apparitions of the Ghosts of men altogether incredible to them; they always substituting in their place some Angel or Devil which must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present their persons, themselves being not at leisure to act any such part.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But <hi>Misconceit</hi> and <hi>Prejudice,</hi> though it may hinder the force of an Argument with those that are in that manner <hi>entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> yet <hi>Reason</hi> cannot but take place with them that are <hi>free.</hi> To whom I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal whether (considering the aereal Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles of Souls which are common to them with other <hi>Genii,</hi> so that whatever they are fancied to doe in their stead, they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves; as also how congruous
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55765:168"/>
it is, that those persons that are most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, when it is in their power, should act in their own affairs, as in detecting the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, in disposing their estate, in rebuking injurious Executors, in visiting and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling their Wives and Children, in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning them of such and such courses, with other matters of like sort; to which you may adde the profession of the Spirit thus appearing, of being the Soul of such an one, as also the similitude of person; and that all this adoe is in things very just and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unfit for a Devil with that care and kindness to promote, and as unfit for a good <hi>Genius,</hi> it being below so noble a nature to tell a Lie, especially when the affair may be as effectually transacted without it;) I say, I dare appeal to any one, whether all these things put together and rightly weighed, the violence of prejudice not pulling down the ballance, it will not be certainly carried for the present cause; and whether any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Judge ought not to conclude, if these Stories that are so frequent every where and in all Ages concerning the Ghosts of men appearing be but true, that it is true also that it is their Ghosts, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Souls of men subsist and act after they have left these earthly Bodies.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>1. The preeminence of Arguments drawn from Reason above those from Story. 2. The first step toward a Demonstration of Reason that the Soul acts out of her Body, for that she is an <hi>immaterial Substance separable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</hi> 3. The second, That the <hi>immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> for Sense, Motion, and Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of the Body, are certain <hi>subtile</hi> and <hi>tenuious Spirits.</hi> 4. A comparison betwixt the <hi>Soul in the Body</hi> and the AEreal <hi>Genii,</hi> 5. Of the nature of <hi>Daemons</hi> from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Marcus</hi> the Eremite, and how the Soul is presently such, having once left this Body. 6. An Objection concerning the Souls of Brutes: to which is answered, First by way of concession; 7. Secondly, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the Arguments for the former conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. 8. That there is no rational doubt at all of the Humane Soul acting after death. 9. A further Argument of her activity out of this Body, from her conflicts with it while she is in it. 10. As also from the general hope and belief of all Nations, that they shall live after death.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BUT we proceed now to what is less subject to the evasions and misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of either the <hi>Profane</hi> or <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious.</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:55765:169"/>
For none but such as will profess themselves meer Brutes can cast off the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Conclusions of Philosophy and Reason; though they think that in things of this nature they may, with a great deal of applause and credit, refuse the testimony of other mens senses if not of their own: all <hi>Apparitions</hi> being with them nothing but the strong surprisals of <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi> But they cannot with that ease nor credit silence the Deductions of Reason, by saying it is but a <hi>Fallacy,</hi> unlesse they can shew the Sophisme: which they cannot doe, where it is not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To carry on therefore our present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in a rational way, and by degrees; we are first to consider, That (according as already has been clearly demonstrated) there is a Substance in us which is ordinarily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Soul,</hi> really distinct from the Body, (for otherwise how can it be a Substance?) And therefore it is really and locally sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the Body. Which is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable step towards what we aim at.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the next place we are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, That the immediate Instrument of the Soul are those tenuious and aereal particles which they ordinarily call the <hi>Spirits;</hi> that these are they by which the Soul hears, sees, feels, imagines, remembers, reasons,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55765:169"/>
and by moving which, or at least directing their motion, she moves likewise the Body; and by using them, or some subtile Matter like them, she either compleats, or at least contributes to the Bodies Organization. For that the Soul should be the <hi>Vital Architect</hi> of her own house, that close connexion and sure possession she is to have of it, distinct and secure from the invasion of any other particular Soul, seems no slight Argument. And yet that while she is exercising that Faculty, she may have a more then ordinary Union or Implication with the Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Soul of the World, so far forth as it is <hi>Plastick,</hi> seems not unreasonable: and therefore is asserted by <hi>Plotinus;</hi> and may justly be suspected to be true, if we attend to the prodigious effects of the Mothers I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination derived upon the Infant, which sometimes are so very great, that, unless she raised the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> into consent, they might well seem to exceed the power of any Cause. I shall abstain from producing any Examples till the proper place: in the mean time I hope I may be excused from any rashness in this assignation of the cause of those many and various Signatures found in Nature, so plainly pointing at such a Principle in the World as I have intimated before.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:55765:170"/>
4. But to return, and cast our eye upon the Subject in hand. It appears from the two precedent Conclusions, that the Soul considered as invested immediately with this tenuious Matter we speak of, which is her inward Vehicle, has very little more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the <hi>aereal Genii,</hi> then a man in a Prison from one that is free. The one can onely see, and suck air through the Grates of the Prison, and must be annoyed with all the stench and unwholsome fumes of that sad habitation; whenas the other may walk and take the fresh air, where he finds it most commodious and agreeable. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is betwixt the <hi>Genii</hi> and an <hi>incorporated Soul.</hi> The Soul, as a man faln into a deep pit, (who can have no better Water, nor Air, nor no longer enjoyment of the Sun, and his chearful light and warmth, then the measure and quality of the pit will permit him) so she once immured in the Body cannot enjoy any better Spirits (in which all her life and comfort consists) then the constitution of the Body after such circuits of concoction can administer to her. But those <hi>Genii</hi> of the Aire, who possess their Vehicles upon no such hard terms, if themselves be not in fault, may by the power of their minds accommodate themselves with more pure and impolluted Matter, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55765:170"/>
such as will more easily conspire with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest and divinest functions of their Spirit. In brief therefore, if we consider things aright, we cannot abstain from strongly surmising, that there is no more difference betwixt a Soule and an aëreal <hi>Genius,</hi> then there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Sword in the scabbard and one out of it: and that a Soule is but a <hi>Genius</hi> in the Body, and a <hi>Genius</hi> a Soule out of the Body; as the Antients also have defined, giving the same name, as well as nature, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuously to them both, by calling them both <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as I have elsewhere noted.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is very consonant to what <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Psellus</hi> sets down, from the singular knowledge and experience of <hi>Marcus</hi> the Eremite, in these matters; who describes the nature of these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as being throughout Spirit and Aire; whence they heare and see and feel in every part of their Body. Which he makes good by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and wonders at the ignorance of men that doe not take notice of it, viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that it is neither Bones, nor Nerves, nor any gross or visible part of the Body, or of any Organ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whereby the Soule immediately exercises the functions of Sense; but that it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that are her nearest and inmost instrument
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55765:171"/>
of these operations:</hi> Of which when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is deprived, there is found no Sense in it, though the gross Organs and parts are in their usuall consistency, as we see in <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copes</hi> and <hi>Apoplexies.</hi> Which plainly shewes, that the immediate Vehicle of Life are the Spirits; and that the Soules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the Body is by these; as the most learned Physicians doe conclude with one consent. Whence it will follow, that this <hi>Vinculum</hi> being broke, the Soule will be free from the Body, and will as naturally be carried out of the corrupt carkass that now has no harmony with the Soule, into that Element that is more congenerous to her, the vital Aire, as the Fire will mount upwards; as I have already noted. And so Principles of Life being fully kindled in this thinner Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, she becomes as compleat for Sense and Action as any other Inhabitants of these aiery regions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is onely one perverse Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against this so easy and naturall Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which is this; That by this manner of reasoning, the Soules of Brutes, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those of the perfecter sort, will also not onely subsist, (for that difficulty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted pretty well already) but also live and enjoy themselves after death. To which I dare boldly answer, That it is a thousand
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55765:171"/>
times more reasonable that they doe, then that the Soules of Men doe not. Yet I will not confidently assert, that they doe, or doe not; but will lightly examine each Hypothesis. And first, by way of feigned concession, we will say, They doe; and take notice of the Reasons that may induce one to think so. Amongst which two prime ones are those involved in the Objection, That they doe subsist after death; and, That the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate instrument of their Vitall Functions is their Spirits, as well as in Man. To which we may adde, That for the present we are fellow-inhabitants of one and the same Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Earth, subject to the same fate of Fire, Deluges and Earthquakes. That it is improbable, that the vast space of Aire and AEther, that must be inhabited by living creatures, should have none but of one sort, that is the Angels or <hi>Genii,</hi> good or bad. For it would seem as great a solitude, as if Men alone were the Inhabitants of the Earth, or Mermaids of the Sea. That the periods of vitall congruity, wound up in the Nature of their Soules, by that eternall Wisdome that is the Creatress of all things, may be shorter or longer, according as the property of their essence and relation to the Universe requires; and that so their Descents and Returns may be accordingly swifter or
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55765:172"/>
slower. That it is more conformable to the Divine goodness to be so then otherwise, if their natures will permit it: And that their existence would be in vain, while they were deprived of vital operation when they may conveniently have it. That they would be no more capable of Salvation in the other state, then they are here of Conversion. That the intellectual Inhabitants of the Aire having also externall and corporeall Sense, variety of Objects would doe as well there, as here amongst us on Earth. Besides that Historyes seem to imply, as if there were such kind of aereal Animals amongst them, as Dogs, Horses, and the like. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be short, that the Soules of Brutes cease to be alive after they are separate from this Body, can have no other reason, then <hi>Immorality</hi> the Mother of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> (that is, nothing but narrowness of spirit, out of over-much self-love, and contempt of other Creatures) to embolden us so confidently to adhere to so groundless a Conclusion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This Position makes indeed a plausible shew, insomuch that if the Objection drove one to acknowledge it for Truth, he might seem to have very little reason to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of it. But this Controversy is not so easily decided. For though it be plain that the Soules of Beasts be Substances
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55765:172"/>
really separable from their Bodies; yet if they have but one Vital congruity, namely the <hi>Terrestriall</hi> one, they cannot recover life in the Aire. But their having one or two, or more Vital congruities, wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon his wisdome &amp; counsel that has made all things. Besides, the Souls of Brutes seem to have a more passive nature, then to be able to manage or enjoy this escape of Death, that free and commanding Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belonging onely to us, as also Remini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scency. But Brutes have onely a passive Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and bare Memory; which failing them in all likelyhood in the shipwrack of their Body, if they could live in the Aire, they would begin the World perfectly on a new score, which is little better then Death: so that they might in this sense be rightly deemed mortall. Our being Co-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the same element, the Earth, proves nothing: for by the same reason, Worms and Fleas should live out of their Bodies, and Fishes should not, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, their shape, it may be, a little changed (for there is no necessity that these creatures in their aiery Vehicles should be exactly like themselves in their terrestriall ones) might act and live in the more moist tracts of the Aire. As for the supposed so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude that would be in the Aire, it reaches
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55765:173"/>
not this Matter. For in the lower Regions thereof, the various Objects of the Earth and Sea will serve the turn. The winding up of those severall circuits of vitall congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity may indeed pass for an ingenious inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as of a thing possible in the Soules of Brutes: but, as the Schools say well, <hi>A posse ad esse non valet consequentia.</hi> As for that Argument from <hi>Divine Goodness,</hi> it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his Wisdom which attempers it self to the natures of things, &amp; we not knowing the nature of the Soules of Brutes so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as we doe our own, we cannot so easily be assured from thence what will be in this case. A Musitian strikes not all strings at once; neither is it to be expected that every thing in Nature at every time should act: but when it is its turn, then touched upon it will give its sound; in the interim it lies silent. And so it may be with the Soules of Brutes for a time, especially when the vitall temper of Earth and Aire and Sea shall fail; yea and at other times too, if none but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Spirits be fit to manage <hi>AEreall</hi> Vehicles. I confess indeed, that Salvation can no more belong to the Soules of Brutes then Conversion; but that is as true of the Soules of Plants, (if they have any distinct from the <hi>Universall Spirit of Nature)</hi> but yet it does not prove that the Soules of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55765:173"/>
Vegetables shall live and act in Aiery Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, after an Herbe or Tree is dead and rotten here. To that of conveniency of variety of Objects for the aiery Inhabitants I have answered already. And for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of Horses, Doggs and the like, they may be the transformation of the ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <hi>Genii</hi> into these shapes: Which though it be a sign that they would not abhor from the use and society of such aeriall Animals, if they had them; yet they may the better want them, they being able so well themselves to supply their places. We will briefly therefore conclude, that from the meer light of Reason it cannot be infallibly demonstrated, that the Soules of Brutes doe not live after death, nor that it is any Incongruity in Nature to say they do. Which is sufficient to enervate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Objection.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But for the life and activity of the Soules of Men out of this Body, all things goe on hand-smooth for it, without any check or stop. For we finding the aerial <hi>Genii</hi> so exceeding near-a-kin to us in their Faculties, we being both <hi>intellectuall Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and both using the same immediate instrument of Sense and Perception, to wit, <hi>aeriall Spirits,</hi> insomuch that we can scarce discover any other difference betwixt us
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55765:174"/>
then there is betwixt a man that is naked and one clad in gross thick cloathing; it is the most easy and naturall inference that can be, to conclude, that when we are separate from the Body, and are invested onely in Aire, that we shall be just like them, and have the same life and activity they have. For though a Brute fall short of this Priviledge, it ought to be no disheartning to us, because there is a greater cognation betwixt the <hi>Intellectual</hi> Faculties and the <hi>aiery</hi> or <hi>aethereal</hi> Vehicle, then there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt such Vehicles and those more low and sensuall powers common to us with Beasts. And we finde, in taking the fresh aire, that the more fine and pure our Spirits are, our thoughts become the more noble &amp; divine, and the more purely intellectuall. Nor is the step greater upwards then downwards: For seeing that what in us is so Divine and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall may be united with the body of a Brute, (for such is this Earthly cloathing) why may not the Soule, notwithstanding her ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall Congruity of life, (which upon new occasions may be easily conceived to surcease from acting) be united with the Vehicle of an Angel? So that there is no puzzle at all concerning the Soul of Man, but that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon Death she may associate her self with those aeriall Inhabitants, the <hi>Genii</hi> or <hi>Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:55765:174"/>
9. Which we may still be the better as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of, if we consider how we have such Faculties in us, as the Soul finds hoppled and fettered, clouded and obscured by her fatal residence in this prison of the Body. In so much that, so far as it is lawful, she falls out with it for those incommodations that the most confirmed brutish health brings usually upon her. How her Will tuggs against the impurity of the Spirits that stir up bestial Passions, (that are notwithstanding the height and flower of other Creatures en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments) and how many times her whole life upon Earth is nothing else but a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warfare against the results of her union with this lump of Earth that is so much like to other terrestrial Animals. Whence it is plain she finds her self in a wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that she was created for a better and purer state; which she could not attain to, unless she lived out of the Body: which she does in some sort in divine Ecstasies and Dreams; in which case she making no use of the Bodies Organs, but of the purer Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the fourth Ventricle of the Brain, she acts as it were by her self, and performs some preludious Exercises, conformable to those in her aiery Vehicle.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Adde unto all this, that the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul is the common, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55765:175"/>
naturall, hope and expectation of all Nations; there being very few so barbarous as not to hold it for a Truth: though, it may be, as in other things, they may be something ridiculous in the manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing themselves about it; as that they shall retire after Death to such a Grove or Wood, or beyond such a Hill, or unto such an Island, such as was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Island where <hi>Achilles</hi> Ghost was conceived to wander, or the <hi>Insulae Fortunatae,</hi> the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Elysium</hi> of the Ancients. And yet, it may be, if we should tell these of the <hi>Coelum Empyreum,</hi> and compute the height of it, and distance from the Earth, and how many solid Orbs must be glided through before a Soul can come thither; these simple Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians would think as odly of the <hi>Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> Opinion as we do of theirs: and it may be some more judicious and sagacious Wit will laugh at us both alike. It is sufficient, that in the main all Nations in a manner are agreed that there is an <hi>Immortality</hi> to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,</hi> as well as that there is a <hi>Deity</hi> to be <hi>worshipped;</hi> though ignorance of circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces makes Religion vary, even to Monstro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, in many parts of the world. But both Religion, and the belief of the Reward of it, which is a blessed state after Death, being so generally acknowledged by all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55765:175"/>
of the Earth; it is a plain Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it is true according to the Light of Nature. And not onely because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve so, but because they do so seriously either desire it, or are so horribly afraid of it, if they offend much against their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: which properties would not be in men so universally, if there were no Objects in Nature answering to these Faculties, as I have elsewhere argued in the like case.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. That the <hi>Faculties</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and the nature of the immediate instrument of them, the <hi>Spirits,</hi> doe so nearly symbolize with those of Daemons, that it seems reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if God did not on purpose hinder it, that they would not fail to act out of this earthly Body. 2. Or if they would, his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wisdome could easily implant in their essence a double or triple <hi>Vital Congruity,</hi> to make all sure. 3. A further demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the present Truth from the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of God. 4. An Answer to an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against the foregoing Argument. 5. Another Demonstration from His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. 6. An Answer to an Objection. 7. An
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55765:176"/>
Answer to another Objection. 8. Another Argument from the Justice of God. 9. An Objection answered. 10. An invincible Demonstration of the Souls Immortality from the Divine Goodness. 11. A more particular enforcement of that Argument, and who they are upon whom it will work least. 12. That the noblest and most ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Spirit is the most assurable of the Souls Immortality.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BUT finally, to make all sure, let us contemplate the Nature of God, who is the Author and Maker of all things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to whose Goodness, Wisdome and Power all things were created, and are ever ordered; and let us take special notice how many steps towards this Immortality we now treat of, are impressed upon the very nature of the Soul already; and then seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider, if it be possible that the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Deity</hi> should stop there, and goe no further, when there are so great reasons, if we understand any thing, that He perfect our expectations. For we have already clearly demonstrated, That the Soul of man is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance actually separable from the Body, and that all her Operations &amp; Functions are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately performed, not by those parts of the Body that are of an earthly and gross
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55765:176"/>
consistency, but by what is more aeriall or aethereall, the <hi>Vitall</hi> and <hi>Animall Spirits;</hi> which are very congenerous to the Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Angels or <hi>Genii.</hi> Insomuch that if the Divine power did but leave Nature to work of it self, it might seem very strange, considering those Divine and Intellectuall Faculties in us, (as conformable to the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Soules of Angels as our Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are to their Vehicles) if it would not be an immediate sequel of this Priviledge, that our Soules, once separate from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, should act and inform the Aire they are in with like facility that other <hi>Genii</hi> doe, there being so very little difference betwixt both their natures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or if one single <hi>Plastick</hi> power, in a Subject so near a-kin to these aerial people, will not necessarily suffice for both states, certainly it must be a very little addition that will help out: and how easy is it for that Eternall Wisdome to contrive a double or triple Vitall Congruity, to wit, <hi>aeriall</hi> and <hi>aethereal,</hi> as well as <hi>terrestrial,</hi> in such an Essence, whose Faculties and properties doe so plainly symbolize with those purer Inhabitants of both the <hi>AEther</hi> and <hi>Aire?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But this is not all we have to say. For if there be one thing more precious in the Deity then another, we shall have it all
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:55765:177"/>
as a sure and infallible pledge of this present Truth, <hi>That our Souls will not fail to prove Immortall.</hi> And for my own part, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more precious in the Godhead then his <hi>Veracity, Justice</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> and all these three will assure us and secure us, that we shall sustain no loss or damage by our departure out of these Earthly Bodies, in either Life or Essence. For it were a very high reproach to that Attribute of God which we call his <hi>Veracity,</hi> he so plainly and universally promising to all the Nations of the World, where there is any Religion at all, a happy state after this life; if there should in reality be no such thing to be expected. For he does not onely connive it the Errour, if it be one, by not declaring himself against it, (as any upright person would, if another should take upon him, in his presence or hearing, to tell others that he intended to bestow such and such gifts and revenues upon them, when there was no such matter:) but he has, as a man may say, on set purpose indued men with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary parts and powers, to set this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on foot in the Earth; all <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Workers</hi> of <hi>Miracles</hi> that have appeared in the world, having one way or other assured to Man-kind this so weighty Truth. And the most Noble &amp; Vertuous Spirits in all Ages
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55765:177"/>
have been the most prone to believe it. And this not onely out of a sense of their own Interest; but any one that ever had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to experience these things, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That that Clearness &amp; Purity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that most consists with the Love and admiration of God and Vertue, and all those divine Accomplishments that even those that never could attain to them give their highest approbation of, I say, that this more refined temper of Minde does of it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a wonderful proneness, if not a necessity, of presuming of the Truth of this Opinion we plead for. And therefore if it be not true, God has laid a train in Nature, that the most vertuous and pious men shall be the most sure to be deceived: Which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to his Attribute of <hi>Veracity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor can the strength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be evaded by replying, that God may deceive men for their good, as Parents doe their Children; and therefore His <hi>Wisdome</hi> may contrive such a naturall Errour as this, to be serviceable for States and Polities, to keep the people in awe, and so render them more faithfull and governable. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that there does result from this divine Truth such an usefulness, by the by, for the better holding together of Common-weals; but to think that this is the main use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55765:178"/>
and that there is nothing more in it then so, is as Idioticall and Childish, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that because the Stars, those vast lights, doe some small offices for us by Night, that therefore that is all the meaning of them, and that they serve for nothing else. Besides, there is no Father would tell a Lye to his Child, if he were furnisht with truth as effectual for his purpose; and if he told any thing really good, as well as desirable, to his Childe, to induce him to Obedience, if it lay in his power, he would be sure to perform his promise. But it is in the power of God to make good whatever he has propounded for reward; nor need he make use of any falshood in this matter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he doe, he has less <hi>Veracity</hi> then an ordinary honest man; which is <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,</hi> and <hi>contradictious</hi> to the nature of the Deity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again upon point of <hi>Justice,</hi> God was engaged to contrive the Nature and Order of things so, that the Soules of Men may live after death, and that they may fare according to their behaviour here upon earth. For the Godhead, as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher calls him, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and does immutably and inevitably distribute Justice, both Reward and Punishment, in the world. But how difficult a thing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55765:178"/>
it is to be good and to live according to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the common practise and complaint of all men doe confess with one consent; and that it is exceeding hard to perswade any one to doe that violence to their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to endeavour after a due degree and right sense of Vertue (for Craft and Policy are easy enough, and other things there are that, set against the contrary Vices, look like Vertues, but are not:) But to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to those that truly are, is, I say, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hard, if not impossible, without the inculcation of this grand concernment, the State of the Soule after Death, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that will then follow a Vertuous life. Of which hopes if we be frustrated by the Soules Mortality, we are defrauded of our Reward, and God of the honour of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor can the force of this Argument be enervated by either that high pretension of <hi>Stoicisme, That Vertue to it self is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reward;</hi> or that the very hopes of this Immortality, it being accompanied with so much joy, tranquillity and contentment, will countervail all the pain and trouble of either acquiring, or keeping close to Vertue once acquired. For as for the first, It is one thing to talk high, and another thing to practise. And for my own part, I think
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55765:179"/>
in the main, that <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who placed the chiefest good in Pleasure, Philosophized more solidly then the paradoxical <hi>Stoicks.</hi> For questionless that is that which all men ought to drive at, if they had the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and knew wherein to place it, or could arrive to the purest and most warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table sense of it. But there can be no <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> (without a perfect Miracle) while our Spirits are disturbed and vitiated by sordid and contemptible Poverty, by Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Sicknesses, Tortures, ill Diet, and a number of such Adversities, that those that are the most exactly vertuous have been in all Ages most lyable to. Besides the care and sollicitude of perpetually stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon their guard, the stings of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Defamation, and a continuall vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to see the baseness and vileness of mens tempers, and ugly oblique transactions of affairs in the world. Which inquietudes cannot be avoided by any other remedy but what is as ill as the disease, or worse, it being altogether incompetible to a true <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall</hi> tenour of minde; I mean their <hi>Stoical Apathy;</hi> of which the best that can be said is, that it is a kind of constant and safe piece of fullenness, stating us onely in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those that are said to have neither wone nor lost: So poor a reward is persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55765:179"/>
and distressed Vertue of it self, without the hope of future Happiness.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to say, the Hope thereof without Enjoyment is a sufficient compensation, is like that mockery <hi>Plutarch</hi> records of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi> towards a Fidler, whom he caused to play before him, promising him a reward; but when he demanded it of him for his pains, denied it him, or rather said it was paid already, putting him off with this jest, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>So long as you pleased me with playing, so long you rejoyced your self with hoping after the reward; so that you are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently paid already.</hi> Which piece of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mirth may be passable in a ludicrous matter, and from a Tyrant, where height of Fortune makes proud and forgetful Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity contemn their inferiours: But in a thing of this nature, that concerns not onely this transient life, but the sempiternal dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul, Injustice there is unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably grievous; and so much the more harsh and uncomely, if we consider that it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be committed, not by a frail earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Potentate, (the height of whose Honours may make him regardless of smaller affairs and meaner persons,) but by the God of Heaven, who can with the like ease attend all things as he can any one thing; and who
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55765:180"/>
is perfectly and immutably just, not doing nor omitting any thing by changeable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as it happens in vain Men, but ever acting according to the transcendent Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Holiness of his own Nature.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Neither is <hi>Divine Justice</hi> engaged onely to <hi>reward,</hi> but also to <hi>punish;</hi> which cannot be, unless the Souls of men subsist after Death. For there are questionless many thousands that have committed most enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Villanies, persecuted the Good, taking away their possessions, liberties, or lives; adding sometimes most barbarous tortures and reproachful abuses; and in all this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratified their covetousness, ambition and revenge; nay, it may be the bestial fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their own spirits, that have pleased themselves exceedingly to bring the truly religious into disgrace, and have laughed at all vertuous actions as the fruits of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Folly; and yet for all this have died in peace on their beds, after their lives have been as thick set with all sensual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Honour, Riches and Pleasure, as their Story is with Frauds, Rapines, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Sacriledges, and whatever crimes the impious boldness of lawless persons will venture on.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Such things as these happen propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably through all the ranks and orders

of men. Nor is it sufficient to reply that their own Consciences, as so many Furies, do lash them and scorch them in this life: For we speak of inveterate and successful wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, where that Principle is utterly laid asleep; or if it at any time wake and cry, the noise of the affairs of the world, and hurry of business, and continual visits of friends and flatterers, false instructions of covetous Priests or mercenary Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (who for gain will impudently cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and pervert both the Light of Nature and Sense of Religion) the sound and clatter of these, I say, will so possess the ear of the prosperously wicked, that the voice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science can be no more heard in this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual tumult, then the vagient cries of the Infant <hi>Jupiter</hi> amidst the rude shuffles and dancings of the <hi>Cretick Corybantes,</hi> and the tinckling and clashing of their brazen Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets. And therefore if there be no Life hereafter, the worst of men have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test share of happiness, their passions and affections being so continually gratified, and that to the height, in those things that are so agreeable, and, rightly circumstantiated, allowable to humane Nature: such as are the sweet reflection on the success of our political management of the affairs of the World; the general tribute of Honour and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55765:181"/>
respect for our Policy and Wit, and that ample testimony thereof, our acquisitions of Power or Riches; that great satisfaction of foiling and bearing down our Enemies, and obliging and making sure our more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable Friends; to which finally you may adde all the variety of Mirth and Pastime that flesh and blood can entertain it self with, from either <hi>Musick, Wine,</hi> or <hi>Women.</hi>

               <p n="10">10. Thirdly and lastly, the Mortality of the Soul is not onely inconsistent with the <hi>Veracity</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> of God, but also with his <hi>Goodness,</hi> the most soveraign and sacred Attribute in the Deity, and which alone is enough to demonstrate, That the Soul of man cannot perish in Death. For suppose that God had made no promise to us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any extraordinary Prophet, or by the suggestion of our own natural Faculties, that we shall be Immortal, and that there was neither Merit nor Demerit in this life, so that all plea from either the Divine <hi>Veracity</hi> or <hi>Justice</hi> were quite cut off; his <hi>Goodness</hi> alone (especially if we consider how capable the Soul is of after-subsistence) is a sufficient assurance that we shall not fail to live after Death. For how can that soveraign <hi>Goodness,</hi> assisted by an omnipotent Knowledge, fail to contrive it so; it being so infinitely more conformable to his Transcendent Bounty,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55765:181"/>
to ordain thus then otherwise? that is to say, so soon as he created the World, to make it so compleat, as at once to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Being not onely all Corporeal Substance (according as all men confess he did) but also all Substances <hi>Immaterial</hi> or <hi>Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,</hi> and as many of them as can partake of Life, and of enjoyment of themselves and the Universe, to set them upon living and working in all places and Elements that their Nature is able to operate in; and therefore amongst other Beings of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Order, that the Souls of men also, whereever they were, or ever should be, especially if it were not long of themselves, should have a power of Life and Motion, and that no other <hi>Nemesis</hi> should follow them then what they themselves lay the trains of; nor this to utter annihilation, but by way of chastisement or punishment: and that they being of so multifarious a nature, as to have such Faculties as are nearly a-kin to Brutes, as well as such as have so close an affinity with those of the aereal <hi>Genii</hi> and celestial Angels, that their <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> should be as multifarious, and themselves made capable of a living Union with either <hi>Celestial, AErial,</hi> or <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial</hi> Vehicles; and that the leaving of one should be but the taking up of another,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55765:182"/>
so long as the Elements continue in their natural temper, and as soon as the Laws of Generation will permit.</p>
               <p n="11">11. These, and a long series of other things consonant to these, represent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their view that have the favour of beholding the more hidden treasures of the <hi>Divine Benignity.</hi> But they being more then the present occasion requires, I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self with what precisely touches the matter in hand, which is, That the Soul of Man being capable to act after this life in an <hi>AErial Vehicle,</hi> as well as here in an <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and it being better that she do live and act, then that she be idle and silent in death; and it depending meerly upon the Will of God whether she shall or no; He ordering the natures of things infallibly according to what is best, must of necessity ordain that the Souls of men live and act after death. This is an unavoidable Deduction of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to those that acknowledge the Being of God, and rightly relish that transcendent Attribute in the Divine Nature. For those that have a true sense thereof, can as hardly deny this Conclusion as the Existence of the Deity. Nor can they ever be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that He who is so perfectly good in himself, and to whom they have so long ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered in faithful obedience and amorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotion,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55765:182"/>
has made them of such a nature, that when they hope most to enjoy him, they shall not be able to enjoy him at all, nor any thing else; as not being in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to act but in an earthly Body. But to those that be of a meer animal temper, that relish no love but that of themselves and their own interest, nor care for any but those that are serviceable to them, and make for their profit, these being prone to judge of God according to the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their own Spirit, will easily conceit, that Gods care of us and tenderness over us is onely proportionable to the fruit he reaps by us; which is just none at all.</p>

                  <head>AXIOME XXVII.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The <hi>Soule</hi> separate from this <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Body is not released from all <hi>Vital Union</hi> with Matter.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="2">2. THis is the general Opinion of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists. Plotinus</hi> indeed dissents, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning the most divine Souls, as if they at last were perfectly unbared of all Matter, and had no union with any thing but God himself: which I look upon as a fancy proceeding from the same inequality of temper, that made him surmise that the most degenerate Soules did at last sleep in the bodies of Trees, and grew up meerly into <hi>Plantal life.</hi> Such fictions as these of fancyfull men have much depraved the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Cabbala</hi> and sacred Doctrine which the <hi>Platonists</hi> themselves doe profess to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a holy <hi>Tradition</hi> received from the mouth of God or Angels. But however <hi>Plotinus</hi> himself does not deny but till the Soule arrive to such an exceeding height of purification, that she acts in either an <hi>aiery</hi> or <hi>celestial</hi> Body. But that she is never released so perfectly from all Matter, how pure soever and tenuious, her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of operating here in this life is a greater
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55765:184"/>
presumption then can be fetcht from any thing else, that she ever is. For we finde plainly that her most subtil and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual operations depend upon the fitness of temper in the Spirits; and that it is the fineness and purity of them that invites her and enables her to love and look after <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>intellectual</hi> Objects: Which kind of Motions if she could exert immediately by her own proper power and essence, what should hinder her but that, having a will, she should bring it to effect, which yet we finde she cannot if the Spirits be indisposed. Nor can the Soule well be hindred by the undue temper of the Spirits in these Acts, if they be of that nature that they belong to the bare essence of the Soule quite praescinded from all Union with Matter. For then as to these Acts it is all one where the Soule is, that is, in what Matter she is (and she must be in some, because the Universe is every where thick-set with Matter) whether she be raised into the purest regions of the Aire, or plunged down into the foulest Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Earth or Water; for her <hi>intellectual</hi> actings would be alike in both. What then is there imaginable in the <hi>Body</hi> that can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her in these Operations? Wherefore it is plain that the nature of the Soule is such, as that she cannot act but in dependence
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55765:185"/>
on Matter, and that her Operations are some way or other alwaies modified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And therefore if the Soule act at all after death, (which we have demonstrated she does) it is evident that she is not released from all vitall union with all kind of Matter whatsoever: Which is not onely the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> but of <hi>Aristotle</hi> also, as may be easily gathered out of what we have above cited out of him, Lib. 2. Cap. 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Besides, it seems a very wilde leap in nature, that the Soul of Man, from being so deeply and muddily immersed into Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to keep company with Beasts, by vitall union with gross flesh and bones, should so on a suddain be changed, that she should not adhere to any Matter whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but ascend into an <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or <hi>pure Intellects.</hi> This must seem to any indifferent man very harsh and incongruous, especially if we consider what noble Beings there are on this side the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that all the Philosophers that ever treated of them acknowledge to be vitally united with either <hi>aerial</hi> or <hi>aethereal</hi> Vehicles. For of this condition are all the <hi>Genii</hi> or Angels. It is sufficient therefore that the Soule never
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:55765:185"/>
exceed the immateriality of those orders of Beings; the lower sort whereof that they are vitally united to Vehicles of Aire, their ignorance in Nature seems manifestly to bewray. For it had been an easy thing, and more for their credit, to have informed their followers better in the Mysteries of Nature; but that themselves were ignorant of these things, which they could not but know, if they were not thus bound to their <hi>aiery</hi> bodies. For then they were not enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to move with the whole course of the Aire, but keeping themselves steddy, as being disunited from all Matter, they might in a moment have perceived both the <hi>diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>annual motion</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and so have saved the Credit of their followers, by communicating this Theory to them; the want of the knowledge whereof spoiles their repute with them that understand the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme of the world better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for all they boast of their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, so as if it were the Dictate of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Angels.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>There is a Triple <hi>Vitall Congruity</hi> in the Soule, namely <hi>AEthereall, AEriall,</hi> and <hi>Terrestriall.</hi>

Of the <hi>Terrestrial Congruity</hi> there can be no doubt; and as little can there be but that at least one of the other two is to be granted, else the Soule would be released from all vital union with Matter after Death.

But the Soule of Man is capable of very high refinements, even to a condition purely An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall.

                  <argument>
                     <p>According to the usual custome of Nature, the Soul awakes orderly into these <hi>Vital Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities,</hi> not passing from one Extreme to another without any stay in the middle.</p>

For considering how small degrees of purification the Souls of almost all men get in this life, even theirs who pass vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly for honest and good men, it will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow that very few arrive to their <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal</hi> Vehicle immediately upon quitting their <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Body; that being a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that has appertained to none but very Noble and <hi>Heroical</hi> Spirits indeed, of which History records but very few. But that there may be degrees of purity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the <hi>AErial</hi> Bodies, is a thing that is not to be denied, so that a just <hi>Nemesis</hi> will finde out every one after death.</p>

for considering the brushiness and angulosity of the parts of the Air, a more then ordinary Motion or compressive Rest may very well prove painful to the Soul, and dis-harmonious to her touch; and partly from what we may observe in our own Spirits in this Body, which we can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly direct, not give Motion to, nor diminish their Motion by our Imagination or Will, (for no man can imagine himself into Heat or Cold, the sure consequences of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Motion and Rest, by willing his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to move faster or slower; but he may direct them into the Organs of spontaneous Motion, and so by moving the grosser parts of the Body, by this direction he may spend them, and heat these parts in the expence of them; and this is all we can doe) and partly from that Divine Providence that made all things, and measures out the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Faculties of his Creatures accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Wisdome and Counsel, and therefore has bound that state of the Soul to straighter conditions, that is competible to the bad as well as to the good.</p>

THE truth of the first part of this Axiome appears from daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; for we may frequently observe how strangely the <hi>Passions</hi> of the Mind will work upon our Spirits in this state, how Wrath, and Grief, and Envy will alter the Body, to say nothing of other Affections. And as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly the finer the Body is, the more mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it is upon this account: so that the <hi>Passions</hi> of the Minde must needs have a very great influence upon the Souls <hi>AEreal Vehicle;</hi> which though they cannot change into any thing but Air, yet they may change this Air into qualifications as vastly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as <hi>Vertue</hi> is from <hi>Vice, Sickness</hi> from <hi>Health, Pain</hi> from <hi>Pleasure, Light</hi> from <hi>Darkness,</hi> and the <hi>stink</hi> of a <hi>Gaol</hi> from the <hi>Aromatick odours</hi> of a flourishing <hi>Paradise.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THat we may now have a more clear and determinate apprehension of the nature and condition of the Soul out of the Body, let us first consider her a while, what she is in her own Essence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reference to any Body at all, and we shall finde her <hi>a Substance extended and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerpible,</hi> as may be easily gathered out of what we have written, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3, 5, 8. as also <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1, 2. And it is a season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contemplation here (where we consider the Soul as having left this <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) that she hath as ample, if not more ample, Dimensions of her own, then are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in the Body she has left. Which I think worth taking notice of, that it may stop the mouths of them that, not without reason, laugh at those unconceivable and ridiculous fancies of the Schools; that first rashly take
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:55765:191"/>
a way all <hi>Extension</hi> from Spirits, whether Soules or Augels, and then dispute how many of them booted and spur'd may dance on a needles point at once. Fooleries much derogatory to the Truth, and that pinch our perception into such an intolerable streightness and evanidness, that we cannot imagine any thing of our own Being; and if we doe, are prone to fall into despair, or contempt of our selves, by fancying our selves such unconsiderable Motes of the Sun.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But as it is very manifest that the Soule has Dimensions, and yet not infinite, and therefore that she is necessarily bounded in some Figure or other; so it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether there be any peculiar Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure naturall to her, answerable to <hi>animal shape,</hi> or whether she be of her self of either a Round or Oval figure, but does change her shape according as occasion requires. It is not material to define any thing in this Question more then thus, That when the Soule acts in <hi>Terrestrial Matter,</hi> her <hi>Plastick</hi> part is determined to the Organization of the Body into humane forme; and in the <hi>AEreal</hi> or <hi>AEthereal,</hi> that she is neither more nor less determined to any shape then the <hi>Genii</hi> or Angels, and that if their Vehicles are more naturally guided into one shape
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:55765:191"/>
then another, that hers is in the same condition; so that in her visible Vehicle she will bear the ordinary form of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, such a countenance, and so cloathed, as they.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which is more material, I think is more easy to be defined, and that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soule be one <hi>Homogeneal</hi> Substance, or whether it be in some manner <hi>Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal.</hi> That the latter is in some measure true, is manifest from what we have written <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. viz. That the <hi>Perceptive</hi> faculty reaches not throughout the whole Soule, but is confined to a certain part, which we called the <hi>Centre</hi> or <hi>Eye of the Soule,</hi> as also her <hi>Perceptive part;</hi> but all the rest <hi>Plastick.</hi> But here arises a further Scruple, whether there be not an <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneity</hi> in the very <hi>Plastick</hi> part also of the Soule. The <hi>Aristotelians</hi> seem to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident there is not, and doe affirm that if there were an Eye in the Toe, the Toe would see as well as the Head. Of which I very much doubt: For hence it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that some Creatures would have a glimmering of Light all over, they being in a manner all over transparent; and some thin and clear Complexions might haply have the perception of Light betwixt the lower parts of their Fingers, which are in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:55765:192"/>
some good measure pellucid; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Life and Spirits being continued from thence to the <hi>Conarion,</hi> as they are, or to the fourth Ventricle of the Brain, it would follow that the Soule would have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of some glimmerings of Light from thence, which were to <hi>see</hi> there as well as to <hi>feel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore it seems more rationall to admit an <hi>Heterogeneity</hi> in the <hi>Plastick</hi> part of the Soule also, and to acknowledge that every removall from the Seat of Common Sense, that is to say, every Circle that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds the Centre of the Soule, has not the same bounds of power, neither for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nor extent. But that as concerning the former, there is a gradual falling off from the first excellency, which is the <hi>Perceptive</hi> part of the Soule; the closest Circle to which is that part of the <hi>Plastick</hi> that is able to convey Objects of Sight as well as of Touch and Hearing, and what other Senses else there may be in the Soule. The next Circle is <hi>Hearing</hi> without <hi>Seeing,</hi> though not without <hi>Touch:</hi> for <hi>Touch</hi> spreads through all, but in its exteriour region, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively the greatest, it transmits the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiated Perceptions of no Objects but those that are <hi>Tactile;</hi> but to others it is onely as a dead Medium, as the Circle
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:55765:192"/>
of Hearing is but as a dead Medium to the Objects of Sight. So that if we would please our Imagination with <hi>Ficinus,</hi> in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying the Soule as a Star, we shall doe it more perfectly, if we look upon her in her Circles, as having an <hi>Halo</hi> about her: For the Soule to our <hi>Reason</hi> is no more <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal,</hi> then that Spectacle is to our <hi>Sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But if we look upon the Soule as ever propending to some personall shape, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the <hi>Plastick</hi> rayes must then tend to a kind of Organization, so far as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducent to the state the Soule is in, whether in an <hi>Aiery</hi> or <hi>AEthereal</hi> Vehicle. For that the <hi>Plastick</hi> power omits or changes as she is drawn forth by the nature of the Matter she acts upon, is discoverable in her Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of our Bodies here. For in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood the Soule in her self is as much of one sex as another; which makes her some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times signe the Matter with both, but that very seldome: and therefore it is manifest that she omits one part of her <hi>Plastick</hi> power, and makes use of the other, in almost all efformations of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> Whence it is easy to conclude, that supposing her <hi>Plastick</hi> power naturally work the <hi>AEthereal</hi> or <hi>AEreal</hi> Vehicle into any <hi>animal shape,</hi> it may put forth onely such stroaks of the efformative
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:55765:193"/>
vertue as are convenient and becoming the Angelical Nature. But according to this Hypothesis haply all Objects of Sense will not arrive to the Centre of the Soule from every part of the Horizon; no not though this Organization were not naturall but meerly arbitrarious. But be the Soule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived either bound up thus into <hi>animal forme,</hi> or spread loose into any careless round shape, according as her rayes shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splay themselves in her <hi>Vehicle</hi> of <hi>Aire</hi> or <hi>AEther,</hi> yet the seat of sight will be duely restrained, which is a consideration of no contemptible consequence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This in generall may suffice concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very Nature of the Soule it self, her <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Heterogeneity.</hi> I shall onely adde to this one Observable concerning her <hi>Aiery</hi> and <hi>AEthereal Vehicle,</hi> and then I shall descend to more particular disquisitions. Rash fancies and false deductions from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood Experiments have made some very confident that there is a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature, and that every Body by how much more light it is, so much less substance it has in it self. A thing very fond and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, at the first sight, to such as are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently well versed in the incomparable Philosophy of <hi>Renatus Des-Cartes,</hi> whose dexterous wit and through insight into the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:55765:193"/>
nature and lawes of Matter, has so perfected the reasons of those <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooritus, Epicurus, Lucretius</hi> and others have puzzled themselves about, that there seems nothing now wanting as concerning that way of Philosophizing, but patience and an unprejudiced judgment to peruse what he has writ.</p>
               <p n="7">7. According therefore to his Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and the Truth, there is ever as much Matter or Body in one consistency as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as for example, there is as much Matter in a Cup of Aire as in the same Cup filled with Water, and as much in this Cup of Water as if it were filled with Lead or Quicksilver. Which I take notice of here, that I may free the imagination of men from that ordinary and idiotick misapprehension which they entertain of Spirits that appear, as if they were as evanid and devoid of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as the very shadowes of our Bodies cast against a Wall, or our Images reflected from a River or Looking-glass: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this errour have given them names accordingly, calling the Ghosts of men that present themselves to them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Umbrae, Images</hi> and <hi>Shades.</hi> The which, the more visible they are, they think them the more substantial; fancying that the Aire is so condensed, that there is not onely more
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55765:194"/>
of it, but also that simply there is more Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Substance, when it appears thus visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then there was in the same space before. And therefore they must needs conceit that Death reduces us to a pittifull thin pittance of Being, that our Substance is in a manner lost, and nothing but a tenuious reek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, no more in proportion to us, then what a sweating horse leaves behind him as he gallops by in a frosty morning. Which certainly must be a very lamentable consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to such as love this thick and plump Body they beare about with them, and are pleased to consider how many pounds they outweighed their Neighbour the last time they were put in the ballance together.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But if a kinde of dubious Transparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will demonstrate the <hi>deficiency</hi> of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Substance, a Pillar of <hi>Crystal</hi> will have less thereof then one of <hi>Tobacco-smoak;</hi> which though it may be so doubtful and evanid an Object to the Eye, if we try it by the Hand, it will prove exceeding so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid: as also these Ghosts that are said to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this manner have proved to them that have touched them, or have been tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by them. For it is a thing ridiculous and unworthy of a Philosopher, to judge the measure of corporeal Matter by what it
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:55765:194"/>
seems to our <hi>sight;</hi> for so Air would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: or what it is to our <hi>handing</hi> or weighing of it; for so indeed a Cup of Quick-silver would seem to have infinitely more Matter in it then one fill'd with Air onely, and a vessel of Water less when it is plung'd under the water in the River, then when it is carried in the Air. But we are to remember, that let Matter be of what consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency it will, as thin and pure as the flame of a candle, there is not less of corporeal Substance therein then there is in the same dimensions of Silver, Lead, or Gold.</p>
               <p n="9">9. So that we need not bemoan the shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd condition of the deceased, as if they were stript almost of all Substance corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, and were too thinly clad to enjoy themselves as to any Object of Sense. For they have no less Body then we our selves have, onely this Body is far more active then ours, being more <hi>spiritualized,</hi> that is to say, having greater degrees of Motion communicated unto it; which the whole Matter of the world receives from some <hi>spiritual</hi> Being or other, and therefore in this regard may be said the more to symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize with that immaterial Being, the more Motion is communicated to it: As it does also in that which is the effect of Motion, to wit the tenuity and subtilty of its particles,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:55765:195"/>
whereby it is enabled to imitate, in some sort, the proper priviledge of Spirits that pass through all Bodies whatsoever. And these Vehicles of the Soul, by reason of the tenuity of their parts, may well pass through such Matter as seems to us impervious, though it be not really so to them. For Matter reduced to such fluid subtilty of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as are invisible, may well have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance through Pores unperceptible. Whence it is manifest that the Soul, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a natural sense, loseth nothing by Death, but is a very considerable gainer thereby. For she does not onely possess as much Body as before, with as full and solid dimensions, but has that accession cast in, of having this Body more invigorated with Life and Motion then it was formerly. Which consideration I could not but take notice of, that I might thereby expunge that false conceit that adheres to most mens fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, of that <hi>evanid</hi> and <hi>starved</hi> condition of the other state.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THose more particular Enquiries we intend to fall upon, may be reduced to these few Heads: viz. <hi>The place of the Souls abode, Her employment,</hi> and <hi>Her moral condition after Death.</hi> That the <hi>place of Her abode</hi> is the <hi>Aire,</hi> is the constant opinion of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:55765:196"/>
the ancient Philosophers and natural The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologers, who doe unanimously make <hi>that Element</hi> the Receptacle of Souls departed: which therefore they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because men deceased are in a state of invisibility, as the place they are confined to is an Element utterly invisible of its own nature, and is accloy'd also with caliginous mists, and enveloped by vicissitudes with the dark shadow of the Earth. The truth of this opinion of theirs is plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable from the 29. and 31. Axiomes. For Nature making no enormous jumps, it must needs follow, that separate Souls must take their first station in the Aire, because that <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> that fits an <hi>AErial Vehicle</hi> does of order awaken immediately upon the quitting of the <hi>Earthly Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore the Soul being thus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally united with a <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Vehicle</hi> of Aire, it is impossible that she should drive out of those Regions: because her motions are onely according to the capacity of her Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, she being not able to alter the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency thereof into any more subtile or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer temper then the Aire will admit of, keeping still its own Species. Onely she may conspissate the Aire by directing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof towards her, and so squeezing out a considerable part of the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55765:196"/>
Element may retain more Aire then ordinary: But she cannot command the Air from her so entirely, as to actuate these two Elements alone, or any considerable part of them, because the <hi>AEthereal Congruity</hi> of life is as yet wholy asleep; nor is it in the power of the Soul to awake it as she plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and therefore it would be Pain and Death to her to attempt the removal of the aerial Matter quite from her. Besides that it would require such a force as would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a contribution of motion to it, as well as direction of it, to make it able to bear against other parts of the Aire that love not to be streightned nor crouded: which though it may haply be done in some measure, yet that she may by this force of direction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a whole Vehicle of <hi>AEther,</hi> seems ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively improbable, as is plain from the 31. Axiome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore it is necessary that the Soul departed this life should be somewhere in the Aire, though it be not at all necessary that they should inhabit all of them the same Region thereof. For as some Souls are more purified then others when they leave the Body, so a more pure degree of <hi>Vital Congruity</hi> will awake in them: whence by that Divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> that runs through all things, they will be naturally conveyed
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:55765:197"/>
to such places, and be associated to such company as is most congruous to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and will be as distinctly sorted by that eternal Justice that God has so deeply ingrafted in the very essential contexture of the Universe, as humane Laws dispose of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with us, sending some to Prisons, some to Pest-houses, and others to the <hi>Prytaneum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It will therefore, in all likelihood, fall to some of their shares to be fatally fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this lower Region of the Aire, as I doubt not but many other Spirits are; though <hi>Cardan</hi> much pleases himself with a peculiar conceit of his own, as if the supreme Region of the Aire was the onely habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all <hi>Daemons</hi> or Spirits whatever, and that their descent to us is as rare as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Men into the bottome of the Sea, and almost as difficult, this thick Aire we breathe in being in a manner as unsutable to their tenuious consistencies as the Water is to us; in which we are fain to hold out breath, and consequently to make a very short stay in that Element. Besides that he fancies the passage of the Middle Region tedious to them, by reason of its Coldness; which therefore he saith is as it were a fence betwixt us and them, as the Sea is betwixt the Fishes and us; whom though we exceed much in Wit and Industry, and have a great
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:55765:197"/>
desire to catch them and kill them, yet we get very few into our hands in comparison of those that scape us: And so these <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> though they bear us no good will, by bodily conflict they can hurt none of us (as being so difficult a thing to come at us) and very few of us by their Art and Industry. For this fancyfull Philosopher will have them onely attempt us as we do the Fishes, by Baits, and Nets, and Eel-spears, or such like Engines which we cast into the bottom of the Water: So these aerial <hi>Genii,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their station above in the third Region of the Aire (as we doe on the bank of the River, or in a Boat on the Sea, when we fish) by sending down Dreams and Apparitions, may entangle some men so, that by affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and disturbances of minde at last, though at this distance, they may work their ruine and destruction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Hypothesis, I suppose, he has framed to give an account why the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the <hi>Genii</hi> is so seldome, and why so little hurt is done by them as there is. For an Answer would be ready, that this lower A<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e is no Element for them to abide in: and that it is as foolishly argued by those that say there are no Spirits, because they are so seldome seen, as if the Fishes, upon a concession of Speech and Reason to their
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:55765:198"/>
mute Tribe, should generally conclude, that there are no such Creatures as Men or Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, because it happens so very seldome that they can see them; and should contemn and laugh ac those Fishes that, having had the hap to meet with them, should say they have seen such Creatures, as if they were fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and lunatick, and not well in their wits, or else too much in them, and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived such fictions for some political design.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Which Parable may hold good, though not upon the same grounds, onely by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting <hi>difference of condition</hi> for <hi>distance of place;</hi> and the similitude will prove as sound as before. For, for a Spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densate his Vehicle to almost a Terrestrial grossness and Visibility, is as rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth as for Terrestrial animals to dive to the bottom of the Sea, and its likely every jot as difficult: and so the reason as obvious why so few are seen, &amp; the confident denial of their existence as rash and foolish, by then that have not seen them themselves. For it is as if the Fishes should contest amongst themselves about the existence of Men, and their diving into the Water, and whether there were any places haunted in the Sea; as those would be the most famous where they fish for Pearls, or that cause the most frequent Shipwracks, or are most pleasant
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:55765:198"/>
to swim in. And some notable occasion, mischance, or weighty design, such as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre more rarely, must be reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the onely invitements to the <hi>Genii</hi> to expose themselves to our view.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That there is so little hurt done by them, need not be resolved into the distance of their habitation, but into the <hi>Law of the Universe,</hi> whose force penetrates through all orders of Beings. Besides, it is too trivial and idiotick a conceit, &amp; far below the pitch of a Philosopher, to think that <hi>all</hi> AErial Spirits are Haters of Mankinde, so as to take delight meerly in destroying them. For Men do not hate Fishes because they live in another Element different from theirs, but catch them meerly in love to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for gain and food; which the aiery <hi>Genii</hi> cannot aim at in destroying of us. But to doe Mischef meerly for Mischiefs sake, is so excessive an Enormity, that some doubt whether it be competible to any <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Being.</hi> And therefore <hi>Cardan</hi> ought to have proved that first: as also, if there be any so extremely degenerate, that there be many of them, or rather so many that they cannot be awed by the number of those that are less depraved. For we may observe that men amongst our selves that are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wicked, yet they abhor very much from
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:55765:199"/>
those things that are grossly &amp; causlesly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to either Man or Beast; &amp; themselves would help to destroy, punish, or at least hinder the attempters of such wild &amp; exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant outrages that have no pretence of Reason, but are a meer exercise of Cruelty and Vexation to other Creatures. He also ought to have demonstrated, that all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are not the <hi>Peculium</hi> of some Spirits or other, and that there are not invisible Governours of Nations, Cities, Families, and sometime of particular Men; and that at least a <hi>Political Goodness,</hi> such as serves for the safety of Persons and what belongs to them, is not exceedingly more prevalent even in these Kingdomes of the Aire, then <hi>gross Injustice.</hi> For all this may be on this side of the <hi>Divine Life:</hi> so that there is no feare of making these aerial Inhabitants over-perfect by this Supposition. In a word, he should have proved that <hi>Political Order,</hi> in the full exercise thereof, did not reach from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Earth,</hi> and pierce into the <hi>Subterraneous Regions</hi> also, if there be any <hi>Intellectual Creatures</hi> there. For this will suffice to give a reason that so little hurt is done, though all places be full of <hi>AErial Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Adde unto all this, that though they may not be permitted to doe any gross evill
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:55765:199"/>
themselves, and to kill men at pleasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their consents, yet they may abet them in such wayes, or invite them to such courses, as will prove destructive to them: but, it may be, with no greater plot then we have when we set Doggs together by the eares, fight Cocks, bait Beares and Bulls, run Horses, and the like; where often, by our occasion, as being excited and animated by us, they pursue their own inclinations, to the loss of their lives. But though we doe not care to kill a Dog or a Cock in this way; yet there is none so barbarous as to knock these Creatures on the head meerly because they will doe so. So these worser kind of <hi>Genii,</hi> according as their tempers are, may haply follow some men prone to such or such vices, in which they may drive them in way of contest, or to please their own fancies, to the utmost they can doe in it; and, taking their parts, sport themselves in making one man overcome another in duelling, in drinking, in craft and undermining, in wenching, in getting riches, in clambering to honours; and so of the rest. Where it may be their pastime to try the Victory of that Person they have taken to; and if he perish by the hurry of their temptations and animations, it is a thing they intended no more, it may be,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:55765:200"/>
then he that sets his Cock into the pit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires his neck should be broke: but if it happen so, the sorrow is much alike in both cases. And therefore these Spirits may doe mischief enough in the world, in abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men that act it, though haply they neither take pleasure in doing of it upon any other termes, nor if they did, are able to doe it, there being so many watchfull eyes over them. For these <hi>AErial Legions</hi> are as capable of <hi>Political Honesty,</hi> and may as deeply resent it, as the Nations of the Earth doe, and it may be more deeply.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But if these Creatures were removed so far off as <hi>Cardan</hi> would have them, I doe not see how they could have any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at all with us, to doe us either good or hurt. For that they are able to send Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions or Dreames at this distance, is it self but a Dream, occasioned from that first errour in the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Philosophy, that makes God and the Intelligences act from the heavenly sphears, and so to produce all these effects of Nature below; such as can never be done but by a present <hi>Numen</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> that pervades all things.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This conceit therefore of his shall be no hindrance to our concluding, That this lower Region of the Aire is also replenisht with <hi>Daemons.</hi> Which if it be, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:55765:200"/>
but that the impurer Souls wander there also; though I have taken all this pains to bring still greater trouble upon my self. For it is obvious to object that which <hi>Lucretius</hi> has started of old, that this Region being so obnoxious to Windes and tempests, the Souls will not be able to keep their Vehicles of Aire about them, but that they will be blown in pieces by the roughness of these storms. But we may be easily delivered of this solicitude, if we consider the nature of the <hi>Windes,</hi> the nature of these <hi>Vehicles,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Statick</hi> power of the Soule. For to say theywil make as good shift as the <hi>Genii</hi> here, is not fully satisfactory, because a man would also willingly understand how the <hi>Genii</hi> themselves are not liable to this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. My Answer therefore shall reach both.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That <hi>Windes</hi> are nothing else but Watery particles at their greatest agitation, <hi>Cartesius</hi> has very handsomely demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his <hi>Meteors:</hi> Which particles doe not so much drive the Aire before them, as pass through it, as a flight of arrowes and showers of haile or rain. One part of the Aire therefore is not driven from another; but it is as if one should conceive so many little pieces of haire twirling on their mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle point as at quarter-staffe, and so passing through the Aire; which motion would pass
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:55765:201"/>
free, without carrying the Aire along with it. This therefore being the nature of Winde, the Aire is not torn apieces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, though we finde the <hi>impetus</hi> of it move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against us, because it cannot penetrate our Bodies with that facility that it does the Aire.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But the <hi>Vehicles</hi> of the <hi>Genii</hi> and Souls deceased are much-what of the very nature of the Aire; whence it is plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the Winde should have any other force on them, then what it has on the rest of that Element; and therefore the least thing imaginable will hold all the parts together. Which is true also if the Winde did carry along the Aire with it: for then the Vehicles of the <hi>Genii</hi> would move along with the stream, suffering little or no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence at all, unless they would force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against it. Which they are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to doe, as indeed not so much as to come into it, or not at least to continue in it, but may take shelter, as other living Creatures doe, in houses, behind walls, in woods, dales, caverns, rocks and other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious places; and that maturely enough, the change of Aire and prognostick of storms being more perceptible to them then to any terrestrial animal.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And yet they need not be so cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:55765:201"/>
to keep out of danger, they having a power to grapple with the greatest of it, which is their <hi>Statick</hi> faculty; which arises from the power of directing the motion of the particles of their Vehicle. For they having this power of directing the motion of these particles which way they please, by Axiome 31. it necessarily followes, that they can determinate their course inwards, or toward the Centre; by which direction they will be all kept close together, firm and tight: which ability I call the <hi>Statick</hi> power of the Soule. Which if it can direct the whole agitation of the particles of the Vehicle, as well those of the first and second Element as those of the Aire, and that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the Centre, and partly in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertendency against the storme, this force and firmness will be far above the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest windes that she can possibly meet with.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Wherefore the Soules Vehicle is in no danger from the boisterousness of the Winds, and if it were, yet there is no fear of cessation of Life. For as the Wind blowes off one part of Aire, it brings on another which may be immediately actuated by the presence of the Soule; though there be no need to take refuge in so large an Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. And it is more probable that she is more
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:55765:202"/>
peculiarly united to one part of the Aire then another, and that she dismisses her Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle but by degrees, as our Spirits leasurely pass away by insensible Perspiration.</p>
               <p n="15">15. We see how little the Souls Vehicle can be incommodated by storms of Winde. And yet Rain, Haile, Snow and Thunder will incommodate her still less. For they pass as they doe through other parts of the Aire, which close again immediately, and leave neither wound nor scarre behinde them. Wherefore all these Meteors in their Mediocrity may be a pleasure to her and refreshment; and in their excess no long pain, nor in their highest rage any destruction of life at all. From whence we may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that not onely the Upper Region, but this Lower also, may be inhabited both by the <hi>deceased Souls</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and by <hi>Daemons.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:55765:203"/>
2. As for those <hi>employments</hi> wherewith she may entertain her self <hi>in solitude,</hi> they are either <hi>Objects</hi> of the <hi>External Senses,</hi> or of the <hi>Inward Minde.</hi> Concerning the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> whereof it is more easie to move Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions then satisfy them; as Whether she have the same number of Senses she had in this life. That she is endued with <hi>Hearing, Sight</hi> and <hi>Touch,</hi> I think there can be no scruple, because these will fall to her share necessarily, whether her <hi>Vehicle</hi> be organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or not; and that of <hi>Seeing</hi> and <hi>Touch</hi> is the most uncontrovertible of all. For the sense of visible Objects being discovered to us by transmission of Motion through those Spherical particles that are continued along from the Object through the Aire to our very Organ of Sight (which sees meerly by reason of these particles vitally united with the Soul) the same particles pervading all the Souls Vehicle, it is impossible but that she should see. But the Question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she sees in every part thereof. To which I must answer, No: partly from what I have already declared concerning the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneity</hi> of her <hi>Plastick part;</hi> and partly from a gross inconvenience that would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Supposition. For if we should grant that the Soul saw in every part of her Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, every Object that is near would not
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:55765:203"/>
onely seem double, but centuple, or mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuple; which would be a very ugly enormity and defacement of Sight. Wherefore we have, with very good reason, restrained the <hi>Visive faculty</hi> of the Soul in this state of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, as well as it was in the <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But this hinders nothing but that the Soul, when she lies in one <hi>Homogeneal</hi> orb of Aire, devoid of organization, may see round about her, behinde, before, above, beneath, and every way. But if she organize her Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, Sight may haply be restrain'd, as in us who cannot see behinde us. Which Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration we toucht upon before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is plain therefore that these AErial Spirits, though we cannot see them, cannot miss of seeing us; and that, it may be, from a mighty distance, if they can transform their Vehicle, or the Organ of Sight, into some such advantageous Figure as is wrought in Dioptrick Glasses. Which power will infinitely exceed the contracting and dilating of the pupil of our Eye, which yet is a weaker and more defectuous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt towards so high a Priviledge as we speak of: which notwithstanding may seem very possible in Spirits from 31. and 34. Axiomes. The same also may be said of their <hi>Hearing.</hi> For the same principle may
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:55765:204"/>
enable them to shape themselves Organs for the receiving of <hi>Sounds,</hi> of greater art and excellency then the most accurate <hi>Acoustick</hi> we read of, or can excogitate. Wherefore it is a very childish mistake to think, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we neither <hi>see</hi> the shape nor <hi>hear</hi> the discourse of <hi>Spirits,</hi> that they neither <hi>hear</hi> nor <hi>see</hi> us. For soft Bodies are impressible by hard ones, but not on the contrary; as melted Wax will receive the Signature of the Seal, but the Seal is not at all impressed upon by the Wax. And so a solid Body will stop the course of the Aire, but the Aire will not stop the course of a solid Body; and every inconsiderable terrestrial consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency will reflect Light, but Light scarce moves any terrestrial Body out of its place, but is rebounded back by it. That therefore that is most tenuious and thin, is most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and therefore if it be once the Vehicle of Sense, is most sensible. Whence it will follow, that the reflexion of Light from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being able to move our Organs, that are not so fine, they will more necessarily move those of the <hi>Genii,</hi> and at a greater distance. But their Bodies being of <hi>diaphanous Aire,</hi> it is impossible for us to <hi>see</hi> them, unless they will give themselves the trouble of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to a more <hi>terrestrial consistency,</hi> whereby they may reflect light. Nor can
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:55765:204"/>
we easily <hi>hear</hi> their ordinary speech, partly because a very gentle motion of the Aire will act upon their Vehicles, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they may haply use the finer and purer part of that Element in this exercise, which is not so fit to move our Sense. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unless they will be heard <hi>datâ operâ,</hi> naturally that impress of the Aire in their usual discourse can never strike <hi>our</hi> Organ.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And that we may not seem to say all this for nought; that they will have <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> as well as <hi>Seeing,</hi> appears from what I have intimated above, that this Faculty is ranged near the <hi>Common Sensorium</hi> in the Vehicle, as well as that of Sight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Vehicle being all Aire, such percus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of it as cause the sense of Sound in us will necessarily doe the like in them; but more accurately, haply, if they organize their Vehicle for the purpose, which will answer to the arrection of the Ears of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, for the better taking in the Sound.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That they have the sense of <hi>Touch</hi> is inevitably true, else how could they feel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, which is necessary in the bearing of one Body against another, because they are impenetrable? And to speak freely my mind, it will be a very hard thing to disprove that they have not something analogical to <hi>Smell</hi> and <hi>Tast,</hi> which are very near a-kin
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:55765:205"/>
to <hi>Touch</hi> properly so called. For Fumes and Odours passing so easily through the Aire, will very naturally insinuate into their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles also: which Fumes, if they be grosser and humectant, may raise that diversifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Touch</hi> which we Mortals call <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting;</hi> if more subtile and dry, that which we call <hi>Smelling.</hi> Which if we should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, we are within modest bounds as yet in comparison of others; as <hi>Cardan,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms downright that the AErial <hi>Genii</hi> are nourished, and that some of them get into the Bodies of Animals to batten themselves there in their Blood and Spirits. Which is also averred by <hi>Marcus</hi> the <hi>Mesopotamian Eremite</hi> in <hi>Psellus,</hi> who tells us that the purer sort of the <hi>Genii</hi> are nourished by drawing in the Aire, as our Spirits are in the Nerves and Arteries; and that other <hi>Genii,</hi> of a courser kinde, suck in moisture, not with the Mouth as we doe, but as a Sponge does water. And <hi>Moses AEgyptius</hi> writes concerning the <hi>Zabii,</hi> that they eat of the blood of their Sacrifice, because they thought it was the food of the <hi>Daemons</hi> they worshipped, and that by eating thereof they were in a better capacity to communicate with them. Which things if they could be believed, that would be no such hard Probleme concerning the Familiars of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:55765:205"/>
why they suck them. But such curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities, being not much to our purpose, I willingly omit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The conclusion of what has been said is this, That it is certain that the <hi>Genii,</hi> and consequently the Souls of men departed, who <hi>ipso facto</hi> are of the same rank with them, have the sense of <hi>Seeing, Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Touching,</hi> and not improbably of <hi>Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and <hi>Tasting.</hi> Which Faculties being granted, they need not be much at a loss how to spend their time, though it were but upon external Objects; all the furniture of Heaven and Earth being fairly exposed to their view. They see the same Sun and Moon that we doe, behold the persons and converse of all men, and, if no special Law inhibit them, may pass from Town to Town, and from City to City, as <hi>Hesiod</hi> also intimates,

They may be also (and haply not uninteressed) Spectators of the glorious and mischievous hazards of War, whether Sea-fights or Land-fights; besides those soft and silent, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times no less dangerous, Combats in the Camps of <hi>Cupid;</hi> and a thousand more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities that it would be too long to reckon up, where they haply are not <hi>men</hi> Spectators but Abettors, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes: Like old men that are past Wrestling, Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Barre, or playing at Cudgels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet will assist and abet the young men of the Parish at those Exercises. So the Souls of men departed, though they have put off with the Body the capacity of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary functions of humane Life, yet they may assist and abet them, as pursuing some design in them; and that either for evil or good, according as they were affected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when they were in the Body.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In brief, whatever is the custome and desire of the Soul in this life, that sticks and adheres to her in that which is to come; and she will be sure, so farre as she is capable, either to act it, or to be at least a Spectator and Abettor of such kinde of actions.

That they cannot well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in a meer simple Orbicular forme. 8. That they converse in humane shape, at least the better sort of them. 9. Whether the shape they be in proceed meerly from the <hi>Imperium</hi> of their Will and Fancy, or is regulated by a natural Character of the <hi>Plastick</hi> part of the Soule. 10. That the personal shape of a Soule or <hi>Genius</hi> is partly from the <hi>Will,</hi> and partly from the <hi>Plastick</hi> power. 11. That considering how the Soul organizes the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, and moves our limbs at pleasure; it were a wonder if Spirits should not have such command over their Vehicles as is believed. 12. A further Argument from an excessive vertue some have given to Imagination.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:55765:208"/>
1. BUT the separate state of the Soule does not condemn her to this Solitude, but being admitted into the order of the <hi>Genii,</hi> she is possessed of their Priviledges, which is to converse personally with this <hi>AErial people,</hi> and also upon occasion with the Inhabitants of the Earth; though the latter with far more difficulty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for her converse with the AErial <hi>Genii</hi> and other Souls separate, it must be in all reason concluded to be exceeding much more frequent then that with men, and yet this latter is in some sort more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible; because it is certain she can see us, light being reflected from our opake Bodies unto her Sense, and by conspissating her Vehicle she may make her self visible to us. But the Vehicles of the <hi>Genii</hi> and of <hi>Souls</hi> being in their natural consistence purely AErial, and Air being a transparent Body, it will transmit the light wholly; and so no reflexion being made from these aiery Bodies, they can have no perception of one anothers presence, and therefore no society nor communion one with another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This seems a shrewd Difficulty at the first view. But it is easily taken off, if we consider that Aire will admit of many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Rarefaction and Condensation, and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55765:209"/>
yet still appear unto us alike invisible, as one may observe in the Weather-glass. But it were more proper to propose in this case the experiment of the Wind-gun, wherein the Aire is compressed to a great number of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of condensatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beyond its natural state; within the compass of many whereof there is no doubt, if not in the utmost, that the Aire does remaine invisible to us. But there is no scruple to be made but that in the progress of these degrees of Condensation the Aire, if it were in a Glass-barrel, might become vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the <hi>Genii,</hi> by reason of the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and delicacy of their Senses, before it would be so to us. Whence it followes, that the Vehicles of the <hi>Genii</hi> may have a consistency different from the Aire, and perceptible to them, that is to say, to one anothers sight, though it be as unpercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to us as the rest of the Aire is. As, it may be, a man that has but bad eyes would not be able to distinguish Ice immersed in the Water from the Water it self by his Sight, though he might by his Touch. Or if their Vehicles could be supposed purer and finer then the rest of the Aire, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence might be perceptible by that means too. For this vaporous Aire having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question a confused reflection of light in it, every way in some proportion like that
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:55765:209"/>
in a Mist, or when the Sun shines waterishly and prognosticks rain; these repercussions of light being far more sensible to the <hi>Genii</hi> then to us, the lessening of them would be more sensible, and therefore the diminution of reflection from their Vehicles would be sufficient to discover their presence one to another: and for the illustrating of this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, the experiment of the Weather-glass is more proper. But the other suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition I look upon as the more likely to be true; and that as the <hi>aquatil Animals</hi> that live in the Sea have a consistency grosser then the Element they move in, so it is with these that live in the Aire, though there be nothing near so great a difference here as in that other Element.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is plain therefore, that the Persons of the <hi>Genii</hi> and separate Souls are visible one to another. But yet not at any distance, and therefore there is necessity of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one another for mutual converse: which enforces us to say something of their <hi>Local Motion.</hi> Which is neither by Fins nor Wings, as in Fishes or Birds, who are fain to sustain themselves by these instruments from sinking to the bottome of either Element: but it is meerly by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the agitation of the particles of their Vehicle toward the place they aime
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:55765:210"/>
at; and in such a swiftness or leasureliness as best pleases themselves, and is competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their natures. For they can goe no swifter then the whole summe of agitation of the particles of their Vehicle will carry so much Matter, nor indeed so swift; for it implies that their Vehicles would be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into an absolutely hard Body, such as Brass or Iron, or whatever we find harder; so that necessarily they would fall down to the Earth as dead as a Stone. Those there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are but phantastick conceits that give such agility to Spirits, as if they could be here and there and every where at once, skip from one Pole of the World to another, &amp; be on the Earth again in a moment: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth they can pass with no greater swiftness then the direction of such a part of the agitation of the particles of their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles will permit, as may be spared from what is employed in keeping them within a tolerable compass of a due aerial flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And this alone will suffice to make them exceed us in activity and swiftness by many degrees. For their whole Vehicle is haply at least as thin and moveable as our animal Spirits, which are very few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of this luggage of an earthly Body that they are to drive along with them. But
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55765:210"/>
the spiritual Bodies of the <hi>Genii</hi> have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to drive along with them but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and therefore are more free and light, compared to us, then a mettl'd Steed that has cast his Rider, compared with a Pack-horse loaden with a sack of Salt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The next, thing to be considered, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>mutual conversation</hi> of these ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <hi>Genii,</hi> is <hi>the shape</hi> they appear in one to another, of what <hi>Figure</hi> it is, and whether the Figure be <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Arbitrarious,</hi> or <hi>Mixt.</hi> For that they must appear in some Figure or other is plain, in that their Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are not of an infinite extension. It is the more general Opinion, that there is no particular Figure that belongs unto them naturally, unless it be that which of all Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures is most simple, and most easy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to, even by external helps, which is the equal compression of the Aire on every side of the Vehicle, by which means drops of Dew and Rain and pellets of Hail come so ordinarily into that shape. Which also will more handsomely accord with the nature of the Soul, supposing she consist of <hi>Central</hi> and <hi>Radial</hi> essence, as I have above descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the Common <hi>Sensorium</hi> be placed in the midst. In this Figure may the Soul reside in the Aire, and haply melt her self, I mean her Vehicle, into near so equal a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidity
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:55765:211"/>
with that part of that Element ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent to her, that it may be in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure like our retiring into secrecy from the sight of men, when we desire to be private by our selves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But she may, if she will, and likely with farre more ease, change this consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her AErial Body into such a degree of thickness, that there may be a dubious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of her, as in the glimpse of a Fish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water, and may still make her self more visible to her fellow-<hi>Genii,</hi> though keeping yet this simple Orbicular form. But what converse there can be betwixt two such heaps of living Aire, I know not. They may indeed communicate their affections one to another in such a way as is discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Eye, wherein the motions of the Spirits doe plainly indicate the Passions of the Minde: so that it may seem possible, in this simple Figure, to make known their joy or grief, peaceableness or wrath, love or dislike, by the modification of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits of their Vehicle. But how there can well be entertained any Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual or Rational Conference, without any further organization of their Aiery Bodies, I profess my self at a loss to understand.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wherefore the <hi>Genii</hi> and <hi>separate Souls,</hi> whatever their shape be in private,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:55765:211"/>
appear in a more operose and articulate form when they are to converse with one another. For they can change their Figure in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they please, by Axiome 34. Which power, I conceive, will be made use of not onely for service, but ornament and pulcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. And the most unexceptionable Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, questionless, is that of Man in the best patterns (chuse what Sex you will) and far above the rest of Creatures; which is not our judgement onely, but His that made us. For certainly he would give to the Principal of <hi>terrestrial Animals</hi> the noblest form and shape; which though it be much obscured by our unfortunate Fall, yet questionless the defacement is not so great, but that we may have a near guess what it has been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It is most rational therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the AErial <hi>Genii</hi> converse with one another in <hi>Humane shape,</hi> at least the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort of them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But the difficulty now is, whether that Humane shape that the Soul transforms her Vehicle into, be simply the effect of the <hi>Imperium</hi> of her Will over the Matter she actuates, or that her Will may be in some measure limited or circumscribed in its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by a concomitant exertion of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> power; so that what proceeds from the Will may be onely more general, that
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:55765:212"/>
is, That the Souls Will may onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Vehicle into an Animal form; but that it is the form or shape of a Man, may arise in a more natural way from the concomitant exertion of the <hi>Plastick</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. I say, in a more easy and natural way: For vehemency of desire to alter the Figure into another representation may make the appearance resemble some other creature: But no forced thing can last long. The more easy and natural shape therefore that, at least, the better <hi>Genii</hi> appear in, is <hi>Humane:</hi> which if it be granted, it may be as likely that such a determinate Humane shape may be more easy and natural then another, and that the Soul, when she wills to appear in personal Figure, will transform her Vehicle into one constant likeness, unless she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise her self on set purpose. That is, the <hi>Plastick</hi> power of every Soul, whether of Men, or of the other <hi>Genii,</hi> does naturally display it self into a different modification of the Humane shape, which is the proper Signature of every particular or individual person: which though it may be a little changed in Generation by vertue of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Parents, or quality of their seed, yet the Soul set free from that Body she got here, may exquisitely recover her ancient form again.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:55765:212"/>
10. Not that the <hi>Plastick</hi> virtue, awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Imperium</hi> of her Will, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newall the lineaments it did in this <hi>Earthly</hi> Body (for abundance of them are useless and to no purpose, which therefore, Providence so ordaining, will be silent in this <hi>aiery</hi> figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and onely such operate as are fit for this separate state; and such are those as are requisite to perfect the visible feature of a Person, giving him all parts of either orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or use for the pleasure of rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;) nor that this Efformative power does determine the whole appearance alone (for these aerial Spirits appear variously clad, some like beautiful Virgins, others like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Warriours with their Helmets and Plumes of feathers, as <hi>Philostratus</hi> would make us believe <hi>Achilles</hi> did to <hi>Apollonius:)</hi> But there is a mixt action and effect, resul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting partly from the freeness of the Will and Imagination, and partly from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propension of the <hi>Plastick</hi> virtue, to cast the Vehicle into such a personal shape.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Which Prerogative of the Soul, in having this power thus to shape her Vehicle at will, though it may seem very strange, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we doe not see it done before our eyes, nor often think of such things; yet it is not much more wonderful then that she orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the womb, or that we
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55765:213"/>
can move the parts of our Body meerly by our Will and Imagination. And that the aerial Spirits can doe these things, that they can thus shape their Vehicles, and transform themselves into several Appearances, I need bring no new instances thereof. Those Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations I have recited in my <hi>Third Book against Atheism</hi> doe sufficiently evince this Truth. And verily, considering the great power acknowledged in Imagination by all Philosophers, nothing would seem more strange, then that these Aiery Spirits should not have this command over their own Vehicles, to transform them as they please.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For there are some, and they of no small note, that attribute so wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to that Faculty armed with confidence and belief (to which Passion <hi>Fear</hi> may in some manner be referred, as being a strong belief of an imminent evil, and that it will surely take effect, as also vehement <hi>Desire,</hi> as being accompanied with no small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of perswasion that we may obtain the thing desired, else Desire would not be so very active) I say, they attribute so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force to Imagination, that they affirm that it will not onely alter a mans own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but act upon anothers, and that at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; that it will inflict diseases on the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:55765:213"/>
sound, and heal the sick; that it will cause Hail, Snows and Winds; that it will strike down an Horse or Camel, and cast their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into a ditch; that it will doe all the feats of Witchcraft, even to the making of Ghosts and Spirits appear, by transforming the adjacent Aire into the shape of a person that cannot onely be felt and seen, but heard to discourse, and that not onely by them whose Imagination created this aiery <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrum,</hi> but by other by-standers, whose Fancy contributed nothing to its existence. To such an extent as this have <hi>Avicenna, Algazel, Paracelsus, Pomponatius, Vaninus</hi> and others, exalted the power of humane Imagination: which if it were true, this transfiguration of the Vehicles of the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Souls and <hi>Genii</hi> were but a trifle in comparison thereof.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BUT I shall contain my belief within more moderate bounds, that which the most sober Authors assent to being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for our turn; and that is the power of <hi>Imagination</hi> on our own Bodies, or what is comprehended within our own, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb of the Mother. For that <hi>Imagination</hi> will bring real and sensible effects to pass is plain, in that some have raised diseases in their own Bodies by too strongly imagining of them; by fancying bitter or soure things, have brought those real sapours into their mouths; at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of some filthy Object, have faln a vomiting; at the imagining of a Potion, have faln<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a purging; and many such things of the like nature. Amongst which, that of prefixing to ones self what time in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55765:214"/>
we will wake, is no less admirable then my. Which alterations upon the Spirits for the production of such qualities, is every jot as hard as the ranging them into new figures or postures. But the hardest of all is, to make them so determinately active, as to change the shape of the Body, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out knobs like horns, as it hapned to <hi>Cyppus,</hi> of which <hi>Agrippa</hi> speaks in his <hi>Occult. Philosoph.</hi> Which I should not have repeated here, had I not been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of a later example of the like effect of Imagination, though upon more fancyful grounds. That <hi>feare</hi> has killed some, and turned others gray, is to be referred to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination also: the latter of which examples is a signe that the <hi>Plastick</hi> power of the Soule has some influence also upon the very haires: which will make it less marvellous that the Souls Vehicle may be turned into the live effigies of a Man, not a haire, that is necessary to the perfecting of his repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, being excluded, free Imagination succeeding or assisting the <hi>Plastick</hi> power in the other state.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But of all Examples, those of the <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi> by the Imagination of the Mother come the nearest to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For we may easily conceive, that as the Plastick power in the <hi>Foetus</hi> is directed
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55765:215"/>
or seduced by the force of the Mothers Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; so the Efformative virtue in Souls se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate and the <hi>Genii</hi> may be governed and directed or perverted by the force of their Imagination. And so much the more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by how much the union is more betwixt the Imagination of the Soule and her own Plastick faculty, then betwixt her and the Plastick power of another Soule; and the capacity of being changed, greater in the yielding aerial Vehicle, then in the grosser rudiments of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And yet the effects of the force of the Mothers Imagination in the signing of the <hi>Foetus</hi> is very wonderful, and almost beyond belief, to those that have not examined these things. But the more learned sort both of Physitians and Philosophers are agreed on the truth thereof, as <hi>Empedocles, Aristotle, Pliny, Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and all the modern Physitians, being born down into assent by daily experience. For these Signatures of less extravagance and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity are frequent enough, as the similitude of Cherries, Mulberries, the colour of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret-wine spilt on the woman with child, with many such like instances. And if we stand but to what <hi>Fienus</hi> has defined in this matter, who has, I think, behaved himself as cautiously and modestly as may be, there
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:55765:215"/>
will be enough granted to assure us of what we aime at. For he does acknowledge that the Imagination of the Mother may change the figure of the <hi>Foetus</hi> so as to make it beare a resemblance, though not absolutely perfect, of an Ape, Pig, or Dog, or any such like Animal. The like he affirms of colours, haires, and excrescencies of several sorts: that it may produce also what is very like or analogous to horns and hoofs, and that it may encrease the bigness and number of the parts of the Body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And though he does reject several of the examples he has produced out of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, yet those which he admits for true are Indications plain enough, what we may expect in the Vehicle of a <hi>departed Soule</hi> or <hi>Daemon.</hi> As that of the Hairy girle out of <hi>Marcus Damascenus;</hi> that other out of <hi>Guilielmus Paradinus,</hi> of a Child whose skin and nails resembled those of a Bear; and a third out of <hi>Balduinus Ronsaeus,</hi> of one born with many excrescencies coloured and figured like those in a Turky-cock; and a fourth out of <hi>Pareus,</hi> of one who was born with an head like a Frog; as lastly that out of <hi>Avicenna,</hi> of chickens with hawks heads. All which deviations of the <hi>Plastick</hi> power hapned from the force of Imagination in the Females, either in the time of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:55765:216"/>
or gestation of their young.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But he scruples of giving assent to others, which yet are assented to by very learned writers. As that of Black-moores being born of white Parents, and white Children of black, by the exposal of pictures representing an AEthiopian or European: which those two excellent Physitians, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> and <hi>Sennertus,</hi> both agree to. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects also that out of <hi>Cornelius Gemma,</hi> of a Child that was born with his Forehead wounded and running with blood, from the husbands threatning his wife, when she was big, with a drawn sword which he directed towards her Forehead. Which will not seem so incredible, if we consider what <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> records of his own knowledg, viz. That a Woman with child seeing a Butcher divide a Swines head with his Cleaver, brought forth her Child with its face cloven in the upper jaw, the palate, and upper lip to the very nose.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the most notorious instances of this sort are those of <hi>Helmont De injectis materialibus.</hi> The one of a Taylors wife at <hi>Mechlin,</hi> who standing at her doore, and seeing a souldiers hand cut off in a quarrel, presently fell into labour, being struck with horrour at the spectacle, and brought forth a child with one hand, the other arm bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:55765:216"/>
without one, of which wound the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant died by the great expense of blood. Another woman, the wife of one <hi>Marcus De Vogeler</hi> Merchant of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> in the year 1602. seeing a souldier begging who had lost his right arme in Ostend-siege, which he shewed to the people still bloody, fell presently into labour, and brought forth a Daughter with one arme struck off, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left but a bloody stump to employ the Chirurgions skill: this woman married af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to one <hi>Hoochcamer</hi> Merchant of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and was yet alive in the year 1638. as <hi>Helmont</hi> writes. He adds a third example, of another Merchants wife which he knew, who hearing that on a morning there were thirteen men to be beheaded (this hapned at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> his time) she had the curiosity to see the execution. She getting therefore a place in the Chamber of a certain widow-woman, a friend of hers that dwelt in the market-place, beheld this Tragick spectacle; upon which she suddainly fell into labour, and brought forth a perfectly-formed infant, onely the head was wanting, but the neck bloody as their bodies she beheld that had their heads cut off. And that which does still advance the wonder is, that the hand, arme, and head of these infants, were none of them
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:55765:217"/>
to be found. From whence <hi>Van-Helmont</hi> would infer a penetration of corporeal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions; but how groundlessly I will not dispute here.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If these Stories he recites be true, as I must confess I doe not well know how to deny them, he reporting them with so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and credible circumstances; they are notable examples of the power of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and such as doe not onely win belief to themselves, but also to others that <hi>Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> would reject, not of this nature onely we are upon, of wounding the body of the Infant, but also of more exorbitant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of parts, of which we shall bring an instance or two anon. In the mean time, while I more carefully contemplate this strange virtue and power of the Soule of the Mother, in which there is no such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of purification or exaltedness, that it should be able to act such miracles, as I may call them, rather then natural effects; I cannot but be more then usually inclinable to think that the <hi>Plastick</hi> faculty of the Soule of the Infant, or whatever accessions there may be from the Imagination of the Mother, is not the adaequate cause of the formation of the <hi>Foetus:</hi> a thing which <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> somewhere intimates by the by, as I have already noted, viz. That the <hi>Soule of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:55765:217"/>
the World,</hi> or <hi>the Spirit of Nature,</hi> assists in this performance. Which if it be true, we have discovered a Cause proportionable to so prodigious an Effect. For we may easily conceive that the deeply-impassionated fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Mother snatches away <hi>the Spirit of Nature</hi> into consent: which Spirit may rationally be acknowledged to have a hand in the efformation of all vital Beings in the World, and haply be the onely Agent in forming of all manner of Plants. In which kinde whether she exert her power in any other Elements then Earth and Water, I will conclude no further, then that there may be a possibility thereof in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Regions of <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>AEther.</hi> To the right understanding of which conjecture, some light will offer it self from what we have said concerning the Visibility and Consistency of the aerial <hi>Daemons</hi> in their occursions one with another.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But this is not the onely Argument that would move one to think that this <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> intermeddles with the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> For those Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are derived on the Infant from the Mothers fancy in the act of Conception, cannot well be understood without this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis. For what can be the Subject of that Signature? Not the <hi>Plastick</hi> part of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:55765:218"/>
the Soul of the Mother; for that it is not the Mothers Soul that efforms the <hi>Embryo,</hi> as <hi>Sennertus</hi> ingeniously conjectures from the manner of the efformation of Birds, which is in their Egges, distinct from the Hen, and they may as well be hatched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Hen at all, a thing ordinarily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in <hi>AEgypt;</hi> nor the Body of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo,</hi> for it has yet no Body; nor its Soul, for the Soul, if we believe <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is not yet present there. But the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> is present every where, which snatcht into consent by the force of the Imagination of the Mother, retains the Note, and will be sure to seal it on the Body of the Infant. For what rude inchoations the Soul of the World has begun in the Matter of the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> this Signature is comprehended in the whole design, and after compleated by the presence and operation of the particular Soul of the Infant, which cooperates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to the pattern of the Soul of the World, and insists in her footsteps; who having once begun any hint to an entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, she is alike able to pursue it in any place, she being every where like or rather the same to her self. For as our Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, yet, upon the various temper of the Spirits, exerts her self into various imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and conceptions; so the Soul of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55765:218"/>
the World, being the same perfectly every where, is engaged to exert her efformative power every where alike, where the Matter is exactly the same. Whence it had been no wonder, if those Chickens above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with Hawks heads had been hatched an hundred miles distant from the Hen, whose Imagination was disturbed in the act of Conception: because the Soul of the World had begun a rude draught, which it self would as necessarily pursue every where, as a <hi>Geometrician</hi> certainly knows how to draw a Circle that will fit three Points given.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Opinion therefore of <hi>Plotinus</hi> is neither irrational nor unintelligible, That the <hi>Soul of the World</hi> interposes and insinuates into all generations of things, while the Matter is fluid and yielding. Which would induce a man to believe, that she may not stand idle in the transfiguration of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles of the <hi>Daemons,</hi> but assist their fancies and desires, and so help to cloath them and attire them according to their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: or it may be sometimes against their wills, as the unwieldiness of the Mothers Fancy forces upon her a Monstrous birth.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. Three notable Examples of Signatures, rejected by <hi>Fienus:</hi> 2. And yet so farre allowed for possible, as will fit our design. 3. That <hi>Helmonts</hi> Cherry and <hi>Licetus</hi> his Crab-fish are shrewd arguments that the Soul of the World has to do with all Effor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of both Animals and Plants. 4. An Example of a most exact and lively Signature out of <hi>Kircher:</hi> 5. With his judgement thereupon. 6. Another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample out of him of a Child with gray hairs. 7. An application of what has been said hitherto, concerning the Signatures of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> to the transfiguration of the aiery Vehicles of <hi>separate Souls</hi> and <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> 8. Of their personal transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion visible to us.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THose other Examples of the Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Foetus</hi> from the Mothers Fancy, which <hi>Fienus</hi> rejecteth, the one of them is out of <hi>Wierus,</hi> of a man that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his wife when she was bigge with child, saying, she bore the Devil in her womb, and that he would kill him: whereupon, not long after, she brought forth a Child well shaped from the middle downwards, but
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:55765:219"/>
upwards spotted with black and red spots, with eyes in its forehead, a mouth like a <hi>Satyre,</hi> ears like a Dog, and bended horns on its head like a Goat. The other out of <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> of one who returning home in the disguise of a Devil, whose part he had acted on the Stage, and having to doe with his wife in that habit, saying he would beget a Devil on her, impregnated her with a Monster of a shape plainly diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical. The third and most remarkable is out of <hi>Peramatus,</hi> of a Monster born at S. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> in the year 1573<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the narration whereof was brought to the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> from very faithful hands. How there was a Child born there at that time, that besides the horrible deformity of its mouth, ears and nose, had two horns on the head, like those of young Goats, long hair on the body, a fleshy girdle about his middle, double, from whence hung a peece of flesh like a purse, and a bell of flesh in his left hand, like those the <hi>Indians</hi> use when they dance, white boots of flesh on his legges, doubled down: In brief, the whole shape was horrid and diabolical, and conceived to proceed from some fright the Mother had taken from the antick dances of the <hi>Indians,</hi> amongst whom the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self does not fail to appear sometimes.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:55765:220"/>
2. These Narrations <hi>Fienus</hi> rejecteth, not as false, but as not being done by any natural power, or if they be, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions are something more lively then the truth. But in the mean time he does freely admit, that by the meer power of Imagination there might be such excrescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as might represent those things that are there mentioned; though those diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical shapes could not have true horns, hoofs, tail, or any other part, specifically distinct from the nature of Man. But so farre as he acknowledges is enough for our turn.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>Fortunius Licetus</hi> is more liberal in his grants, allowing not onely that the Births of women may be very exqulsitely distorted in some of their parts into the likeness of those of Brutes, but that Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maerical imaginations in Dreams may also effect it, as well as Fancies or external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects when they are awake. Of the latter sort whereof he produces an Example that will more then match our purpose, of a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian</hi> matron, who by chance beholding a Crab in a Fishermans hand new caught, and of a more then ordinary largeness, when she was brought to bed, brought forth a Crab (as well as a Child) perfectly like those that are ordinarily caught in the Sea. This was
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55765:220"/>
told him by a person of credit, who both knew the Woman, and saw the Crab she brought forth. <hi>Helmonts</hi> Cherry he so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mentions, and how it was green, pale, yellow, and red, at the times of year other Cherries are, is something of this nature; that is to say, comes near to the perfect spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a <hi>Cherry,</hi> as this did of a <hi>Crab,</hi> the plantal life of a Cherry being in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the one, as the life of an Animal was perfectly in the other. Which confirms what we said before, that strength of our Desire and Imagination may snatch into consent the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> and make it act: which once having begun, leaves not off, if Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will but serve for to work upon; and being the same in all places, acts the same upon the same Matter, in the same circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. For the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of every Vegetable is the <hi>Spirit of Nature;</hi> in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof this Cherry flourisht and ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the seasons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where the party was that bore that live Signature. These two instances are very shrewd arguments that the <hi>Soul of the World</hi> has to doe with all Efformations of either <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Animals.</hi> For neither the Childs Soul nor the Mothers, in any likelihood, could frame that <hi>Crab,</hi> though the Mother might, by that strange power of Desire and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55765:221"/>
Imagination, excite the <hi>Spirit of the World</hi> that attempts upon any Matter that is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for generation, some way or other, to make something of it; and being determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the fancy of the Woman, might sign the humid materials in her Womb with the image of her Minde.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore if <hi>Fienus</hi> had considered from what potent causes <hi>Signatures</hi> may arise, he would not have been so scrupulous in believing that degree of exactness that some of them are reported to have: or if he had had the good hap to have met with so notable an example thereof, as <hi>Kircher</hi> professes himself to have met with. For he tells a story of a man that came to him for this very cause, to have his opinion what a certain strange Signature, which he had on his Arm from his birth, might portend; concerning which he had consulted both <hi>Astrologers</hi> and <hi>Cabbalists,</hi> who had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed great preferments, the one imputing it to the Influence of the Stars, the other to the favour of the sealing Order of Angels. But <hi>Kircher</hi> would not spend his judgement upon a meer verbal description thereof; though he had plainly enough told him, it was <hi>the Pope sitting on his Throne, with a Dragon under his feet, and an Angel putting a Crown on his head.</hi> Wherefore the man
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55765:221"/>
desirous to hear a further confirmation of these hopes (he had conceived from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conjectures of others) by the suffrage of so learned a man, was willing in private to put off his doublet, and shew his Arm to <hi>Kircher:</hi> who having viewed it with all possible care, does profess that the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature was so perfect, that it seemed rather the work of Art then of exorbitating Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; &amp; yet by certain observations he made, that he was well assured it was the work of Nature, and not of Art, though it was an artificial piece that Nature imitated, <hi>viz.</hi> the picture of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, who is sometimes drawn according as this Signature did lively represent, namely on a Throne, with a Dragon under his feet, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with one hand on his Seat, and bearing the other in that posture in which they give the Benediction, and an Angel remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Curtain, and reaching a Crown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his head.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Kircher</hi> therefore leaving the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions and fooleries of the spurious <hi>Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> and <hi>Astrologers,</hi> told him the truth, though nothing so pleasant as their lies and flatteries, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Signature was not impressed by any either influence of the Stars, or Seals of Angels, but that it was the effect of the Imagination of his Mother
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:55765:222"/>
that bore him, who in some more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fit of affection towards this Pope, whose picture she beheld in some Chappel or other place of her devotion, and having some occasion to touch her Arm, printed that image on the Arm of her Child, as it ordinarily happens in such cases. Which doubtless was the true solution of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The same Author writes, how he was invited by a friend to contemplate another strange miracle (as he thought that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him to behold it) that he might spend his judgement upon it. Which was nothing else but an exposed Infant of some fourteen days old, that was gray-hair'd, both head and eye-brows. Which his friend, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, look't upon as a grand Prodigy, till he was informed of the cause thereof. That the Mother that brought it forth, being married to an old man whose head was all white, the fear of being surprized in the act of Adultery by her snowy-headed hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, made her imprint that colour on the Child she bore. Which Story I could not omit to recite, it witnessing to what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act curiosity the power of Fancy will work, for the fashioning and modifying the Matter, not missing so much as the very colours of the hair, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:55765:222"/>
noted something to that purpose.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To conclude therefore at length, and leave this luxuriant Theme. Whether it be the Power of Imagination carrying cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> into consent, or the <hi>Soule</hi> of <hi>the Infant,</hi> or both; it is evident that the effects are notable, and sometimes very accurately answering the Idea of the Impregnate, derived upon the moist and ductil matter in the Womb: Which yet, not being any thing so yielding as the soft aire, nor the Soule of the Mother so much one with that of the Infant as the separate Soule is one with it self, nor so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly united to the Body of the Infant as the Soule separate with her own Vehicle, nor having any nearer or more mysterious commerce with the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> then she has when her <hi>Plastick</hi> part, by the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium</hi> of her Will and Imagination, is to organize her Vehicle into a certain shape and form, which is a kind of a momentaneous birth of the distinct Personality, of either a <hi>Soule separate,</hi> or any <hi>other Daemon;</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that we may be very secure, that there is such a power in the <hi>Genii</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Souls,</hi> that they can with ease and accuracy transfigure themselves into shapes and forms agreeable to their own temper and nature.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:55765:223"/>
8. All which I have meant hitherto in reference to their visible congresses one with another. But they are sometimes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to us also, under some Animal shape, which questionless is much more difficult to them then that other Visibility is. But this is also possible, though more unusual by far, as being more unnatural. For it is possible by Art to compress Aire so, as to reduce it to visible opacity, and has been done by some, and particularly by a friend of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> whom he mentions in his Letters as having made this Experiment; the Aire getting this opacity by squeezing the <hi>Globuli</hi> out of it. Which though the separate Souls and Spirits may doe by that directive faculty, Axiome 31. yet surely it would be very painful. For the first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lying bare, if the Aire be not drawn exceeding close, it will cause an ungratefull heat; and if it be, as unnatural a cold; and so small a moment will make the first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too much or too little, that it may, haply, be very hard, at least for these infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Spirits, to keep steddily in a due mean. And therefore, when they appear, it is not unlikely but that they soak their Vehicles in some vaporous or glutinous moisture or other, that they may become visible to us at a more easy rate.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AFter this Digression, of shewing the facility of the figuring of the Vehicles of the <hi>Genii</hi> into personal shape, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again where we left; which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Society of these <hi>Genii</hi> and <hi>Souls separate,</hi> and under what shape they converse one with another; which I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be <hi>Humane,</hi> especially in the better sort of Spirits. And as for the worst kind, I should think that they are likewise for the most part in Humane form, though disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with ugly circumstances; but that they figure themselves also in Bestial appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:55765:224"/>
it being so easy for them to transform their Vehicle into what shape they please, and to imitate the figures as dexterously as some <hi>men</hi> will the voices of brute beasts, whom we may hear sing like a Cuckow, crow like a Cock, bellow like a Cow and Calfe, bark like a Dog, grunt and squeak like a Pig, and indeed imitate the cry of almost any Bird or Beast whatsoever.

               <p n="2">2.

of the tempers of these <hi>Daemons,</hi> they may have a propension to imitate their shape rather then others, and appear ugly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner and measure of their internal turpitudes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it is likely also that those <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, those <hi>Igneous Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours Psellus</hi> makes mention of, (as the end and scope of the nefarious ceremonies those wicked wretches, he describes, often used) were coloured according to the more or less feculency of the Vehicle of the <hi>Daemon</hi> that did appear in this manner, viz. in no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal shape, but by exhibiting a light to the eyes of his abominable Spectatours and Adorers: which, I suppose, he stirred up within the limits of his own Vehicle; the power of his Will and Imagination, by Axiome 31, commanding the grosser par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Aire and terrestrial vapours, together with the <hi>Globuli,</hi> to give back every way, from one point to a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, not great, and therefore the more easy to be done. Whence the first Element lyes bare in some considerable measure, whose activity cannot but lick into it some particles of the Vehicle that borders next thereto, and thereby exhibit, not a pure star-like light (which would be, if the first Element thus unbared, and in the midst of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:55765:225"/>
pure aire, were it self unmixt with other Matter) but the feculency of those parts that it abrades and converts into fewel, and the foulness of the ambient Vehicle through which it shines, makes it look red and fiery like the Horizontal Sun seen through a thick throng of vapours. Which <hi>fiery splendour</hi> may either onely slide down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and so pass by with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Daemons</hi> Vehicle, which <hi>Psellus</hi> seems mainly to aime at; or else it may make some stay and discourse with them it approaches, according as I have heard some Narrations. The reason of which lucid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances being so intelligible out of the Principles of <hi>Cartesius</hi> his Philosophy, we need not conceit that they are nothing but the prestigious delusions of Fancy, and no real Objects, as <hi>Psellus</hi> would have them; it being no more uncompetible to a <hi>Daemon</hi> to raise such a light in his Vehicle, and a purer then I have described, then to a wicked man to light a candle at a tinderbox.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But what we have said concerning the purity and impurity of this light, remindes me of what is of more sutable consequence to discourse of here, which is the Splendour and Beauty of personal shape in the better sort of the <hi>Genii.</hi> Which assuredly is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or lesser, according to the degrees of
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:55765:225"/>
                  <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>moral Affections</hi> in them. For even in this Body, that is not so yielding to the powers of the Mind, a man may observe, that according as persons are better or worse inclined, the aire of their visage will alter much, and that vicious courses, defacing the inward pulcritude of the Soul, doe even change the outward countenance to an abhorred hue. Which must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore necessarily take place, in a far greater measure, in the other state; where our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form is wholy framed from the inward <hi>Imperium</hi> of our Minde: which by how much more pure it self is, it will exhibit the more irreprehensible pulcritude in the outward feature and fashion of the Body, both for proportion of parts, the spirit and aire of the Countenance, and the ornament of cloaths and attirings: there being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble connexion in the Soule of the Sense of these three things together, <hi>Vertue, Love,</hi> and <hi>Beauty;</hi> of all which she her self is the first Root, and especially in the separate state, even of outward Beauty it self: whence the converse of the most vertuous there must needs afford the highest pleasure and satisfaction; not onely in point of rational communication, but in reference to external and personal complacency also. For if Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice can be ever seen with outward
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:55765:226"/>
eyes, it must be in these aerial Vehicles, which yield so to the Will and Idea of good and pure affections, that the Soule in a manner becomes perfectly transparent through them, discovering her lovely beauty in all the efflorescencies thereof, to the ineffable enravishment of the beholder.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Not that I mean, that there is any necessity that their Vehicle should be as a Statue of fluid <hi>Crystal;</hi> but that those impresses of beauty and ornament will be so faithfully and lively represented, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dictates of her inward Sense and Imagination, that if we could see the Soule her self, we could know no more by her then she thus exhibits to our eye: which personal figuration in the extimate parts thereof, that represent the Body, Face and Vestments, may be attempered to so fine an opacity, that it may reflect the light in more perfect colours then it is from any earthly body, and yet the whole Vehicle be so devoid of weight, as it will necessarily keep its station in the Aire. Which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder at, while we consider the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Clouds there, less aerial by far then this consistency we speak of: to say nothing of aerial Apparitions as high as the clouds, and in the same colours and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures as are seen here below, and yet no
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55765:226"/>
reflexions of terrestrial Objects, as I have proved in my Third Book against Atheism.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The exact Beauty of the personal shapes and becoming habits of these aiery Beings, the briefest and safest account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that Philosophy can give, is to referre to the description of such things in Poets: and then, when we have perused what the height and elegancy of their fancy has penn'd down. to write under it, <hi>An obscure Subindication of the transcendent pulcritude of the AErial Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii,</hi> whether <hi>Nymphs</hi> or <hi>Heroes.</hi> For though there be neither Lust, nor difference of Sex amongst them (whence the kindest commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of minde will never be any thing else but an exercise of <hi>Intellectual love,</hi> whose Object is <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Beauty;)</hi> yet it is not improbable but that there are some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral strictures of discrimination of this Beauty into <hi>Masculine</hi> and <hi>Feminine:</hi> partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the temper of their Vehicles may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to this kinde of pulcritude rather then that; and partly because several of these <hi>aerial Spirits</hi> have sustained the difference of Sex in this life, some of them here ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Males, others Females: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their History being to be continued from their departure hence, they ought to retain some character, especially so general a one, of what they were here. And it is
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55765:227"/>
very harsh to conceit that <hi>AEneas</hi> should meet with <hi>Dido</hi> in the other World in any other form then that of a Woman: whence a necessity of some slighter distinction of habits, and manner of wearing their hair, will follow. Which dress, as that of the <hi>Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> mode, is easily fitted to them by the power of their Will and Imagination: as appears from that Story out of <hi>Peramatus,</hi> of the <hi>Indian</hi> Monster that was born with fleshy boots, girdle, purse, and other things that are no parts of a man, but his cloathing or utensils; and this meerly by the Fancy of his Mother, disturb'd and frighted, either in sleep or awake, with some such ugly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as that <hi>Monster</hi> resembled.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE have now accurately enough defined in what form or garb the aerial <hi>Genii</hi> converse with one another. It remains we consider how they <hi>mutually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain</hi> one another in passing away the time. Which is obvious enough to conceive, to those that are not led aside into that blind Labyrinth which the generality of men are kept in, of suspecting <hi>that no representation of the state of these Beings is true, that is not so confounded and unintelligible that a man cannot think it sense, unless he wink with the inward eyes of his Minde, and command si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to all his Rational Faculties.</hi> But if he will but bethink himself, that the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate instrument of the Soul in this life is the Spirits, which are very congenerous to the body of Angels; and that all our passions and conceptions are either suggested from them, or imprest upon them; he cannot much doubt but that all his Faculties of Reason, Imagination and Affection, for the general, will be in him in the other state as they were here in this: namely, that he will be capable of Love, of Joy, of Grief, of Anger; that he will be able to imagine, to discourse, to remember, and the rest of
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:55765:228"/>
such operations as were not proper to the Fabrick of this earthly Body, which is the Officine of Death and Generation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it will follow, that the Souls of men deceaed, and the rest of the aerial <hi>Daemons,</hi> may administer much content to one another in mutual Conferences concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature of things, whether <hi>Moral, Natural,</hi> or <hi>Metaphysical.</hi> For to think that the quitting the earthly Body entitles us to an Omnisciency, is a Fable never enough to be laught at. And <hi>Socrates,</hi> somewhere in <hi>Plato,</hi> presages, that he shall continue his old Trade when he comes into the other World; convincing and confounding the idle and vain-glorious <hi>Sophists</hi> whereever he went. And by the same reason <hi>Platonists, Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians, Stoicks, Epicureans,</hi> and whatever other sects and humors are on the Earth, may in likelihood be met with there, so far as that estate will permit; though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt of all things we doubt of here. For these aerial Spirits know that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>are,</hi> and that the Souls of men <hi>subsist</hi> and <hi>act</hi> after death, unless such as are too deeply tinctured with <hi>Avenroism.</hi> But they may doubt whether they will hold out for ever, or whether they will perish at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of the World, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> would have them. It may be also a great
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:55765:228"/>
controversie amongst them, whether <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>'s or <hi>Ptolemies</hi> Hypothesis be true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Motion of the Earth; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Stars be so bigge as some define them. For these lower <hi>Daemons</hi> have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter means then we to assure themselves of the truth or falshood of these Opinions. Besides the discourse of News, of the affairs as well of the <hi>Earth</hi> as <hi>Aire.</hi> For the <hi>aerial Inhabitants</hi> cannot be less active then the <hi>terrestrial,</hi> nor less busie, either in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of some solemn exercises, or in carrying on designs party against party; and that either more Private or more Publick; the events of which will fill the <hi>aerial Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> with a quick spreading fame of their Actions. To say nothing of prudential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures concerning future successes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and innumerable other entertains of Conference, which would be too long to reckon up, but bear a very near analogy to such as men pass away their time in here.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But of all Pleasures, there are none that are comparable to those that proceed from their joynt exercise of Religion and Devotion. For their Bodies surpassing ours so much in tenuity and purity, they must needs be a fitter soil for the Divinest thoughts to spring up in, and the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and most enravishing affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:55765:229"/>
their Maker. Which being height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by sacred Hymns and Songs, sung with voices perfectly imitating the sweet passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate relishes of the sense of their devout minds, must even melt their Souls into Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, and make them swim with joy in God. But these kinds of exercises being so highly rapturous and ecstatical, transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them beyond the ordinary limits of their Nature, cannot in Reason be thought to be exceeding frequent; but as a solemn Repast, after which they shall enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves better for a good space of time after.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore there be other entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which though they be of an inferiour nature to these, yet they farre exceed the greatest pleasure and contentments of this present state. For the <hi>Animal life</hi> being as essential to the Soul as union with a Body, which she is never free from; it will follow that there be some fitting gratifications of it in the other World. And none greater can be imagined then <hi>Sociableness</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal complacency,</hi> not onely in rational dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, which is so agreeable to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical Ingeny, but innocent Pastimes, in which the Musical and Amorous propension may be also recreated. For these three dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are the flowr of all the rest, as <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:55765:229"/>
has somewhere noted: And his rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption into the other World is set out by <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Oracle, from some such like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as these.

And he holds on, naming the happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Soul of <hi>Plotinus</hi> was to associate with, viz. <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and the purer
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:55765:230"/>
Spirits of the Golden Age, and all such as made up the Chorus of immortal <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship.</hi> These sing, and play, and dance together, reaping the lawful pleasures of the very <hi>Animal life,</hi> in a far higher degree then we are capable of in this World. For every thing here does as it were tast of the cask, and has some coursness and foulness with it. The sweet motions of the Spirits in the passion of <hi>Love</hi> can very hardly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded off from too near bordering upon the shameful sense of <hi>Lust;</hi> the Fabrick of the terrestrial Body almost necessitating them to that deviation. The tenderer <hi>Ear</hi> cannot but feel the rude thumpings of the wood, and gratings of the rosin, the hoars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or some harshness and untunableness or other, in the best consorts of Musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Voices. The judicious <hi>Eye</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but espy some considerable defect in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the proportion, colour, or the aire of the face, in the most fam'd and most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red beauties of either Sex: to say nothing of the inconcinnity of their deportment and habits. But in that other state, where the Fancy consults with that first Exemplar of Beauty, <hi>Intellectual Love</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and the Body is wholly obedient to the imagination of the Minde, and will to every Punctilio yield to the impresses of that inward pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern;
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:55765:230"/>
nothing there can be found amiss, every touch and stroak of motion and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being conveyed from so judicious a power through so delicate and depurate a Medium. Wherefore they cannot but enravish one anothers Souls, while they are mutual Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of the perfect pulcritude of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers persons, and comely carriage, of their graceful dancing, their melodious singing and playing, with accents so sweet and soft, as if we should imagine the Aire here of it self to compose Lessons, and send forth Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical sounds without the help of any terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Instrument. These, and such like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes as these, are part of the happiness of the best sort of the aerial <hi>Genii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Which the more certain knowledge of what is done amongst the inferiour <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> will further assure us of. For it is very probable that their Conventicles, into which Witches and Wizzards are admitted, are but a depraved adumbration of the friendly meetings of the superiour <hi>Genii.</hi> And what Musick, Dancing and Feasting there is in these, the free confession of those Wretches, or fortuitous detection of others, has made manifest to the World, <hi>viz.</hi> How Humane and Angelical <hi>Beauty</hi> is transformed there into Bestial <hi>Deformity,</hi> the chief in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ordinarily appearing in the Figures of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:55765:231"/>
                  <hi>Satyres, Apes, Goats,</hi> or such like <hi>ugly</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; how the comely deportments of Body, into ridiculous gesticulations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse postures and antick dances; and how innocuous love and pure friendship dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates into the most brutish lust and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable obscenity that can be imagined: of which I will adde nothing more, having spoke enough of this matter in the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix to my <hi>Antidote</hi> Chap. 12.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What is most material for the present, is to consider, whether as the Musick and Dancing of these lower and more deeply-lapsed <hi>Daemons,</hi> are a distorted imitation of what the higher and more pure <hi>Daemons</hi> doe in their Regions; so their Feasting may not be a perverted resemblance of the others Banquetings also: that is to say, it is worth our enquiring into, whether they doe not eat and drink as well as these. For the rich amongst us must have their repast as well as the poor, and Princes feed as well as Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, though there be a great difference in their diet. And I must confess, there is no small difficulty in both, whence the good or bad <hi>Genii</hi> may have their food; though it be easy enough to conceive that they may feed and refresh their Vehicles. For suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing they doe vitally actuate some particular portion of the Aire that they drive along
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:55765:231"/>
with them, which is of a certain extent, it is most natural to conceive, that partly by local motion, and partly by the activity of their thoughts, they set some particles of their Vehicles into a more then usual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being thus moved, scatter and perspire; and that so the Vehicle lessens in some measure, and therefore admits of a recruite: which must be either by formal repast, or by drawing in the crude Aire one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which haply may be enough; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so like it self alwaies, the pleasure will be more flat. Wherefore it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but that both may have their times of Refection, for pleasure at least, if not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; which will be the greater advantage for the <hi>Good,</hi> and the more exquisite misery for the <hi>Bad,</hi> they being punishable in this regard also.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But, as I said, the greatest difficulty is to give a rationall account whence the bad <hi>Genii</hi> have their food, in their execrable feasts, so formally made up into dishes. That the materials of it is a vaporous aire, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as well from the faintness and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of them that have been entertained at those feasts, as from their forbidding the use of <hi>Salt</hi> at them, it having a virtue of dissolving of all aqueous substances, as well as hindering their congelation. But how the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55765:232"/>
Aire is moulded up into that form and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency, it is very hard to conceive: whether it be done by the meer power of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their own Vehicles, first dabled in some humidities that are the fittest for their design, which they change into these forms of Viands, and then withdraw, when they have given them such a figure, colour, and consistency, with some small touch of such a sapour or tincture: or whether it be the priviledge of these <hi>AErial Creatures,</hi> by a sharp Desire and keen Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to pierce the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> so as to awaken her activity, and engage her to the compleating in a moment, as it were, the full design of their own wishes, but in such matter as the Element they are in is capable of, which is this crude and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous Aire; whence their food must be very dilute and flashie, and rather a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery then any solid satisfaction and pleasure.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But those Superiour <hi>Daemons,</hi> which inhabit that part of the Aire that no storm nor tempest can reach, need be put to no such shifts, though they may be as able in them as the other. For in the tranquillity of those upper Regions, that <hi>Promus-Condus</hi> of the <hi>Universe, the Spirit of Nature,</hi> may silently send forth whole Gardens and Orchards of most delectable fruits and flowers, of an
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55765:232"/>
aequilibrious ponderosity to the parts of the Aire they grow in, to whose shape and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours the transparency of these Plants may adde a particular lustre, as we see it is in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones. And the <hi>Chymists</hi> are never quiet till the heat of their fancy have calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vitrified the Earth into a crystal-line pellucidity, conceiting that it will be then a very fine thing indeed, and all that then growes out of it: which desirable Spectacle they may haply enjoy in a more perfect manner, whenever they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into those higher Regions of the Aire. For the very Soile then under them shall be transparent, in which they may trace the very Roots of the Trees of this <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Paradise</hi> with their eyes, and if it may not offend them, see this opake Earth through it, bounding their sight with such a white splendour as is discovered in the full Moon, with that difference of bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that will arise from the distinction of Land and Water; and if they will recreate their palats, may tast of such Fruits, as whose natural juice will vie with their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Extractions and Quintessences. For such certainly will they there find the blood of the Grape, the rubie-coloured Cherries, and Nectarines. And if for the compleating of the pleasantness of these habitations, that
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:55765:233"/>
they may look less like a silent and dead soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they meet with Birds &amp; Beasts of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shapes and colours, the single accents of whose voices are very grateful to the ear, and the varying of their notes perfect mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical harmony; they would doe very kindly to bring us word back of the certainty of these things, and make this more then a <hi>Philosophical Conjecture.</hi> But that there may be <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Feasting</hi> in those higher aerial Regions, is less doubted by the Platonists; which makes <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> call the Soul, when she has left the Body, <gap reason="foreign">

Elysiums,</hi> depainting them out in all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of their Ornaments: but there is no prudence of being lavish of ones pen in a matter so lubricous and Conjectural. Of the bare existence whereof we have no other ground, then that otherwise the greatest part of the Universe by infinite measure, and the most noble, would lye as it were uncultivate, like a desart of Sand, wherein a man can spie neither Plant nor living Creature. Which though it may seem as strange, as if Nature should have restrained all the Varieties she would put forth to one contemptible Mole-hil, and have made all the rest of the Earth one Homogeneal surface of dry clay or stone, on which not one sprig of Grass, much less any Flower or Tree, should grow, nor Bird nor Beast be found once to set their foot thereon: yet the <hi>Spirits</hi> of us <hi>Mortals</hi> being too pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to be able to grapple with such vast Objects, we must resolve to rest either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or sceptical, in this matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And therefore let us consider what will more easily fall under our comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and that is the <hi>Polity</hi> of the <hi>aiery Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> Concerning which, that in general there is such a thing among them, is the most assuredly true in it self, and of the most use to us to be perswaded of.

their particular <hi>orders</hi> and <hi>customes</hi> is a more needless Curiosity.

                  </gap>) but it is also the easy and obvious suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ordinary Reason, that it must needs be so, and especially amongst the AErial <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii</hi> in these lower Regions, they being a mixt rabble of good and bad, wise and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, in such a sense as we may say the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth are so, and therefore they must naturally fall under a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and submit to Lawes, as well &amp; for the same reasons as Men doe. For otherwise they cannot tolerably subsist, nor enjoy what rights may some way or other apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to them. For the Souls of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased and the <hi>Daemons,</hi> being endued with corporeal Sense, by Axiome 30. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore capable of <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently of both Injury and Punishment, it is manifest, that having the use of Reason, they cannot fail to mould themselves into some Political form or other; and so to be
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55765:235"/>
divided into Nations and Provinces, and to have their Officers of State, from the King on his Throne to the very lowest and most abhorred Executioners of Justice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Which invisible Government is not circumscribed within the compass of the aiery Regions, but takes hold also on the Inhabitants of the Earth, as the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men does on several sorts of brute Beasts, and the AEthereal Powers also have a Right and Exercise of Rule over the AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. Whence nothing can be committed in the World against the more indispensable Laws thereof, but a most severe and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table punishment will follow: every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, City, Family and Person, being in some manner the <hi>Peculium,</hi> and therefore in the tutelage, of some invisible Power or other, as I have above intimated.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And such Transgressions as are against those Laws without whose observance the Creation could not subsist, we may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red are punished with Torture intolerable, and infinitely above any Pleasure imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable the evil <hi>Genii</hi> can take in doing of those of their own Order, or us Mortals, any mischief. Whence it is manifest that we are as secure from their gross outrages (such as the firing of our houses, the stealing away our jewels, or more necessary Utensils, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:55765:235"/>
our selves or children, destroying our cattel, corn, and other things of the like sort,) as if they were not <hi>in rerum natura.</hi> Unless they have some special permission to act, or we our selves enable them by our rash and indiscreet tampering with them, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the malice of some person that is in league with them. For their greatest li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of doing mischief is upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; which yet is very much limited, in that all these Actions must pass the consent of a visible person, not hard to be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in these unlawful practices, and easy to be punished by the Law of Men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And the AErial <hi>Genii</hi> can with as much ease inflict punishment on one another, as we Mortals can apprehend, imprison, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish such as transgress against our Laws. For though these <hi>Daemons</hi> be invisible to us, yet they are not so to their own Tribe: nor can the activity and subtilty of the Bad over-master the Good Commonwealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there, that uphold the Laws better then they are amongst us. Nor may the various Transfiguration of their shapes conceal their persons, no more then the disguises that are used by fraudulent men. For they are as able to discern what is fictitious from what is true and natural amongst themselves, as we are amongst our selves. And every AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:55765:236"/>
Spirit being part of some <hi>Political sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>division,</hi> upon any outrage committed, it will be an easy matter to hunt out the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor. No <hi>Daemon</hi> being able so to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure himself, but upon command he will be forced to appear in his natural and usual form, not daring to deny upon examination to what particular <hi>Subdivision</hi> he belongs. Whence the easy discovery of their miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and certainty of insupportable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will secure the World from all the disorder that some scrupulous wits suspect would arise from this kinde of Creatures, if they were in Being.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To which we may adde also, That what we have, is useless to them, and that it is very hard to conceive that there are many Rational Beings so degenerate as to take pleasure in ill, when it is no good to themselves. That <hi>Socrates</hi> his Aphorism, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, may be in no small measure true in the other World, as well as in this. That all that these evil Spirits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, may be onely our lapse into as great a degree of Apostasy from God as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to be full partakers with them of their false Liberty; as debauched persons in this life love to make Proselytes, and to have respect from their Nurslings in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. And several other Considerations
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55765:236"/>
there are that serve for the taking away this Panick fear of the incursations and mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of these aerial Inhabitants, and might further silence the suspicious Atheist; which I willingly omit, having said more then enough of this Subject already. See <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If any be so curious, as to demand what kinde of Punishment this <hi>People of the Aire</hi> inflict upon their Malefactors, I had rather referre them to the Fancies of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Agrippa, De Occult. Philosoph. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 41. then be laught at my self for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to descend to such particularities. Amongst other things he names their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carceration, or confinement to most vile and squalid Habitations. His own words are very significant: <hi>Accedunt etiam vilissimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ac teterrimorum locorum habitacula, ubi AEtnaei ignes, aquarum ingluvies, fulgurum &amp; tonitruorum concussus, terrarum voragines, ubi Regio lucis inops, nec radiorum Solis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pax, ignaráque splendoris syderum, perpetuis tenebris &amp; noctis specie caligat.</hi> Whence he would make us believe, that the subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous caverns of the Earth are made use of for Dungeons for the wicked <hi>Daemons</hi> to be punished in: as if the several <hi>Volcano's,</hi> such as <hi>AEtna, Vesuvius, Hecla,</hi> and many others, especially in <hi>America,</hi> were so many Prisons
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:55765:237"/>
or houses of Correction for the unruly <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii.</hi> That there is a tedious restraint upon them upon villanies committed, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, is without all question; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with corporeal Sense, and that more quick and passive then ours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more subject to the highest degrees of torment. So that not onely by incarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating them, &amp; keeping them in by a watch, in the caverns of burning Mountains, where the heat of those infernal Chambers and the steam of Brimstone cannot but excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate them exceedingly, but also by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them into sundry other Hollows of the ground, noysome by several fumes and vapours, they may torture them in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fashions and degrees, fully proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the greatest crime that is in their power to commit, and farre above what the cruellest Tyranny has inflicted here, either upon the guilty or innocent. But how these Confinements and Torments are inflicted on them, and by what Degrees and Relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is a thing neither easy to determine, nor needful to understand. Wherefore we will surcease from pursuing any further so unprofitable a Subject, and come to the Third general Head we mentioned, which is, <hi>What the Moral condition of the Soul is when she has left this Body.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. Three things to be considered before we come to the <hi>moral</hi> condition of the Soul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death: namely, her Memory of transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this life. 2. The peculiar feature and individual Character of her <hi>AErial Vehicle.</hi> 3. The Retainment of the same Name. 4. How her ill deportment here lays the train of her Misery hereafter. 5. The unspeakable torments of Conscience worse then Death, and not to be avoided by dying. 6. Of the hideous tortures of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sense on them, whose searedness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science may seem to make them uncapable of her Lashes. 7. Of the state of the Souls of the more innocent and conscientious <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</hi> 8. Of the natural accruments of <hi>After-happiness</hi> to the morally good in this life. 9. How the Soul enjoys her actings or sufferings in <hi>this Life</hi> for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Cause, when she has passed to the <hi>other.</hi> 10. That the reason is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably the same in things of less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. 11. What mischief men may create to themselves in the other world by their Zealous mistakes in this. 12. That though there were no Memory after Death, yet the manner of our Life here may sow
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55765:238"/>
the seeds of the Souls future happiness or misery.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. FOR the better solution of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, there is another first in nature to be decided; namely, <hi>Whether the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members any thing of this Life after Death.</hi> For <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> seem to deny it; but I doe not remember any reasons in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that will make good their Opinion. But that the contrary is true, appears from what we have already proved <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. viz. <hi>That the immediate seat of Memory is the Soul her self, and that all Representations with their circumstances are reserved in her, not in the Spirits</hi> (a thing which <hi>Vaninus</hi> himself cannot deny) <hi>nor in any part of the Body.</hi> And that the Spirits are onely a necessary Instrument whereby the Soul works; which while they are too cool and gross and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, Oblivion creeps upon her, in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that the Spirits are thus distempered; but the disease being chased away, and the temper of the Spirits rectified, the Soul forthwith recovers the memory of what things she could not well command before, as being now in a better state of Activity. Whence, by the 33. Axiome, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that her Memory will be rather more perfect after Death, and Conscience more
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55765:238"/>
nimble to excuse or accuse her according to her Deeds here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not altogether beside the purpose to take notice also, That the natural and usual Figure of the Souls <hi>AErial Vehicle</hi> bears a resemblance with the feature of the party in this life; it being most obvious for the <hi>Plastick part</hi> (at the command of the Will to put forth into personal shape) to fall as near to that in this life as the new state will permit. With which act the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nature</hi> haply does concurre, as in the figuration of the <hi>Foetus;</hi> but with such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits as becomes the AErial Congruity of life, of which we have spoke already: as also how the proper Idea or Figure of every Soul (though it may deflect something by the power of the Parents Imagination in the act of Conception, or Gestation, yet) may return more near to its peculiar semblance afterwards, and so be an unconcealable Note of <hi>Individuality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We will adde to all this, the Retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same Name which the deceased had here, unless there be some special reason to change it: so that their persons will be as punctually distinguisht and circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as any of ours in this life. All which things, as they are most probable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they will thus naturally fall out,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:55765:239"/>
so they are very convenient for administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice, and keeping of Order in the other State.</p>
               <p n="4">4. These things therefore premised, it will not be hard to conceive how the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Soul after this life depends on her <hi>Moral</hi> deportment here. For <hi>Memory</hi> cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing not, <hi>Conscience</hi> may very likely awake more furiously then ever; the Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a more clear Judge of evil Actions past, then she could be in the Flesh, being now stript of all those circumstances and concurrences of things that kept her off from the opportunity of calling her self to account, or of perceiving the ugliness of her own ways. Besides, there being that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication betwixt the <hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Aire,</hi> that at least the fame of things will arrive to their cognoscence that have left this life; the after ill success of their wicked enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises and unreasonable transactions may arm their tormenting Conscience with new whips and stings, when they shall either hear, or see with their eyes, what they have unjustly built up, to run with shame to ruine, and behold all their designs come to nought, and their fame blasted upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is the state of such Souls as are capable of a sense of dislike of their past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions:
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:55765:239"/>
and a man would think they need no other punishment then this, if he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mighty power of the Minde over her own Vehicle, and how vulnerable it is from her self. These Passions therefore of the Soule that follow an ill Conscience, must needs bring her aiery body into intolerable distempers, worse then Death it self. Nor yet can she die if she would, neither by fire, nor sword, nor any means imaginable; no not if she should fling her self into the flames of smoaking <hi>AEtna.</hi> For suppose she could keep her self so long there, as to indure that hideous pain of destroying the <hi>vital Congruity</hi> of her Vehicle by that sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fire; she would be no sooner released, but she would catch life again in the Aire, and all the former troubles and vexations would return, besides the overplus of these pangs of Death. For Memory would return, and an ill Conscience would return, and all those busie Furies, those disordered Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which follow it. And thus it would be, though the Soule should kill her self a thousand and a thousand times; she could but pain and punish her self, not destroy her self.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But if we could suppose some mens Consciences seared in the next state as well as this, (for certainly there are that make
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:55765:240"/>
it their business to obliterate all sense of difference of Good and Evil out of their minds; &amp; hold it to be an high strain of wit (though it be nothing else but a piece of bestial stupidity) to think there is no such thing as <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and that it is a principall part of perfection, to be so dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate as to act according to this Principle without any remorse at all;) these men may seem to have an excellent priviledge in the other world, they being thus armour-proof against all the fiery darts of that domestick Devil: As if the greatest security in the other life were, to have been compleatly wicked in this. But it is not out of the reach of meer Reason and Philosophy to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that such bold and impudent wretches as have lost all <hi>inward</hi> sense of Good and Evil, may there against their wills feel a lash in the <hi>outward.</hi> For the divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> is excluded out of no part of the Universe; and Goodness and Justice, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn here, will be acquainted with them in that other state, whether they will or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I speak of such course Spirits that can swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down Murder, Perjury, Extortion, Adultery, Buggery, and the like gross crimes, without the least disgust, and think they have a right to satisfy their own Lust, though it be by never so great injury against

their Neighbour. If these men should carry it with impunity, there were really no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and themselves were the truest Prophets and faithfullest Instructers of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, divulging the choicest <hi>Arcanum</hi> they have to impart to them, namely <hi>That there is no God.</hi> But the case stands quite otherwise. For whether it be by the importunity of them they injure in this life, who may meet with them afterward, as <hi>Cardan</hi> by way of objection suggests in his Treatise of this Subject; or whether by a general deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by all of the other world that are able to protect, (such Monsters as I describe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haply far less in proportion to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the other state, then these here are to this;) they will be necessarily exposed to those grim and remorsless <hi>Officers of Justice,</hi> who are as devoid of all sense of what is good as those that they shall punish. So that their penalty shall be inflicted from such as are of the same principles with themselves, who watch for such booties as these, and when they can catch them, dress them and adorn them according to the multifarious petulancy of their own unaccountable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and taking a speciall pride and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the making and seeing Creatures miserable, fall upon their prey with all eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and alacrity, as the hungry Lions on a
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:55765:241"/>
condemned malefactour, but with more fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity and insultation by far. For having more wit, and, if it be possible, less good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness then the Soule they thus assault, they satiate their lascivient cruelty with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of abuses and torments they can imagine, giving her onely so much respite as will serve to receive their new inventions with a fresher smart and more distinct pain. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any Reason or Rhetorick prevail with them, no Expostulation, Petition or Submission. For to what purpose can it be, to expostulate about injury and violence with them whose deepest reach of wit is to understand this one main Principle, <hi>That every ones Lust, when he can act with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is the most sacred and soveraign Law?</hi> Or what can either Petitions or Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe with those who hold it the <hi>most contemptible piece of fondness and filliness that is, to be intreated to recede from their own Interest?</hi> And they acknowledging no such thing as <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> make it their onely interest to please themselves in what is agreeable to their own desires: and their main pleasure is, to excruciate and torture, in the most exquisite wayes they can, as many as Opportunity delivers up to their power. And thus we see how, in the other life, the proud conceited <hi>Atheist</hi> may at last feel the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55765:241"/>
sad inconvenience of his own Practises and Principles. For even those that pleased themselves in helping him forward, while he was in this life, to that high pitch of wickedness, may haply take as much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to see him punisht by those <hi>grim Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners,</hi> in the other. Like that sportful cruelty (which some would appropriate to <hi>Nero's</hi> person) of causing the <hi>Vestal</hi> virgins to be ravisht, and then putting them to death for being so.</p>

Let us cast our eyes therefore upon a more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Object; and that is The state of the Soul that has, according to the best opportunity she had of knowledge, liv'd vertuously and conscientiously, in what part or Age of the world soever. For though this <hi>Moral Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> amongst the <hi>Pagans</hi> will not amount to what our Religion calls <hi>Salvation;</hi> yet it cannot but be advantageous to them in the other state, according to the several degrees thereof; they being more or less Happy or Miserable, as they have been more or less Vertuous in this life. For we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine why God shoud be more harsh to them in the other world then in this, nothing having happened to them to alienate his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection but Death; which was not in their
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55765:242"/>
power to avoid, and looks more like a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment then a fault: though it be neither to those that are well-meaning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious, and not professed contemners of the wholsome suggestions of the light of Nature, but are lovers of Humanity and Vertue. For to these it is onely an entrance into another life,

Which Truth I could not conceal, it being a great prejudice to <hi>Divine Providence</hi> to think otherwise. For to those that are free, her wayes will seem as unintelligible in overloading the simple with punishment, as in not rewarding the more perfectly righteous and illuminate. For from a fault in either they will be tempted to a misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the whole, and hold no Providence at all.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Let there therefore be peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Morality, every where, to those that pass into the other State. For unless God make a stop on purpose, it will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow, that Memory after Death suggesting nothing but what the Conscience allows of, much Tranquillity of minde must result from thence, and a certain health and beauty of the AErial Vehicle; also better
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55765:242"/>
Company and Converse, and more pleasant Tracts and Regions to inhabit. For what <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaks of the <hi>extreme</hi> degrees, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nead.</hi> 4. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 45. is also true of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate,</hi> else Divine Justice would be very maime. <hi>For a man,</hi> saith he, <hi>having once appropriated to himself a pravity of temper, and united with it, is known well what he is; and according to his nature is thrust forward to what he propends to, both here, and departed hence, and so shall be pulled by the drawings of Nature into a sutable place. But the Good man his Receptions and Communications shall be of another sort, by the drawing as it were of certain hidden strings transposed and pulled by Natures own fingers. So admirable is the power and order of the Universe, all things being carried on in a silent way of Justice, which none can avoid, and which the wicked man has no perception nor understanding of, but is drawn, knowing nothing whither in the Universe he ought to be carried. But the good man both knows and goes whither he ought, and discerns before he departs hence where he must inhabit, and is full of hopes that it shall be with the Gods.</hi> This large Paragraph of <hi>Plotinus</hi> is not without some small Truth in it, if rightly limited and understood; but seems not to reach at all the Circumstances and accruments of happiness to the Soul in
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:55765:243"/>
the other State, which will naturally follow her from her transactions in this life.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For certainly, according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of Benignity of Spirit, and the desire of doing good to mankinde in this life, and the more ample opportunities of doing it, the felicity of the other World is redoubled upon them; there being so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain communication and entercourse betwixt both. And therefore they that <hi>act</hi> or <hi>suffer</hi> deeply in such Causes as God will maintain in the World, and are just and holy at the bottome, (and there are some Principles that are indispensably such, which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has countenanced both by Miracles, the suffrages of the Wisest men in all Ages, and the common voice of Nature) those that have been the most Heroical Abetters and Promoters of these things in this life, will naturally receive the greater content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Minde after it, being conscious to themselves how seriously they have assisted what God will never desert, and that Truth is mighty, and must at last prevail; which they are better assured of out of the Body, then when they were in it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Nor is this kinde of access of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to be confined onely to our furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of what is of the highest and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable consideration here, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:55765:243"/>
touches all transactions that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a vertuous and good principle, whereof there are several degrees: amongst which those may not be esteemed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest that refer to a National good. And therefore those that, out of a natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity of Spirit and successful fortitude in Warre, have delivered their Country from bondage, or have been so wise and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in Politicks, as to have contrived wholsome Laws for the greater happiness and comfort of the People, while such a Nation prospers and is in being, it cannot but be an accrument of happiness to these so considerable Benefactors, unless we should imagine them less generous and good in the other World, where they have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of being Better. And what I have said in this more notable instance, is in a degree true in things of smaller concernment, which would be infinite to rehearse. But whole Nations, with their Laws and Orders of Men, and Families may fail, and therefore these accessions be cut off; but he that laies out his pains in this life, for the carrying on such designs as will take place so long as the World endures, and must have a compleat Triumph at last, such a one laies a train for an everlasting advantage in the other World, which, in despite of all the tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:55765:244"/>
and turnings of unsetled fortune, will be sure to take effect.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But this matter requires Judgement as well as Heat and Forwardness. For prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Ignorance, though accompanied with some measure of Sincerity and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning, may set a-foot such things in the World, or set upon record such either false, or impertinent and unseasonable, Principles, as being made ill use of, may very much prejudice the Cause one desires to promote; which will be a sad spectacle for them in the other State. For though their simplicity may be pardonable, yet they will not fail to finde the ill effect of their mistake upon themselves. As he that kills a friend in stead of an enemy, though he may satisfy his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that rightly pleads his innocency, yet he cannot avoid the sense of shame and sorrow that naturally follows so mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous an error.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Such accruencies as these there may be to our enjoyments in the other World, from the durable traces of our transactions in this, if we have any <hi>Memory</hi> of things after Death, as I have already demonstrated that we have. But if we had not, but <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi>'s Opinion were true, yet <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> will not prove <hi>onely</hi> useful for this present state.

our living here, we shall hereafter, by a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den concatenation of Causes, be drawn to a condition answerable to the purity or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Souls in this life: that silent <hi>Nemesis</hi> that passes through the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of the Universe, ever fatally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving us into such a state as we our selves have fitted our selves for by our accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary actions.

               <p n="1">1. WE had now quite finished our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, did I not think it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to answer a double expectation of the Reader. The one is touching the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> the other the producing of Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that may be made against our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:55765:245"/>
Assention of the Souls Immortality. For as for the former, I can easily imagine he may well desire a more punctual account of that Principle I have had so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to, then I have hitherto given, and will think it fit that I should somewhere more fully explain what I mean by the terms, and shew him my strongest grounds why I conceive there is any such Being in the World. To hold him therefore no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in suspence, I shall doe both in this place. <hi>The Spirit of Nature</hi> therefore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that notion I have of it, is, <hi>A sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance incorporeal, but without Sense and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversion, pervading the whole Matter of the Universe, and exercising a plastical power therein according to the sundry predispositions and occasions in the parts it works upon, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such Phaenomena in the World, by dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the parts of the Matter and their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as cannot be resolved into meer Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical powers.</hi> This rude Description may serve to convey to any one a conception determinate enough of the nature of the thing. And that it is not a meer Notion, but a real Being, besides what I have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally hinted already (and shall here again confirm by new instances) there are several other considerations may perswade us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The first whereof shall be concerning
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:55765:245"/>
those experiments of <hi>Sympathetick</hi> Pains, Asswagements and Cures, of which there are many Examples, approved by the most scrupulous Pretenders to sobriety and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of all which I cannot forbear to pronounce, that I suspect them to come to pass by some such power as makes strings that be tuned Unisons (though on several Instruments) the one being touched, the other to tremble and move very sensibly, and to cast off a straw or pin or any such small thing laid upon it. Which cannot be resolved into any <hi>Mechanical</hi> Principle, though some have ingeniously gone about it. For before they attempted to shew the reason, why that string that is not <hi>Unison</hi> to that which is struck should not leap and move, as it doth that is, they should have demonstrated, that by the meer Vibration of the Aire that which is <hi>Unison</hi> can be so moved; for if it could, these Vibrations would not fail to move other Bodies more movable by farre then the string it self that is thus moved. As for example, if one hung loose near the string that is struck a small thred of silk or an hair with some light thing at the end of it, they must needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive those reciprocal Vibrations that are communicated to the Unison string at a far greater distance, if the meer motion of the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:55765:246"/>
material Aire caused the subsultation of the string tuned Unison. Which yet is contrary to experience. Besides that, if it were the meer Vibration of the Aire that caused this tremor in the <hi>Unison</hi> string, the effect would not be considerable, unless both the strings lay well-nigh in the same Plane, and that the Vibration of the string that is struck be made in that Plane they both lie in. But let the string be struck so as to cut the Plane perpendicularly by its tremulous excursions, or let both the strings be in two several Planes at a good distance above one another, the event is much-what the same, though the Aire cannot rationally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to vibrate backwards and forwards, but well-nigh in the very Planes wherein the strings are moved. All which things do clearly shew, that pure <hi>corporeal</hi> causes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce this effect: and that therefore we must suppose, that both the strings are united with some one <hi>incorporeal</hi> Being, which has a different <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> from <hi>Matter,</hi> but yet a <hi>Sympathy</hi> therewith; which affecting this <hi>immaterial</hi> Being, makes it affect the Matter in the same manner in another place, where it does symbolize with that other in some predisposition or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, as these two strings doe in being tuned <hi>Unisons</hi> to one another: and this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:55765:246"/>
sending any particles to the Matter it does thus act upon; as my thought of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of my Toe being represented within my Brain, by the power of my Soul I can, without sending Spirits into my Toe, but onely by making use of them that are there, move my Toe as I please, by reason of that <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> that is peculiar to my Soul as a spiritual substance that pervades my whole Body. Whence I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude also, that there is some such Principle as we call the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> or the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Soul of the World,</hi> into which such Phaenomena as these are to be resolved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I account <hi>Sympathetick</hi> Cures, Pains and Asswagements to be such. As for example, when in the use of those <hi>Magnetick</hi> Remedies, as some call them, they can make the wound dolorously hot or chill at a great distance, or can put it into perfect case, this is not by any agency of emissary Atoms. For these hot Atoms would cool sufficiently in their progress to the party through the frigid aire; and the cold Atoms, if they could be so active as to dispatch so far, would be warm enough by their journey in the Summer Sun. The inflammations also of the Cowes Udder by the boyling over of the milk into the fire, the scalding of mens entrails at a distance by the burning of their
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:55765:247"/>
excrements, with other pranks of the like nature, these cannot be rationally resolved into the recourse of the Spirits of Men or Kine mingled with fiery Atoms, and so re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the parts thus affected, because the minuteness of those toms argues the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainness of their extinction, as the smallest wires made red hot soonest cool. To all which you may adde that notable example of the Wines working when the Vines are in the flower, and that this sympathetick effect must be from the Vines of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from which they came: whence these exhalations of the Vineyards must spread as <hi>far</hi> as from <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Canaries</hi> to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by the same reason must reach round about every way as far from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> besides their journey upwards into the Aire. So that there will be an Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere of vineall Atoms of an incredible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, unless they part themselves into trains, and march onely to those places whither their Wines are carried. But what corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real cause can guide them thither? Which question may be made of other Phaenomena of the like nature. Whence again it will be necessary to establish the Principle I drive at, though the effects were caused by the transmission of Atoms.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The notablest examples of this <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:55765:247"/>
Sympathy</hi> are in histories more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and obscure, and such as, though I have been very credibly informed yet, as I have already declared my self, I dare onely avouch as possible, viz. the Souls of men leaving their Bodies, and appearing in shapes suppose of <hi>Cats, Pigeons, Wezels,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Men, and that whatever hurt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls them in these <hi>Astral</hi> bodies, as the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsians</hi> love to call them, the same is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon their <hi>Terrestrial</hi> lying in the mean time in their beds or on the ground. As if their <hi>Astral bodies</hi> be scalded, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, have the back broke, the same certainly happens to their <hi>Earthly bodies.</hi> Which things if they be true, in all likelihood they are to be resolved into this Principle we speak of, and that the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> is snatcht into consent with the imagination of the Soules in these <hi>Astral</hi> bodies or <hi>aiery Vehicles.</hi> Which act of imagining must needs be strong in them, it being so set on and assisted by a quick and sharp pain and fright in these scaldings, woundings, and stroaks on the back; some such thing happening here as in women with child, whose Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies made keen by a suddain fear, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived their children of their arms, yea and of their heads too, as also appears by two remarkable stories Sr. <hi>Kenelme Digby</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates

               <p n="5">5. Which effects I suppose to be beyond the power of any humane Fancy unassisted by some more forceable Agent; as also that prodigious birth he mentions of a woman of <hi>Carcassona,</hi> who by her overmuch sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pleasing her self with an Ape while she was with Child, brought forth a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster exactly of that shape. And if we should conclude with that learned Writer, that it was a real Ape, it is no more wonderfull, nor so much, as that birth of a Crabfish or Lobster we have above mentioned out of <hi>Fortunius Licetus;</hi> as we might also other more usual, though no less monstrous births for the wombs of women to bear. Of which the Soul of the Mother cannot be suspected to be the cause, she not so much as being the efformer of her own <hi>Foetus,</hi> as that judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Naturalist Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> has determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And if the Mothers Soule could be the efformer of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> in all reason her <hi>Plastick</hi> power would be ever particular and specifick as the Soul it self is particular. What remains therefore but the <hi>universal Soule of the World</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> that

can doe these feats? who, <hi>Vertumnus</hi> like, is ready to change his own Activity and the yielding matter into any mode and shape indifferently as occasion engages him, and so to prepare an edifice, at least the more rude stroaks and delineaments thereof, for any specifick Soule whatsoever, and in any place where the Matter will yield to his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. But the time of the arrival thither of the particular guest it is intended for, though we cannot say how soon it is, yet we may be sure it is not later then a clear discovery of Sensation as well as Vegetation and organization in the Matter.</p>

Concerning the motion whereof I agree with <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of the immediate corporeal cause, to wit, the <hi>AEtherial</hi> matter, which is so plentifully in the Air over it is in grosser Bodies; but withall doe vehemently sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that there must be some <hi>immaterial</hi> cause, such as we call the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> or <hi>Inferiour Soule of the World,</hi> that must direct the motions of the <hi>AEtherial</hi> particles to act upon these grosser Bodies to drive them towards the Earth. For that surplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Agitation of the <hi>globular</hi> particles of the <hi>AEther</hi> above what they spend in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Earth about, is carried every way indifferently, according to his own conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:55765:250"/>
by which motion the drops of liquors are formed into round figures, as he ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously concludes. From whence it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that a bullet of iron, silver or gold placed in the aire is equally assalted on all sides by the occursion of these aethereal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and therefore will be moved no more downwards then upwards, but hang <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> as a piece of Cork rests on the water, where there is neither winde nor stream, but is equally plaied against by the particles of water on all sides.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is it imaginable how the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of this aethereal Element here against the surface of the Earth, being it is so fluid a Body, should make it endeavour to lift it self from the Earth at so great a distance as the middle Region of the Aire and further. Besides, that this is not the cause of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of heavy Bodies is manifest, because then a broad Plate of the most solid Metal and most perfectly polisht, such as is able to reflect the aethereal particles most effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously, being placed slooping would change the course of the descent of things, and make them fall perpendicularly to it, and not to the Plane of the Horizon; as for example, not from A to B, but from A to C: which is against experience. For the heavy Body will always fall down from
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:55765:250"/>
A to B, though <figure/> the recession of the aethereal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must needs be from C to A ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Hypothesis.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor can the endeavour of the celestial Matter from the centre to the circumference take place here. For besides that <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> the profoundest Master of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, has declin'd that way himself (though Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has taken it up,) it would follow, that near the Poles of the Earth there would be no descent of heavy Bodies at all, and in the very Clime we live in none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular. To say nothing how this way will not salve the union of that great Water that adheres to the body of the Moon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But to make good what I said, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable proof that heavy Bodies in the very Clime where we live will not descend perpendicularly to the Earth, if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his solution of the Phaenomenon of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity be true; we shall evidently <hi>demonstrate</hi> both to the Eye and to Reason the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their declination from a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in any Elevation of the Pole. In the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:55765:251"/>
                  <figure/> Circle therefore A B D, let the AEquator be B D, and from the point C draw a line to E, parallel to B D: which line C E will cut the circle in F 60. degrees, suppose, from B. Imagine now a heavy Body at E; according to Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his solution of the Probleme of Gravity, it must fall towards the Earth in a line parallel to the <hi>AEquator, viz.</hi> in the line E F; which, say I, declines from the line H F drawn perpendicular to the Horizon L K two third parts of a right angle, that is to say, 60. degrees. For the E F H is equal to G F R, which again is equal to the alternate angle B G F, which is two third parts of a right angle <hi>ex thesi.</hi> Whence it is plain that E F declines from a perpendicular no less then 60. degrees. By the same reason, if we had drawn the Scheme for the elevation of 50. which is
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:55765:251"/>
more Southern then our Clime, we might demonstrate that the descent of heavy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies declines from a perpendicular to the Horizon 50 degrees, or 5/9 of a right angle, and so of the rest. From whence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that men cannot walk upright, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, in the elevation suppose of 60. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as near to the ground as E F is to F L, and much nearer in the more remote parts of the North, as in <hi>Norway, Russia, Frisland, Island, Scricfinnia, Greenland</hi> and others; and there is proportionably the same reason in other Climes less Northern. So that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> need not send us so farre off as to the Poles to make the experiment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For if for example we drew a Scheme for the Parallel under which we live, suppose about 52. degrees of Elevation, we might represent truly to the eye in what posture men would walk at <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his determination of the causes of Gravity. For it is plain <figure/>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:55765:252"/>
from what has been above demonstrated, that the natural posture of their Bodies upon the Horizon L K would be in the line E F, out of which if they did force themselves towards the perpendicular H F, it would be much pain to them, neither could they place themselves in the line H F, without being born headlong to the ground, and laid flat upon the Horizon F K; the force of the Aire or whatever more subtile Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therein pressing in lines parallel to E F, and therefore necessarily bearing down whatever is placed loose in the line H F, as is plain to any one at first sight. But we finding no such thing in experience, it is evident that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his solution is salse; nay I may say that he has not rendred so much as a possible cause of this so ordinary a Phaenomenon. A thing truly much to be lamented in one who, upon pretence that all the Appearances in the Universe may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into meer Corporeal causes, has with unparallell'd confidence, and not without some wit, derided and exploded all immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Substance out of the World; whenas in the mean time he does not produce so much as possible Corporeal causes of the most ordinary effects in Nature. But to leave Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> to his own ways, and to return to <hi>Des-Cartes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:55765:252"/>
6. Adde unto all this, that if the motion of gross Bodies were according to meer Mechanical laws, a Bullet, suppose of Lead or Gold, cast up into the aire, would never descend again, but would persist in a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linear motion. For it being farre more solid then so much Aire &amp; AEther put together as would fill its place, and being moved with no less swiftness then that wherewith the Earth is carried about in twenty four hours, it must needs break out in a straight line through the thin aire, and never return again to the Earth, but get away as a <hi>Comet</hi> does out of a <hi>Vortex.</hi> And that <hi>de facto</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Bullet has been shot so high that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fell back again upon the ground, <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> does admit of as a true experiment. Of which, for my own part, I can imagine no other unexceptionable reason, but that at a certain distance the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> in some regards leaves the motion of Matter to the pure laws of Mechanicks, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in other bounds checks it, whence it is that the Water does not swill out of the Moon.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now if the pure Mechanick powers in Matter and Corporeal motion will not amount to so simple a Phaenomenon as the falling of a stone to the Earth, how shall we hope they will be the adaequate cause of
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:55765:253"/>
sundry sorts of Plants and other things, that have farre more artifice and curiosity then the direct descent of a stone to the ground. Nor are we beaten back again by this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very into that dotage of the confounded <hi>Schools,</hi> who have indued almost every dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Object of our Senses with a distinct <hi>Substantial form,</hi> and then puzzle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with endless scrupulosities about the generation, corruption, and mixtion of them. For I affirm with <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> that nothing affects our Senses, but such variations of Matter as are made by difference of Motion, Figure, Situation of parts, &amp;c. but I dissent from him in this, in that I hold it is not meer and pure mechanical motion that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses all these sensible Modifications in Matter, but that many times the immediate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector thereof is this <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> (I speak of) one and the same every where, and acting alwaies alike upon like occasions, as a clear-minded man and of a solid judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives alwaies the same verdict in the same circumstances. For this <hi>Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> intermedling with the efformation of the <hi>Foetus</hi> of Animals (as I have already shewn more then once) where notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there seems not so much need, there being in them a more particular Agent for that purpose; 'tis exceeding rational that
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55765:253"/>
all Plants and Flowers of all sorts (in which we have no argument to prove there is any particular Souls) should be the effects of this <hi>Universal Soule of the World.</hi> Which Hypothesis, besides that it is most reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it self, according to that ordinary Axiome, <hi>Frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora,</hi> is also very serviceable for the preventing many hard Problems about the <hi>Divisibility</hi> of the Soules of Plants, their <hi>Transmutations</hi> into other <hi>Species,</hi> the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Slips, and the like. For there is one Soule ready every where to pursue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of prepared Matter. Which is the common and onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of all <hi>Plantal appearances,</hi> or of whatever other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> there be, greater or smaller, that exceed the pure Mechanical powers of Matter. We except onely <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> who having all of them the capacity of some sort of enjoyments or other, it was fit they should have particular Souls for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the sense of those enjoyments which the transcendent Wisdome of the Creatour has contrived.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I have now plainly enough set down what I mean by the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved its Existence. Out of what has been said may be easily conceived why I give it this name, it being a Principle that
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:55765:254"/>
is of so great influence and activity in the <hi>Nascency</hi> as I may so call it, &amp; <hi>Coalescency</hi> of things: And this not onely in the production of Plants, with all other <hi>Concretions</hi> of an inferiour nature, and yet above the meer <hi>Mechanical</hi> lawes of Matter; but also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>birth</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> whereunto it is preparatory and assistent. I know not whether I may entitle it also to the guidance of Animals in the chiefest of those actions which we usually impute to <hi>natural Instinct.</hi> Amongst which none so famous as the Birds making their Nests, and particularly the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial structure of the Martins nests under the arches of Church-windowes. In which there being so notable a design unknown to themselves, and so small a pleasure to present Sense, it looks as if they were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by another, inspired and carried away in a natural rapture by this <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> to doe they know not what, though it be really a necessary provision and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for laying their Eggs, and hatching their young, in the efformation whereof this <hi>Inferiour Soule of the World</hi> is so ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conceived to assist and intermeddle: and therefore may the better be supposed to over-power the Fancy, and make use of the members of the Birds to build these conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Receptacles, as certain shops to lay up
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:55765:254"/>
the Matter whereon she intends to work, namely the Eggs of these Birds whom she thus guides in making of their nests.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But this argument being too lubricous, I will not much insist upon it. The most notable of those offices that can be assigned to the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> and that sutably to his name, is the Translocation of the Souls of Beasts into such Matter as is most fitting for them, he being the common <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xenet</hi> or <hi>Contractor</hi> of all natural Matches and Marriages betwixt <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>matter,</hi> if we may also speak Metaphors as well as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> whose Aphorisme it is, that <hi>Materia appetit formam ut foemina virum.</hi> This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit therefore may have not onely the power of directing the motion of Matter at hand, but also of transporting of particular Souls and Spirits in their state of <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity</hi> to such Matter as they are in a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to catch life in again. Which Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation or Transmission may very well be at immense distances, the effect of this <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi> and <hi>Coactivity</hi> being so great in the working of Wines, as has been above no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though a thing of less concernment. Whence, to conclude, we may look upon this <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> as the great <hi>Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master-General</hi> of divine Providence, but able alone, without any under-Officers, to
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:55765:255"/>
lodge every Soule according to her rank and merit whenever she leaves the Body: And would prove a very serviceable Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis for those that fancy the praeexistence of humane Souls; to declare how they may be conveighed into Bodies here, be they at what distance they will before; and how Matter haply may be so fitted, that the best of them may be fetcht from the purest aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Regions into an humane Body, without serving any long Apprentiship in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Aire: as also how the Souls of Brutes, though the Earth were made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inept for the life of any Animal, need not lye for ever useless in the Universe. But such speculations as these are of so vast a comprehension and impenetrable obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that I cannot have the confidence to dwell any longer thereon; especially they not touching so essentially our present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, and being more fit to fill a volume themseves, then to be comprised within the narrow limits of my now almost-finish'd Discourse.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. Objections against the Souls Immortality from her condition in <hi>Infancy, Old age, Sleep</hi> and <hi>Sicknesses.</hi> 2. Other Objections taken from Experiments that seem to prove her <hi>Discerpibility.</hi> 3. As also from the seldome appearing of the Souls of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased; 4. And from our natural fear of Death. 5. A Subterfuge of the adverso par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in supposing but one Soule common to all Creatures. 6. An Answer concerning the Littleness of the Soule in <hi>Infancy:</hi> 7. As also concerning the weakness of her Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals then, and in Old age. 8. That Sleep does not at all argue the Souls Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, but rather illustrate her Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 9. An Answer to the Objection from Apoplexies and Catalepsies: 10. As also to that from Madness. 11. That the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous depravations of her Intellectual Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe no more argue her Mortality, then the worser Modifications of Matter its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Annihilability.</hi> And why God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Souls sympathizing with Matter.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AS for the Objections that are usually made against the Immortality of the Soule; to propound them all, were both
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:55765:256"/>
tedious and useless, there being scarce above one in twenty that can appear of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to but an indifferent Wit and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the greatest difficulties that can be urged I shall bring into play, that the Truth we doe maintain may be the more fully cleared, and the more firmly believed. The most material Objections that I know against the Souls Immortality, are these five. The First is from the consideration of the condition of the Soule in <hi>Infancy,</hi> and <hi>Old age,</hi> as also in <hi>Madness, Sleep,</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies.</hi> For if we doe but observe the great difference of our Intellectual operations in <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Dotage</hi> from what they are when we are in the prime of our years, and how that our Wit grows up by degrees, flourishes for a time, and at last decayes, keeping the same pace with the changes that Age and Years bring into our Body, which observes the same lawes that Flowers and Plants; what can we suspect, but that the Soule of Man, which is so magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken of amongst the learned, is nothing else but a Temperature of Body, and that it growes and spreads with it, both in bigness and virtues, and withers and dies as the Body does, or at least that it does wholly depend on the Body in its Operations, and therefore that there is no sense nor percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:55765:256"/>
of any thing after death? And when the Soule has the best advantage of years, she is not then exempted from those Eclipses of the powers of the Minde that proceed from <hi>Sleep, Madness, Apoplexies,</hi> and other Diseases of that nature. All which shew her condition, whatever more exalted Wits surmise of her, that she is but a poor mortal and corporeal thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second Objection is taken from such Experiments as are thought to prove the Soule <hi>divisible</hi> in the grossest sense, that is to say, <hi>discerpible</hi> into pieces. And it seems a clear case in those more contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Animals which are called <hi>Insects,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> describes them, and doth acknowledge that being cut into pieces, each segment will have its motion and sense apart to it self. The most notable Instance of this kind is in the <hi>Scolopendra,</hi> whose parts <hi>Aristotle (Histor. Animal. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.) affirmes to live a long time divided, and to run backwards and forwards; and therefore he will have it to look like many living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures growing together, rather then one single one, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>De Juvent. &amp; Senect. Cap.</hi> 2. But yet he will not afford them the priviledge of Plants, whose Slips
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:55765:257"/>
will live and grow, being set in the Earth. But the instances that belong to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ascend higher, for they pretend that the parts of perfect Animals will also live asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. There are two main instances thereof. The one, that of the Eagle <hi>Fromondus</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whose head being chopt off by an angry Clown, for quarrelling with his dog, the Body flew over the barn near the place of this rude execution. This was done at <hi>Fromondus</hi> his fathers house: nor is the story improbable, if we consider what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily happens in Pigeons and Ducks, when their heads are cut off. The other instance is, of a Malefactour beheaded at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> whose head when it had given some few jumps into the crowd, and a Dog fell a licking the blood, caught the Dogs eare in its teeth, and held it so fast, that he being frighted ran away with the mans head hanging at his eare, to the great astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confusion of the people. This was told <hi>Fromondus</hi> by an eye-witness of the fact. From which two examples they think may be safely inferred, that the Souls of Men, as well as of the more perfect kinde of Brutes, are also <hi>discerpible.</hi> That example in the same Authour out of <hi>Josephus Acosta,</hi> if true, yet is finally to this purpose. For the speaking of the sacrificed Captive, when
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:55765:257"/>
his Heart was cut out, may be a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation indeed that the Brain is the Seat of the Common Sense, but no argument of the Divisibility of the Soule, she remaining at that time entire in the Body, after the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Heart, whose office it is to afford Spirits, which were not so far yet dissipated, but that they sufficed for that suddain operation of life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Third Objection is from the sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Souls of the deceased. For if they can at all appear, why do they not oftner? if they never appear, it is a strong suspicion that they are not at all in Being.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fourth is from the Fear of Death, and an inward down-bearing sense in us at some times, that we are utterly mortal, and that there is nothing to be expected after this life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Fifth and last is rather a Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge then an Objection, That there is but <hi>One Common Soul</hi> in all Men and Beasts, that operates according to the variety of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and Persons it does actuate and vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, bearing a seeming particularity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the particular pieces of Matter it enforms, but is one in all; and that this particularity of Body being lost, this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Man or Beast is lost, and so every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature is properly and intirely mortal.
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:55765:258"/>
These are the reallest and most pertinent Objections I could ever meet withall, or can excogitate, concerning the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: to which I shall answer in order.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And to the First, which seems to be the shrewdest, I say, that neither the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractedness</hi> of the Soule in <hi>Infancy,</hi> nor the <hi>Weakness</hi> of her Intellectual Operations either <hi>then</hi> or in <hi>extream Old age,</hi> are sufficient proofs of her <hi>Corporeity</hi> or <hi>Mortality.</hi> For what wonder is it that the Soule, faln into this low and fatal condition, where she must submit to the course of Nature, and the lawes of other Animals that are generated here on Earth, should display her self by degrees, from smaller dimensions to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary size of men; whenas this faculty of <hi>contracting and dilating</hi> of themselves is in the very essence and notion of all Spirits? as I have noted already <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. So she does but that leisurely and naturally now, being subjected to the lawes of this terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Fate, which she does, exempt from this condition, suddainly and freely: not grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>Juxta-position</hi> of parts, or <hi>Intromission</hi> of Matter, but inlarging of her self with the Body meerly by the <hi>dilatation</hi> of her own Substance, which is one and the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As for the <hi>Debility</hi> of her Intellectuals
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:55765:258"/>
in <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Old age,</hi> this consideration has less force to evince her a meer corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real essence then the former, and touches not our Principles at all, who have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the very worst surmise concerning the operations of the Minde, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them, of my own accord, to depend very intimately on the temper and tenour of the Souls immediate instrument, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; which being more torpid and watry in Children and Old men, must needs hinder her in such operations as require another constitution of Spirits then is usually in <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Childhood:</hi> though I will not profess my self absolutely confident, that the Soule cannot act without all dependence on Matter. But if it does not, which is most probable, it must needs follow, that its Operations will keep the lawes of the Body it is united with. Whence it is demonstrable how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi> is to preserve and advance a mans Parts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As for <hi>Sleep,</hi> which the dying Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher called the Brother of Death, I doe not see how it argues the Souls Mortality, more then a mans inability to wake again: but rather helps us to conceive, how that though the stounds and agonies of Death seem utterly to take away all the hopes of the Souls living after them; yet upon a

recovery of a quicker Vehicle of Aire, she may suddainly awake into fuller and fresher participation of life then before. But I may answer also, that Sleep being onely the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the outward Senses, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of motion from the external world, argues no more any radical defect of Life and Immortality in the Soul, then the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a mans Sight bounded within the walls of his chamber by Shuts, does argue any blindness in the immured party: who haply is busy reading by candle-light, and that with ease, so small a print as would trouble an ordinary Sight to read it by day. And that the Soule is not perpetually employed in sleep, is very hard for any to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; we so often remembring our dreams meerly by occasions, which if they had not occurred, we had never suspected we had dreamed that night.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Which Answer, as also the former, is applicable to <hi>Apoplexies, Catalepsies,</hi> and whatever other Diseases partake of their nature, and witness how nimble the Soule is to act upon the suppeditation of due Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and how Life and Sense and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Reason, and all return, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the fitting temper of the Spirits, suitable to that <hi>vital Congruity</hi> that then is predominant in the Soule.</p>

10. And as for <hi>Madness,</hi> there are no Apprehensions so frantick but are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Souls Immortality, not as they are frantick, but as Apprehensions. For <hi>Matter</hi> cannot apprehend any thing, either wildly or soberly, as I have already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently demonstrated. And it is as irrational for a man to conclude, that the depraved Operations of the Soule argue her Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as that the worser tempers, or figures, or whatever more contemptible modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there are of Matter, should argue its annihilation by the meer power of Nature; which no man that understands himself will ever admit. The Soule indeed is indued with several Faculties, and some of them very fatally passive, such as those are that have the nearest commerce with Matter, and are not so absolutely in her own power, but that her levity and mindlesness of the divine light may bring her into subjection to them; as all are, in too sad a sort, that are incarcerate in this terrestrial Body, but some have better luck then other some in this wild and audacious ramble from a more secure state. Of which Apostasy if there be some that are made more tragick examples then others of their stragling from their soveraign Happiness, it is but a merciful admonition of the danger we all have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:55765:260"/>
by being where we are; and very few so wel escaped, but that if they could examine their Desires, Designs, and Transactions here, by that Truth they were once masters of, they would very freely confess, that the mistakes and errours of their life are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to, but of worse consequence then, those of natural Fools and Mad-men, whom all either hoot at for their folly, or else la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their misery. And questionless the Souls of Men, if they were once reduced to that sobriety they are capable of, would be as much ashamed of such Desires and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they are now wholly engaged in, as any mad-man, reduced to his right Senses, is of those freaks he played when he was out of his wits.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But the variety of degrees, or kindes of depravation in the Intellective faculties of the Soule, her Substance being <hi>indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible,</hi> cannot at all argue her <hi>Mortality,</hi> no more then the different modifications of Matter the <hi>Annihilability</hi> thereof, as I have already intimated. Nor need a man trouble himself how there should be such a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy betwixt Body and Soule, when it is so demonstrable that there is. For it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to consider, that it is their immediate nature so to be by the will and ordinance of Him that has made all things. And that if
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:55765:260"/>
Matter has no Sense nor Cogitation it self, as we have demonstrated it has not, it had been in vain, if God had not put forth into Being that Order of immaterial Creatures which we call Souls, vitally unitable with the <hi>Matter:</hi> Which therefore, according to the several modifications thereof, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily have a different effect upon the Soule, the Soule abiding still as unperisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Matter that is more mutable then <hi>she.</hi> For the Matter is <hi>dissipable,</hi> but she utterly <hi>indiscerpible.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. NOR doe those Instances in the second Objection prove any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as if the Soule it self were really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible. The most forcible Example is that of the <hi>Scolopendra,</hi> the motion of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded parts being so quick and nimble, and so lasting. But it is easy to conceive, that the activity of the Spirits in the Mechanical conformation of the pieces of that Insect, till motion has dissipated them, will as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily make them run up and down, as Gunpowder in a squib will cause its motion. And therefore the Soule of the <hi>Scolopendra</hi> will be but in one of those Segments, and uncertain in which, but likely according as the Segments be made. For cut a Wasps head off from the Body, the Soule retires out of the head into the Body; but cut her in the wast, leaving the upper part of the Body to the head, the Soule then retires into that forepart of the Wasp. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no wonder that the head being cut off, the Body of the Wasp will fly and
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:55765:261"/>
flutter so long, the Soule being still in it, and haply conferring to the direction of the Spirits for motion, not out of Sense, but from custome or nature: as we walk not thinking of it, or play of the Lute though our minde be running on something else, as I have noted before. But when the wast is left to the head, it is less wonder, for then the Animal may not be destitute of sense and fancy, to conveigh the Spirits to move the wings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The former case will fit that of the headless Eagle that flew over the Barn. But the mans head that catcht the Dog by the ear would have more difficulty in it (it not seeming so perfectly referrible to the latter case of the Wasp) did not we consider how hard the teeth will set in a swoon. As this Head therefore was gasping while the Dog was licking the blood thereof, his ear chanced to dangle into the mouth of it, which closing together as the ear hung into it, pinched it so fast that it could not fall off. Besides it is not altogether improbable, especially considering that some men die upwards, and some downwards, that the Soul may, as it happens, sometimes retire into the Head, and sometimes into the Body, in these decollations, according as they are more or less replenisht with Spirits, and by
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:55765:262"/>
the lusty jumping of this Head, it should seem it was very full of them. Many such things as these also may happen by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> who, its like, may be as busy in the ruines of Animals, while the Spirits last, as it is in the fluid rudiments of them when they are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But the former answers being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, it is needless to enlarge our selves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this new Theme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To this second Objection might have been added such monstrous births, as seem to imply the <hi>Perceptive part</hi> of the Soul divided actually into two or more parts. For <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> seems expresly to affirm, <hi>De Generat. Animal. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. that that monstrous birth that has two hearts is two Animals, but that which has but one heart is but one. From whence it will follow that there is but one Soul also in that one-hearted Monster, though it have two or more heads; whence it is also evident, that the <hi>Perceptive part</hi> of that one Soule must be actually divided into two or more. This opinion of <hi>Aristotle Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> subscribes to, and therefore conceives that that monstrous child that was borne at <hi>Emmaus,</hi> in <hi>Theodosius</hi> his time, with two heads and two hearts, was two persons; but that other borne Anno 1531. with two heads &amp; but one heart, who lived till he was
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:55765:262"/>
a man, was but one person. Which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives appears the plainer, in that both the heads professed their agreement perpetually to the same actions, in that they had the same appetite, the same hunger and thirst, spoke alike, had the same desire to lye with their wife, and of all other acts of exonerating nature. But for that other that had two hearts, and was divided to the Navel, there was not this identity of affection and desire, but sometimes one would have a mind to a thing, and sometimes another, sometimes they would play with one another, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fight. See <hi>Sennert. Epitom. Scient. Natural. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But I answer, and first to <hi>Aristotles</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that he does not so confidently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, that every Monster that has but one heart is but one <hi>Animal.</hi> For his words run thus; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Where he onely speaks hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetically, not peremptorily, that the Heart is that part where the first Principle of life is, and from which the rest of life in Soul or Body is to be derived. For indeed he makes it elswhere the seat of Common Sense, but that it is a mistake we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready demonstrated, and himself seems not
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:55765:263"/>
confident of his own Opinion; and therefore we may with the less offence decline it, and affirm (and that without all hesitancy) that a Monster is either one or more Animals according to the number of the heads of it, and that there are as many distinct Souls as there are heads in a monstrous Birth. But from the heads downwards the Body being but one, and the heart but one, that there must needs be a wonderful exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the sense of affections in these heads, they having their Blood and Spirits from one fountain, and one common seat of their passions and desires. But questionless when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever one head winked, he could not then see by the eyes of the other; or if one had pricked one of these heads, the other would not have felt it: though whatever was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted below, it is likely they both felt alike, both the Souls equally acting the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this Monster, but the heads being actuated by them onely in several. Which is a sufficient answer to <hi>Sennertus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The weakness of the third Objection is manifest, in that it takes away the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of all Spirits, as well as the Souls of the deceased. Of whose Being notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none can doubt that are not dotingly incredulous. We say therefore that the Souls of men, being in the same condition
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:55765:263"/>
that other Spirits are, appear sometimes, though but seldome. The cause in both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, partly the difficulty of bringing their Vehicles to an unnatural consistency, and partly they having no occasion so to doe, and lastly it being not permitted to them to doe as they please, or to be where they have a minde to be.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As for the <hi>Fear of Death,</hi> and that <hi>down-bearing sense</hi> that sometimes so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulably suggests to us that we are wholly mortal: To the first I answer, that it is a necessary result of our union with the Body, and if we should admit it one of the imperfections or infirmities we contract by being in this state, it were a solid Answer. And therefore this fear and presage of ill in Death is no argument that there is any ill in it, nor any more to be heeded then the predictions of any fanatical fellow that will pretend to prophecie. But besides this, it is fitting that there should be in us this fear and abhorrency, to make us keep this sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Providence has plac't us in; otherwise every little pet would invite us to pack our selves out of this World, and try our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in the other, and so leave the Earth to be inhabited onely by Beasts, whenas it is to be ordered and cultivated by Men.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To the second I answer, that such
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:55765:264"/>
peremptory conclusions are nothing but the impostures of Melancholy, or some other dull and fulsome distempers of blood that corrupt the Imagination; but that Fancy proves nothing, by Axiome 4. And that though the Soul enthroned in her <hi>AEthereal Vehicle</hi> be a very magnificent thing, full of Divine Love, Majesty and Tranquillity; yet in this present state she is inclogg'd and accloy'd with the foulness and darkness of this <hi>Terrestrial Body,</hi> she is subject to many fears and jealousies, and other disturbing passions, whose Objects though but a mockery, yet are a real disquiet to her minde in this her Captivity and Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which condition of hers is lively set out by that incomparable Poet and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonist, <hi>AEneid.</hi> 6. where, comparing that more free and pure state of our Souls in their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial or fiery Vehicles with their restraint in this earthly Dungeon, he makes this short and true description of the whole matter.

This is the sad estate of the more deeply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed Souls upon Earth; who are so wholly mastered by the motions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that they are carried headlong into an assent to all the suggestions and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that it so confidently obtrudes upon them; of which that of our mortality is not the weakest.

But the Knowing and Benign Spirit though he may flow in tears at so dismal a Spectacle, yet it does not at all suppress his hope and confidence of the Souls safe pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage into the other world; and is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise moved then the more passionate Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatours of some cunningly-contrived Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, where persons whose either Vertue, or misfortunes, or both, have wonne the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the beholders, are at last seen wallowing in their blood, and after some horrid groans and gasps, lye stretcht stark dead upon the stage: but being once drawn off, find themselves well and alive, and are ready to tast a cup of wine with their friends in the attiring room, to solace themselves really, after their fictitious pangs of death, and leave the easy-natur'd multitude to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to their soft passions for an evil that never befell them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AS for the last Objection, or rather Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge, of such as have no minde to finde their Souls immortal, pretending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have none distinct from that one Universal Soule of the World, whereby notwithstanding they acknowledge that the operations we are conscious to our selves of, of Reason and other Faculties, cannot be without one; we shall easily discover either the falsness or unserviceableness of this conceit for their design, who would so fain slink out of Being, after the mad freaks they have played in this Life. For it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly true, that a man is most properly that, whatever it is, that <hi>animadverts</hi> in him; for that is such an operation that no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but himself can doe it for him.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:55765:266"/>
perceive and take notice of its <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi> operations, but of all <hi>Sensations</hi> whatsoever that we are conscious of, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they terminate in our Body or on some outward Object. From whence it is plain, that <hi>That which we are</hi> is both <hi>Sensitive</hi> and <hi>Intellectual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now if we rightly consider what is comprehended in the true and usual notion of the <hi>Unity</hi> of a Soule, it is very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that the <hi>Animadversive</hi> thereof is but <hi>one,</hi> and that there is no Sensation nor Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any kinde in the Soule, but what is communicated to and perceived by the whole <hi>Animadversive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Which things being premised, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follows, that if there be but <hi>one Soule</hi> in the World, that Soule is both <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> and <hi>Sensitive,</hi> and that there cannot be any Pain, Pleasure or Speculation, in <hi>one</hi> mans Soule, but the same would be in <hi>all,</hi> nay that a man cannot lash a Dog, or spur a Horse, but himself would feel the smart of it: which is flatly against all experience, and therefore palpably false. Of this wilde Supposition I have spoken so fully in my <hi>Poems,</hi> that I need adde nothing here in this place, having sufficiently confuted it there.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But not to cut them so very short, let
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:55765:267"/>
us imagine the most favourable contrivance of their opinion we can, and conceit that though this <hi>Soule of the World</hi> be of it self every where alike, and that the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versive</hi> faculty is in it all in like vigour; yet it being engaged in severally-tempered Bodies, <hi>Animadversion</hi> is confin'd to that part of Matter onely which it actuates, and is stupid and unsensible of all other opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether Sensitive or Intellectual, that are transacted by her without, in other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: a thing very hard to conceive, and quite repugnant to the Idea of the <hi>Unity</hi> of a Soule, not to be conscious to her self of her own perceptions. But let it pass for a possibility, and let us suppose that one part of the Soule of the World informs one man, and another another, or at least some vital Ray there, yet notwithstanding, this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion will be incumbred with very harsh dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. For if several parts of the Soul of the World inform several parts of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when a man changes his place, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tears one part of the Soul of the World from another, or else changes Souls every step; and therefore it is a wonder that he changes not his Wits too, and loses his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Unless they will say that every part of the <hi>Soul of the World,</hi> upon the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a new Body, acts just so in it as that

part acted which it left, if there be no change or alteration thereof: whence every part of the Soul of the World will have the self-same Thoughts, Errours, Truths, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances, Pains, Pleasures, that the part had the Body newly left. So that a man shall always fancy it is himself, whereever he goes, though this self be nothing but the Soul of the World acting in such a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Body, and retaining and renewing to her self the Memory of all Accidents, Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Motions and Cogitations, she had the perception of in this particular piece of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized Matter. This is the most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous representation of this Opinion that can possibly be excogitated. But I leave it to those that love to amuse themselves in such mysteries, to try if they can make any good sense of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And he that can fancy it as a thing possible, I would demand of him, upon this supposition, who <hi>himself</hi> is; and he cannot deny but that he is a Being <hi>Perceptive</hi> and <hi>Animadversive,</hi> which the <hi>Body</hi> is not, and therefore that himself is not the Body; wherefore he is that in him which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Soul:</hi> But not its <hi>Operations,</hi> for the former reason; because they perceive nothing, but the Soul perceives them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting them: nor the <hi>Faculties,</hi> for they
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:55765:268"/>
perceive not one anothers Operations; but that which is a mans <hi>Self</hi> perceives them all: Wherefore he must say he is the <hi>Soul;</hi> and there being but one Soul in the World, he must be forc'd to vaunt himself to be the <hi>Soul of the World.</hi> But this boasting must suddainly fall again, if he but consider that the Soul of the World will be every mans personal <hi>Ipseity</hi> as well as his; whence every <hi>one</hi> man will be <hi>all</hi> men, and <hi>all</hi> men but <hi>one</hi> Individual man: which is a perfect contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to all the Laws of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> and <hi>Logick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But reminded of these inconveniences, he will pronounce more cautiously, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that he is not the Soul of the World at large, but onely so far forth as she expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites or exerts her self into the Sense and Remembrance of all those Notions or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses that happen to her, whereever she is joyned with his Body; but that so soon as this Body of his is dissipated and dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that she will no longer raise any such determinate Thoughts or Senses that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to that Union, and that so the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of such Actions, Notions and Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were held together in relation to a particular Body, being lost and laid aside upon the failing of the Body to which they did referre, this <hi>Ipseity</hi> or <hi>Personality</hi> which
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:55765:268"/>
consisted mainly in this, does necessarily perish in death. This certainly is that (if they know their own meaning) which many Libertines would have, who are afraid to meet themselves in the other World, for fear they should quarrel with themselves there for their transactions in this. And it is the handsomest Hypothesis that they can frame in favour of themselves, and farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that dull conceit, <hi>That there is nothing but meer Matter in the World;</hi> which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more lyable to confutation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And yet this is too scant a covering to shelter them and secure them from the sad after-claps they may justly suspect in the other life. For first, it is necessary for them to confess that they have in this life as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and proper sense of Torment, of Pleasure, of Peace, and Pangs of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and of other impressions, as if they had an individual Soul of their own distinct from that of the World, and from every ones else; and that if there be any <hi>Daemons</hi> or <hi>Genii,</hi> as certainly there are, that it is so with them too. We have also demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that all Sense and Perception is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately excited in the Soul by the Spirits; wherefore with what confidence can they promise themselves that the death of this earthly Body will quite obliterate all the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:55765:269"/>
tracts of their Being here on earth? when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the subtiler ruines thereof, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, may determine the Thoughts of the <hi>Soul of the World</hi> to the same tenour as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and draw from her the memory of all the Transactions of this life, and make her exercise her judgement upon them, and cause her to contrive the most vital exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the terrestrial Body into an aerial Vehicle, of like nature with the ferment of these material rudiments of life, saved out of the ruines of death. For any slight touch is enough to engage her to perfect the whole Scene, and so a man shall be represented to himself and others in the other state, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or no; and have as distinct a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal <hi>Ipseity</hi> there as he had in this life. Whence it is plain, that this false <hi>Hypothesis, That we are nothing but the Soul of the World acting in our Bodies,</hi> will not serve their turns at all that would have it so; nor se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from future danger, though it were admitted to be true. But I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated it false already, from the notion of the <hi>Unity</hi> of a Soul. Of the truth of which Demonstration we shall be the better assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if we consider that the subtile Elements, which are the immediate conveyers of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in our Souls, are continued throughout in the <hi>Soul of the World,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:55765:269"/>
into all living Creatures. So that the Soul of the World will be necessarily informed in every one, what she thinks or feels every where, if she be the onely Soul that actuates every Animal upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That other conceit, of our Souls being <hi>a Vital Ray of the Soul of the World,</hi> may gain much countenance by expressions in ancient Authors that seem to favour the Opinion: as that of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> who saith that the Souls of men are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And <hi>Philo</hi> calls the Minde of Man, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Trismegist,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. All which expressions make the Soul of man a <hi>Ray</hi> or <hi>Beam</hi> of the <hi>Soul of the World</hi> or of <hi>God.</hi> But we are to take notice that they are but Metaphorical phrases, and that what is understood thereby, is, <hi>that there is an emanation of a secondary substance from the several parts of the Soul of the World, resembling the Rayes of the Sun.</hi> Which way of conception, though it be more easy then the other, yet it has diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties enough. For this <hi>Vital Ray</hi> must have some head from whence it is stretched, and so the Body would be like a Bird in a string, which would be drawn to a great
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:55765:270"/>
length when one takes long voyages, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to the East or West <hi>Indies.</hi> Or if you will not have it a <hi>linear Ray,</hi> but an <hi>Orb</hi> of particular life; every such particular Orb must be hugely vast, that the Body may not travel out of the reach of the Soul. Besides, this Orb will strike through other Bodies as well as its own, and its own be in several parts of it; which are such incongruities and inconcinnities as are very harsh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to our Rational faculties. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that notion is infinitely more neat and safe, that proportions the Soul to the dimensions of the Body, and makes her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent on any thing but the Will of her Creator; in which respect of dependence she may be said to be a <hi>Ray</hi> of him, as the rest of the Creation also; but in no other sense that I know of, unless of likeness and similitude, she being the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Rays</hi> of Light are of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. But let every particular Soul be so many <hi>Rayes</hi> of the Soul of the World, what gain they by this, whenas these <hi>Rayes</hi> may be as capable of all the several congruities of life, as the Soul is in that sense we have described? and therefore <hi>Personality, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> will as surely return or continue in the other state, according to this Hypothesis, as the other more usual
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:55765:270"/>
one. Which also discovers the great folly of <hi>Pomponatius</hi> (and of as many as are of the same leven with him) who indeed is so modest and judicious as not to deny <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions,</hi> but attributes all to the influence of the Stars, or rather the <hi>Intelligencies</hi> of the Celestial Orbs. For they giving life and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to brute Animals, why may they not also, upon occasion, animate and actuate the Aire into shape and form, even to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them speak and discourse one shape with another? For so <hi>Pomponatius</hi> argues in his Book of the <hi>Immortality</hi> of <hi>the Soul,</hi> from <hi>Aquinas</hi> his concession, that Angels and Souls separate may figure the Aire into shape, and speak through it; <hi>Quare igitur Intelligentiae moventes corpora coelestia haec facere non possunt cum suis instrumentis quae tot ac tanta possunt quae faciunt Psittacos, Picos, Corvos &amp; Merulas, loqui?</hi> And a little after, he plainly reasons from the power the <hi>Intelligencies</hi> have of generating Animals, that it is not at all strange that they should raise such kinde of <hi>Apparitions</hi> as are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in History. But if these Celestial <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencies</hi> be confined to their own Orbs, so as that no <hi>secondary Essence</hi> reach these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Regions, it is impossible to conceive how they can actuate the Matter here below. But if there be any such <hi>essential emanations</hi>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:55765:271"/>
from them, whereby they actuate the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into these living Species we see in the World, of Men and Brutes; nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders but the same emanations remaining, may actuate the Aire when this earthly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick fails, and retain the memory of things transacted in this life, and that still our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality</hi> will be conserved as perfect and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct as it was here.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But this conceit of <hi>Pomponatius</hi> is farre more foolish then theirs that make onely one <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> that passes through all the Matter of the World, and is present in every place, to doe all feats that there are to be done. But to acknowledge so many several <hi>Intellectual Beings</hi> as there be fancied Celestial Orbs, and to scruple, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to seem confident, that there are not so many particular Souls as there be Men here on Earth, is nothing but Humour and Madness. For it is as rational to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge eight hundred thousand Myriads of <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Immaterial Beings,</hi> really distinct from one another, as eight; and an infinite number, as but one, that could not create the Matter of the World. For then two Substances, wholly independent on one another, would be granted, as also the Infinite parts of Matter that have no dependence one on the other. Why may
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:55765:271"/>
not there be therefore infinite numbers of Spirits or Souls that have as little depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence one on another, as well as there should be eight <hi>Intelligencies?</hi> whenas the motions and operations of every Animal are a more certain argument of an <hi>Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Being</hi> residing there, then the motions of the Heavens of any distinct <hi>Intelligencies</hi> in their Orbs, if they could be granted to have any: And it is no stranger a thing to conceive an Infinite multitude of <hi>Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> as well as <hi>Material, Essences,</hi> indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on one another, then but two, namely the Matter and the Soule of the World. But if there be so excellent a principle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent as can <hi>create</hi> Beings, as certainly there is; we are still the more assured that there are such multitudes of spiritual Essences, surviving all the chances of this present life, as the most sober and knowing men in all Ages have professed there are.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. That the Authour having safely conducted the Soule into her AErial condition through the dangers of Death, might well be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from attending her any further. 2. What reasons urge him to consider what fates may

befall her afterwards. 3. Three hazzards the Soule runs after this life, whereby she may again become obnoxious to death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of some. 4. That the aerial <hi>Genii</hi> are mortal, confirmed by three testimonies. 5. The one from the Vision of <hi>Facius Cardanus,</hi> in which the Spirits that appeared to him profest themselves mortal. 6. The time they stayed with him, and the matters they disputed of. 7. What credit <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eronymus Cardanus</hi> gives to his Fathers Vision. 8. The other testimony out of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> concerning the Death of the great God <hi>Pan.</hi> 9. The third and last of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> whose opinion <hi>Plutarch</hi> has polisht and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. 10. An Enumeration of the several Paradoxes contained in <hi>Facius Cardanus</hi> his Vision. 11. What must be the sense of the third Paradox, if those AErial Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours spake as they thought. 12. Another Hypothesis to the same purpose. 13. The craft of these <hi>Daemons,</hi> in shuffling in poysonous errour amongst solid Truths. 14. What makes the story of the death of <hi>Pan</hi> less to the present matter, with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his observations touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacred <hi>Islands</hi> neare <hi>Britain.</hi> 15. That <hi>Hesiod</hi> his opinion is the most unexceptionable, and that the harshness therein is but seeming, not real. 16. That
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:55765:272"/>
the <hi>AEthereal Vehicle</hi> instates the Soule in a condition of perfect Immortality. 17. That there is no internal impediment to those that are <hi>Heroically</hi> good, but that they may attain an everlasting happiness after Death.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WE have now, maugre all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and Objections made to the contrary, safely conducted the Soule into the other state, and installed her into the same condition with the <hi>AErial Genii.</hi> I might be very well excused, if I took leave of her here, and committed her to that fortune that attends those of the Invisible World: it being more seasonable for them that are there, to meditate and prefigure in their mindes all futurities belonging to them, then for us that are on this side the passage. It is enough that I have demonstrated, that neither the Essence nor Operations of the Soule are extinct by Death; but that they either not intermit, or suddainly revive upon the recovery of her aiery Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But seeing that those that take any pleasure at all in thinking of these things, can seldome command the ranging of their thoughts within what compass they please, and that it is obvious for them to doubt whether the Soule can be secure of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:55765:273"/>
in life in the other world, (it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying no contradiction, That her Vital Congruity, appropriate to this or that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may either of it self expire, or that she may by some carelesness debilitate one <hi>Congruity,</hi> and awaken another, in some measure, and so make her self obnoxious to Fate;) we cannot but think it in a manner necessary to extricate such difficulties as these, that we may not seem in this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game to loose all we won in the former; and make men suspect that the Soule is not at all immortal, if her Immortality will not secure her against all future fates.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To which she seems liable upon three accounts. The one we have named already, and respects an intrinsecal Principle, the <hi>Periodical terms</hi> of her <hi>Vital Congruity,</hi> or else the Levity and Miscarriage of her own Will. Which obnoxiousness of hers is still more fully argued from what is affirmed of the AErial <hi>Genii</hi> (whose companion and fellow-Citizen she is) whom sundry Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers assert to be <hi>Mortal.</hi> The other two hazards she runs are from without, to wit, the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That the AErial <hi>Genii</hi> are mortal, three main Testimonies are alledged for it. The Vision of <hi>Facius Cardanus,</hi> the Death of
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:55765:273"/>
the great God <hi>Pan,</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and the Opinion of <hi>Hesiod.</hi> I will set them all down fully, as I finde them, and then answer to them. The Vision of <hi>Facius Cardanus</hi> is punctually recited by his son <hi>Hieronymus</hi> in his <hi>De Subtilitate Lib.</hi> 19. in this manner.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That his Father <hi>Facius Cardanus,</hi> who confessed that he had the society of a familiar Spirit for about thirty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, told him this following Story often when he was alive, and after his death he found the exact relation of it committed to writing, which was this. <hi>The</hi> 13. <hi>day of August</hi> 1491. <hi>after I had done my holy things, at the</hi> 20. <hi>houre of the day, there appeared to me, after their usual manner, seven men cloathed in silk garments, with cloaks after the Greek mode, with purple stockins and crimson Cassocks, red and shining on their breasts; nor were they all thus clad, but onely two of them who were the chief. On the ruddier and taller of these two other two waited, but the less and paler had three attendants; so that they made up seven in all. They were about fourty years of age, but lookt as if they had not reacht thirty. When they were asked who they were, they answered that they were</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines aerii, AErial Men, <hi>who are born and die as we; but that their life is much longer then ours, as reaching to</hi> 300. <hi>years. Being
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:55765:274"/>
asked concerning the Immortality of our Souls, they answered,</hi> Nihil quod cuique proprium esset superesse, <hi>That they were of a nearer affinity with the</hi> Divi <hi>then we; but yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely different from them: and that their happiness or misery as much transcended ours, as ours does the brute Beasts. That they knew all things that are hid, whether Monies or Books. And that the lowest sort of them were the</hi> Genii <hi>of the best and noblest men, as the basest men are the trainers up of the best sort of Dogs. That the tenuity of their Bodies was such, that they can doe us neither good nor hurt, saving in what they may be able to doe by Spectres and Terrours, and impartment of Knowledge. That they were both publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors in an Academy, and that he of the lesser stature had</hi> 300. <hi>disciples, the other</hi> 200. Cardan's <hi>Father further asking them why they would not reveal such treasures as they knew unto men; they answered, that there was a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial law against it, upon a very grievous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>These aerial Inhabitants stai'd at least three hours with</hi> Facius Cardanus, <hi>disputing and arguing of sundry things, amongst which one was the</hi> Original of the World. <hi>The taller denied that God made the world</hi> ab aeterno: <hi>the lesser affirmed that he so created it every moment, that if he should desist but one
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:55765:274"/>
moment, it would perish. Whereupon the othèr cited some things out of the Disputations of</hi> Avenroes, <hi>which Book was not yet extant, and named several other Treatises, part whereof are known, part not, which were all of</hi> Avenroes <hi>his writing, and withall did openly profess himself to be an</hi> Avenroist.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The record of this Apparition <hi>Cardan</hi> found amongst his Fathers Papers, but seems unwilling to determine whether it be a true history or a Fable, but disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it in such a shuffling manner, as if he was perswaded it were true, and had a mind that others should think it so. I am sure he most-what steers his course in his Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical adventures according to this <hi>Cynosura,</hi> which is no obscure indication of his assent and belief.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That of the Death of the great God <hi>Pan,</hi> you may read in <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>De de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu Oraculorum;</hi> where <hi>Philippus,</hi> for the proof of the Mortality of <hi>Daemons,</hi> recites a Story which he heard from one <hi>AEmilianus</hi> a Roman, &amp; one that was remov'd far enough from all either stupidity or vanity: <hi>How his Father</hi> Epitherses <hi>being shipt for</hi> Italy, <hi>in the evening, near the</hi> Echinades, <hi>the winde failed them; and their Ship being carried by an uncertain course upon the Island</hi> Paxae, <hi>that most of the Passengers being waken, many
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:55765:275"/>
of them drinking merrily after Supper, there was a voice suddainly heard from the Island, which called to</hi> Thamus <hi>by name, who was an</hi> AEgyptian <hi>by birth, and the Pilot of the Ship: which the Passengers much wondred at, few of them having taken notice of the Pilots name before. He was twice called to before he gave any sign that he attended to the voice, but after giving express attention, a clear and distinct voice was heard from the Island, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering these words,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>The company was much astonisht at the hearing of the voice: and after much debate amongst themselves,</hi> Thamus <hi>resolved that, if the wind blew fair, he would sail by and say nothing; but if they were becalmed there, he would doe his Message: and therefore they being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed when they came to</hi> Palodes, <hi>neither winde nor tide carrying them on,</hi> Thamus <hi>loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of the poop of the Ship toward the shore, delivered his Message, telling them that the great</hi> Pan <hi>was dead. Upon which was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly heard as it were a joynt groaning of a multitude together, mingled with a murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous admiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The opinion of <hi>Hesiod</hi> also is, that the <hi>Genii</hi> or <hi>Daemons</hi> within a certain period of years doe die; but he attributes a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Longaevity to them, to wit of nine
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:55765:275"/>
thousand seven hundred and twenty years, which is the utmost that any allow them, most men less. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> under the person of others, has polisht this Opinion into a more curious and distinct dress: for out of the mortality of the <hi>Daemons,</hi> and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ranks which <hi>Hesiod</hi> mentions of <hi>Rational Beings,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="10">10. These are the most notable Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for the Mortality of <hi>Daemons</hi> that I have met withall, and therefore the more worth our reviewing. That Vision of <hi>Facius Cardanus,</hi> if it be not a Fable, contains many Paradoxes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:55765:276"/>
As first, <hi>That these</hi> AErial Genii <hi>are born at set times as well as we.</hi> Not that any she-<hi>Daemons</hi> are brought to bed of them, but that they seem to have a beginning of their Existence, from which they may be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have continued, some more years and some less. A thing unconceivable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we should imagine that there is still a lapse or descent of Souls out of the higher Regions of the Aire into these lower, or that these that leave these earthly Bodies pass into the number of the aiery <hi>Daemons.</hi> As neither their death can so well be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, unless we should fancy that their Souls pass into more pure Vehicles, or else descend into <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Bodies. For <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> himself acknowledges they perish not; which also is agreeable with his Opinion of the Praeexistence of our Souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That these AErial</hi> Genii <hi>live but about</hi> 300. <hi>years,</hi> which is against <hi>He siod</hi> and the greatest number of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> unless they should speak of that particular Order themselves were of; for it is likely there may be as much difference in their ages, as there is in the ages of several kinds of Birds and Beasts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That our Souls are so farre mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as that there is nothing proper to us remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:55765:276"/>
Fourthly, <hi>That they were nearer allied to the Gods then we by farre, and that there was as much difference betwixt them and us, as there is betwixt us and Beasts.</hi> Which they must understand then concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their Vehicles, and the natural activity of them, not the preeminency of their Intellectual Faculties. Or if they doe, they must be understood of the better sort of those <hi>AErial Spirits.</hi> Or if they mean it of all their Orders, it may be a mistake out of pride: as those that are rich and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as well as speculative amongst us, take it for granted that they are more judicious and discerning then the poor and despicable, let them be never so wise.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>That they know all secret things, whether hidden Books or Monies:</hi> which men might doe too, if they could stand by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealedly from them that hide them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>That the lowest sort of them were the</hi> Genii <hi>of the Noblest men, as the baser sort of Men are the Keepers and Educators of the better kinde of Dogs and Horses.</hi> This clause of the Vision also is inveloped with obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they having not defined whether this meanness of condition of the Tutelar <hi>Genii</hi> be to be understood in a <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Physical</hi> sense; whether the meanness of rank and power, or of natural wit and sagacity; in
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:55765:277"/>
which many times the Groom exceeds the young Gallant who assigns him to keep his Dogs and Horses.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>That such is the thinness and lightness of their Bodies, that they can doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor hurt thereby, though they may send strange Sights and Terrors, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Knowledge;</hi> which then must be chiefly of such things as belong to their ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Region. For concerning matters in the Sea, the Fishes, if they could speak, might inform men better then they. And for their corporeal debility, it is uncertain whether they may not pretend it, to animate their Confabulators to a more secure converse, or whether the thing be really true in some kindes of them. For that it is not in all, may be evinced by that Narration that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> a little after recites out of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> of the Devil that carried a Witch into the Aire, and set her on the top of a Chimney, giving her a Pot, and bidding her turn the mouth downwards, which done the whole Town was fired, and burnt down within the space of an hour. This hapned <hi>April</hi> the 10. <hi>Anno</hi> 1533. The Towns name was <hi>Schil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach,</hi> eight German miles distant from <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> The Story is so well attested, and guarded with such unexceptionable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that though <hi>Cardan</hi> love to shew
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:55765:277"/>
his wit in cavilling at most he recites, yet he finds nothing at all to quarrel at in his.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>That there are Students and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Philosophy in the AErial World, and are divided into Sects and Opinions there, as well as we are here.</hi> Which cannot possibly be true, unless they set some value upon knowledge, and are at an eager loss how to finde it, and are fain to hew out their way by arguing and reasoning as we doe.</p>
               <p>Ninthly and lastly, <hi>That they are reduced under a Political Government, and are afraid of the infliction of punishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. These are the main matters compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in <hi>Facius</hi> his Vision, which how true they all are, would be too much trouble to determine. But one clause, which is the third, I cannot let pass, it so nearly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the present Subject, and seeming to intercept all hopes of the Souls Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. To speak therefore to the summe of the whole business; we must either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive these aerial Philosophers to instruct <hi>Facius Cardanus</hi> as well as they could, they being guilty of nothing but a forward pride, to offer themselves as dictating O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to that doubtful Exorcist (for his son <hi>Cardan</hi> acknowledges that his Father had a form of Conjuration that a Spaniard
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:55765:278"/>
gave him at his death;) or else we must suppose them to take the liberty of equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, if not of downright lying. Now if they had a minde to inform <hi>Facius Cardanus</hi> of these things directly as they themselves thought of them, it being altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but that there appeared to them, in their aerial Regions, such sights as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the persons of men here deceased, it is impossible that they should think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then as we have described their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the fore-going Chapter, that hold there is but one Soul in the World, by which all living Creatures are actuated. Which, though but a meer possibility, if so much, yet some or other of these aerial Speculators may as well hold to it as some doe amongst us. For <hi>Pomponatius</hi> and others of the <hi>Avenroists</hi> are as ridiculously pertinacious as they. And therefore these <hi>Avenroistical Daemons</hi> answered punctually according to the Conclusions of their own School, <hi>Nihil proprium cuiquam superesse post mortem.</hi> For the Minde or Soul being a Substance common to all, and now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united from those Terrestrial Bodies which it actuated in <hi>Plato,</hi> suppose, or <hi>Socrates,</hi> and these Bodies dead and dissipated, and onely the common Soul of the World sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, there being nothing but this Soul
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:55765:278"/>
and these Bodies to make up <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato;</hi> they conclude it is a plain case, that nothing that is proper survives after death. And therefore, though they see the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> in the other World, owning also their own personali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with all the actions they did, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that befell them in this life; yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sullen subtilties and curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their School, they may think and profess, that to speak accurately and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophically it is none of them, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Substance proper to them remaining after death, but onely the Soul of the World, renewing the thoughts to her self of what appertained to those parties in this life.</p>
               <p n="12">12. This is one Hypothesis consistent enough with the veracity of these Daemons; but there is also another, not at all impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, viz. That the Vehicles of the Souls of men departed are as invisible to this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Genii</hi> that confabulated with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Cardanus</hi> as that Order is to us: and that therefore, though there be the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the Ghosts of Men deceased to them as well as to us; yet it being but for a time, it moves them no more then our confirmed <hi>Epicureans</hi> in this world are moved thereby: especially it being prone
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:55765:279"/>
for them to think that they are nothing but some ludicrous spectacles that the universal Soule of the World represents to her self and other Spectatours, when, and how long a time she pleases, and the vaporous reliques of the dead body administer occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Now that the Vehicles of the Souls of men departed this life, after they are come to a setled condition, may be farre thinner and more invisible then those of the fore-named <hi>Daemons,</hi> without committing any inconcinnity in Nature, may appear from hence: For the excellency of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spirit is not alwaies according to the consistency of the Element with which it does incorporate; otherwise those Fishes that are of humane shape, and are at set times taken in the Indian Sea, should have an<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> higher degree of Reason and Religion then we that live upon Earth, and have bodies made of that Element. Whence nothing hinders but that the Spirit of Man may be more noble then the Spirit of some of the aerial <hi>Daemons.</hi> And Nature not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies running in Arithmetical, but also it Geometrical Progression, one Remove it one may reach far above what is before it for the present in the other degrees of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression. As a creeping worm is above a cad-worm, and any four-footed beasts above
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:55765:279"/>
the birds, till they can use their leggs as well as they; but they are no sooner even with them, but they are straight far above them, and cannot onely goe, but fly. As a Peasant is above an imprison'd Prince, and has more command; but this Prince can be no sooner set free and become even with the Peasant in his liberty, but he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above him. And so it may be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with the Souls of men when they are freed from this prison of the Body, their steps being made in Geometrical Progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as soon as they seem equal to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Daemons</hi> we speak of, they may mount far above them in tenuity and subtilty of Body, and so become invisible to them; and therefore leave them in a capacity of falsly surmising that they are not at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot see them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But if they thought that there is either some particular Ray of the Soule of the World, that belongs peculiarly suppose to <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or that they had proper Souls really distinct, then it is evident that they did either equivocate or lye. Which their pride and scorn of mankinde (they looking upon us but as Beasts in comparison of themselves) might easily permit; they making no more conscience to deceive us, then we doe to put a dodge upon a dog, to
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:55765:280"/>
make our selves merry. But if they had a design to winde us into some dangerous errour, it is very likely that they would shuffle it in amongst many Truths, that those Truths being examined, and found solid at the bottome, we might not suspect any one of their dictates to be false. Wherefore this Vision being ill meant, the poison intended was, that of the Souls Mortality; the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous falseness of which opinion was to be covered by the mixture of others that are true.</p>
               <p n="14">14. As for that Relation of <hi>AEmilianus,</hi> which he heard from his Father <hi>Epitherses,</hi> it would come still more home to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if the conclusion of the Philologers at Rome, after <hi>Thamus</hi> had been sent for, and averred the truth thereof to <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> could be thought authentick, namely, that this <hi>Pan,</hi> the news of whose death <hi>Thamus</hi> told to the <hi>Daemons</hi> at <hi>Palodes,</hi> was the Son of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Penelope;</hi> for then 'tis plain that <hi>Pan</hi> was an humane Soule, and therefore concerns the present question more nearly. But this Narration being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to a more sacred and venerable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it looses so much of its force and fitness for the present use. That which <hi>Demetrius</hi> adds, concerning certain Holy Islands neare <hi>Britain,</hi> had been more fit in this regard.
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:55765:280"/>
Whither when <hi>Demetrius</hi> came, suddainly upon his arrival there happened a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the air, mighty tempests &amp; prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious whirlwinds. After the ceasing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Inhabitants pronounced, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That some of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more then humane was dead.</hi> Upon which <hi>Plutarch,</hi> according to his usual Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, descants after this manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>As the lightning of a lamp brings no grievance with it, but the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it is offensive to many; sogreat Souls, while they remain kindled into life, shine forth harmlesly and benignly, but their extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or corruption often stirs up windes and tempests, as in this present example, and often infects the aire with pestilential annoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. But the last Testimony is the most unexceptionable, though the least preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be infallible, and seems to strike dead both waies. For whether the Souls of men that goe out of these earthly bodies be vertuous or vitious, they must die to their
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:55765:281"/>
                  <hi>AErial</hi> Vehicles. Which seems a sad story at first sight, and as if Righteousness could not deliver from Death. But if it be more carefully perused, the terrour will be found onely to concern the Wicked. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest pitch of Death is the Descent into this Terrestrial Body, in which, besides that we necessarily forget whatever is past, we doe for the present lead <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a dark and obscure life,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaks, dragging this weight of Earth along with us, as Prisoners and Malefactours doe their heavy shackles in their sordid and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluse confinements. But in our return back from this state, Life is naturally more large to them that are prepared to make good use of that advantage they have of their <hi>Aiery Vehicle.</hi> But if they be not masters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in that state, they will be fatally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded back to their former Prison in process of time; which is the most gross Death imaginable. But for the Good and vertuous Souls, that after many Ages change their <hi>AErial Vehicle</hi> for an <hi>AEthereal</hi> one, that is no Death to them, but an higher ascent into life. And a man may as well say of an Infant, that has left the dark Wombe of his Mother, that this change of his is Death, as that a <hi>Genius</hi> dies by leaving the gross Aire, and emerging into that Vehicle
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:55765:281"/>
of Light, which they ordinarily call <hi>AEthereal</hi> or <hi>Coelestial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. There may be therefore, by Axiome 36. a dangerous relapse out of the <hi>AErial</hi> Vehicle into the <hi>Terrestrial,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Death of the Soule that is thus retrograde. But for those that ever reach the <hi>AEthereal state,</hi> the periods of life there are infinite; &amp; though they may have their <hi>Perige's</hi> as well as <hi>Apoge's,</hi> yet these Circuits being of so vast a compass, and their <hi>Perige</hi>'s so rare and short, and their return as certain to their former <hi>Apsis,</hi> as that of the Coelestial Bodies, and their <hi>athereal</hi> sense never lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in their lowest touches towards the Earth; it is manifest that they have arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to that life that is justly styled <hi>Eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. Whence it is plain, that perseverance in Vertue, if no <hi>external Fate</hi> hinder, will carry Man to an <hi>Immortal life.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those that be thus <hi>Heroically good,</hi> be so by discipline and endeavour, or <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. AS for the External impediments, we shall now examine them, and see of what force they will be, and whether they be at all. The former of which is the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of the World.</hi> Which is an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Opinion, believed and entertain'd, not onely by Religious, but by Philosophers also, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> especially, who affirm that the Souls of Men doe subsist indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, but cannot continue any longer in being then to the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the World.

<pb n="526" facs="tcp:55765:283"/>
the condition indeed of the Souls of Men and <hi>Daemons</hi> after that sad Fate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Those that will not have the World eternal have found out two ways to destroy it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by <hi>Water</hi> or by <hi>Fire.</hi> Which, they say, does as naturally happen in a vast Period of Time, which they call <hi>Annus magnus,</hi> as Winter and Summer doe in our ordinary year. <hi>Inundatio non se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus quam Hyems, quam AEstas lege Mundi venit.</hi> But for this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it not being so famous, nor so frequently spoken of, nor so destructive, nor so likely to end the World as the other way, nor belonging so properly to our enquiry, we shall let it pass. The general Prognostick is concerning <hi>Fire</hi> now, not onely of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> as <hi>Zeno, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes, Chrysippus, Seneca;</hi> but of several also of different Sects, as <hi>Heraclitus, Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Cicero, Pliny, Aristocles, Numenius,</hi> and sundry others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But though there be so great and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous consent that the World shall be burnt, yet they doe not express themselves all alike in the business. <hi>Seneca</hi>'s vote is the most madly explicite of any, making the very Stars run and dash one against another, and so set all on fire.

<pb n="527" facs="tcp:55765:283"/>
                  <hi>Stoicks</hi> did. For the destroying of the <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal</hi> Regions by <hi>Fire</hi> is as foolish a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as the sentencing of the Eele to be drown'd, because the matter of the <hi>AEther</hi> is too fine and subtile for <hi>Fire</hi> to rage in, it being indeed nothing but a pure. light or fire it self. And yet this <hi>AEthereal</hi> Matter is infinitely the greatest portion of the World. Wherefore the World cannot be said properly to be lyable to the destruction of Fire from any natural causes, as the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> would have it. Which is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively true upon <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his Principles, who makes Fire nothing but the motion of certain little particles of Matter, and holds that there is no more motion at one time in the World then at another; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one part of the Matter cannot impress any agitation upon another, but it must lose so much it self. This hideous noise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the World must be restrain'd to the firing of the <hi>Earth</hi> onely, so farre as it concerns us.

For their nature is so simple that they cannot corrupt, and therefore want no renovation, as the Earth does. Nor do the Inhabitants of those heavenly Regions defile themselves with any vice; or if they doe, they sink from their material station as well as moral, and fall towards these ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial dreggs.

We are willing then to be born down, by this common and loud cry of Fire that must burn the World, into an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Earth may within a certain Period of time be burnt, with all those things that are upon it or near it. But what concurse of natural causes may contribute to this dismal spectacle, is not proper for me to dispute, especially in this place. I shall onely take a view of what sad effects this <hi>Conflagration</hi> may have upon the Souls of <hi>Daemons</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> For that those those that
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:55765:284"/>

               <p n="6">6. The most certain and most destra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive execution that this Fire will doe, must be upon the unrecovered Souls of Wicked <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Daemons;</hi> those that are so deeply sunk and drown'd <gap reason="foreign">

These Souls or Spirits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that have so inextricably entangled themselves in the Fate of this lower World, giving up all their Senses to the momentany pleasures of the moist luxurious Principle, which is the very seat of Death, these, in the mystical Philosophy of the Ancients, are the Nymphs, to whom though they allot a long Series of years, yet they doe not exempt them from mortality and fate. And <hi>Demetrius</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> pronounces expresly out of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> that their life will be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the World, from what the Poet intimates <hi>AEnigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi>

But to leave these Poetical Riddles, and take a more serious and distinct view of the condition of the Soul after the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration</hi> of the Earth; we shall finde five several sorts of Opinions concerning it. The first hold, <hi>That this unmerciful heat and fire will at last destroy and consume the Soul as well as the Body.</hi> But this seems to me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that any created Substance should utterly destroy another Substance, so as to reduce it to nothing. For no part of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, acting the most furiously upon another part thereof, does effect that. It can onely attenuate, dissipate and disperse the parts, and make them invisible. But the Substance of the Soul is <hi>indissipable</hi> and <hi>indiscerpible,</hi> and therefore remains entire, whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Body or Vehicle.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The second Opinion is, <hi>That after long and tedious torture in these flames, the Soul by a special act of Omnipotency is annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</hi> But, me thinks, this is to put Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence too much to her shifts, as if God were so brought to a plunge in his creating a Creature of it self immortal, that he must be fain to uncreate it again, that is to say to annihilate it. Besides that that divine <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:55765:285"/>
that lies within the compass of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, never supposes any such forcible eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of the Deity into extraordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but that all things are brought about by a wise and infallible or inevitable train of secondary Causes, whether natural or free Agents.</p>

               <p n="10">10. A fourth sort therefore of Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors there is, who conceive that after this
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:55765:286"/>
solution of the Souls or Spirits of Wicked <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Daemons</hi> from their Vehicles, <hi>That their pain is continued to them even in that separate state, they falling into an unquiet sleep, full of furious tormenting Dreams, that act as fiercely upon their Spirits, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Fire did upon their Bodies.</hi> But others except against this Opinion as a very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conjecture, it supposing that which to them seems not so sound, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul can act when it has lost all vital Union with the Matter; which seems repugnant with that so intimate and essential aptitude it has to be united therewith. And the Dreams of the Soul in the Body are not transacted without the help of the Animal Spirits in the Brain, they usually symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with their temper. Whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is no certain ground to establish this Opinion upon.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The last therefore, to make all sure, that there may be no inconvenience in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that the Souls or Spirits as well of evil <hi>Daemons</hi> as wicked <hi>Men,</hi> disjoyned from their Vehicles by the force of that fatal <hi>Conflagration,</hi> may subsist, have excogitated an odde and unexpected Hypothesis, <hi>That when this firing of the World has done due execution upon that unfortunate Crue, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and direful torture has we aried their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficted

Ghosts into an utter recess from all Matter, and thereby into a profound sleep or death; that after a long Series of years, when not onely the fury of the Fire is utterly slaked, but that vast Atmosphere of smoak and vapours, which was sent up during the time of the Earths Conflagration, has returned back in copious showres of rain</hi> (which will again make Seas and Rivers, will binde and consolidate the ground, and, falling exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentifully all over, make the soil plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and fruitful, and the Aire cool and wholsome) <hi>that Nature recovering thus to her advantage, and becoming youthful again, and full of genital salt and moisture, the Souls of all living Creatures belonging to these lower Regions of the Earth and Aire will awaken orderly in their proper places.</hi> The Seas and Rivers will be again repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with Fish; the Earth will send forth all manner of Fowls, four-footed Beasts, and creeping things; and the Souls of Men also shall then catch life from the more pure and balsamick parts of the Earth, and be clothed again in terrestrial Bodies; and lastly, the AErial <hi>Genii,</hi> that Element be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming again wholsome and vital, shall, in due order and time, awaken and revive in the cool rorid Aire. Which Expergera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into life is accompanied, say they, with

propensions answerable to those resolutions they made with themselves in those fiery torments, and with which they fell into their long sleep.</p>

We see therefore how desperately undemonstrable the condition of the Soule is after the Conflagration of the Earth, all these five Opinions being accompanied with so much lubricity and uncertainty.

               <p n="15">15. All that we can be assured of is, that those Souls that have obtained their <hi>aethereal Vehicles</hi> are out of the reach of that sad fate that followes this Conflagration; and that
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:55765:288"/>
the wicked Souls of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Daemons</hi> will be involved in it. But there are a middle sort betwixt these, concerning whom not onely curiosity but good will would make a man sollicitous. For it is possible, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration</hi> of the World may surprise many thousands of Souls, that neither the course of Time, nor Nature, nor any higher Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple has wrought up into an <hi>AEthereal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi> of life, but yet may be very holy, innocent and vertuous. Which we may easily believe, if we consider that these very Earthly Bodies are not so great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the goodness and sincerity of the Minde, but that many, even in this life, have given great examples thereof. Nor can that AErial state be less capable of, nor wel be without, the <hi>good Genii,</hi> no more then the Earth without good men, who are the most immediate Ministers of the Goodness and Justice of God. But exemption from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fates in the world is not alwaies entailed upon <hi>Innocency,</hi> but most ordinarily upon <hi>natural power.</hi> And therefore there may be numbers of the good Genii, and of very holy and innocuous Spirits of men departed, the consistency of whose Vehicles may be such, that they can no more quit these aerial Regions, then we can fly into them, that have heavy bodies, without wings. To say
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:55765:289"/>
nothing of those vertuous and pious men that may haply be then found alive, and so be liable to be overtaken by this storm of fire. Undoubtedly, unless there appear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the approach of this fate, some visible <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>Jupiter Sospitator,</hi> as the heathens would call him, they must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be involved in the ruine of the wicked. Which would be a great eye-sore in that exact and irreprehensible frame of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that all men promise to themselves who acknowledge that there is a God. Wherefore according to the light of Reason, there must be some supernatural means to rescue those innocuous and benign Spirits out of this common calamity. But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the manner of it here how it must be done, would be to entitle natural Light and Philosophy to greater abilities then they are guilty of; and therefore that Subject must be reserved for its proper place.</p>

been, at certain times, such near offers in Nature towards this sad accident already. <hi>Pliny,</hi> though he instances but in one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet speaks of it as a thing that several times comes to pass. <hi>Fiunt,</hi> saith he, <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giosi &amp; longiores solis defectus, qualis occiso Dictatore Caesare, &amp; Antoniano bello, totius anni pallore continuo.</hi> The like happened in <hi>Justinians</hi> time, as <hi>Cedrenus</hi> writes; when, for a whole year together, the Sun was of a very dim and duskish hue, as if he had been in a perpetuall Eclipse. And in the time of <hi>Irene</hi> the Empress it was so dark for seventeen dayes together, that the ships lost their way on the sea, and were ready to run against one another, as <hi>Theophanes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. But the late accurate discovery of the spots of the Sun by <hi>Shiner,</hi> and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and disappearing of fixt Stars, and the excursions of Comets into the remoter parts of our <hi>Vortex,</hi> as also the very intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal contexture of that admirable Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> doe argue it more then possible that, after some vast periods of time, the Sun may be so inextricably inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped by the <hi>Maculae</hi> that he is never free from, that he may quite loose his light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Preambles of which <hi>Extinction</hi> will be very hideous, and intolerable to all the Inhabitants of the Planets in our <hi>Vortex,</hi> if
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:55765:290"/>
the Planets have then any Inhabitants at all. For this defect of light and heat coming on by degrees, must needs weary out poor mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals with heavy languishments, both for want of the comfort of the usual warmth of the Sun, whereby the Bodies of men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, and also by reason of his inability to ripen the fruits of the Soile; whence necessarily must follow Famine, Plagues, Sicknesses, and at length an utter devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and destruction of both <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Beasts.</hi> Nor can the <hi>AErial Daemons</hi> scape free, but that the <hi>vital tye</hi> to their Vehicles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily confining them to their several <hi>Atmospheres,</hi> they will be inevitably impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned in more then <hi>Cimmerian</hi> darkness. For the <hi>Extinction</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> will put out the light of all their <hi>Moons,</hi> and nothing but Ice, and Frost, and flakes of Snow, and thick mists, as palpable as that of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> will possess the Regions of their habitation. Of which sad spectacle though those twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eyes of heaven, the Stars, might be compassionate spectatours; yet they cannot send out one ray of light to succour or visit them, their tender and remote beams not being able to pierce, much less to dissipate, the clammy and stiff consistency of that long and fatal Night.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore calling our mind off from
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:55765:291"/>
so dismal a sight, let us place it upon a more hopeful Object; and consider the condition of those Souls that have arrived to their <hi>AEthereal Vehicle,</hi> and see how far this fate can take hold of them. And it is plain at first sight, that they are out of the reach of this misty dungeon, as being already mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the secure mansions of the purer <hi>AEther.</hi> The worst that can be imagined of them is, that they may finde themselves in a condition something like that of ours when we walk out in a clear, starlight, frosty night, which to them that are sound is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a pleasure then offence. And if we can beare it with some delight in these Earthly Bodies, whose parts will grow hard and stiff for want of due heat, it can prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a new modification of tactual pleasure to those <hi>AEthereal Inhabitants,</hi> whose bodies are not constipated as ours, but are themselves a kinde of agile light and fire. All that can be conceived is, that the spherical particles of their Vehicles may stand a little more closely and firmly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether then usual, whence the triangular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals being more straight, the subtilest ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will move something more quick in them, which will raise a sense of greater vigour and alacrity then usual. So little formidable is this fate to them in this regard.</p>

4. But their light, you'l say, will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured, the Sun being put out, whose shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning seems to concern the <hi>Gods</hi> as well as <hi>Men,</hi> as <hi>Homer</hi> would intimate,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</l>
                  </q>
But I answer, that that of <hi>Homer</hi> is chiefly to be understood of the <hi>AErial Daemons,</hi> not the <hi>AEthereal Deities,</hi> who can turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a pure actual Light when they please. So that there is no fear but that their personal converse will be as chearful and distinct as before, white letters being as legible upon black paper as black upon white. But this is to suppose them in the dark, which they are not, but in a more soft and mild light, which is but a change of pleasure, as it is to see the Moon shine fair into a roome after the putting out of the Candle. And certainly the contribution of the light of the Stars is more to their quick and tender Senses, then the clearest Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine night is to ours; though we should suppose them no nearer any Star then we are. But such great changes as these may have their conveniences for such as Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will favour, as well as their inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences. And the <hi>Extinction</hi> of our <hi>Sun</hi> may be the Augmentation of Light in some Star of a neighbouring <hi>Vortex.</hi> Which
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:55765:292"/>
though it may not be able to pierce those <hi>Cimmerian</hi> Prisons I spake of before, yet it may give sufficient light to these <hi>Spirits</hi> that are free. Besides that the Discerption and spoil of our <hi>Vortex,</hi> that will then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, will necessarily bring us very much nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Centre of some other, whose Star will administer sufficient light to the AEthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real <hi>Genii,</hi> though it be too weak to relieve the AErial. And that so remote a distance from these central Luminaries of the <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> is consistent with the perfectest happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we may discern partly, in that the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Matter above <hi>Saturn,</hi> till the very marge of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> is more strongly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated then that betwixt him and the Sun, and therefore has less need of the Suns beams to conserve its agility and liquidity; and partly, in that those huge vast Regions of <hi>Aither</hi> would be lost, and in vain in a manner, if they were not frequented by <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal Inhabitants,</hi> which in all reason and likelihood are of the noblest kinde, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of their Element. And therefore all the <hi>AEthereal</hi> People may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire thither upon such an exigency as this, and there rest secure in joy and happiness, in these true <hi>Intermundia Deorum</hi> which <hi>Epicurus</hi> dream'd of.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Which we may easily admit, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:55765:292"/>
the grand Priviledges of the <hi>AEthereal Vehicle,</hi> wherein so great a power of the Soul is awakened, that she can moderate the motion of the particles thereof as she plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, by adding or diminishing the degrees of agitation, Axiome 32. whereby she is also able to temper the solidity thereof, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this contemperation of her Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, to ascend or descend in the <hi>Vortex</hi> as she lists her self, and that with a great variety of swiftness, according to her own pleasure. By the improvement of which Priviledge she may also, if she please, pass from one <hi>Vortex</hi> into another, and receive the warmth of a new <hi>Vesta,</hi> so that no fate imaginable shall be ever able to lay hold upon her.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor will this be any more labour to her, then sailing down the stream. For she, having once fitted the agitation and solidity of her <hi>Vehicle</hi> for her celestial voiage, will be as naturally carried whither she is bound, as a stone goes downward, or the fire upward. So that there is no fear of any lassitude, no more then by being rowed in a Boat, or carried in a Sedan. For the celestial Matter that environs her Vehicle, works her upward or downward, toward the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre or from the Centre of a <hi>Vortex,</hi> at its own proper pains and charges. Lastly, such is the tenuity and subtilty of the Senses of
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:55765:293"/>
the <hi>AEthereal</hi> Inhabitants, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision and sagacity must be, beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, above that of ours, besides that there will be warnings and premonitions of this future disaster, both many, and those very visible and continued, before the Sun shall fail so far, as that they shall at all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in his decay; so that the least blast of misfortune shall never be able to blow upon them, nor the least evil imaginable overtake them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This is a small glance at the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Providence, whose fetches are so large, and Circuits so immense, that they may very well seem utterly incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the <hi>Incredulous</hi> and <hi>Idiots,</hi> who are exceeding prone to think that all things will ever be as they are, and desire they should be so: though it be as rude and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, as if one that comes into a <hi>Bad,</hi> and is taken much with the first Dance he sees, would have none danced but that, or have them move no further one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they did when he first came into the room; whenas they are to trace nearer one another, or further off, according to the measures of the Musick, and the law of the Dance they are in. And the whole Matter of the Universe, and all the parts thereof, are ever upon Motion, and in such a Dance,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:55765:293"/>
as whose traces backwards and forwards take a vast compass; and what seems to have made the longest stand, must again move, according to the modulations and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of that Musick, that is indeed out of the hearing of the acutest ears, but yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible by the purest Minds and the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest Wits. The truth whereof none would dare to oppose, if the breath of the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer could but tell its own story, and declare through how many <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Vortices</hi> it has been strained, before the particles thereof met, to be abused to the framing of so rash a contradiction.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We have now finisht our whole <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> the summary result whereof is this; That there is an incorporeal Substance, and that in Man, which we call his Soul. That this Soul of his subsists and acts after the death of his Body, and that usually first in an AErial Vehicle, as other <hi>Daemons</hi> doe; wherein she is not quite exempt from fate, but is then perfect and secure, when she has obtain'd her <hi>AEthereal</hi> one, she being then out of the reach of that evil Principle, whose dominion is commensurable with misery and death. Which power the <hi>Persian Magi</hi> termed <hi>Arimanius,</hi> and resembled him to <hi>Darkness,</hi> as the other good Principle, which they called <hi>Oromazes,</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> styling one

Of which there can be no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that will prove allowable, but an adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of those two grand parts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the one working in the <hi>Demoniacal,</hi> the other in the <hi>Divine</hi> Orders. Betwixt which natures there is perpetually more or less strife and contest, both inwardly and outwardly. But if <hi>Theopompus</hi> his prophecy be true in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who was initiated into these <hi>Arcana,</hi> the power of the <hi>Benign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> will get the upper hand at last, <gap reason="foreign">

And therefore that Oracle is then fulfilled, when the Soul has ascended into that condition we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready described, in which alone it is out of the reach of <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Mortality.</hi>

to adorn their memory after death; but is so high a Priviledge of the Soul of Man, that meer <hi>Political</hi> vertues, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> calls them, can never advance her to that pitch of Happiness. Either Philosophy, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more sacred then Philosophy, must be her Guide to so transcendent a condition. And not being curious to dispute, whether the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> ever arrived to it by living according to the precepts of their Master, I shall notwithstanding with confidence averre, that what they aimed at, is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limest felicity our nature is capable of; and being the utmost Discovery this <hi>Treatise</hi> could pretend to, I shall conclude all with a <hi>Distich</hi> of theirs (which I have elswhere ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of upon like occasion) it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the furthest scope, not onely of their Philosophy, but of this present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.

The difficulty of reconciling Free-will with Divine Presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Prophecies. 16. That the faculty of Free-will is seldome put in use. 17. That the use of it is properly in Moral conflict. 18. That the Soul is not invincible there neither. 19. That Divine decrees either finde fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments or make them. 20. That the more exact we make Divine Prescience, even to the comprehension of any thing that implies no contradiction in it self to be comprehended, the
