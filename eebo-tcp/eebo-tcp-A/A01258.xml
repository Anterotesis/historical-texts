         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Iuers men finding them ſelues in like
daunger, may better iudge each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
caſe, then any one that hath not
experimented the like, as for example,
no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can better iudge of the charges
and expences that a man hath bene at
in the purſute of ſome proceſſe, then
he that hath bene at the like.</p>
            <p>This doe I ſay, Syr, ſith there is nothing more daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
then ſclaunder, and that no man can better iudge of
the peruerſneſſe thereof, then ſuch as haue both taſted and
tryed it. So it is that the Reformed Princes haue bene ſclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the Pope, vvho hath noted them of hereſie: and in
my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your Maieſtie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beſt iudge of the iniurie done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, as hauing in your ſelfe tried the sharpneſſe of the
dartes of ſclander, for your Maieſtie haue vvith the like
dartes bene atteinted, no leſſe pernitiouſly and maliciouſly
then the Reformed Princes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that the ſclander rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vpon your Maieſtie, vvas both vndirect and ſecret, but
the ſame vvherevvith the Reformed Princes are charged,
is open. Novv is it a plaine caſe, that a ſecret enemy is more
daungerous then an open, and ſo conſequently they that haue
touched your Maieſtie vvith ſuch a ſclander, bearing you
invvard malice, are moſt dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous enemies. The ſclander
vvherevvith the Pope hath charged the Reformed Princes
<pb facs="tcp:2815:3"/>
is vvell enough knovven, and the aunſvvere thereto, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ther
vvith their iuſt defence, shall in my opinion, be
peremptorily enough intreated of in this preſent Treatiſe.
But the ſclaunder vvherevvith the Pope doth charge your
Maieſtie deſerueth the laying open, becauſe that being both
ſecret and indirect, it hath neuertheleſſe a more venimous
tayle then the tayle of a Scorpion, and of the ſame nature: for
the vvound can hardly be cured, but by the death of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
If the Pope could haue burdened your Maieſtie vvith
hereſie, it is euident that he vvould not haue ſpared you: but
your Maieſtie, haue alvvayes bene ſo good a Catholick, that
he could not accuſe you of hereſie, but he muſt firſt haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
him ſelfe, and therefore ſeeing that vvay vvould
not ſerue, he hath ſought out an other: for vnder hand he
hath ſpread abroad ſundry brutes &amp; nevves, importing that
your Maieſtie do fauour hereticks, and haue about you thoſe
that take part vvith heretickes, and theſe rumors hath he
diſperſed, not onely in France, but through all Italie, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and other places. Novv therfore let your Maieſtie iudge
vvhat an impreſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this may leaue in the harts of the people,
and vvhat a conſequence this action dravveth after it, your
Maieſtie may thereby read in the hartes of the Pope &amp; the
League, &amp; turning the leafe neuer ſo little, may knovv their
driftes, togither vvith the conſequence of the matter: That
is, that the Pope ſeeketh firſt to vveaken the part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that it may ſtand as an 0 in algoriſme, and next
to bring in the Councill of Trent and the Inquiſition, ſo to
authoriſe the League euen aboue your Maieſtie, ſo as no
man may ſpeake amiſſe of the Pope or the League, but he
shall ſodenly be caſt into priſon: and that once brought to
paſſe, the next muſt be to lay hands vpon your ſelfe, and bury
you in ſome Monaſterie: I ſay burie, becauſe ſo you shall dye
<pb facs="tcp:2815:3"/>
double in this vvorld: and by and by raiſe ſpeaches accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the impreſsions afore mentioned, that your Maieſtie
hauing fauored the heretickes, are by his holineſſe depoſed
from the crovvne, and the Cardinall of Bourbon declared
next, but vnmeet for ſucceſsion, and therefore that he vvill
ſet vp ſuch a one of the League as shall be at his deuotion:
this I ſay vvill he doe, if your Maieſtie take not the better
heede, and prouide not in time for it. Neither shall he doe
any thing that hath not already bene done to your predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours,
vvhoſe estates the Popes haue troubled, vvhen there
vvas no ſpeach of Reformation, but onely vpon mallice that
they bare to the priuiledges of the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch Church. And alſo
albeit your Maieſtie should shake of the Popes yoke, yet
should you doe nothing but vvhat your predeceſſours haue
ſought to do, vvitneſse the Pragmaticall Sanction, neither
shall it be any noueltie in Fraunce. The hatred alſo that the
Pope beareth to your Maieſtie, is the ſame that he hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
against your predeceſſours, euen for their priuiledges,
therefore he vvould vvillingly haue in France ſuch a king
as might be his creature, ſo that his driftes are as preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to the Clergie, as pernitious to your perſon, and vvhether
they be hurtfull to the people, let the preſent troubles declare.
For the people had bene at reſt, had not the League troubled
all Fraunce, and therefore it is a matter that concerneth all,
neither is there any other meanes to remedie it, but by sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Popes yoke, your predeceſſours haue done it for a
ſmaller matter, not in reſpect of Reformation, neither did
king Henry the viij. in England shake it for Reformation,
but for his ſtate: And this I vvill aduovv that the libertie
and puritie of the Councell of Nice, vvhich vve doe craue, is
better for France and the ſtate thereof, then the yoke of the
Tridentine Councell that the League requireth. I call it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
<pb facs="tcp:2815:4"/>
becauſe in the time of the Nicene Councell there
vvas no Popish yoke and puritie, for that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there vvas no
ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But albeit your Maieſtie vvill not come neare
to that point, yet can you not eſcape the Popes ſuperſtitious
practiſes, but by renouncing the Papacie, after the example
of your predeceſſours deſires, and as king Henry the eight
of England put in effect, not for Reformation, but for the
state. For it is moſt certaine that the Pope hath no povver
to hurt any, but his ovvne faction, or ſuch as haue any dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vvith him: but to thoſe that haue forſaken him, his
poyſon is ſpit, his povver to hurt is ended, and his endeuors
are quayled and made of no effect. Had king Henry of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
ſtill follovved him, he vvould either by guile, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
or croiſades, haue thundered againſt him, but
hauing caſt him of, the Pope might like a Cerberus vvith
his three heades crovvned vvith three crovvnes, haue bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at him, but byte he could not. The like vvill it be
vvith all that forſake him, vvell he may barke, but not
byte, your Maieſtie may knovv vvhat difference there
is betvveene the fidelitie of the Reformed, and the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
of the League: The Reformed vvill dye in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:
but the Pope by the League, ſeeketh to make your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
odious to your ſubiectes, and to other Princes and
people about you, by miniſtring vnto them ſuch vvicked
impreſsions by their ſecret ſclaunders. It is a goodly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to knovv vvhom to trust, and vvhom to take heede of,
neither vvonder I but at one thing, vvhich is, that the
Sorboniſtes hauing afore time denounced a Pope an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
that the Clergie haue not as yet declared this a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke,
for raiſing ſo great a ſchiſme in Europe, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for stirring vp the ſubiectes against their king in
Fraunce. I vvill not any further dilate vpon theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:2815:4"/>
vvhich are ſufficiently knovven to your Maieſtie,
and Kinges loue breuitie. I haue no more to ſay, but to pray
vnto the Lord to bleſſe and proſper your Crovvne, and to
make your ſcepter to ſprout, florishe and bring forth fruict
as he did thoſe of Ezechias and Ioſias. From London this
12. of December. 1588.</p>

rule haue we out of this heauenly orchard gathered fruicts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitorie,
inſtructiue, Deuine and Politicke, which are ſundry
reaſons of diuers ſortes, whereof ſome be admonitorie, others
inſtructiue ſome Deuine, and others Politick as hauing reſpect
to the diuers iudgementes of men, of whom ſome may be led
and kept in awe with ſimple admonition, where others require
ſomewhat of greater force for their better inſtructions, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

likewiſe of Mary Magdalenes diſpoſition,<note place="margin">Luc. 10. 42.</note> ſuch as choſe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

others againe do reſemble Martha, whoſe hartes are ſet vpon
the affaires of this world, &amp; to thoſe muſt we deliuer reaſons of
Pollicie,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> and after the example of S. Paule, giue milk to ſuch as
can not brook any other foode, and ſtronger meat to thoſe that
haue ſtronger ſtomacke Neither are Politick reaſons vtterly to
be diſdained ſith God him ſelfe vouchſafed to eſtabliſh a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
gouernement in Iſraell, as well as to inſtruct the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
And if any perſon be vncapable of higher matters,
and neuertheleſſe may be brought by Politicke reaſons to doe
his duetie, why ſhall we forbeare to inſtruct him by ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as he is moſt capable of? And therefore haue we forborne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2815:6"/>
nothing that we haue thought might ſeeme to induce men to
the knowledge of the truth, and the performance of their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yea we are perſwaded that we haue brought a fruict of no
ſmall conſequence to all Europe, in that we ſhew by reaſons
aſwell Deuine as Politick, that the truth whereof we here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
is both fit for the conſcience, and commodious to the
ſtate: which neuertheſſe is a matter contrary to the opinions of
many, who haue accoumpted the truth to be in deede conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to the conſcience, but hurtfull to the ſtate and the reaſon
that led them ſo to iudge, was becauſe they iudged but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
of matters depending vpon the truth, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
do no leſſe mainteine Pollicie in the generall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of a people, then conſcience in the perſon of euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:
and therefore we will deuide this preſent Treatiſe into
two partes, whereof the one ſhall be diſcuſſed by reaſons The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall,
the other by reaſons Politicall, which Treatiſe we do
name <hi>The Reformed Politick,</hi> becauſe that in the ſame we doe
mainteine Reformation for the moſt part by Politick reaſons,
albeit we hope ſhortly to ſecond it with Deuine, concerning
Church gouernement, to the end to ſtrengthen that part which
ſeemeth the weaker, albeit of it ſelfe it be ſtrong enough.</p>
               <p>Nothing in the olde ſerpent is more ancient then lying,<note place="margin">2</note>
whereof he is the father,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12 9.</note> neither is there any thing more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to Satan then ſclander,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. 44.</note> whereupon he is called the Deuill,
that is, a ſclanderer. The obiect alſo of his ſclander is no other
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God and his Church,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 26</note> for vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what reaſon ſhould he ſclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his owne? ſo ſhould he oppoſe him ſelfe againſt him ſelfe,
and worke his owne deſtruction, ſo as his kingdome could not
ſtand. But he is not aſhamed to ſclander God, and to gaineſay
his worde:<note place="margin">Gen. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27.</note> for when God ſaid to Adam, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye the
death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> he feared not to contrary him, ſaying, <hi>No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſhall not dye
the death,</hi> ſo that albeit this ſpeach of Satan was not in euery
reſpect contradictorie to Gods, yet was it his intent to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
God. For the meaning of Gods words ſtretched to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death, whereof man made him ſelfe guiltie the ſelfe ſame
day that he tranſgreſſed Gods commandement: but Satan
aymed onely at the bodily death: neither imagined he that God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2815:7"/>
had ſpoken of any other death, and therfore meant by contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that point to make God a lyer, and not that onely, but alſo
to bring of God into ſuſpition of enuie, as vnder hand taxing
him to enuie mans felicitie, as if God had forbidden man the
eating of the tree of good and euill, for feare leaſt he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like vnto God, by the knowledge of good and euill. As
for our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, it is not to be doubted but the deuill
hath ſclandered him. For what greater ſclander would any man
haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſclanderouſly to put him to death? So that if Satan en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into Iudas togither with the ſoppe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 13. 27</note> to the end to cauſe him
to bring his treaſon to effect, who doubteth but he had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
quoifed the Scribes and Phariſeis, to make them enterpriſe
the death of the ſonne of God? which being ſo, who can doubt
but thoſe goodly titles that the Phariſeis gaue to our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, were forged in the ſame ſhop and by the ſame work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note>
who charged our Lord that by Beelzebub the Prince of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
he caſt out deuils? If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he durſt ſo ſhameleſly ſet him ſelfe
againſt God &amp; his only ſonne, is it any maruell that he dare ſet
vpon men the ſeruants of God, bruting abroad in all places, that
the faithfull which ſerue God vnder the puritie of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are heretickes? We are therefore to know that as to Satan
there is nothing more familier then to ſclander God, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
and his faithfull members: ſo is there nothing more familiar
to the faithfull, then to ſee them ſelues ſclandered by the old
ſerpent and his angels, which are his members and ſuppoſts.
And this is ſo familiar and ordinarie to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there neede no
example. For we know what ſclanders and perſecutions Gods
people haue endured by ſtrangers, and the Prophetes by their
brethren, in ſo much that it is written, that no Prophet hath
bene put to death but in Hieruſalem. And this teacheth vs that
euen ſuch as in outward profeſſion ſeeme to be Gods people,
do for the moſt part perſecute Gods elect, and thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he
will ſanctifie, and ſeparate from the broad way that leadeth to
deſtruction. For as they that among the Iſraelites ſacrificed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Baal, did perſecute them which bowed not vnto him, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo
in the Church which is termed Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they that folow like ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions,
do perſecute thoſe that will not cleaue to the ſame.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2815:7"/>
For this cauſe in the Apocalypſe the Church which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a woman enuironed with the ſunne,<note place="margin">Apoc. 18.</note> crowned with 12.
ſtarres, ſtanding vpon the moone, is notably ſaid to be ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wilderneſſe by the two winges of the great eagle. Which
great eagle hath relation to the Romaine Empire and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances
thereof, as is the Papacie, which hath brought this
woman into the wilderneſſe, where being, ſhe is compared to a
mightie harlot holding a cup full of the abhomination of her
whoredomes, which are the ſuperſtitions that ſeparate vs from
the deſolate woman, and repleniſhed with the bloud of the
Martyrs, which hath bene ſhed becauſe they would not cleaue
to theſe ſuperſtitions. Euen as the Idolatrous Church of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
perſecuted the true faithfull which ſerued God in pureneſſe,
ſo alſo the deſolate and ſuperſtitious Church amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
doth perſecute the faithfull, that ſeeke to ſerue God purely
and without ſuperſtition. But withall the examples of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience
of the faithfull in old tyme ſhould be vnto vs a miror of
pacience: and the promiſes of our deliuerance which God hath
made vs, ought to be as it were oyle to refreſh the lampe of our
hope, as alſo theſe fatherly corrections ſhould be a teſtimonie
vnto vs, that God accompteth vs his children, to the end that
we walke worthely, as children of ſuch a father, ſeparating our
ſelues from the vanitie and frowardneſſe of the world, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the truth in abandoning vanitie: and ſeeking to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the world by that faith, which is the victorie, arming our
faith with charitie, zeale, ſinceritie, truth and the feare of God.
Now the cauſe why we ſee that the faithfull are ordinarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,
not onely by ſtrangers, but alſo by thoſe that aduow
them ſelues to be the people of God, and of his Church, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that in the Church there be both of the children of Agar
and of the children of Sara, and the children of Agar do vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſpiſe and perſecute the children of Sara: albeit to their own
harmes. And Iacob alſo was an exile 20. yeares in a forem land,
for feare of his brother Eſau: ſo doe we ordinarily ſee in the
Church of God, that they that are borne after the fleſh doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
thoſe that are borne after the promiſe, appertaining to
Gods election. The aduerſaries of the Reformation do ſay that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2815:8"/>
the Reformed are heretickes, whereto I aunſwere, that reaſon
maketh the man, &amp; truth the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To ſpeake without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is not the part of a man, but to bable: and to ſpeake againſt
the truth, by charging any one in that which concerneth the
conſcience, is to ſclander, and it is the deuils rhetorick. Chriſtian
Religion is not built vpon auctoritie but vpon truth, not vpon
the auctoritie of men but vpon the truth that is of God: If the
aduerſaries of Reformation ſhould be driuen to proue their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
by reaſon and truth, they would be ſhreudly troubled,
and we may plainly ſay that they could not do it: becauſe that
either they are ignorant wherein Reformation doth conſiſt, or
if they know they can not taxe it of hereſie without ſpeaking
againſt their owne conſciences, and therefore we will entreat
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this point, to the end that in few wordes it may manifeſtly
appeare, that there is no hereſie in Reformation, and alſo that
all that the Reformed are charged withall is but ſclander.</p>
               <p>It is the part of a good archer to finde the white at the firſt
view, and to hit it with the firſt ſhaft, and he ſhall be deemed a
good and expert maſter, ſo that it come not by chance. S. Paule
hath ſhewed the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of his arte, in that with one only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
he reached the end of the law, and with an other the mark
that was ſet vp as the end of the Goſpell. The arrow wherewith
he hath hit the end of the law, was but one onely worde, vnder
the which he hath comprehended the whole doctrine of the
law,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 11</note> and that is, Charitie, and the ſhaft wherewith he pierced
the mark of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Gal 5. 14.</note> is alſo this onely word, Faith, where
vnder he hath alſo comprehended the whole doctrine of the
Goſpell.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 5.</note> Now then if any man would know wherein conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
the difference betweene Reformation and the doctrine
termed Catholick: it is in the ſuperſtition. For take the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
out of that Religion, which in name is termed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and there will remaine no difference betweene the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and the Reformed, and therefore I appeale to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any diſcret perſon in this caſe, videl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
not to cleaue to ſuperſtition: for if it be hereſie, Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be taxed of hereſie: but if it be no hereſie, they which
terme them ſelues Catholickes, can not taxe Reformation with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2815:8"/>
hereſie, vnleſſe it be with ſclander. For Reformation differreth
not from the Catholicke Religion but in one point, which is
ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>Many there be that haue formed them<note n="*" place="margin">The name of a monſter that caſteth fire out of his mouth, hauing the head of a lion, the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a goat, and the taile of a dragon.</note> Chimeres co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
Reformation as imagining it to conſiſt in thoſe things wherein
it doth not conſiſt,<note place="margin">3.</note> and whereof ſome haue ſpoken lightly, and
others haue iudged raſhly, each condemning it for want of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
ſome haue perſwaded them ſelues that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
it very well, and yet neuer tooke paines to ſeeke into the
depth of it. There are that haue thought Reformation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in ouerthrowing the eſtat of the Clergie, and this foreiudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath bene a greater hinderance to Reformation then the
weapons of the Leaguers. For it is certaine that had the
Clergie ſuppoſed, that they might vnder Reformation haue
enioyed their eſtate, they would haue craued it, to the ende to
haue ſhaken of the yoke of ſuperſtition, which is burdenſome
to the greateſt part of them, and therefore they neuer retained
ſuperſtition, but for their eſtates ſake: and if the Clergie
had admitted Reformation, the people would alſo haue embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it, and ſo had the Popes partakers bene vnarmed, and
haue had no meanes to enterpriſe the League: and we forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with thoſe that doe now ſtrengthen our aduerſaries fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.<note place="margin">Luke. 14. 17.</note>
True it is that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bridegrome calleth the gueſtes to
the mariage, there is no excuſe of buying of land or vines that
may ſerue,<note place="margin">Luke. 14. 33.</note> or withhold vs. Yea we muſt euen renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all goods
and come to Chriſt when he calleth, and yet it doth not follow
that we muſt binde men to buy Reformation with the loſſe of
their goods. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the aduerſaries to Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
hath through the Popes ſubtiltie had courſe: But what? Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt proteſted that he came not to aboliſh the law, but to
fulfill it, &amp; reprouing the faultes of the Phariſies, exepted their
eſtate, ſaying, Theſe thinges ought to haue bene done, and yet
the other not left vndone, which notwithſtanding they haue
ſtill imagined that it ſhould ouerthrow their eſtate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
haue obſtinately ſet them ſelues there againſt, which hath
bred the deſtruction that they ſtood in feare of. This preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
hath alſo waſted the demaynes of the Clergie, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2815:9"/>
the Reformation might haue bene preſerued, but the fault
was in that it was neuer propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, procured or ſo much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
nothing will be obteined without requeſt: but that
that is done is done, &amp; therfore let vs prouide for that that is to
come. And the documentes of the Lord are giuen vs to inſtruct
our ſelues therewith, but not to enter to farre into iudgement
of others matters. Many alſo haue bene planted in Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and therein hauing taken roote, haue made no difficultie to dye
for the ſame, who if they ſhould haue bene forced at the firſt
bluſh to purchace it with the price of all their goodes, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
what they would haue done. Many alſo there be that
haue abandoned their goodes, yet not the vſe of them, but the
care and diſquiet, as the Apoſtles did their nets, and yet they
ſtill vſed them, euen after the Lordes reſurrection: yet muſt we
not take the Lordes inſtruction to the ende thereby to caſt a
ſtumbling block in our brethrens way, neither to enter to farre
into iudgement of others, but euery one to iudge him ſelfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thoſe inſtructions, and to referre the reſt to God: as
alſo I ſay not this to the end to mitigate things paſt, but to wiſh
men to be more circumſpect in time to come. For when we
haue throughly wayed all thinges, we ſhall finde Reformation
to import nothing contrarie to the ſtate of the Clergie. To the
end therefore that none may hereafter call this article into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
I will ſet down the reaſons wherupon I build my ſpeach.</p>
               <p>Firſt England hath vnder the ſtate of Reformation preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the ſtate of the Clergie, as alſo in ſome partes of Germanie
it is kept ſound, and yet may be better preſerued in Fraunce.</p>
               <p>Secondly the ſtate of the Clergie dependeth vpon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall
Policie. The Gentiles then being grafted into Iſraell as
the wild oliue is into the naturall,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 17</note> the Epiſcopall branche is
grafted into the Leuiticall, &amp; therfore ſucceeding in their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
they ought alſo to ſucceede in their priuileges and rights.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the end of Reformation tendeth not to corrupt the
order and pollicie that Moſes hath eſtabliſhed, but to reforme
that which the Popes haue corrupted with their ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly Reformation tendeth not to ſet the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the old, or to arme Ieſus Chriſt againſt Moſes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2815:9"/>
to ſhewe that Ieſus Chriſt with one hand deſtroyed that
which he built with the other: for he is the auctor as well of
the law as of the Goſpell: but rather to ſeeke out that harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and agreement, which is betweene the law and the Goſpell,
which is taught by the harmonie of the Canticle of Moſes and
of the lambe, ſet downe in the Apocalypſe. 15. 3. whereby we be
taught, that throughout all the holy Scripture there is not any
repugnance, abrogation, or contradiction. And in deede we
ſhould do God great iniurie, if we ſhould imagine that he vſed
any repugnancie in his lawes, abrogation in his decrees, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in his rightes: well there may be ſome derogations,
but a derogation doth but expound an edict, by taking away
ſome weake part and of no value or importance, to the end to
corroborate the more important part, as we ſee that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
derogateth from the law,<note place="margin">Ierem. 9.</note> by taking away the letter, as the
manuall Circumciſion,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 29.</note> thereby to ſhewe the excellencie and
importance of the Circumciſion of the hart,<note place="margin">Colloſſ. 2. 11</note> wrought without
handes, and taught by the Prophetes vnder the law and by the
Apoſtles in the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, as in the law we may conſider the pollicie and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
the law hath waxen old as concerning the literall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
not concerning the ſpirite: but the pollicie remaineth, as
appeareth, firſt, in that S. Paule teacheth vs, that the Gentiles (as
in the dayes of Dauid) were aforetime eſtranged from the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
of Iſraell,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> for ſo doth the Greeke text import: neither
doe I alter the termes, as coueting rather to draw at the well
head then out of the chanels: and I finde no reaſon to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
common wealth in ſtead of policie. I know we are all made
fellow burgeſes of heauen, but beſides, we are all made partakers
of the policie, that is to ſay, of the priuileges: howbeit by the
ſame we are bound and made ſubiect to the ſame rightes, which
we ought not to giue ouer to obey traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. I know there may
be great obiections made, but I haue likewiſe greater ſolutions,
which I reſerue for the Treatiſe of the policie of the Church,
and it ſuffiſeth me here to ſet downe the fondamentall reaſons.
Some may ſay vnto me, that S. Paule ſpeaketh of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
policie, not of the externall: whereto I aunſwere, that the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2815:10"/>
Moſaicall gouernement is ſpirituall, firſt becauſe the ſpirite of
God penned it, ſecondly becauſe S. Paule ſaith that the law is
ſpirituall: but the part is of one kinde in his courſe, and there
is as great difference betweene this gouernement, and a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
ſimply externall, as there is betweene Gods law and
mans traditions. For the law is ſpirituall, and mans traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are
carnall, and purge no more but the outſide of the cup, whereas
Gods word is penetratiue, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the partition of the ſoule and
the ſpirite, of the ſinewes and marow, and this gouernement is
Gods word, which clenſeth the whole cuppe as well within as
without, and therefore can not be called ſimply externall, but
internall, whoſe principall end te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to rule the inward man.</p>
               <p>Againe S. Paule ſaith that the law is good, if it be lawfully
vſed. Then muſt we without queſtion ſeeke out the lawfull vſe
therof, that is, we muſt take it after the ſpirite &amp; newneſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and not after the old letter. Now the ſpirite of the law is the
equitie thereof, but the letter is the rigour of the wordes. And
therefore we muſt not after the rigour of the wordes, take eye
for eye,<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 24.</note> or tooth for tooth, neither do I thinke, that the iudges
that liued vnder the law, did in ſuch points folow the letter.
Thus we may ſee wherefore S. Paule in his Epiſtle to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
inuiteth vs to the gouernement of Iſraell,<note place="margin">Rom.</note> when he laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the vanitie of the righteouſneſſe of the law againſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of workes,<note place="margin">Gal.</note> and the aboliſhment of the law,<note place="margin">Heb.</note> againſt ſuch as
conſtituted righteouſneſſe in outward ceremonies, whom he
teacheth that the new Teſtament aboliſheth the old, howbeit
that is to be vnderſtood concerning the old letter, whereto is
oppoſed the newneſſe of ſpirite.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon will I alſo adde, for that S. Paule ſaith, that the
law was giuen for the tranſgreſſions: for by that we know that
we are to vſe it to correct tranſgreſſions, and that ſelfe place
ſerueth for a farther explication of the lawfull vſe of the law,
whereof we ſpake in the former article. For the law conſiſteth
in Commandements, commanding naturall equitie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
doth S. Paule call it the law of Commandementes: but the
Goſpell requireth a ſupernaturall perfection, wherof the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
man who is naturall is vncapable, which perfection is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2815:10"/>
by inſtructions, admonitions, counſels and examples.
Now he that fulfilleth not the law, is by the law puniſhable, as
hauing ſinned, for ſinne is the tranſgreſſion of the law, as S. Iohn
teacheth, ſaying <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But there be things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the profeſſion of the Goſpell, which who ſoeuer fulfilleth
not is reproueable, and yet not puniſhable, and therefore the
law remaineth to bridle and puniſh tranſgreſſions. The thinges
belonging to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are, not to looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a woman, to couet
her:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> after a blow on the one cheeke, to turne the other: to him
that requireth but thy coate, to giue both coate &amp; cloake: to do
good to our enemies: &amp; to be perfect, as our father that is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
is perfect: who ſo doth not theſe thinges, is neuertheleſſe
not ſubiect to puniſhment: but he that contrarie to the law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floureth
a maiden, muſt according to the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the law,
giue her a dowrie or mary her: he that hath ſtolen foure ſheepe,
muſt according to the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the law, be taught by his
paſtor to reſtore fiue. I omit that which concerneth the Ciuill
Magiſtrate, and ſpeake onely of that that toucheth the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, and this ſatisfaction which the paſtor is to
impoſe, taketh place, when the man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of him ſelfe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
his ſinne. Here may ſome man obiect vnto me, that the law
was a ſchoolemaiſter to bring vs to Chriſt: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I anſwere, in
this place S. Paule ſpeaketh of the ceremoniall law, which ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a diſtinction betweene cleane and vncleane things, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the elements of this world, and were neither taſted of,
nor eaten, but were ſhadowes of things to come vnder Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the law was to be conſidered, gouernement and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
alſo that there was two kindes of gouernement, the Ciuill
&amp; the Eccleſiaſticall, where Moſes had the Ciuill &amp; Aaron the
Eccleſiaſticall: likewiſe in the Prieſthood of Aaron there were
two things, the Eccleſiaſticall gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and the ceremonie:
ſome Prieſts there were that medled rather with the ceremonie
then with the gouernement: but there were likewiſe Leuites
that were not Prieſtes, but dealt onely in Eccleſiaſticall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
being Doctours of the law, of whom ſome remained in
the ſanctuarie townes, there to iudge of murthers by chaunce
medley: howbeit they could not iudge by tradition, but by law.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2815:11"/>
Deut. 17. Vpon the eſtate of the Clergie depended theſe fiue
thinges: 1. ceremonie, and the right of the ſacrifices. 2. The reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.
3. poſſeſſions. 4. dignities, and fifthly the lawes whereby
they ſhould iudge the people. For the ceremonie, they had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices:
For their reuenues, they had the tenthes: for their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
they had 48. townes, their cattell and the houſes that
they purchaſed, alſo the vowes: and in ſtead of this the French
Clergie haue their demaines &amp; tenthes: for their dignities they
had the order of Iethro.<note place="margin">Num. 35. 11.</note> Exod. 18. Deut. 17. And the lawes that
they were to obſerue were the lawes conteined in the law.<note place="margin">Leuit. 25. 32.</note> Deut.
17. Act. 23.</p>
               <p>Now it is to be noted,<note place="margin">Leuit. 27.</note> that the law gaue the Prieſtes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to iudge, &amp; that in ſuch ſorte, that who ſoeuer did not obey
them, was denounced worthy of death: howbeit hereto were
added two bonds. The one that the Prieſt could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne,
but in ſpecifying the law of God, whereby he did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne: the
other, that the perſon condemned dyed not but by the Ciuill
Magiſtrates handes, who had authoritie to looke, whether the
man were iuſtly condemned, according to the law cited in his
condemnation. Deut. 17.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore that the Chriſtian Clergie, liuing holily may
poſſeſſe their reuenues: neither will I be a more ſeuere cenſurer
of their eſtate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt was of the ſtate of the Phariſies.
But alas, if Ieſus Chriſt bewailed the wretchedneſſe of the
Phariſies, becauſe they tithed the mint, and had left iuſtice or
mercy, how much more lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table is the wretchedneſſe of that
Clergy, which termeth it ſelf Catholick: which poſſeſſeth theſe
holy reuenues to the end to mainteine Gods lawes, and yet haue
not onely forſaken them, and cleaued to traditions, but alſo do
mainteyne ſuperſtition contrarie to Gods lawes, yea and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
ſuch as will not cleaue to the like? How much better were
it for them to poſſeſſe them holily in liuing according to God?
whereby they might liue honeſtly with lawfull wiues; where
as now they waſt them vnworthely vpon harlots. Hetherto
haue men thought, that the part of the God of this world was
fauorable to the Clergie, and that Gods part was contrarie to
them: but in deede Gods part is more fauorable to the Clergy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2815:11"/>
then the contrary part: and not to the Clergie onely, but to all
the people, in reſpect of the warres which the ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue
brought in, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ended but with agreeing with God:
for Gods wrath which hath ſtirred vp theſe ſcourges, muſt
be appeaſed, and then God will appeaſe theſe troubles which
breed our miſeries. There is then no hinderance but that the
the Clergie may enioye their rightes and priuileges. True it is
that in S. Paule there be ſome admonitions and examples: but
they neither make law, neither abrogate any law: had S. Paule
bene in the dayes of Eleazar the ſonne of Aaron, he would haue
taken the tenthes: but being in ſuch a time as the Churches
were poore, he laboured with his owne hands to ſpare them: For
he was a principall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who knew how to abound and how to
want, and ſo ſpared them, but not vpon duetie, as him ſelf teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.
1. Cor. 9. Likewiſe had Aaron or Eleazar bene in the dayes
of S. Paule, when the Churches were poore, they would haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
with their owne hands, or bene content with food and
raiment: but had they bene in the time of great Conſtantin,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was lawfull to poſſeſſe the tenthes, they would haue vſed
them. Out of all which we do gather, that he which hath little
muſt be content with a little: and he that hath much muſt ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to vſe it lawfully. And herein conſiſteth the knowledge
how to abound,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> or to want, when a man can be content with
his want, and not forget him ſelfe in his plenty. As for Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
dignities, we graunt them euen to the higheſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the order of Iethro, which order was neuer conſtituted
in the new Teſtament, but was practiſed, and in deede the new
is not to ordeine matters already ordeined in the old, but to put
them in practiſe. Now after the order of Iethro, the chief Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
do ſucceede in the high Prieſts roome, and the Apoſtles
are to be conſidered as ſoueraine Biſhops, becauſe that next to
Ieſus Chriſt there were none in greater authoritie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they, but
there were in leſſe. And for their partes they were in equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
each with other: for ſith our Lord would not appoint
any one to be the greateſt amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his Apoſtles, he hath left them
all in equall power, neither could any man giue them any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
beſides, he appointed them in like degree, to the end they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2815:12"/>
ſhould be chief in thoſe prouinces whither Gods ſpirite ſent
them, and ſo ſhould not neede one to depend vpon the other.
Now that they were chief it appeareth, firſt in that Sainct Paule
likeneth him ſelfe vnto a maſter builder, not a ſimple maſſon,
and others to maſſons that build aboue, when he ſaith, that him
ſelfe laid the foundation, and that the reſt builded thereupon.
Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, in that both from Corinthe and other places they did
write vnto S. Paule, to decide the moſt difficult matters among
them: for it is the office of the chiefeſt to decide the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
cauſes Exod. 18. Deut. 17. S. Paule likewiſe charged Titus as
a Biſhop to ordeine Prieſts throughout the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations Tit.
1. And Titus receaued that charge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Paule, as from a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then himſelfe: For S. Paule vſeth commandement. S. Paule
alſo. 1. Cor. 11. 34. ſaith, when I come I will determine of the reſt,
thereby reſeruing to him the ordering of ſuch thinges, as could
not be performed but in the preſence of the chiefeſt: He alſo
ſaith, that he that giueth the bleſſing, is greater then he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth
it:<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> Euen ſo may we alſo ſay, that he that commaundeth
is greater then he that obeyeth: and he that ſendeth, then he that
is ſent.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> Now S. Paule commandeth Timothie, ſaying, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande
thee in the name of God. &amp;c. He required alſo obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in Philemon, ſaying, truſting in thine obedience. True it is that
he alſo vſed entreatie, whereof groweth the Prouerbe, a great
Lordes requeſt is as good as a commaundement. S. Paule like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
willeth Timothie not to admit any accuſation againſt the
Prieſt or Elder, without two or three witneſſes: ſo that Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
might admit or reiect accuſations againſt Prieſtes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it followeth that he had iuriſdiction euen ouer the Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Sainct Paule alſo ſent Timothie to the Corinthians:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> He
commaunded Titus to come vnto him,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> alſo to ſend Zene a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
of the law,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note> and Apollo: and he commaunded Timothie
to come before winter, and to bring Mark with him. True
it is that Paule ſent Timothy to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.</note> but Titus
we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not as one ſent, but offered himſelfe, and Sainct Paule ſent
a famous brother to the congregations, and therefore in the 12.
chap. of the ſame Epiſtle, he ſaith that he deſired Titus, and ſent
a brother. He alſo ſaith that he requeſted Apollo who would
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2815:12"/>
not goe, adding withall, that he ſhall go ſo ſoone as his leaſure
ſerueth him, and ſo ſheweth, that he did not refuſe, but delay. In
all which it appeareth, that euery thing was done in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
yet will I ſay, that the Apoſtles vſurped no dominion ouer,
Gods elect, or Lordſhip ouer their faith, or ouer the Lordes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:
but in deede there is differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene dominion &amp;
iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: They exerciſed no dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but exerciſed their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
as hauing iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. True it is that they exerciſed this iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with charitie rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authoritie, as alſo it is the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of euery Biſhop. Here might one obiect that ſith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were equall in authoritie, the Biſhops alſo ought to be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
authoritie: But I deny the conſequence, &amp; will proue it to
be no conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the ſaying of S. Paule, where he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth
him ſelfe to a wiſe maſter builder laying the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the
reſt to the workemen that build thereupon: For admit all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectes
and maſter maſſons were equall, yet followeth it not
that all ſimple maſſons or workmen ſhall be ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In deede it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that all chief Biſhops in euery kingdome or ſoueraigne
principalitie ſhould haue like authoritie. Moreouer the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were equall among them ſelues, but other Biſhops were
not equall with them, as we haue already ſhewed. I know that
Paules building may be referred to the preaching, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
hindereth not the applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Likewiſe we might
bring an other example, and that is, that albeit the Counſellers
in a Parliament be equall in authoritie, yet doth it not follow
that the Counſellers of Preſidiall ſeas, be of equall authoritie
with them. Here may they alſo obiect, that S. Paule calleth Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
his companion,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.</note> and ſaith to Philemon, if thou accompteſt
me thy fellow: whereto I aunſwere, that Eneas called his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
his fellowes, and yet it followeth not that they were equall
with their Captaine. And a Captaine may ſay to his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
I am thy fellow, and it becommeth him, but the ſouldier to
ſay the ſame, it were vnſeemely. It may alſo be obiected, that S.
Paule calleth the other Biſhops his helpers and fellow labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:
whereto I anſwere, that all workemen are fellow labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
and helpers of the maſter maſſon, yet not equall with him.
And God ſometime maketh men his fellow laborers, yet not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2815:13"/>
with him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>I ſay then that the Eccleſiaſticall dignities haue place euen to
the higheſt, but not vniuerſall, which vſurpeth dominion euen
ouer kinges, yea ſo farre forth as to diſpoſe of their ſcepters and
crownes: and I will proue my ſaying thus. The high Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of Aaron was ſubiect to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat of Moſes and
the kingdome of Iuda. Alſo in the law which God ſet downe,
there was no Prieſthood aboue the kinges, and that by reaſon
of the law, ſith that vnder the principalitie of Moſes, there was
a high Prieſthood: therfore it followeth that vnder euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſoueraigne principalitie, there ſhould be a chief Biſhop,
yet not ſo as to acknowledge any vniuerſall Biſhop. Sith alſo
that Ieſus Chriſt would not ordeine any to be greateſt among
the Apoſtles, it followeth that there ought not to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
among the chief. And Ieſus Chriſt forbiddeth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to vſurpe dominion: the vniuerſall Biſhopricke is therfore
no lawfull order, but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred by Babell. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
will alledge the pretended donation of Conſtantine the great,
I aunſwere, that many impugne it as falſe, beſides that a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be of any force to abuſe or to vſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to good
maners, as the Pope ſtriueth to vphold ſuperſtition, repugnant
to all good maners and true godlineſſe, yea the ingratitude of
the receauer of the donation, maketh the donation voyde: but
the Popes haue practiſed all ingratitude againſt the Emperors,
procuring their ſubiectes many times to rebell, preſcribing
their Empires, working their deathes, betraying of them, as
Fredericke Barbaroſſa was betrayed to the Turke, and treading
vpon their throates, with ſuch other ingratefull inſolencies.
Againe the Emperour hath no authoritie in Fraunce, he can
not then giue the Pope any there. In Fraunce Conſtantines
authoritie is vnknowen, neither doth any man giue that which
he hath not, nor can transferre any further right then his own.
But if he beare him ſelfe vpon the authoritie of Doctors, I will
alledge one Doctour, euen S. Gregory, who ſaith that the firſt
that ſhall take vpon him to be vniuerſall Biſhop, ſhall be the
forerunner of Antichriſt. If they alledge the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, I anſwere,
that ſome of them haue improued the Popes authoritie, albeit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2815:13"/>
ſome others aſſembled by the Popes driftes and practiſes haue
approued it. And admit the Councels had without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
approued it, yet let vs looke whether their Decrees be
grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods word: for in that caſe we muſt obey them,
as alſo if they be not contrary to Gods word: But Ieſus Chriſt
expreſſely forbiddeth ſuch dominion, then may no Councell
authoriſe it. For S. Paule ſaith, that he may doe nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the truth, how then ſhall the Councels be of force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Chriſtes expreſſe prohibition? Againe, in Fraunce the
king hath the Ciuill dominion, and the Parliamentes haue no
dominion, but the iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: likewiſe in England the Queene
hath the dominion, and the Biſhops the Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
But the authoritie which the Pope vſurpeth, is a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which exalteth it ſelfe aboue kinges, and therefore by
Gods word expreſly forbidden. Thus hath the Pope no right,
neither any colour in Gods word, neither is there any king or
prince by Gods word ſubiect vnto him, no not ſo much as
any chief Biſhop that is bound to acknowledge him. But all
kinges and ſoueraigne princes, may in their kingdomes and
principalities eſtabliſh chief Biſhops, after the maner and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of England.</p>
               <p>I haue before ſhewed that the ſtate of the Clergie is no cauſe
of our ſeparation from thoſe whom in Fraunce we call Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes,<note place="margin">4</note>
and therefore the abuſe may be thought to be the cauſe,
but it is not: for there is no gouernement wherein there may
not be abuſe, but the abuſe ſimply it not ſufficient cauſe of
ſchiſme. We know that there was neuer any more excellent
gouernement then the ſame which God eſtabliſhed, yet did the
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Hely the high Prieſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit great abuſes,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 12.</note> defiling the
women appointed to watch the tabernacle, &amp; againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
willes,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 13.</note> and contrary to the cuſtome eſtabliſhed in the law,
chuſing ſuch meates as they liked in the Prieſtes kettles. The
people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained hereof, yet made they no ſchiſme, as in deede
they ought not: and now if we were to complaine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes
but for their ſimple abuſes, we ſhould haue no cauſe
to make any ſchiſme: well might we haue occaſion to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine,
yet not therefore to ſeparate our ſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:2815:14"/>
It may be thought alſo that ceremonies are the cauſe of our
ſeparation from the Catholickes,<note place="margin">5</note> yet are they not ſo, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I make great difference betweene ceremonies and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
for ſuperſtition is forbidden by Gods word, ſo are not
ceremonies, for there be three kindes of ſimple ceremonies, one
Legall, an other Euangelicall, and the third indifferent, yet not
contrary to the word of God. The Legall are aboliſhed as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the letter, but doe remaine, as concerning the ſpirite,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that their truth is eternall, &amp; abideth for euer as the
word of God. The Euangelicall, as the Sacraments, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
And others there are which be indifferent, as not forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by the word of God, for the which one ſhould not condemne
an other. The ſame are ſuch as are vſed in ſundry Reformed
places, as in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, Switzerland and els where. In which cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
the Reformed faithfull ought to haue reſpect to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie:
one to beare with an other, according to the rule of S. Paul,
who ſaith: Let not him that eateth not, deſpiſe him that eateth,
and he that eateth, let him not reproue him that eateth not, that
is to ſay, let not one condemne an other. True it is that there
be fooliſh and trifling ceremonies, as in Baptiſme to put the
ſpatle of the Prieſt into the childes mouth, when as ſometimes
the Prieſt ſhall be halfe a lazare, halfe rotten, and haue rotten
teeth, or a ſtincking or corrupt breath, which can not but be
daungerous for the child, and therefore vpon ſo villanous a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
the father may ſometimes take occaſion not to cleaue
thereto: as alſo there be garments, which being worne vpon any
ſignification, and for diſtinction in callinges, are ceremonies,
but if we attribute any vertue vnto them, they be ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>The cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſeparation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth not in the ſtate of
the Clergie,<note place="margin">6</note> neither in the abuſes, nor in the ceremonies, but in
the ſuperſtition. Superſtition do I call all worſhipping of falſe
Gods: falſe worſhipping of the true God, or euery worſhip
contrary to the word of God.</p>
               <p>As for the word ſuperſtition, it is a Latin word, and may be
taken diuerſlly. It may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that which in Latin is called
<hi>Superſtitum parentatio,</hi> that is to ſay, the ſuruiuours funerals,
there hence transferring it to any other falſe worſhip, or rather
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2815:14"/>
                  <hi>ſuper ſtatutu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cultum, extranea &amp; prophana adiectio,</hi> taking <hi>ſuper</hi>
in ſtead of <hi>praeter</hi> or <hi>contra,</hi> which ſignifieth all worſhip that is
added, beſides the ſame which God hath eſtabliſhed. The
Greekes do call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth the worſhipping
of the deuils: but vary it how they will, I force not, ſo the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
remaine.</p>
               <p>Superſtition then being the cauſe of our ſeparation, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to be thought that we can not allow any ſuperſtitious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
But diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is needefull to be had, in clearing the cauſe
of ſuperſtition from that that concerneth the ſtate, and not to
condemne any thing raſhly.</p>
               <p>The ſuperſtitions that cauſe vs to abandon the Popes partie,
are the worſhipping of Images and Reliques, the inuocation
of Sainctes, Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation, Artolatrie, Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the Popes orders eſtabliſhed by ſuperſtitious traditions,
falſe and faleable Pardons, falſe merites derogatorie to Chriſtes
merites, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>As for Images, it is a matter ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly beaten by other, and
therefore I ſhall not neede to enter into particularities, for it is
manifeſt inough, that the worſhipping of them is idolatrie. I
know that euery Image is not an Idoll, alſo that an Image ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
maketh not an Idoll, but the worſhip thereof, which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition:
For it is written, Thou ſhalt not honor it. But we
doe honor it, when we celebrate it with any worſhip. I alſo
graunt, that an Image ſet vp for a hiſtorie is no Idoll, as we ſee
in the temples of thoſe that are called Lutherans in Germanie,
but if we attribute any vertue thereto, it is ſuperſtition: for the
vertue that we attribute, is the cauſe of the worſhip and honor
thereto, yet is it good vtterly to purge Gods Church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe
Images, which haue bene cauſes of the peoples Idolatrie, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it were to be wiſhed that it might be done by the kinges
authoritie. And it is to be meruailed, that in the Churches
there are the Images of God the father,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> ſith God him ſelfe hath
ſo expreſly forbidden it. For if they might take place, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
ought not to be reproued for their Image of Iupiter. For
it is certaine that by Iupiter they vnderſtood <hi>Ioue pater,</hi> and it
is an auncient character of Noahs Religion, who called God Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houa
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2815:15"/>
And the Poete ſaying, <hi>Iouis omnia plena,</hi> ſpeaketh of the
great God creator of all thinges. I will omit all Poeticall ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
neither doth my Argument leade me to ſpeake of them.</p>
               <p>As for the Images of Ieſus Chriſt and his Sainctes, if that of
Ieſus ought not to be worſhipped, much leſſe ought thoſe of
the Sainctes: but that of Ieſus Chriſt muſt not be worſhipped,
it is then in vayne to worſhip thoſe of Saincts. Some man may
ſay that they worſhip them not, hereto I aunſwere, that when
we exhibite ſo great reuerence to any thing, as we can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite
more to God him ſelfe, we worſhip that thing. But ſuch
is the worſhip that is done to Images, before the which we
vncouer our heades, bend our knees, hold vp our handes, make
our prayer, preſent our offring and ſuch like: Tell me then I
pray you, what more can we doe to God him ſelfe? But the
ſubtiler ſorte do ſay: ween you that when I kneele before a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe
of wood or ſtone, I pray to the wood or ſtone? No I doe
it to the thing repreſented by that woodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Crucifixe, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thereupon, do direct my prayer to Chriſt. Thinke you, ſay
they, that I am ſo ſenceleſſe as to ſtay vpon this viſible Image?
mine eye is in deede vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the viſible Image, but my hart is with
Ieſus Chriſt that is in heauen.<note place="margin">2. Kin. 18.</note> But let me aske thee, Thinkeſt
thou that they which ſacrificed to the braſen ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had not the
like ſtarting hole? They had more reaſon to ſacrifice thereto,
then thou to a Crucifixe. For it figured Ieſus Chriſt hanging
on the wood: and whereas thy Crucifixes be erected by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
men, without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement from God, that was
erected by Gods expreſſe commandement: and whereas ſome
of thy Crucifixes are authoriſed by falſe miracles, that was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
by the miracles wrought in the deſert, by healing ſuch as
the ſerpents had bitten. All which notwithſtanding, when the
people began to ſacrifice thereto, Ezechias brake it, ſaying, that
it was but braſſe. Wherefore if theſe ſtarting holes ſhould take
place, who doubteth but the Iſraelites would haue had the like?
Thou worſhipeſt, ſayeſt thou, Ieſus Chriſt, and art not ſo ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
as to worſhip the Crucifixe: weeneſt thou the Iſraelites
were ſo ſenceleſſe as to worſhip the braſen ſerpent, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
him that was thereupon figured, hanging vpon the wood?
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2815:15"/>
or thinkeſt thou that they were ſo ignoraunt, that they knew
it not to be the figure of the Meſſias, ſith they liued in a time ſo
illuminated with Prophetes, as was the time of Ezechias? Had
ſuch ſhiftes taken place, Ezechias would neuer haue deſtroyed
the braſen ſerpent, which notwithſtanding theſe ſhiftes, being
broken, thy excuſes alſo take no place. Thou wilt ſay, that they
ſacrificed to the braſen ſerpent, but that thou doeſt not ſacrifice
to the Crucifixe. I anſwere, that there were two ſortes of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the one burnt offerings the other meate offrings. The burnt
offrings were made of beaſtes: The meate offrings of fruicts, as
of corne, wine, bread, oyle &amp; ſuch like, wherfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
the like thinges to the Crucifixe, thou ſacrificeſt againe to
the braſen ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou makeſt thoſe offerings before
the Images of Sainctes, thou doeſt yet worſe. To be brief, all
theſe excuſes are but ſtarting holes, and it is no hereſie to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
ſuch ſuperſtition: yea this ſuperſtitious worſhip is the
cauſe that iuſtly we may well call them Idols.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> And S. Paule
teacheth vs, what ſoeuer is ſacrificed to Idols, is offered to Idols,
wherein we doe learne that the Idols which in old time aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
by oracles, were deuils. Yea there be ſome deuines, which
note the worſhip of the Images of Sainctes, and there be I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
vnder the Catholicke Religion that abuſe the world,
which thinketh, that the Sainctes doe worke miracles: albeit
they be ſuch miracles as the old oracles wrought long agoe.
Wherein it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they are the ſame deuils, which abuſe
the people, hauing onely chaunged their names. In old time
they would be called God, and now they wilbe termed Saincts.
The Gods of old time had their Prieſtes and Sibilles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now
the Saincts haue their Southſayers: they frame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to the
time, but in the meane time the people is abuſed thinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the name is altered, the matter is changed. As for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Honor, Latrie, Doulie &amp; Hiperdoulie, it is an other
kinde of ſhift, which hath neither reaſon nor grounde in the
word of God. Now therfore do I appeale to euery mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this matter: viz. that ſith they worſhip Images, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this worſhip may not be taken for ſuperſtition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
alſo whether this worſhip maketh not their Images Idols.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2815:16"/>
And S. Paule teſtifieth, that Idols be deuils: Therefore theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
whereto they erect worſhip are deuils, that is to ſay, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
are worſhipped in them: and ſo being deuils, we are not
to haue any acquaintance with them. For Sainct Paule telleth
vs that we can not participate, both in the cup of the Lord and
in the cup of deuils, and ſo he ſheweth vs that to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of both togither, be two incompatible extremities. To
the end therefore to participate in the Lordes cup, we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſeparate our ſelues from the Pope, who mainteineth the
cup of deuils, that is, Idolatrie. This then is the cauſe of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
which who ſoeuer will iudge without paſſion, I am
aſſured will finde to be lawfull. This is in deede the matter of
our ſeparation, and not the ſimple abuſes, neither the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
ſimply, and much leſſe the ſtate of the Clergie: for the
which thinges there ought not to be any breach made in the
Church: well may we in modeſtie require the correction of the
abuſes, when there be any, yet not therefore make a ſchiſme.</p>
               <p>Concerning inuocation of Saincts,<note place="margin">7</note> that is yet an other kinde
of ſuperſtition, for this we know, that all worſhip of God and
deuine ſeruice, is contained vnder theſe two kinds, inuocation
and thankeſgiuing. And this adoration or worſhip is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to God, that it can not be transferred to any other, as he
ſayth, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip one God onely, and him onely ſhalt thou
ſerue:</hi> which is that kind of adoration and worſhip that ought
to be reſerued to God onely, and not transferred to others. But
in the religion tearmed Catholicke, they do no leſſe transferre
thankeſgiuing to the Saincts then inuocation: for they make
their vowes to Saincts, and to pay vowes and oblations, is to
celebrate thankeſgiuing, and therefore it may be ſayd, that they
transferre the whole worſhip vnto them, and ſo do no longer
worſhip one God onely, neither ſerue him alone: but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
worſhip and adoration, do giue him as many compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
as there be Sainctes, whom they inuocate. Beſides that,
ſometimes ſuch a one is vpon earth inuoceted for a Sainct, as
in deede is broyled in hell fire, &amp; ſo may they finde in hell ſome
one, whom they make a companion of God, in reſpect of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and adoration: neither will I ſay that idoles, being by S.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2815:16"/>
Paules teſtimonie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> deuils: the deuils do cauſe them ſelues to be
worſhipped as Sainctes in their ſteades. Againe, albeit it were
not forbidden, yet ſith there is no commandement for it in the
worde, that worſhip can not be according to the faith which
commeth of the hearing of the word: and whatſoeuer is not of
faith is ſinne,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 18.</note> as S. Paule witneſſeth. And there can be no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
where there is neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, inſtruction, exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple,
nor admonition.<note place="margin">4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eſd 1. 40</note> But beſides the commandement to worſhip
and ſerue one God onely, S. Paule reproueth the worſhipping
of Angels, which is as much as to reproue the worſhipping of
Sainctes: for they being the meſſengers of the will of God, are
compriſed vnder the name of Angels,<note place="margin">Mala. 3. 1.</note> as we ſee in Malachy,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 10</note>
who is called the Angell of the Lord.<note place="margin">Apoc. 1.</note> It is alſo written of Iohn
Baptiſt,<note place="margin">Iſay. 33. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſend my Angell before thy face, who ſhall prepare thy
wayes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mala. 2. 7.</note> And the ſeuen Biſhops of the ſeuen Churches of Aſia,
are called the ſeuen Angels of the ſeuen congregations, with
many ſuch other examples, infinitely to be found in the holy
Scripture. So that the Saincts being named Angels: vnder the
prohibition of the worſhip of Angels, is contained the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of the worſhip of Saincts.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 11.</note> The Angels alſo as S. Peter
teacheth, are greater then the Saincts, and therefore if the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Angels, who are greater then the Saincts, be by S. Paule
reproued, how can the worſhipping of images ſtand? All ſuch
therefore is but vanitie and ſuperſtition, and the forſaking of
ſuch matters is good, ſo farre is the abandoning of them from
being hereſie. True it is that ſome do bring in diſtinctions, as
thus: That they call not vpon the Saincts for remiſſion, but for
interceſſion: whereto I anſwere, that howſoeuer they call vpon
them, or with whatſoeuer title it be, yet is inuocation ſtill inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
adoration and worſhip, and ſo ſtill forbidden by the
commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip one God, and him onely ſhalt
thou ſerue,</hi> neither can theſe diſtinctions take place, vnleſſe the
holy Scripture did expreſly propound them, no more then the
diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of honour, <hi>latrie, doulie,</hi> or <hi>hyperdeulie.</hi> And they be
ſufficiently confuted by denying onely, becauſe there is no ſuch
matter contained throughout the holy Scripture authenticall.
To be briefe, we muſt call vpon God onely, &amp; not vpon Saincts,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2815:17"/>
and to God only muſt we addreſſe our vowes, &amp; not to Saincts.
Some may obiect, that the Saincts in heauen do know what is
done vpon earth, yea and that they pray to God for vs. Wherto
I anſwer, that the Prophets being in the world, knew the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
eſtate of the Church, and do better know it in heauen: but
they are no ſearchers of the hearts, for that is proper to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And S. Paule ſaith, that no man knoweth what is in man,
but the ſpirit of man, which is in man himſelfe: wherefore the
ſpirits of men which are in heauen, do not know what is in the
ſpirit or heart of man that is vpon earth. But he that is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
muſt know his heart &amp; intent for whom he intreateth.
I will not denie but charitie may moue them to pray for vs, yet
do hit not follow thereof, that we ſhould call vpon them, ſith
we haue no ſuch commandement.</p>
               <p>As for prayer for the dead,<note place="margin">8</note> and the doctrine of Purgatorie, it
hath foundation but vpon the ſecond booke of Machabees, the
ſixt booke of Virgils Aeneides, and Homer. Which be very
weake props to hold vp ſo heauie a building. They giue vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretences,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 7.</note> but in vayne, ſith that as Salomon teſtifieth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the duſt returneth to the duſt, the ſpirite returneth to God that
gaue it, which ſheweth that when man dyeth, his ſpirite retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to God, of him to receaue his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
there is no appeale: neither are there but two wayes,
the broad and the narrow, two gates, the wide and the ſtreight,
and two iſſues, life and death. So as there is no voyde place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
to build Purgatorie vpon.</p>
               <p>One point there is, which is, that the rentes that are giuen to
pray for the dead, might be conuerted to the inſtruction of the
people, and to pray for the ſaluation of the ſuruiuors their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours:
for ſo might that which hath bene giuen to a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
vſe be conuerted to a lawfull and godly vſe, following the
example of cenſers of Chore his partakers,<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> which hauing
bene offered for a conſpiracie, were afterward conuerted into
golden plates vpon the altar of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Neither can the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation be admitted,<note place="margin">9</note>
becauſe it ſtandeth not with any deuine reaſon, that an earthly
thing ſhould be tranſubſtantiated into a heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, that is, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2815:17"/>
bread into heauenly bread. For if the bread be tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
into Chriſtes body, then ſhould Chriſtes body be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
tranſubſtantiated into a dead and earthly bread diſpoiled
of his qualities and powers. Now there is nothing that letteth
vs, but that we may eate Chriſtes body clothed with all his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and powers, without ſubiecting it to earthly bread: for
we muſt eate it as liuing bread,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 51.</note> ſith Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, that he is
the liuing bread, and the bread of life. But there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene eating it as liuing bread, and eating it as a dead,
ſenceleſſe, earthly and immoueable bread. And tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
gain ſaith the eating of it as liuing bread, when it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
it vnder the earthly kindes of a dead and immoueable
bread: which is a ſpeach moſt vnworthy the body of Ieſus
Chriſt: beſides that we doe ſubiect the heauenly thing ſignified
vnto the earthly ſigne, which is yet more vnworthy the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Euchariſt, and therefore the abandoning of ſuch
doctrine is no hereſie.</p>
               <p>Thereby alſo it appeareth that it is ſuperſtition to worſhip
the Sacramentall bread, becauſe the thing ſignified ought not
to be ſubiected to the thing ſignifying: and his body which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
all thinges can not be compriſed in a dead and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing. This is ſtill to worſhip the braſen ſerpent, which
was but braſſe, &amp; yet was no leſſe a Sacrament of Ieſus Chriſt
hanging vpon tree, then is the Sacramentall bread. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe matters are but ſuperſtitions, whereto we are not
bounde to cleaue. And ſuch as perſecute vs becauſe we will
not bend our neckes to the yoke of ſuperſtitions, doe lend to a
good marchant, who is able to pay them well again. They haue
a marueilous accompt to make: but we, thankes be to God, may
giue a good accompt of our conuerſation, not before men one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but euen before God, who will not be deceaued: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let theſe men looke what accompt they be able to giue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: for men may ſometimes be deceaued: but God will
not be dalyed with all: The corroſiue of conſcience may for a
while ſuffer them to ſleepe, but the fire once kindled therein
will neuer be quenched,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 31</note> &amp; S. Paule ſaith, It is an horrible thing
to fall into the handes of the liuing God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:2815:18"/>
As touching the Maſſe,<note place="margin">10</note> Reformation is not an enemy ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to it, but alſo to the ſuperſtitions wherewith it is ſtuffed.
Some Catholickes there be, that ſay that we doe euill in that we
cleaue not to the Maſſe, becauſe there be ſome good thinges
therein, as the Epiſtle and the Goſpell. True it is, there be good
things, but there be alſo bad: namely all that is ſuperſtitious: &amp;
therefore take away the bad, and ſo ſhall we ſoone compound
for the reſt, and grow to agreement.</p>
               <p>Traditions haue alſo in part bene the cauſe of our ſeparation
from the Pope,<note place="margin">11</note> but who will for that accuſe vs of hereſie? haue
not both Eſay and Ieſus Chriſt taught the ſame? yea there be
ſuch traditions as S. Paule termeth doctrine of deuils, as is that
of vowed chaſtitie, for S. Paule teſtifieth that Gods ſpirite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
doth ſay, that in the latter dayes ſome ſhall reuolt from
the faith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> cleauing to ſpirites of errour &amp; the doctrine of deuils,
ſpeaking lyes in hypocriſie, hauing their conſciences ſeared
with a hoate iron, forbidding mariage, and commanding abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from meates, created by God for vs to vſe with thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.
Theſe be S. Paules owne wordes. Now let vs ſee who
they are of whom he ſpeaketh? They are thoſe that prohibite
mariage: he ſpeaketh then of the Pope, for he forbiddeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in commanding chaſtitie. For what is chaſtitie but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hition
from mariage?</p>
               <p>But what doth he ſay of them? Firſt he ſaith that they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith: they be then gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the groundes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Tell me then, be not they that erre from the grounds of faith
heretickes? Then is the Pope an hereticke, euen by the euident
teſtimonie of Gods ſpirite, and yet doth he accuſe vs of hereſie.
He ſaith well: but who is he that condemneth vs of hereſie? It
is the Pope: Then is it a man, and we may well appeale vnto
God. But he that pronounceth that the Pope is reuolted from
the faith, and ſo conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly an hereticke, is the ſpirite of God:
I pray you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom ſhall he appeale? what, will he thinke
that Gods ſpirite hath ſpoken vnwiſely, &amp; therefore is ready
to recant his ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which he hath ſo ſolemnely pronounced?</p>
               <p>Secondly he ſaith, that they depend vpon the ſpirites of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
Then are not we to hang vpon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:2815:18"/>
Thirdly he ſaith, that they cleaue to the doctrine of deuils:
Is not that I pray you, to communicate in the cup of deuils?
then can they not communicate in the cup of the Lord: for
S. Paule witneſſeth, that we can can not be partakers of the cup
of the Lord,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> and of the cup of deuils: we can not then commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with them, but we muſt alſo communicate in the cup of
deuils, which we can not doe, but by renouncing the cup of
Chriſt. Are we to be blamed then for departing from them?</p>
               <p>Fourthly he ſaith, that they ſpeake lyes in hypocriſie: which
appeareth manifeſtly in the ſclaunder that they charge vs with,
when they taxe vs with hereſie. For would you haue a greater
lye then that? what greater hypocriſie doe you require then the
ſame, which contrary to his owne conſcience ſclaundereth his
neighbour?</p>
               <p>Fifthly he ſaith, their conſciences are ſeared, whereby we ſee
that it is not without cauſe that they reſiſt the truth. For a man
would greatly marueile, to ſee theſe reſiſt ſo euident a light, for
the vpholding of thoſe ſuperſtitions, wherein the darkneſſe is
as palpable as was that of Egypt in times paſt: But now that
we know their conſciences to be ſeared, we thinke it no more
ſtraunge that they reſiſt the truth, conſidering that the ſearing
of their conſciences doth take from them all feeling thereof.</p>
               <p>Here might ſome obiect, that S. Paule ſpeaketh of other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes
that may come after vs, &amp; not of the Pope. I graunt he
may alſo ſpeake of others, neuertheleſſe it followeth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that he ſpeaketh not of the Pope, and for proofe thereof I
will for example bring Gods ſaying to Noah. <hi>He that ſheddeth
a mans bloud, let his bloud be ſhed by man:</hi> How if a murtherer
ſhould ſay, that this were not ſpoken by him, but by his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
who might peraduenture haue killed a man: would not
the Iudge aunſwere, that it had relation to both, yea and to
all other ſhedders of mans bloud, who thereby doe make them
ſelues guiltie of the ſame offence? In like maner if there were
a hundred ſectes, which prohibited mariage and the vſe of
meates, the ſpirit of God in the place before alledged, doth note
all the whole hundred: &amp; all other conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces would be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
againſt euery of the hundred, as they be againſt the Pope,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:2815:19"/>
My meaning is, that all ſuch Doctors which propound the
traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of vowed chaſtitie for a doctrine, that is, to make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
therof, are reproued by S. Paule. Neuertheleſſe I ſay, that
the reaſon is not a like, when we keepe Lent vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> policie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
binding the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: becauſe that in that caſe, it is no ſnare
to the conſcience. Here might ſome man ſay, that S. Paule there
ſpeaketh of the latter dayes, and therfore meaneth not that Lent
and abſtinence from mariage which were inſtituted long ago.
Hereto I aunſwere,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2. 18.</note> that S. Iohn euen in his time, ſaid that there
were many Antichriſtes, and that thereby he knew the latter
dayes then to be come, ſo as if the time of the Apoſtles were by
the holy Scriptures termed the latter dayes, much better may
the ſpirite of God in this place call thoſe the latter dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
both Lent and abſtinence from mariage were brought in.</p>
               <p>Infinite particularities which might be alledged,<note place="margin">12</note> will I omit,
as being content to haue touched ſome part of the groſſeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes,
and now will proceede to ſpeake generally of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
doctrine, which I ſay can not be taxed of hereſie. Some
thinges doe they hold common with the Catholickes, and in
ſome others doe they differ. As well the one as the other haue
ſome good thinges, wherein they doe agree, and in either of
them may there be found ſome thinges diſputable: for all men
are men. Herein doe they differ, that the Doctors which call
them ſelues Catholickes, I ſpeake of thoſe of our dayes, haue
their faces turned to ſuperſtition, where as the Reformed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
haue as concerning that point, ſatisfied them ſelues by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from Popiſh ſuperſtitions. Superſtitious doctrine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
the worſhip of Images, which is Idolatrie: and it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
the prohibition from mariage, and from the vſe of
meates, which Gods ſpirite termeth the doctrine of deuils: It
is therfore found to be erronious, ſith the ſpirite of God doth
ſay, that ſuch men cleaue to the ſpirites of error, yea that they be
euen reuolted from the faith, ſhewing that they haue eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them ſelues from the true groundes therof, wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted
them of hereſie. In this then doe they differ, videl that
in the ſuperſtitious Doctors there is hereſie, but in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
there is none. Some matters there may be diſputable in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2815:19"/>
the authors of Reformation, but no hereſie, that is, no doctrine
vtterly repugnant to the principles of faith. I know there be
Catholicke Doctors, that ſome times doe skirmiſh againſt the
Reformed, &amp; to perſwade men that there is errour in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
doe often times propound ſuch thinges as the others ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſpake of, or if they haue ſpoken of any ſuch, do wreſt their
wordes into an other ſence. But admit that in ſome point there
be ſome fault, as all men are men, &amp; we will not make our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
Apoſtles, there is difference betweene a ſimple ouerſight
and an hereſie, but for that cauſe we may not taxe the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of hereſie, ſeing that we accompt not our Doctors o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
as oracles, or goundes of doctrine.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we confeſſe that we drawe neare to the Lordes
day, and the day is ſo formed, that the breake of the day
goeth before the ſunne riſing, and the ſunne riſing before
noone. The breake of day is neuer ſo cleare as the ſunne riſing,
neither is the ſunne riſing ſo light as high noone, whereof we
conclude, that in the Reformation, there is nothing ſo cleare,
but may be better lightened. Againe, a tree beareth fruicts, that
come not all vnto ripeneſſe, but ſome part become vntimely
fruictes, which the tree letteth fall, &amp; thoſe are ordinarily ſoure,
bitter, wormeaten, &amp;c. and yet the reſt of the fruict which
groweth vntill it be ripe proueth very good. Euen ſo this age
hath brought forth many writers, and infinite vayne writings,
neither haue we as yet ſeene for the moſt part, other then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
fruicts of Reformation, but when the ripe fruict appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
then ſhall we know the excellencie thereof. Hereupon is
it ſaid in the Reuelation, let him that is holy, ſanctifie him ſelfe
better, which teacheth vs to labour for perfection, by correcting
the imperfections that be within vs. Moreouer I ſay that often
times the Catholicke Doctors doe in their Pulpites ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Doctors and obteine all the victorie, where as if they
had to deale with a partie, they might be forced to deuide it: for
he that maketh his own hands to play each againſt other, is ſtill
ſure to winne all, but if he ſhould ſet them to wraſtle with
an other, is in daunger to loſe. But no man can ſay we haue
done amiſſe, in giuing ouer the Catholicke Doctours, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teiners
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2815:20"/>
of ſuperſtitious doctrines, to the end to cleaue to others
which mainteine no ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>Superſtitions then haue ſeparated vs from the Pope, not the
ſtate of the Clergie. For we doe allow of the ſtate of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
as being ordeined by God, ſo long as it cleaueth to Gods
lawes, which doe allow the eſtate thereof, vpon condition, that
they renounce all ſuperſtitions repugnant to Gods word, and
exerciſe equitie, charitie and mercy.</p>
               <p>The Pope and his ſuppoſtes doe ſay,<note place="margin">13</note> that Reformation is a
new matter, and muſt therefore be authoriſed by miracles, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as a principle, that euery new doctrine muſt be authoriſed
by miracle. Which if it be ſo, I ſay their ſuperſtitions ought
rather to be authoriſed by miracles, as being more new then
the religion of the Reformed. For the Popes moſt auncient ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
is the ſame of the Croſſe &amp; of Reliques, which holy
Croſſe Helene the mother of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantine the great found after
the Councell of Nice: &amp; the reſt haue crept in ſince in proceſſe
of time, as Images, abſtinence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mariage, Purgatorie, &amp; ſuch
like: &amp; thoſe which were brought in by Helene the mother of
great Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantin, &amp; grand mother of ſuperſtition, haue already
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued 1260. yeares, which is the terme to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prefixed in the
Reuelation, ſo as thereby we may know, that they are come to
their full periode. I ſay therefore, that the pure doctrine conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
from the Apoſtles vnto the Councell of Nice: &amp; that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions
crept in ſince. This doctrine then which was before
the ſuperſtitions which were brought in by Helene, and by the
Popes augmented, was pure, and yet more auncient then ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition:
and is the doctrine which the Reformed doe ſhoot
at. The Religion therefore of the Reformed, is more auncient
then the Popes ſuperſtitions, and therefore neede not to be
authoriſed by miracles: hauing already bene authoriſed, by
the ſame miracles, which our Lord and the Apoſtles did
worke: and Popiſh ſuperſtition being the newer, ſtandeth in
greater neede of authoriſing by miracles: yea and thus much
will I mainteine, that albeit it had miracles, yet might they not
ſuffiſe to make it of authoritie: For no miracles can authoriſe
that doctrine, which the holy Scripture declareth to be the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2815:20"/>
of deuils.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> Yea and Moſes ſaith, that albeit a Prophet, or
a dreamer,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> ſhould propheſie or dreame any ſuch dreame,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> as
ſhould peraduenture came to paſſe (which were miracles ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to authoriſe any good doctrine) yet if the ſame ſhould
preach falſe Gods, he were not to be beleued, but preſently
to be ſtoned to death. Howbeit I ſay, that in Popery they
preach no falſe Gods, but they doe thinges equiualent thereto.
For euery thing whereto man doth erect any worſhip, is by
that worſhip made a God, ſo that as many Sainctes as they call
vpon and ſerue, by erecting any worſhip vnto them, ſo many
doe they make Gods, and therfore albeit they could worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
to authoriſe the doctrine, yet ought ſuch miracles to be
accompted among the miracles wrought by the Heathen ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
aforetime. But in as much as the Popes fauorers doe ſay,
that Reformation is a new doctrine, and muſt be authoriſed by
ſignes and miracles, I will giue them one, howbeit I will giue it
after the ſame maner as the Lord gaue it to the Scribes &amp; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 39</note>
euen the ſigne of the Prophet Ionas, taking it out of the
holy Scripture, and referring it to a matter which was yet to do.
Likewiſe may I ſay that the peruerſe and adulterous nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
ſignes, but ſhall haue no other ſignes giuen it, then the
ſame that God gaue in the Reuelation, that is, that if we ſee and
that ſhortly, the ſame to be fulfilled vpon the Papacie, which is
foreſhewed of the beaſt, &amp; vpon Rome that which is foretold
of Babylon: alſo that we ſee the faithfull that liue vnder the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
triumph ouer the beaſt, ouer his Image &amp; character,
&amp; the number of his name, &amp; reſtore to Babylon double accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her workes, and to fill double vnto her in the cup that
ſhe hath filled to vs: Then ſhall the ſame be to them a certaine
ſigne, that the Reformation is of God, and that it is the ſeale of
our approbation.</p>
               <p>But what greater miracle doe you craue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee in France
a handfull of the Reformed, committing many ouerſightes in
the ſtate, and many times ſuffering them ſelues to be ſnared
through ouermuch ſimplicitie, ſtill hold out, notwithſtanding
all the ſubtelties and endeuours of ſo many mightie and wiſe
men of this world? I wonder that neuer a Catholicke Doctor

               <p>S. Paul teſtifieth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 3.</note> that abſtinence from mariage is a doctrine
of deuils: I know there may be ſundry cauilles alledged to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
this matter, howbeit it can not be ſo well ſcoured but
there will remaine ſome filth. It may be demanded why he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it a doctrine of deuils. I anſwere, becauſe it is a doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to God. For God ſaid, It is not good that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be alone,
ſpeaking generally of all, as well of the Clergie as of the laitie,
and the Pope thinketh it good that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be alone,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Clergie man, wherein he contrarieth God, &amp; ſo did Satan
contrarie God when he ſaid, <hi>You ſhall dye the death.</hi> Againe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was ordeined for three cauſes, whereof two were expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in mans creation,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> videl. that woman might be a helper to
man,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> and for the generation of children. The third cauſe doth
S. Paule expreſſe ſaying,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 9.</note> that it is better to mary then to burne,
ſo ſhewing it to be a remedy againſt temptations. I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
demande, ſith God gaue this law generally to all men, why
ſhould the Clergie be depriued of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law? For ſith temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
are common, they doe as much aſſault the Clergie as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and they being thus depriued of the common remedie,
muſt of neceſſitie fall, and ſo is this a ſnare which the deuill hath
ſet vp to cauſe them to ſtumble, and a yoke that he hath layd
vpon them vnder the pretence of holyneſſe. Now if any will
obiect the ſaying of S. Paule. <hi>That he which marieth his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth well, but he that marieth her not, doth better,</hi> I aunſwere,
that S. Paule in the ſame place ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Faciat quod vult, non peccat
ſi nubat,</hi> which is, let her do as ſhe ſhall thinke good, ſhe ſinneth
not, though ſhe mary. And proceeding in his purpoſe he ſaith,
<hi>That the father may keepe her a virgine,</hi> it is to be meant, If ſhe
will, according to the former ſaying, That ſhe doe as ſhe will.
This my verſion I authoriſe by S. Paule who ſaith, that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not this to ſet a ſnare: for to force the maydens will, were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2815:22"/>
as much as to ſet a ſhare in her way: and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thereupon, that they which of voluntarie abſtinence
from mariage haue made a law, binding the people to one of
theſe extremities videl. either to forbeare mariage, or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
functions, haue ſet a ſnare and vndertaken more then S.
Paule. In ſumme, we may ſee that the deuils erected this ſnare
to cauſe the Clergie to fall thereat: and thereof it commeth
that S. Paule termeth abſtinence from mariage, a doctrine of
deuils, I ſpeake of the Prieſtes vowed chaſtitie, which is ſubiect
to a law. Euen at the Councell of Nice did the deuils endeuour
to bring this their doctrine into the Church, but Paphnutius
withſtood it, and the Councell would not admit it: whereof we
gather, that the Church vntill the Nicene Councell, was free
from thoſe ſuperſtitions, for the which we haue forſaken the
Papacie: And ſo I now ſay, that if they meane to allow the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Religion, they muſt procure it to be receaued in like
forme as it was at the Councell of Nice. The League labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to bring the yoke of the Tridentine Councell into France,
but we craue the libertie of the Nicene Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, that is, the ſtate
of the Church may be ſuch as it was from the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
vntill the time of the Councell of Nice, while there was

               <p>S.<note place="margin">14</note> Paule teacheth vs to pray in an intelligible language, to

after ſpeaking of the Pope: &amp; turning againe to the Catholicke
people, we will alſo entreat of the Reformed Princes, againſt
whom eſpecially the Pope hath addreſſed his ſclaunders: and
then of the Miniſters and Reformed people.</p>
               <p>The king hath promiſed, yea ſworne to driue all heretickes
out of Fraunce. It is a good vowe that his Maieſtie hath made,
onely the queſtion is to ſee who thoſe be. Now is it ſo that they
be heretickes, which erre in the principles of faith, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they which haue reuolted from the faith are the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes:
The Pope mainteineth a doctrine contrarie to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
which in expreſſe words by the mouth of S. Peter, yea and
of Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe doth forbid the vſurping of dominion
ouer the Lordes inheritaunce, and the making of marchaundiſe
of men, or mens ſoules, as the Reuelation calleth it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is an hereticke, and in performance of the kinges vowe,
ought to be driuen out of Fraunce: I ſay, driuen out of France,
that is to ſay, his dominion driuen out of France.</p>
               <p>It is alledged, that no hereticke ought to ſucceede to the
crowne: To this article may the king of Nauarre well ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
for in him is not to be founde any one ſpot of hereſie,
but it is a ſclaunder of the Pope, who lendeth him this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
to the ende to weaken the partie of the Reformation
and ſo to ſtrengthen the League ſo ſtrongly, that it may
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2815:23"/>
ouerrule both king and commons, and ſhut vp the king in
ſome Couent of Charterhouſe Monkes, for to make one of
the League, a creature of the Popes, and one of the king of
Spaines Pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſioners, king: and through him to trouble the whole
ſtate of Fraunce, and aboliſh, the priuiledges of the French
Church: For long hath the Pope longed to ſet in foot, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a day hath he begun to moleſt the French kinges: now he
ſhieldeth him ſelfe vnder pretence of Reformation: but where
was Reformation at the warres of Millan, when the Popes did
nothing but lay ſnares for the kinges of France, in the behalfe
of the Emperour and king of Spaine? who ſo will peruſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunces
of Bellay, ſhall therein finde examples enough:
yea now albeit the cauſe of the Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not, yet would
he finde occaſions to trouble the kinges of France, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is an eaſie matter for him to finde that pretence, thereby
the more cunningly to compaſſe his driftes. And had he euen
ſet his foote vpon the kinges throate, yet were it no newes, for
he hath done as much to the Emperour: or had he thruſt our
king into ſome Monaſterie, yet ſhould he not be the firſt, either
Emperour or King of Fraunce that the Popes haue couled.</p>
               <p>Many times did I marueile why the Popes ſhould accuſe
the Reformed Princes of hereſie, yea and all Reformation, but
hauing read the 12. Chapter of the Reuelation, where it is ſaid
that the Dragon and old Serpent, which is the deuill, doe accuſe
our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before God both day and night, I was reſolued: for
it is not vnnaturall for the child to imitate his fathers actions.</p>
               <p>The king hath bene counſailed to permit but one Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in
France: the counſell is good, if it may be compaſſed by reaſon.
There be two wayes to atchieue it, or at the leaſt to try it, for
man purpoſeth, but God diſpoſeth. The firſt is the ſame, which
the Turke vſeth in mainteining of Mahometes law, and that
is the ſword: but this meanes is bloudy, cruell and doubtfull,
for the blowes are to be deuided, and he is aſſured of winning
nothing but ſtripes: yea and it is tyrannous, whereof we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the king will neuer take that courſe, vnleſſe he be
forced by the League, &amp; worke tyrannie againſt him ſelfe. For
this we know, that by nature he is no tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: &amp; ſo that if it come
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2815:24"/>
to that paſſe, all Frenchmen in reaſon are to take armes to free
the king from the tyrannie of the League. Alſo to take away
a ſchiſme is to put out a fire with fire or with oyle: But fire is
neuer quenched with fire, but with water: that is, the fire of
ſchiſme muſt be quenched with the water of reaſon, which is
ſtronger, and ſtandeth with more equitie then warre it ſelfe.
The other meanes is ſure &amp; may be performed without bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
yea it is a Chriſtian meane, grounded vpon reaſon, truth
and godlyneſſe. It conſiſteth in reiecting the yoke of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Inquiſition and Councell of Trent, propounded by the
League, &amp; reſtoring the Catholicke Religion to the libertie of
the Nicene Councell, free from the Pope and burthen of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
This courſe if the king would vndertake, we ſhould
neuer neede to feare the League: for albeit the League and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
would cut of all the faction of Reformation, yet ſhould
not Reformation quayle, for God vpholdeth it, and for proofe
hereof, the experience of 30. yeares might ſuffiſe: But if the king
and Clergy would fauour the cauſe of Reformation, the League
would make no greater haſt then to hide it ſelfe. The Clergie
may imagine, that this can not be done without their hurt and
loſſe, in reſpect of diuers donations, made vpon ſome abuſe, or
ſuperſtitions and vnlawfull vſe: hereto I aunſwere, that it is not
neceſſarie, that, that which hath bene giuen to an vnlawfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
ſhould therefore be taken away, but rather conuerted to a
better vſe, as were the 250. golden cenſers offered for a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
by Cores confederates,<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> which were conuerted to a good
vſe, vid<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l. to be turned into golden plates, to be layd vpon the
Lordes altar. Euen ſo that hath bene giuen to pray for prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours
ſoules departed, may be conuerted to inſtructions for
ſucceſſours ſuruiuers, or to pray to God for them: &amp; ſo ſhould
the Clergie encurre no loſſe. But if the Clergie will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with ſo manifeſt reaſon, but obſtinately bending againſt
the truth, ſeeke our ſubuertion, we will leaue them to trye in
vayne, how to root out Reformation and waſt their reuenues:
for we know that in the end they ſhall be forced to come to it:
God can well enough reclaime them, either of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes
or by great puniſhments, and therfore let vs ſuffer them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2815:24"/>
to runne their race: for when they haue runne well, they muſt
ſtay, and yeeld thereto.</p>
               <p>When a man hath a ſute, it helpeth much to doe his whole
endeuour, and to offer his aduerſarie all iuſt and reaſonable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers:
for by that meanes he may bring his aduerſarie to reaſon
and agreement, he alſo cutteth of all ſutes, or els conuinceth his
enemy of frowardneſſe, and ſo iuſtifying his cauſe, enclineth the
Iudge to fauour him. Euen ſo we knowing that we are to deale
with the great Iudge which is God, alſo that we owe a duetic to
our king doe ſeeke to finde out all meanes how to ſatisfie him
with reaſon, and to turne away his wrath, which the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers
doe wrongfully kindle againſt vs, and therefore we offer
to the Catholikes ſo much as in right, reaſon, and equitie we
may, ſo as it is not our fault, and we doe waſh our handes of it
before God: and thus they are to ſee that in contemning the
iuſt motions that we make and propound, they diſdaine not
vs, but the truth which is of God. For if they haue any harme,
it is their owne fault, and God will not puniſh them but vpon
euident &amp; iuſt reaſon, for their contumacie, in that they would
not obey his truth.</p>
               <p>If a man inuiteth his friend to his table, &amp; at dinner offereth
him an apple to eate, and it chaunceth a worme to be therein,
as ſometimes it happeneth, he will not vrge his friend to eate
the worme with the apple, but will giue him leaue to take away
the worme before he eate the apple, euen ſo now the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes
doe inuite vs to eate of the fruict of their Catholicke Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
wherein lyeth a worme, which is the Popiſh ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
yea euen the Papacie it ſelfe, let them then take out the worme,

the Lordes inheritaunce, and of other the conſequences of
the Papacie, as are the ſuperſtitions, which haue borne ſway
ſince the ſaid Councell, and were brought in immediatly
after the ſame, and ſince haue bene augmented and vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vnder the Papacie. I ſay, that if his Maieſtie would ſo
greatly benefite his Realme, equitie would require that it
might be done by the conſent of the Reformed plaintifs, being
called and freely heard.</p>
               <p>This one queſtion will I propound: why our Lord among
his Apoſtles would not haue one greater then an other? alſo
wherefore he hath expreſſely forbidden them to vſurpe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 25.</note>
whereto I aunſwere,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 25</note> that his intent was, they ſhould be
ſubiect to Ciuill dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the Prieſthood of Aaron was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the Iudiciall ſeate of Moſes. And wherefore? We know
that ſomtime there fall out ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which are to be Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the Church,<note place="margin">4. King. 18. 4.</note> as was that of the braſen ſerpent in the time
of Ezechias, and Idolatries in the dayes of Ioſias, and ſuch if the
kinges doe ſuffer,<note place="margin">4. King. 23.</note> the Lord will call them to accompt for them,
and making them accomptable, it is alſo reaſon he ſhould giue
them power to correct, and that this power ſhould not be in
ſubiection to the Biſhops. So did Ezechias and Ioſias bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church of Iſraell, ſuch a Reformation as we craue in
Fraunce, neither therein depended they vpon the high Prieſts,
but as hauing dominion, commaundeth the high Prieſtes to
breake the Idols, and to purge the Temple, neither needed they
to call any Councell for the determining of thoſe matters, but
did with all ſpeede ſet hand to that buſineſſe, to the end to take
away the euill, ſo ſoone as they knew of it. But at this day the
Kings and Princes of Europe, in ſtead of mainteining their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
which God hath giuen them, doe referre them ſelues
to the Pope, and the Pope to the Councell of Trent, which
hath rather empaired then ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded their affaires. Thus do they
as it were ſeeke Phiſicke after a man is dead. And the contempt
of the Priuiledges which God hath giuen them, hath brought
their Realmes and dominions into trouble, namely Fraunce,
where as had the king mainteined the authoritie which Ieſus
Chriſt attributeth to kings, and following the example of Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2815:25"/>
had Reformed the ſuperſtitions of the Church, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
had bene in peace: yea had he employed the forces, which
the League hath employed againſt him ſelfe, in the recouerie of
thoſe countries, which his predeceſſours haue loſt, he might
haue recouered them, or obteined a new crowne. Thus much
more will I alſo ſay, that in caſe his Maieſtie would vndertake
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſing of that which we propound, he ſhould not neede
to feare the threates of the League, which how loude ſo euer it
ſpeake, ſhould ſoone be glad to ſay litle, yea and thoſe that now
dare face his Maieſtie, ſhould ſcarſe find de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes enough wherein
to hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. There is nothing to hinder the king, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the courſe of this aduiſe, from atchieuing by reaſon, that,
which if he labour to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quere by the ſword, he will with great
difficultie bring to paſſe: And ſurely he hath but bad counſell,
that will put him ſelfe into bondage whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he may go free. Ieſus
Chriſt freeth our kings from the Popes yoke, &amp; ſubmitteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to him ſelfe onely: they will not be tributaries to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
&amp; yet ſtoope to his creature. Such as are in bondage ſeeke
to purchaſe libertie, but our kings buy bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage, yea and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dearely: ſome with great treaſures, that are tranſported to
Rome: other with much bloudſhed of their ſubiectes, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their countreis, &amp; trouble of their eſtates: for the Popes
haue troubled many Kinges and Emperours, againſt whom
they haue bent themſelues, euen to the treading vpon their
throates, and vttering contumelious ſpeaches, comparing them
to Dragons, Aſpics and Baſillickes: others they moleſt by
ſtirring vp their neighbours againſt them: and others haue
bought their bondage with the price of their ſcepters and
crownes, whom the Popes haue ſhut vp into Cloiſters and
depoſed from their thrones: neither haue the kinges onely, but
alſo all France bought this bondage very deare, and with much
bloudſhed. O France thou art named France of thy freedome:
but thou ſhalt neuer befree vntill thou freeſt thy ſelfe from the
yoke of the ſclaue of ſclaues, who keepeth thee bound in the
bondage of conſcience and perpetuall trouble of thine eſtate.</p>
               <p>Pope Gregorie ſought to make his Papacie famous by the
correction of the Kale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, wherein he forgat that which ſhould
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2815:26"/>
be the principall in a Kalender, which is to make it begin with
an Equinoctiall or a Solſtice: but admit he did very well, yet
was this correction a matter of ſmall importance in reſpect of
the correction of ſuch ſuperſtitions, as trouble the whole ſtate
of Chriſtendome at this day: whereupon I ſay, that the king
might make a farre more famous and neceſſarie correction,
videl. by correcting the ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that are repugnant both to
the conſcience &amp; eſtate &amp; ſo celebrate the memory of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
with a farre more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Character then Pope Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hath done yea and that after the imitation of thoſe, that haue
bene better qualified in Gods word, then euer was Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie,
namely Ezechias and Ioſias, who were the Reformers of
the Church, Manaſſes alſo though firſt a deformer, yet after al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Reformer likewiſe. S. Paule in the beginning a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and deſtroyer of the Church yet after a builder of the ſame
and ſtill it lyeth in Gods power to raiſe vp ſuch. The League
weeneth to haue brought the king to that ſtay, as to ſet foote
vpon his throat, by laying of ſnares for him at Paris, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his faithfulleſt ſeruaunts from about him. They thinke to
make their accompt to doe all that they may, ſay all that they
dare, and imagine all that they luſt: but all are not out of hart,
that doe diſſemble. The League purpoſed to muffle vp the
French, with the Spaniſh Inquiſition: but the Frenchmens
neckes are not fit for ſuch a yoke. The French naturally and
for the moſt part hath his harte at his tongues and, that is to
ſay, is open, free and without colour, not being a double harted
perſon, neither hipocrite nor diſſembler, as be they that ſuffer
the Inquiſition to bridle them. Wherefore it is a fit meanes to
leade the League to a downfall, and to conuert the Papacie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Popedome aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>The Popes purpoſe in deuiſing the League, was no other
but to make a metamorphoſe of our king, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a more reall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſe
then the tranſubſtantiation, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerting him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a
Hieronimite King, into a Charterhouſe Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke ſometime king.
I know the king is a great Catholicke, yet thinke I not that he
ſo loueth the Pope &amp; his ſuperſtitions, that therefore he would
change his Crowne for a Charterhouſe Monkes coule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:2815:26"/>
As for the Clergy,<note place="margin">2</note> it is no marueile though they would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
their eſtate, for it is a thing naturall, neither would the
Nobilitie vpon neceſſitie doe leſſe for theirs: I will not be a
ſharper cenſurer of their eſtate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt was of the Phariſies:
But alas how lamentable is the wretchedneſſe of thoſe that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ſuperſtition, and perſecute ſuch as will not obey the ſame?
Let them thinke vpon their buſineſſe, it is no ſmall matter to
become Gods enemie: for who ſoeuer oppreſſeth the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
ſubmitting them to a yoke repugnant to Gods word,
maketh him ſelfe an enemie to God. And truly they might
mainteine their eſtate, albeit they abandoned ſuperſtition, yea
and obteine the priuiledge of mariage, which at this day is no
ſmall matter in France, in reſpect of the numbers of men ſlaine
in the warres, and the quantitie of rich enheritrixes left: as well
widowes as maydens. I marueile alſo what reaſon they haue to
withſtand Reformation, which conteineth nothing repugnant
to their eſtate, neither any thing that is not commodious for
them, and choſe rather to cleaue to the Popes, the auncient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
enemies to the kinges of Fraunce and the French Clergie,
who vpon hatred to the French Clergie, haue made a Decree at
Rome, that there ſhall neuer be created Pope of the French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that hatred haue they alwayes ſhewed againſt the
French kinges ſo oft as oportunitie would ſerue, not in wordes
onely but alſo in deeds. But moſt of all I maruell why the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
haue entred the League, to make warre at their owne charge
againſt Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: herein hath the Pope played the Clergie as
braue a tricke of a Phariſie as euer man did: for he hath loaden
them with agreat burthen, whereto him ſelfe would not ſet his
finger: &amp; ſo farre is he from entering into any charges thereof,
that he hath euen waſhed his handes of all. In like maner hath
he alſo brought the king of Spaine into great charges, about
the building vp of this ſea monſter his nauall armie: promiſing
him a million of gold, ſo ſoone as his power ſhould ſet foote in
England, and this million of gold could he well enough wreſt
from the poore by his Bulles and Pardons: but when the king
of Spaines Ambaſſadour came to demaunde this ſumme, his
aunſwere was, that he would not deliuer it before the army had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2815:27"/>
ſet foot on land, ſo that notwithſtanding what ſoeuer the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
earneſtnes, he could obteine nothing, for he told him,
that this money which had bene giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the poore, ought not
ſo lightly to be parted withal: albeit ſince he could employ part
of the ſame, namely 150000. crownes vpon the purchaſe of a
Marquiſate for his nephew. This is a cunning player at the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
game, yet looketh he not whether he be within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
al is one to him ſo that he may get, but in getting he forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing. Now in your opinion, if he thus mocketh the king
of Spaine his eldeſt ſonne, and the chief piller of his houſe, what
will he doe to theſe, whom he hateth of old? will he ſpare them,
or hurt him ſelfe to doe them good? And the League is it any
better for the Clergie, then for him, ſith the Clergie muſt rather
beare the charges then he? No, it is more for the Pope: for it
worketh for the ſtate of the Pope, not for the ſtate of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
conſidering that Reformation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarieth the Popes eſtate &amp;
not the Clergies, but the Pope is not content with making the
Clergie ſpend their reuenues, but withall he forceth them to
ſell their demaines, a matter neuer accuſtomed before. The
auncient kings of Iuda in time paſt, did rather ſell the veſſell of
the Lordes houſe,<note place="margin">2. King. 16. 8. and 18. 16.</note> then medle with the Clergie, but the Pope
had rather make them not onely to conſume their reuenues, but
alſo to ſell temporalties, then to employ the Images and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
Reliques erected contrary to the word of God: ſo deare
vnto him is that that God hateth, and ſo much doth he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne
that which God hath ordeined. Beſides the Clergie may ſee,
how being once burthened with theſe charges, the king hauing
begun to leauie the tenthes, hath ſince continued the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of them: In the beginning they thought they ſhould be
leuied but for one yeare, and ſo to ceaſe, but ſince they haue
bene brought into a cuſtome, and thereof it is come, that the
Clergie conceaued an imagination that this exaction would
neuer ceaſe, without the rooting out of all ſeekers of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and thereupon they conſented to the League, ſo to get out
at once: and in the meane time haue ſold their demaines, and yet
muſt neuertheleſſe pay their tenthes: all which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Reformation is neuer the more rooted out: beſides that,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2815:27"/>
albeit it were rooted out, this ſubſidie would neuertheſſe be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied,
vnder colour of preſeruing the Church from like incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences.
Neither is there any remedy whereby to eſchue this
conſequence; but by taking part againſt the League, which
doth exact theſe reuenues: that is, by declaring them ſelues
ſeruauntes to the king, and enemies to the League, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to the ſupport of their eſtate, ſuch perſons as regard
not the Pope, who hath layd this burthen vpon them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
I doubt not but the Clergie are faithfull to the King,
but neuertheleſſe the League is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracie of the Pope againſt
the crowne of Fraunce: but all that are of the League, are not of
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracie, neither do they vnderſtand the purpoſe thereof:
and the Pope made it not to Reforme the time of Philip the
Faire, when he cauſed the kinges owne children to conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their father: but it is an old practiſe of the Popes, to
ſhuffle the French kinges cardes, and to ſeeke reuenge of the
Pragmaticall Sanction, as well againſt the king as againſt the
Clergie, but he is glad to take the cauſe of Reformation for a
cloake, to the end vnder pretence thereof, to doe that which
otherwiſe would be very hard for him to doe.</p>
               <p>But I pray yon, what cauſe haue they to obey a forrein Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan
Frier, rather then ſome one of the French Clergie? For the
Pope hath bene a poore Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kiſh deuill, that hath caſt his coate
to catch the Papacie, and would now gladly vncrowne the king
to make him a Monke. There be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the French Clergy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Princes, Lordes and men of accompt, whom we might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obey then a Franciſcane at Rome: howbeit if we muſt needs
obey a Franciſcan, are there not enough in Fraunce, that do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deſerue it then he, who was neuer created Pope but vpon
fauour, rather then the worthineſſe in him? But in caſe a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Franciſcan were fitter to gouerne the French Clergie, yet
were it requiſite he were brought into France, ſo to ſpare both
labour and coſt, and to be nearer his flocke, for it is neuer the
propertie of a good ſhepheard, to lye farre from his fold: but
now a dayes we make ſuch ſhepheardes, as doe neuer viſite their
flockes, yea that neuer ſee the flockes, that they entitle them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
ſhepheardes of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:2815:28"/>
To the end to ſhip the Clergy in the League, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that within ſix moneths the Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
extinguiſhed, &amp; now there haue paſſed aboue foure times
12. and they yet neuer the nearer, ſauing in multiplying of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes,
they haue but ſet forward their owne deſtruction, and,
yet are they to take new deliberations. I wonder they know
not that it is in vayne to ſtriue againſt God. There is no cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell
againſt God that can preuaile, well may they make many mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges,
either of Synodes or Eſtates: but if they enter any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
againſt God, he will ſcatter them, yea albeit they hide them
ſelues, yet are they not hidden from him. Let the Clergie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
all the charges they haue bene at, and the purchaſes by the
League returned to the profite of the Clergie: &amp; then let them
come to ſubſtraction, ſo I am aſſured they ſhall finde that the
Clergie hath ſcattered, rather then multiplied, ſo as the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
being put to intereſt, will neuer bring them any profite,
neither yet augment their reuenues: let them recken what
goodes they haue ſold, and what rentes they haue conſumed,
and they ſhall finde that they doe amount to more then that
that hath bene ſold from the Reformed, yet ſhall the Reformed
in the end recouer theirs againe, but ſo ſhall not the Clergie.</p>
               <p>As for the Cardinall of Bourbon, it were better for him to
ſhoot at the ſoueraigne Biſhopricke in Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the crown,
&amp; to practiſe the ſucceſſion of the Crowne for his nephew the
king of Nauarre, yet not by a League or conſpiracie againſt the
king. So might he erect two good pillers to beare vp his houſe:
&amp; this might he doe without ſtirring vp ſuch Tragedies, as are
now ſeene in Fraunce: as alſo the eſtate of a ſoueraigne Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick
might more eaſily be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, in reſpect that already he
is one of the chief Princes of the bloud, and both Primate and
Peere of France, beſides that he ſhould aſpire to that, which ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
with the vocation of his Prieſthood, which alſo he might
enioy during the kings life: for it may be the king ſhall outliue
him, neither will it become him to renounce his Prieſthood,
wherein he hath kept him ſelfe vnto his old age: as alſo he may
thinke, that ſuch as promiſe him the crowne, vſing his pretence
to the ouerthrow of his familie, do well know that charitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2815:28"/>
of it ſelfe, alſo that there is no man, hauing meanes to
diſpoſe of the crowne, but will ſet it vpon his owne head rather
then on a Prieſtes. Beſides in as much as there are ſome whoſe
promiſes, giftes and ſuccours may be ſuſpected, he can not but
ſpeede well in following the Apoſtles counſaile, which is, that
euery man walke in his vocation whereto he is called:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 20</note> he is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
to the Prieſthood, let him then ſo continue, and let him that
can not be Moſes be content to be Aaron.</p>
               <p>I haue before noted for a fault in the Reformed, that they
haue not made ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t offer to the Clergie, of the enioying of
their rightes vnder the Reformation, which is true: but it hath
bene a greater fault in the Clergie, to imagine that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would take from them all that it offereth not. It is moſt
certaine that this foreiudgement hath more hindered the cauſe
of Reformation, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the armes of the Leaguers. For the League
began to worke her effectes but in theſe laſt troubles, where
this foreiudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hath bene an auncient ſtombling blocke of
old in the way of Reformation, neither had the Clergie euer
bent them ſelues ſo ſore againſt it as they haue done, had not
that bene: howbeit it is not foreiudgement giuen, but taken, yea
and by the Clergie taken out of ſeaſon, without ſufficient cauſe
giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, on whoſe ſide there was no other fault,
but a treſpaſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted for want of aduiſement, by vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; miſtaking, neither was there any offence at all, but by
taking the matter ouer ſharpely &amp; indirectly, conſidering that
the Reformation neuer attempted any thing againſt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
but the Clergie againſt the Reformation in all the warres,
namely in the laſt: wherein contrarywiſe the king of Nauarre
hath euidently ſhewed, that he had no quarell to the Clergie, in
that he hath hitherto forborne the Clergie, albeit they entered
into the League againſt him. In deede I ſay, that they of the
Reformation might haue offered the Clergie thoſe things that
I ſet downe, yea and haue procured and craued them, when
they laboured to haue the chambers deuided for the deciſion of
proceſſe. But this is no ſufficient cauſe to kindle ſuch a ſchiſme
as the Pope hath raiſed. For I acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt him the cauſe of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
&amp; foreiudgement, becauſe he alwayes mingled the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2815:29"/>
cauſe with his owne, perſwading the Clergie men that it
generally concerned all their eſtates, and herein haue the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
bene to blame, that they neuer ſought out the ground of this
controuerſie: for had they ſought neuer ſo litle, they had found
that their eſtate was not in queſtion, but the ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which
had they taken away, they had ended all ſchiſme. Whereupon
we perceauing the Popes ſubteltie, who ſeeketh to make the
Reformation odious to the Clergie, by perſwading them that
Reformation will ouerthrow their eſtate, doe raiſe vp a ſhield
againſt that ſhaft, that is, by deuiding the Clergies cauſe from
the Popes, and prouing that Reformation doth not contrarie
the eſtate of the Clergie: beſides, taking the ſame ſhaft, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
it into the flanckes of the beaſt, by prouing that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſhooteth at the Papacie, as being enemy to the Popes
eſtate, becauſe he is the beaſt mentioned in the Reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
hath made warre againſt the Saincts, and being wounded to the
death, ſhall alſo be healed againe, as he hath bene already woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the death by the doctrine of the Martirs, and healed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
for a time: but being now broken out againe, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be cured, and it can not be but deadly and paſt cure.</p>
               <p>For I ſay of the Pope,<note place="margin">3</note> that his eſtate is pernitious as well to
the conſcience as to the ſtate: It was brought in by guile, it is
encreaſed by bribery, and it is vpholden by tyrannie and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiles,
as tyranniſing the conſciences, and troubling the whole
ſtate of Europe. He hath mainteined the ſuperſtitions, of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
Images, Inuocation of Sainctes, Purgatorie, vowed chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and ſuch like, and the ſame will breed his deſtruction. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that Gods word admitteth Eccleſiaſticall dignities, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
the ſoueraignetie after the order of Iethro, but it admitteth not
any domination of an vniuerſall Biſhop: neuertheleſſe if there
were no controuerſie but the degree, yea and albeit there were
ſome abuſes, yet might it be borne: but ſeing it mainteineth ſuch
ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as are directly repugnant to Gods word, &amp; for the
ſame tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſeth the faithfull, it can not be borne: neither can we
doe better, then to abandon it as the enemy to Chriſt and his
truth, yet doe I ſay, that albeit he will renounce all ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet ought not the faithfull to be bound to obey him: for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2815:29"/>
no man can lay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faithfull the yoke which the Lord hath
not layd vpon them: but I ſay that this degree were more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
then the ſuperſtitions which are the doctrines of deuils.</p>
               <p>But to omit all matter of Religion and conſcience, and to
come to the ſtate: wherefore ſerueth the Papacie but to trouble
the ſtate of Kings &amp; Princes? It hath put the King of Spaine to
great charges, and made him buy a reproch very deare: It hath
made him to arme him ſelfe to take a fall, and to ſtoope vnder a
womans arme. It maketh him to mainteine an Inquiſition,
which is but a Popiſh tyranny, and can not but breed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
But what good hath he done in Fraunce, in cauſing
the ſubiectes to enter League againſt their king, yea and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the king againſt him ſelfe? for by deſtroying his Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſubiectes, what doth he deſtroy but him ſelfe? And had the
king employed thoſe forces againſt others, that he hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
againſt him ſelfe, he might with honour haue purchaſed
an other kingdome as great as his owne, and now haue bene at
peace, where he is ſtill in trouble. I ſay that the king hath ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to fight againſt him ſelfe: but not properly the king him
ſelfe, but the League. For the king is a good Prince, but the
League hath againſt his will wrought matters to his hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Againe for what ſerueth the Papacie in Fraunce, but to
ſuck vp her treaſures? Fraunce would not be tributarie to the
Emperour, yet doth ſhe pay tribute to the Empire in the Popes
perſon, who is but a creature of the Empire. Vpon what reaſon
are men to goe to Rome to decide Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, as if in
France there were no man capable of ſuch deciſions? If thoſe of
Rome be better, why cauſe we them not to come into Fraunce,
but muſt ſtill be at new charges to goe to Rome?</p>
               <p>Nay why be not our Parliaments alſo tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> France to
Rome? peraduenture the Romaines may be more capable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
Ciuill cauſes then the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or ſith the Pope hath the
honor to decide the Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, we might giue the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
the deciding of the Ciuill: but if the French be skilfull
enough to decide Ciuill matters, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel enough ſhift with
Eccleſiaſticall, if neede require. But what doth the Papacie for
the French Clergie, but ouerthrow them: by making them ſell
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2815:30"/>
their temporalties &amp; waſt their reuenues to enrich the League,
ſtaruing them ſelues in vayne about rooting out the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
The Clergie warreth vpon me as a profeſſour of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
but I pitie them, ſeing how the Pope entangleth them,
and the League deuoureth them to the very bones. How long
is it ſince Chriſtes Vicar became a Turke, to ſeeke to mainteine
his Religion by the ſword? And of all theſe fooliſh driftes the
people ſmarteth moſt, by encurring infinite loſſes and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes,
vpon a fooliſh fanſie that the Pope hath taken to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
Reformation with the ſword. I pray you if Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
ſhould haue bene ouerthrowen with the ſword, could
one handfull of people haue ſtood theſe 28. yeares in Fraunce?
could they yet haue borne out, if God had not holden them vp,
conſidering how oft they haue bene aſſaulted, and as oft cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuented?
But who euer went about to roote out Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
once planted in his countrie, and hath not laboured
in vayne? Onely the Prince of Parma, who thinketh to haue
floriſhed <gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olily in the Low Countries, but euery bloſſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
not fruict, neither will his ſtalke make any ſheffe
wherewith to enrich the garner. Two thinges will ouerthrow
him. The one for that he hath baniſhed Reformation: the other
becauſe he hath hardly entreated the Catholickes, by deſtroying
their country &amp; boores, as propounding this marke &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that better is a waſt country the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a loſt, yet ſhall we ſee him
leaue that which he hath gotten, yea, &amp; glad if he ſcape with his
skinne. This is a puniſhment that God hath inflicted vpon
Spaine, for perſecuting the faithfull with the Inquiſition: that
ſhe might haue bene rich with the ſpoiles of the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, had ſhe
not waſted them vpon the moleſting of the Low Countryes.</p>
               <p>If the kinges Parliaments were entangled in the Emperours
handes, he would employ all his power to recouer them, and
his Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction being ſnared in the Popes hand,
he laboureth not to recouer it, the cauſe whereof ſeemeth to
be onely becauſe the ſetting them free may coſt him nothing:
for he neede doe no more but forſake the Pope as the Engliſh
&amp; Dutch haue done, neither ſhall he be able to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mouth
and aske, why doe you ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:2815:30"/>
True it is that the Popes eſtate is hurtfull and ruinous, but it
is not hurtfull to any but to thoſe that be his partakers. It is
hurtfull to the king of Spaine, in putting him to great charges
and fooliſh expenſes for nothing: and to Fraunce in ſetting the
whole ſtate in trouble. But what harme hath it done to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
to the Reformed partes of Germanie, or to Suitzerland? it
hath ſpit his venome bnt vpon his owne faction: forſake him,
and he can hurt you no more.</p>
               <p>True it is, that at this time it ſeemeth hard to forſake the
Pope, becauſe of the power of the League: but giue ouer the
League, and let the King and Clergie abandon it, and you ſhall
ſoone ſee both League &amp; Papacy come to naught. And I know
though it ſtay a while, that this will be the end of the game:
when all is done, the League muſt vnleague it ſelfe, and it will
neuer vnleague it ſelfe but with the Popes deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Popes combat againſt the light of the Goſpell, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Martirs and Reformed, hath reſembled the battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the moth &amp; the candle, which burneth firſt her winges,
and then her feete, ſo as ſhe can not leaue the game before ſhe
be wholy burnt. So hath the Pope ſinged his winges in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Germanie and Suitzerland, and can not but continue
the game by the League, vntill the whole body of the Papacie
be burned: you would ſay that the Pope and the moth are
both ſprong out of one double yolked egge, they doe ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
in their fight. Thus much I will ſay, that when the
Martirs complained of the ſuperſtitions, if the Pope had had
any care to ſatisfie their complaintes, his kingdome might
haue continued: But he perſecuted them, and ſo loſt his credit
in the places aforenamed: yea now had the remnant of his
kingdome bene peaceable had he not ſtirred vp the League: he
thought by the League to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found Reformation, and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
it will be his deſtruction. For the Chriſtian kinges ſhall
therby perceaue, that he is a fiſher for Eeles, who ſeeketh to fiſh
onely in pudle water, and can not forbeare troubling the whole
eſtate of Europe. France ſhall know by experience that which
the Reformed could neuer with all the eloquence of Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes
and Cicero haue perſwaded, that is, that the Popes eſtate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2815:31"/>
is ruinous to the people in making them in vayne to waſt the
money, goods, &amp; perſons both of the Clergie &amp; people, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for others dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, ſo as he may bring his purpoſe to paſſe:
and this foreiudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t can not but at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth procure the Popes
ouerthrow, which he hath found in thinking to ouerthrow
Reformation, neither is there Pope, Emperour or King that
ſeeketh the deſtruction of the truth, but deſtroyeth him ſelfe. If
kinges could well conſider this point, they would neuer make
ſuch haſt with their owne harmes to bend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt the
truth: which if euer it tooke place, it is now in this periode
wherein Ieſus Chriſt will raigne, and deſtroy euery kingdome
that ſhall withſtand him, which is a ſong quite repugnant to
the League. Hitherto it hath ſeemed that to get dominion
they neede no more but turne their backes to Chriſt: but now
the caſe doth alter.</p>
               <p>But is not this wonderfull, that ſo ſoone as Ieſus Chriſt
ſhewed him ſelfe to be the Lambe that ſhould take away the
ſinnes of the world, the Wolues with their gluttonous nature
haue come to deuoure him, and at their approch haue founde
him to haue the pawes of a Lyon as being the Lyon of Iuda?
What may this meane, if he be a Lambe, how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to paſſe,
that he hath the pawes of a Lyon, or if he be a Lyon, why bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
he the ſhape of a Lambe? O my friend, he is a Lambe, yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the Lyons pawes, to rent in peeces the wolues that
would deuour him.</p>
               <p>Well, let vs a litle more nearely conſider the Popes goodly
effectes: he hath armed him ſelfe with the Councell of Trent,
as with a Trident or 3. tyned forke to play Neptune &amp; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
the waters. He hath ſhipped his Trident in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Galiaſſes: the South winde would not acknowledge this
new Neptune, but ſcattered his Galiaſſes and brake his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
ſo as he hath but the handle left: that would he now make
a ſcepter, wherewith to play Iupiter vpon earth in Fraunce, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he could not compaſſe to be a Neptune vpon the ſea. But
his Tridents handle is no longer fit for ought but to make a
hatchet ſteale, wherewith to hew out a chariot to march in
more magnificently, but this chariot will proue Phactons
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2815:31"/>
chariot, and ſhortly vtterly ouerthrow his holyneſſe.</p>
               <p>The League likewiſe will be I ſay, the deſtruction of both
Pope and Papacie, which I will proue by two reaſons: one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thereby the Kinges, Clergie and Commons may to their
coſtes learne the hurte that they take by the Popes yoke: and
experience teacheth thoſe thinges, which Rhetoricke was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
able to perſwade. An other, becauſe the effectes of the
League haue hitherto bene very vayne and vnprofitable, and
will be hereafter, ſo as finally the League muſt breake without
working any effect, and it can not breake but with the Popes
ruine.</p>
               <p>But who will hereafter giue eare to the Popes Councels,
knowing them to be ſo pernitious, as by this League they doe
appeare? In it hath he deceaued him ſelfe, by employing his
coyne vpon the purchaſe of his owne deſtruction: for it is moſt
certaine, that the breaking vp of the League is the Popes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
&amp; it will not be lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before he ſhall ſtand in neede of the
peeces therof. He hath alſo deceaued the Leaguers by procuring
them to make great leuies, wherewith to purchaſe mightie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
for nothing. He hath deceaued the Cardinall of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
by feeding him with a vayne hope of the crowne of France,
albeit he purpoſed to beſtow the Crowne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a more factious
perſon then he, he deceaued the king, in labouring him to roote
out the Reformation, to the end afterward with more eaſe and
without controllme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to lay hands vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe, and ſend him
into ſome Monaſterie, &amp; ſo to ſubſtitute an other at his deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And he hath deceaued the Clergy, by cauſing them to waſt
both demaines &amp; reuenues in vayne, and finally he hath begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the people, in bringing them into great calamities of warre,
promiſing them peace, &amp; performing nothing but warre. But
the Reformed could he not deceaued, for they truſted him not.
To be brief he hath deceaued but him ſelf, &amp; thoſe that are his.
But who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagine that God will bleſſe the Popes cauſe, who
termeth him ſelfe Chriſtes Vicare, and yet fighteth with fraude
and perfidie, with treaſon and poyſon, to vphold ſuperſtitions
againſt pietie, falſhood againſt truth, and the doctrine which
S. Paule termeth the doctrine of deuils, againſt the pure and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2815:32"/>
ſound doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Moſt certaine it is, that the League is a conſpiracie of the
Pope againſt the crowne and ſtate of Fraunce: alſo that the
Popes haue ſtill euen of old, practiſed to be reuenged, as well
of the French Kinges, as of the Clergie for the Pragmaticall
Sanction, and of long time haue caſt with them ſelues, how
to ſubdue the Clergie to their domination, as being very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
that they can not atchieue their purpoſe, and now are glad
to make Reformation an argument or pretence, whereby to
bring their driftes to ſome iſſue: and therefore the Pope exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth
the king, in procuring him to labour the rooting out of
Reformation, which is a double weakening of the king. For
thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Reformed in their defences haue ſlaine, hath the
king loſt, and the forces of the Reformed, which might greatly
ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, are thereby alſo made vnprofitable, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto him. After all this doth the Pope cauſe the League to
giue the king a ſpurne with the footein <hi>Salluce,</hi> to the end that
way alſo to exerciſe him, and there to employ the reſt of his
forces: that the kings ſide being thus weakened &amp; the ſtrength
of the League comming on on the other ſide, they may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to doe with him what they liſt. Let the King the Clergie
and all Fraunce hardly thinke vpon this point: it is of no ſmall
conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: it importeth but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole ſtate of France. For
my part I will tell you what I thinke: all ſhall be as others liſt:
yet am I aſſured, that the ſucceſſe of things will ſhewe the right
of mine aduiſe, &amp; wiſe men will allow thereof. Vnder correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I ſay, the king may herein imitate Neptune when he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the windes in Virgill. <hi>Quos ego, ſed motos praeſtat compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere
fluctus.</hi> That is, he may firſt appeaſe all Ciuill warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his owne, and then vſe his owne againſt ſtraungers. A
great rope is ordinarily ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, but deuide it into three or foure
ſmall cordes, and you may eaſily breake it, euen ſo is it with the
Pope: he knoweth the whole power of France to be ſtrong, &amp;
therefore ſeeketh to diſunite and ſeuer them, and to diſperſe
them into foure or fiue factions. One of the Reformed, an other
of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traries, an other the aduerſaries to <hi>Salluces,</hi> the fourth
the League, &amp; the fifth the King, which doe withſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2815:32"/>
the King may reunite to him ſelfe all his ſubiectes, in his owne
defence againſt ſtrangers: and withall ſoone recouer all that the
League hath vſurped, and ſo haue his reuenge for the game.
Thus may the king, if he pleaſe, ſee whether it is better for him
to fauour the Reformed, who are his faithfull ſeruaunts, or the
the Pope that is his ſecret enemie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I ſay that the League is a Popiſh conſpiracie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Crowne and ſtate of Fraunce, yet will I not ſay, that
all thoſe of the League be conſpirators: for I am well aſſured
there be many good men vnder the League, who if they wiſt
that the Pope had conſpired againſt the King, would renounce
both Pope and League, and be the firſt oppugners of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie.
Others there are alſo, which will waxe cold, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee
the League of ſo ſmall effect, or the caſe alter, as vndoubtedly
it will, or elſe if they ſee the king determine to be maiſter: ſo as it
ſeemeth that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may well be adiudged a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpirator againſt
the king, in fauour of the League, before his Maieſtie hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
declared, that he taketh the League to be a conſpiracie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him ſelfe, and withall do preſcribe a time for them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
it, within the which who ſo ſhall not renounce it, but
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue therein, ſhall be holden co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpirators againſt the crowne
and ſtate of Fraunce: and withall pardon all ſuch as ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
therefrom.</p>
               <p>It were alſo requiſite (vnder correction) that the Clergie
ſhould denounce the Pope a ſchiſmatike, for ſetting diuiſion in
the ſtate, and therefore that his Maieſtie, proſecuting the ſteps
of his aunceſters &amp; predeceſſors Kings of Fraunce, ſhould make
declaration of his intent, to vphold and maintaine the French
Church in her auncient priuileges, together with the Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Sanction, amplifying the ſame, and proclaiming the ſame
French Church, free from the Popes yoke and all conſequences
of Popery. To the performing wherof, that his Maieſtie ſhould
alſo create one ſoueraigne Biſhop in Fraunce. Withall his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
might maintaine the Catholique religion, howbeit vnder
the libertie of the French Church, not vnder the Popes yoke,
who contrariwiſe ſhould be denounced in reſpect of his ſecret
malice, an enemie to Fraunce: beſides his Maieſtie ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2815:33"/>
him ſelfe the maintainer of Catholique religion, vnder the
libertie of Gods law, and of the primitiue Church, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Nice. This, if it might pleaſe the King to do, the ſtate of
Fraunce would be appeaſed and ſtrengthened, and the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed,
and the League ſet beſide the ſadle, ſo as malgre all her
endeuors, ſhe ſhould be glad to quaile, and ſo be driuen to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
vp againe, all that ſhe hath deuoured: yea how lowd ſo euer
ſhe be, it would not be long but ſhe would ſing a lower note.
Neither wil I feare to auow (let others thinke and perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelues the contrary if they liſt) that the King and Clergie muſt
now of the two wayes, chooſe one, that is, either to put them
ſelues in the Popes mercie, or to renounce the Papacie. Now if
he put him ſelfe in the Popes mercie, their humanitie may be
well enough knowen, by the curteſie that the Pope ſhewed to
<hi>Fredericke Barbaroſſa,</hi> who referring him ſelfe to his mercie,
kneeled to him, while <hi>Alexander IIII.</hi> then Pope, with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious
ſpeeches, ſet his foote vpon his throate: and nowe if
the King ſhould do the like, the Pope would not put his foote
vpon his throat, but a Monkes coule ouer his head, wherewith
he hath bene long deſirous to hood him: or perhaps he might
eſcape ſomewhat better cheape, if he eſcaped as <hi>Frances Danda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
Duke of Venice, did eſcape the excommunications of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
V.</hi> which was by creeping through the hall vpon all fower
with a halter about his necke.<note place="margin">Suppl. Chron.</note> For the Emperour <hi>Lewes IIII.</hi>
cried Pope <hi>Iohn XXII.</hi> mercie, and asked him forgiueneſſe,
which notwithſtanding, the Pope kept him priſoner in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
three yeares, where in the ende he dyed miſerably.</p>
               <p>But now let vs ſee what the Popes excommunications are:
they are but conſpiracies againſt princes, as appeareth by the
excommunication of Pope <hi>Cregorie VII.</hi> who excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Emperour <hi>Henrie IIII.</hi> &amp; gaue the Imperiall Crowne
to <hi>Rodolph</hi> Duke of Sueuia, who died in the performance of the
Popes conſpiracie. And as for the Popes wickedneſſe, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
in that by a Councell holden at Wormes, and another at
Baſill, an. 1085. he was depoſed from his Papacie, as a ſacrilegious
perſon, and diſturber of the Empire. It is alſo to be noted, that
this <hi>Gregorie</hi> procured the Saxons to reuolt againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2815:33"/>
and alienated his ſubiects from him, yea euen his owne
mother. <hi>Paſcal II.</hi> made <hi>Henrie V.</hi> to rebell againſt his father,
whom he kept priſoner in his towne of Liege, where he cauſed
him to be ſo hardly intreated, that he died, neither would the
ſayd <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſuffer him to be buried. Yet is it to be thought, that
he had no better ground then his predeceſſor, who for the like
doings was depoſed from his Papacie. What greater impietie
can any man deſire then this of the Popes, who ſet the mother
at debate with the Emperour her ſonne, &amp; armed the children
againſt the Emperours their fathers? Likewiſe Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi>
the fourth cauſed the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Lewes</hi> the Meeke ſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpire
againſt their father that they deteined him three yeares in a
Cloiſter, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntill that the French Nobilitie and Clergy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
them, reſtored him and cauſed the children to aske
their father forgiueneſſe. As much would the Pope now doe
to our King, but I hope our Nobilitie and Clergie withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
will not permit it.</p>
               <p>The vanitie of theſe excommunications and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnations
alſo appeareth in that one Pope or Councell releaſeth them
whom an other hath excommunicated, and not onely ſo, but
alſo that ſome one Pope excommunicateth, releaſeth &amp; againe
reexco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth ſome one Emperour, as appeareth by <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke</hi>
the ſecond, who was excommunicated, releaſed &amp; reex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated
thriſe: And, which is moſt of all to be noted, Pope
<hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth being corrupted with money giuen by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
king of Sicill, &amp; the Milaners &amp; other eſtates of Italie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
the Emperour <hi>Fredericke Barbaroſſa:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn of Cremone.</note> Thus are
the Popes excommunications againſt Princes as ſaleable in the
Popes ſhoppe, as the pardons. But what greater trecherie can
we wiſh, then was that of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> who excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
the Emperour <hi>Fredericke Barbaroſſa,</hi> to the end to arme
him againſt the Turkes, and the whileſt ſent his liuely picture
and letters to the Turke, to procure him to be taken? After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Emperour ſeeking to be reuenged of this deede, was
by the ſame Pope forced, as is aforeſaid, vpon his knees to aske
him forgiueneſſe, who beſides in ſpite with bitter wordes ſet
his feete vpon his throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:2815:34"/>
As for the Emperour <hi>Fredericke the II.</hi> him did Pope <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
the III.</hi> excommunicate, and againe in fauour of <hi>Iohn</hi> king
of Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> releaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he was againe by <hi>Gregorie the IX.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
and then might not be releaſed but for money.
Thus are the releaſes of kings from excommunications, as ſale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
alſo as the excommunications and Bulles: This releaſe
coſt him 120000. markes of gold, yet did the ſame Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie
the IX.</hi> againe excommunicate the ſaid Emperour <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke</hi>
the third time, terming him the forerunning of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
wherefore the Emperour might haue appealed as from a
ſclaunder, howbeit if you take it that the Emperours were the
forerunners of the Popes, the Emperour might haue vrged <hi>a
Minima.</hi> This Pope alſo called the Emperour hereticke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it appeareth, that the Reformed Princes are not the firſt
Princes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Popes haue wrongfully excommunicated as
heretickes: for thereof grew the faction of Guelphes &amp; Gibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
which is an euident token that the Popes haue bene no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but perpetuall perturbers of the Empire &amp; whole eſtate of

how oftentimes the Popes haue procured the ſubiectes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolte

matter ſufficient for a whole booke. But what ſtand I vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe
thinges, which are ſo plentifull in bookes? Read the liues of
the Popes, the hiſtories of Emperours, &amp; the Chronicles of the
French kinges, and you ſhall finde hiſtories enough, that eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
doe ſhewe, that the Popes neuer ſerued but to trouble
the ſtate of Europe, euen ſince the time of <hi>Lewes</hi> the meeke, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope <hi>Gregory IIII.</hi> procured his owne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpire, as is aforeſaid. But what greater raſhneſſe and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Iohn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior.</note>
yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> follie and phreneſie would a man deſire, then that of
Pope <hi>Innocent III.</hi> who put the whole Realme of France into
interdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and of <hi>Boniface VIII.</hi> who denounced the Realme
of Fraunce to be fallen into the Popes handes? But this wound
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2815:34"/>
the king applied the remedie of the Scorpion, for it coſt the
Pope his life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides that, king <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire forbad the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of any coyne to Rome. And it is to be noted, that the
Popes quarell was not as then vpon any hatred to Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for that was not yet in queſtion, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a deſire the Pope had
to trouble the ſtate of the Realme. Neither did king <hi>Philip</hi> the
Faire forbid the traſport of any money to Rome as being a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
but as a king deſiring to mainteine the ſtate of France.</p>
               <p>True it is, that the Reformed Princes are not the firſt Princes
that haue bene excommunicated, becauſe they wold not cleaue
to the Popes ſuperſtitions: for Pope <hi>Gregorie III.</hi> exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Emperor <hi>Leo III.</hi> for the ſame cauſe, namely, for that he
would not ſuffer Images in the Churches:<note place="margin">Euſeb. Chronic.</note> wherin it appeareth,
that the cauſe of the Reformed is not ſo new as it ſemeth, beſide
that, it appeareth how ruinous this cup of deuils which is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
is, not only to the conſcience, but alſo to the ſtate, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that it is the ouerthrow both of the Empire and Papacie.
It is the ruine of the Empire, becauſe that for Images this Pope
<hi>Gregory IIII.</hi> procured all Italy to reuolt from the Empire:<note place="margin">Euſeb. Chron.</note> and
it is the ruine of the Papacie, becauſe that for theſe ſuperſtitions
Boemia, England, &amp; moſt part of Germanie haue abandoned
the Pope, as France alſo with the reſt of Europe wil ſhortly do.</p>
               <p>Morouer there is great difference betwene being an heretick
&amp; being by the Pope denounced and heretick: for we know that
the Pope hath ſometimes excommunicated the Florentins, and
the Lawyers haue affirmed the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication to be voyde, as
proceding of hatred, and his hatred againſt Reformation is wel
known to be the hatred of Cain, who hated his brother Abel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Abels works were better then his. Beſides it is a principle
of the Canon law, that one excommunicate perſon can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate
an other, one hereticke can not denounce another
an hereticke, neither one Apoſtate declare another an heretick
or excommunicate perſon: the Pope being ſuch a one we haue
iuſt occaſion to appeale from his ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but we can proue that
he is an hereticke, an Apoſtate from the faith, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
by ſuch Iudges, from whoſe ſentence he can not appeale.</p>
               <p>He is aſſuredly an hereticke which leaneth to a doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2815:35"/>
to the Goſpell: But the Pope leaneth to a doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the doctrine of the Goſpell taught by Ieſus Chriſt:
therefore it followeth that the Pope is an hereticke. My Minor
I proue thus. Ieſus Chriſt in the Goſpell forbiddeth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
whoſe ſucceſſor the Pope termeth him ſelfe, to vſurpe ſuch
dominion ouer the Nations as Kings and Princes doe: But this
doctrine doth the Pope diametrally contrary, vſurping domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ouer the Nations, yea euen ouer Emperours and Kinges:
the Pope therefore is an hereticke. And S. Peter, whoſe ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
the Pope termeth him ſelfe, doth forbid the vſurping of
dominion ouer the Lordes inheritaunce, which the Pope doth
vſurpe.</p>
               <p>Moreuer S. Peter ſaith: There ſhalbe falſe teachers that ſhall
make traficke of men, that is to ſay, make traficke of mens
ſoules, as the Reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth expound it: but the Pope maketh
ſuch traficke by his Bulles: He is therefore a falſe teacher,
and conſequently an hereticke.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> S. Paule alſo, whoſe ſword the
Pope ſaith that he beareth, doth ſay, that ſuch as forbid mariage
&amp; meates, be Apoſtotaes from the faith, alſo that they be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
to ſpirites of errors and the doctrines of deuils: he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Popes, who in their vowed chaſtitie doe forbid
mariage, and in their Lent, meates. Thus the Pope bearing S.
Paules ſword, beareth the ſword that cutteth his owne throat.
And this we muſt alſo note; that there be ſome Doctors which
vphold ſuperſtitions, others which forced by the Popes do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
them, as loth to part from them without their Princes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement:
Now thoſe doe we accompt meere ſuperſtitious
and guiltie of theſe crimes, which vphold and mainteine them:
but as for ſuch as of force doe ſuffer them, it were to be wiſhed
that they were come from among the others, according to the
ſaying of the Scripture. <hi>Come forth of her my people,</hi> whereby we
open them ſuch a paſſage as ſhall not be vncommodious for
them. Out of S. Paules wordes alſo where he ſaith, whoſoeuer
participateth in the cup of deuils is iuſtly exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, that
is to ſay, is excommunicable from the cup of Chriſt, we may
inferre, that ſith the Pope through his ſuperſtitions participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in the cup of deuils, he is excommunicate out of the cup
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2815:35"/>
of Chriſt. Alſo it is a principle in the Clergie law, that one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
perſon, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not excommunicate an other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Pope can not exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate the Reformed Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
him ſelfe by the law of God &amp; teſtimonie of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſtandeth excommunicate, he that is rightly excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
is more excommunicated then he that is ſo but by acte.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Pope is a ſchiſmaticke, in that he hath made a
deuiſion in the ſtate of Fraunce: a conſpirator, becauſe he hath
procured the League to conſpire againſt the King, that is, the
ſubiects againſt their Lord and Soueraigne. And a Church rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
for he hath cauſed the ſale of the demaines of the Clergie.
Here we ſee what a Iudge he is that hath pronounced the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of hereſie againſt the Reformed Princes: an hereticke, a
falſe teacher, an Apoſtata, one that is exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municable, one that
cleaueth to the doctrines of deuils,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> a ſchiſmaticke, a conſpirator,
and a Church robber, who hypocritically ſpeaketh leaſings.
Surely the Popes ſtaffe of excommunication, which he neuer
vſeth but in his conſpiracies againſt Princes, is a daungerous
ſtaffe: howbeit he ought to know, that he hath no power, but
what is ſubiect to the obedience of kings: well may the Paſtors
propound vnto Kinges Gods commandementes, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them to obey theſame, giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warning of Gods threats
and iudgements, in caſe they do not obey him: yea and vpon
their tranſgreſſions thereof, to reproue them, albeit no further
then Gods word doth warrant: yea and all this muſt they do
with great modeſtie, moderation, diſcretion &amp; circumſpection,
watching time conuenient, not to handle them rigorouſly, but
ſeeking to vſe them with reaſon and modeſtie, following the
example of Nathan when he reproued Dauid. True it is that
Elias ſpake boldly vnto Dauid, but his example is rather to be
admired then imitated: for all kings are not Achabs, neither all
men Eliaſſes. The Popes excommunications are Oſtraciſmes,
which he vouchſafeth to none but Kings and Princes. In olde
time the Apoſtles counted it an honor to be ſcourged by the
Scribes &amp; Phariſies, but now it is an honor to be whipped with
the Popes excommunications.</p>
               <p>As concerning the French nation albeit one part of them do<note place="margin">4</note>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:2815:36"/>
know what the truth is, yet dare they not ſay what they thinke,
neuertheleſſe I know, that if occaſion ſhould ſerue to atchieue
libertie, the more they haue bene conſtrained, the more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
will they be to ſhake off the yoke of thoſe that haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
them. Some againe do referre them ſelues to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
care, who many times doe take but ſmall care. In deede I
graunt a man ſhould honor his Curate: but when it concerneth
his ſaluation, that is a matter to be better looked vnto then by
a debitie. If a Marchant be in lawe about a Ciuill cauſe, he will
be glad to haue the opinions of ſundry Atturneys, becauſe him
ſelfe is no lawyer: but his owne iudgement muſt be it that ſhall
teach him of two Atturneyes of contrary opinions, which he
muſt follow: yea ſometime it may ſo fall out, that hauing the
aduiſe of many, he ſhall reſolue him ſelfe vpon one gathered out
of all the others, by the helpe of his owne iudgement, which ſhal
be better then the aduice of any one ſeuerally taken. Euen ſo
when in matters of conſcience they ſhall bring a good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not before entangled, they may finde out thoſe things
that are fit and healthfull for them, peraduenture better then
their Doctors could haue taught them. Who taught the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
to anſwer our Lord ſo wiſely in a matter that ſhe had neuer
before heard of, was it her Doctors? no, but the ſpirit of God.
The ſame is he alſo which is able to teach you the ſame things
which your Doctors vnderſtand not. We knowe that Ieſus
Chriſt is the light of the world, as the Goſpell witneſſeth, and
that this light illuminateth the blind, and blindeth or dazeleth
the eyes of the wiſe, as the Goſpel teacheth. For a man muſt not
ſay: I will not go to the light becauſe I am blind: for albeit thou
art blind, yet mayeſt thou be fit to be illuminated by the light
of the Goſpell: that is to ſay, he that is ignorant, may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
be fitte to learne Gods myſteries, in caſe he be not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly
ignorant. A man at controuerſie with his neighbour,
will inſtruct his Atturney in his right, albeit his Atturney be a
lawyer, and him ſelfe but a paiſant or a clowne: euen ſo may
you ſhewe your preachers, what you haue ſeene and knowen
concerning the truth, thereby to induce them with mildneſſe to
ſeeke your ſaluation: yea, ye may require it euen of your King,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2815:36"/>
ſith it concerneth the ſaluation of your ſoules, then which there
is nothing of greater importance. Beſides you can not enioy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
aſſured peace, but by making atonement with God, of whom
do depend both peace and warre: and the meane to growe to
atonement with him, is to take away that which offendeth him
that is, ſuperſtitions, as images with the worſhip thereupon
depending. Is it not better to renounce them, then to languiſh
in perpetuall miſerie, to be entangled in a perpetuall warre, or
to haue ſuch a peace as is but a renuing of warre, either to enioy
a demie peace, as it were a ſunne betweene two cloudes, in lieu
of an aſſured peace, that may be eſtabliſhed by the meanes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
which if you follow not, you ſhall languiſh in warre
without enioying your commodities, which for the moſt part
ſhall remaine ſubiect to the ſouldiour and thiefe, as your cattell
to be driuen out of your paſtures, and your tillage to ceaſe: ſome
of you to be taken and ranſomed, others to die of the enemies
ſword, and ſo to leaue their widowes and orphanes deſolate, yet
doth not the end of all theſe calamities depend vpon the ſword:
for how long haue we hoped for it, and yet can not get it? For
it is moſt certaine, that when all the men in the world ſhal haue
vndertaken what they liſt, after they ſhall haue laboured in
vaine, Fraunce ſhall be forced in the ende to ſhut vp all her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
by ſharing the controuerſie with the Reformed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
eche muſt part with ſomewhat of his: as the Reformed to
graunt the Clergie all their priuileges, and the Clergie to yeeld
to their iuſt complaints, by aboliſhing their idolatries and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions
repugnant to Gods word: and ſuch of the people as
haue any knowledge, authoritie, wealth or zeale, to employ all
in the ſetting forward of ſo great a benefit to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth.
Is not ſuch an aſſured counſell which may be giuen to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
both of King and Clergy, &amp; the peace of the people, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a bloudy aduice, tending to root out of Fraunce one of
the factions, which hath taken ſo ſure anker hold, that it can not
be deſtroyed without the ouerthrow of the other? Some haue
perſwaded the French nation, that Reformation hath bred all
the calamities now ſeene in the world: but in troth it is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
that hath bred them, but ſuperſtition, and the Pope
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2815:37"/>
for maintaining his ſuperſtitions, hath troubled the whole ſtate
of Europe, and God being offended therewith, doth puniſh vs.
Hath not God in his law promiſed, that if his people doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
his law,<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> he will poure vpon them plentie of bleſſings, as a
land flowing with milke and honie, with peace and quietneſſe
in the land: that he would be vnto them a wall of braſſe, and
would ouerthrow their aduerſaries, ſo as he would put a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
to flight, and make a thouſand to purſue ten thouſand?
Likewiſe, that if they forſooke his lawes, he would ſend them a
heauen of braſſe and infinite other calamities, ſuch as this day
we ſee in Fraunce. Being thus ſcourged, we ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the hand of God: the horſe knoweth the riders hand that
tameth him, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſhould we know that it is God that chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
vs, and knowing it, we ought to ſeeke if there be any euill
in vs, that we might amend it, namely, whether there be any
thing repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to his lawes, that may prouoke his wrath. Then
ſhall we finde that ſuperſtition is repugnant to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that his wrath can not be appeaſed, but by aboliſhing this
euill, and cleauing to his ordinances: ſo ſhall we haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the value of Gods fauour. I know that ſome do thinke
thoſe promiſes are become old: but they can not waxed old,
it is our old Adam that is growen old, not Gods promiſes.</p>
               <p>True it is that the literall ceremonies are growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of date,
but Gods promiſes depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not thereupon: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe God
him ſelfe faith: <hi>I neede not your ſacrifices, your Sabaoths, or your
new Moones.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſay. 1.</note> But his promiſes are made to thoſe that ſhall obey
the lawes of the Lord, whereby the worſhip of God is kept
pure, &amp; all contrarie ſuperſtition taken away. It is the fulfilling
of his lawes, which bringeth his bleſſing and peace vpon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
&amp; the tranſgreſſion thereof that bringeth deſtruction vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Nations:<note place="margin">Ierem. 7. 22.</note> It is alſo to be noted that God in Ieremie doth ſay,
<hi>When I brought your fathers out of Egipt. I ſpake of no ſacrifices,
but commaunded them to obey my voyce.</hi> As alſo we ſee that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
who hath mainteined the puritie of Gods lawes theſe 30.
yeares, hath enioyed an aſſured peace vnder the handes of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and yet ſuch Realmes as be gouerned by men haue bene
troubled: for that kingdome hath God preſerued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2815:37"/>
&amp; ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemies, &amp; to that natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath bene a wall of braſſe.
Euen when the League couered the Ocean with Galiaſſes and
ſhips of both rocke and Canon proofe,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> God ſent the winds (his
angels, as S. Paule termeth them) to ſcatter his aduerſaries. In
ſumme,<note place="margin">Ezech. 20.</note> whereſoeuer a people is that obſerueth Gods lawes, the
ſame ſhall euery where finde a land of Chanaan, that floweth
with milke and hony, and Gods protection to ſerue for a wall
thereto. As alſo when ſoeuer a people ſhall turne from Gods
lawes, and follow ſuperſtition repugnant thereto, the ſame ſhal
finde a braſen heauen, and Gods wrath againſt it. So as I doubt
not openly to auouch to the French Nation, that they haue no
more to doe, but to choſe whether they had rather languiſh in
perpetuall trouble, prouoking the Lord with their ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
or to attaine to peace of conſcience and ſtate, by obeying Gods
lawes, and ſhaking of the yoke of the Pope and his ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Then if they thinke good to abandone ſuperſtition, their
ſupplications may greatly moue the Kinges harte, and induce
him to miniſter that iuſtice to his people.</p>
               <p>Now will I come to the Queene of England:<note place="margin">5</note> ſhe I ſay is a
wiſe &amp; a vertuous Princeſſe, &amp; her vertue and wiſedome hath
appeared in theſe three thinges. Firſt, that ſhe hath mainteined
her people in peace, when all Europe was in trouble: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that ſhe hath gotten the victorie of her enemies, both open
and ſecret, domeſticall and trayterous: and thirdly that her ſelfe
hath bene a partie and fauorer of the Clergie, which may be a
moſt beautifull miror and example to Fraunce, and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
when ſoeuer God ſhall vouchſafe to call them to Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
yet in all this are we to confeſſe Gods fauour, who
hath endued her with ſuch wiſedome and vertue, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
the ſame with his bleſſing, which hath bred her peace,
giuen her the victorie ouer her enemies, and mainteined the
eſtate of her Clergie: ſhe is a ſecond Debora triumphing ouer
Siſara,<note place="margin">Iudg. 4.</note> and iudging Iſraell vnder a Palme tree. The Palme tree
doth in deede belong vnto her: I ſay the victorious Palme tree,
ſith ſhe triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pheth ouer her enemies, which are enemies to God
and his people: and vnder this Palme tree doth our Debora
iudge Gods people, hauing mainteined the gouernement and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2815:38"/>
ſtate of the Clergie, which God hath ordeined by his law, and
confirmed in the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The Pope hath preſumed to commaund both in heauen and
earth: he hath endeuored to open heauen with S. Peters kayes,
and to make himſelfe feared with S. Paules ſword. And the king
of Spaine hath thought to become Monarke of the world, to
commaund alone vpon earth, and to poſſeſſe the ſeas alone, as
well Eaſt as Weſt. And theſe two are come into the North to
be ouercome by a woman. Thus doth God chaſtiſe his enemies,
and thus doth he crowne his choſen. The Giant Goliah was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne
by a ſhepheard, yet was that ſhepheard a man: and
behold here two Goliahs, the Pope and the King of Spaine, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from top to toe, to cauſe them ſelues to be beaten by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
I will therefore celebrate the praiſe of the Chriſtianly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Debora, who with her Atlanticke ſhoulder, leaning v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Deuine fauor, hath vpholden the Reformed Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
heauen, I ſay the heauen of the Clericall eſtate vnder the
Reformation. Neither call I her the Engliſh Debora, but the
Chriſtian Debora, becauſe the good that ſhe hath done to the
Church in vpholding the ſtate of the Clergie, redoundeth not
to England onely, but to all Chriſtendome, ſith we are to looke
that Fraunce ſhould grow to the ſame Reformation, whereto it
can not come, but by taking example of this Princeſſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
the ſtate of the Clergie, and the like wil al other places do
that ſhall conuert to Reformation. And this was wiſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of her Maieſtie, for the ſtate of the Clergie, is the honour
of her Realme, &amp; one piller thereof. She hath no enemie but the
Pope, who, had the ſtate of the Clergie bene ouerthrowen, had
had more fauourers &amp; fewer reſiſtants able to withſtand him.
Thus hath God made the portion of Leuy equall with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
as well for that he would not that they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath choſen
for his inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſhould be in worſe ſtate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was requiſite that Leuy ſhould in part, be the vpholder
of his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus alſo the Clergy ought to be in part a piller
of the eſtate. Two notes of the gouernment of this diſcreet En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Elizabeth and Chriſtian Debora be theſe: firſt, that vnder
her firſt had Reformation free and full courſe throughout En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2815:38"/>
next, that by her alſo the ſtate of the Clergie hath bene
preſerued. In Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce God hath purpoſed to maintaine the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of the Clergie, which are the honor of Fraunce, wherein
France is bound to Queene Elizabeth, for ſhewing the way how
to come to Reformation without endomaging the Clergie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the priuileges of the Clergy might be better kept in France
then they haue bene in England. To blemiſh the vertue of this
Queene, ſome may alleage the Realmes that haue kept their
people in peace with the yoke of the Spaniſh Inquiſition, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I aunſwer, that the ſame is a tyrannous yoke of the Pope,
which can not be but ruinous to thoſe that maintaine it. When
a man boweth a tree to the earth contrary to nature, if it chance
to ſcape, it ſhooteth as farre to the contrarie ſide, and ſhaketh a
long time from ſide to ſide before it can finde any reſt, beſide
that, if in riſing it light vpon him that bent it contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it giueth him ſuch a blow, that it caſteth him downe: and
euen ſo will it happen to thoſe, that preſerue their peace with
the tyrannous yoke of the Inquiſition. For if a man ſhal in their
countreys, proclaime libertie according to Gods lawes, againſt
the tyrannous yoke of the Inquiſition, all the world will come
running. And this Inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will breed the ouerthrow of their
eſtate that haue mainteined it, for no tyrannie is durable: And
God eſpecially will reuerſe ſuch tyrannie ouer the conſciences.
But the peace which this Princeſſe hath mainteined, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the firme rocke of Gods lawes, whereby it is vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and I would to God the Queene mother had in her time
ſo ſought the peace of Fraunce. I would to God our king who
loueth the peace of his people, could ſo haue mainteined it in
his Realme, as the League had neuer come to ſhuffling of the
cardes: yea I would to God his Maieſtie, who loueth quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
would harken to ſuch right meanes as ſhould be giuen
him to mainteine quietneſſe in his land. He hath bene made
to beleue, that by warre he ſhould attaine reſt. Behold a goodly
meanes to come to quietneſſe. It is an eaſie matter to marke
the time when warre beginneth, but it is not ſo eaſie to know
when it will end. Euen this warre hath already continued too
long, and it is likely to accompany him to the graue, to ſhorten
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2815:39"/>
his dayes, or to impoſe vpon him ſome Monkiſh life wherein
there is more ſuperſtition then libertie.</p>
               <p>As for the king of Nauarre,<note place="margin">6</note> ſith the Sea League hath encur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſhipwracke, he is the ſooner, but not the more to feare: for
God hath giuen him both courage and valour to defend and
mainteine him ſelfe, neither is he the weakeſt of the Reformed
Princes, as alſo his enemies know that at his handes there is
nothing to be gotten but ſtripes, the gayne is ſmall and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but the hazard great and euident. It is no great wiſedome
to begin to flay an Eele at the tayle, yet muſt the League either
in duety or in honor proceede, ſith it hath begun, and either
by force or furie, valour or trecherie, proweſſe or rage, try what
it can do againſt him, be it but to ſhew the tricke of a maiſter, as
it lately did in England, or to iumpe faire to the ground, ſo to
breake the necke therof. But God who hath ſet him on worke,
and in whom he hath repoſed his confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhall ſupport him,
as he is able enough to doe. Howbeit in this action my greateſt
pleaſure is, that the king of Nauarre hath no enemies but Gods
enemies, that hate him becauſe he doth mainteine the cauſe of
Gods children, yet haue they offered him great offers to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the cauſe of Reformation, neither can it be but they muſt
needes fall, becauſe God whoſe purpoſes are cleane contrary to
theirs, will ouerthrow their purpoſes, and vphold the king of
Nauarre, who meaneth no other but to doe well.</p>
               <p>There are vnder the Reformation ſome Magiſtrates, that
haue ſtill enioyed not onely their goods, but alſo their offices
and the kings pay, which ſo fell out, by reaſon of ſome Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
liuing vnder the Reformation, being carefull for their
eſtate, and looking for a peace to be concluded were mindefull
of them ſelues: and as reaſon would, prouided for their owne
affaires: euen ſo, had it bene thought vpon, might there haue
bene ſuch prouiſion, as the Clergie, euen vnder the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhould haue enioyed their benefites: whereby if it had
bene ſo done, we ſhould haue had a great part of the Clergie,
which now doe ſtrengthen the League, to haue taken our
partes: For certainly there were many which deteſted ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and would haue baniſhed it, had not their ſtate or liuings
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2815:39"/>
withholde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. It is a matter hereafter to be looked vnto: for
had it bene well ſeene to, the Churches would haue encreaſed,
where now for theſe 28. yeares ſpace they haue ſtill diminiſhed:
howbeit with Gods helpe, it is neuer to late, and therefore it
ſuffiſeth vs we prouide better hereafter.</p>
               <p>The king of Nauarre hath ſhewed him ſelfe wiſer, more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
warie and circumſpect then his aduerſaries, in that he neuer
would during the kinges life, bring into queſtion the right of
ſucceſſion to the Crowne, but ſtill bare and conteined him ſelfe
within the bandes of iuſt obedience &amp; due reſpect to the king:
neither euer employed his weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to offend, but iuſtly, &amp; vpon
iuſt cauſe &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraint had recourſe to thedefenſiue armes, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the law of nature. And beſides returned as friends, ſuch
as came againſt him as enemies, &amp; ſought to ouercome him with
ſtrong hand, refuſing to take any raunſome of them, albeit they
were able to pay largely, wherein he ſheweth that he maketh but
a paſtime of his enemies endeuors: like as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do vſe to laugh at
the vaine endeuours of litle children, who hauing giuen a blow
(as they thinke very great) with their hand yet wet with the
nurſes milk, to a man that doth but ſmile at their vayne choler,
doe imagine they haue done ſome great acte, ſo as if a man ſtart
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, and ſeeme to weepe, it bredeth infinite contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as
weening to haue obteined a great victorie: Thus may we play
with the mighty, when they loyter in exerciſe of childrens pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime.
Neither ought any man to couet to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, but to know
how to commaund: and to know well how to commaund, it is
requiſite he know how to obey: As well in the one as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is wiſedome and dexteritie neceſſarie. S. Paule teacheth
that a Biſhop that gouerneth not his familie well, can neuer
well gouerne the Church. By an argument taken of an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
reaſon, I ſay that he that can well and diſcretly gouerne a
ſmall gouernement, can alſo well diſcharge a greater office. I
ſec many that affect great offices, but neuer labour to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the ſame. Neuertheleſſe the King of Nauarre maketh him
ſelfe ſo much more worthier the Crowne, as he doth leſſe affect
it, by leauing the ſucceſſe thereof in Gods hand.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Miniſters of the Reformation,<note place="margin">7</note> ſome there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2815:40"/>
are of great zeale and learning, ſuch as haue ſuffred much for the
puritie which they haue taught, &amp; haue bene content with litle,
whereby they deſerue great commendation. Neither deſire I any
more, but that ſtill they may be more and more carefull for the
peace of the Church: for ſuch contentions there haue bene, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
among the Reformed, as haue not greatly auailed to edification:
and herein I greatly commend Bucer, yea and honor his aſhes:
for he would neuer leane to any the partialities among the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
but bare him ſelfe quietly betweene both parts, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
innouated any thing in the ſtate of the Clergie. Neither
ſhould we endeuor to triumph ouer our brethren, but ouer our
enemies. For my part I would not ſeeke to triumph ouer the
Clergie, but ouer the Papacie, which is the Beaſt, ouer whom we
are promiſed to triumph in the Reuelation. And as for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
I wiſh, by reaſonable offers and iuſt admonitions, to induce
them to participate with vs in the triumph ouer the Beaſt, by
renouncing her ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>As for the Engliſh gouernment, I ſay that it is grounded v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Gods word, ſo farre foorth as it concerneth the ſtate of the
Clergie, inſtituted in the olde Teſtament, and confirmed in
the Newe.</p>
               <p>And concerning the gouernment of the French Church, ſo
much as concerneth the equalitie of Miniſters, it hath the
like foundation in Gods word, namely in the example of the
Apoſtles, which may ſuffiſe to authoriſe both theſe formes of
eſtate, albeit in ſeuerall times and places. None can denie but
the Apoſtles among them ſelues were equall as concerning au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
albeit there were an order for their preſedence. When
the Apoſtles firſt planted the Church, the ſame being ſmall &amp;
in affliction, there were not as yet any other Biſhops, Prieſtes,
or Deacons but them ſelues: they were the Biſhops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
and together ſerued the tables. Thoſe men therfore whom
God raiſeth vp to plant a Church, can do no better then after
the example of the Apoſtles, to beare them ſelues in equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
for this cauſe haue the French Miniſters, planters of
the reformed Church in Fraunce vſurped it, howbeit prouiſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally:
for it is a matter auowed, that they hold their diſcipline
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2815:40"/>
but by prouiſion, reſeruing libertie to alter it according to the
accurrences. But the equalitie that reſted among the Biſhops in
the primitiue Church, did increaſe as the Churches increaſed:
and thereof proceeded the creation of Deacons, and afterward
of other Biſhops and Prieſts: yet ceaſed not the Apoſtles equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
in authoritie, but they that were created had not like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
with the Apoſtles. But the Apoſtles remained as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine
Biſhops, neither was there any greater then they. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
do I inferre, that in the ſtate of a mighty &amp; peaceable church,
as is the Church of England, or as the Church of France or ſuch
like might be, if God ſhould call them to reformation, the ſtate
of the Clergie ought to be preſerued: for equalitie would be
hurtful to the ſtate, and in time breede confuſion. But as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
continued in this perfect equalitie, ſo long as their new
planted Church was ſmall, ſo ſhould equalitie be applied in the
planting of a Church, or ſo long as the Church continueth
ſmall or vnder perſecution: yet may it alſo be admitted, as not
repugnant to God word (ſith it hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place in the Church)
in thoſe places where alreadie it is receaued, rather then to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
any thing. I ſay therefore, that euen in the Apoſtles time,
the ſtate of the Clergie increaſed as the Church increaſed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was the gouernement vnder the bondage of Egypt, &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the peace of the land of Canaan alike: for the Iſraelites had
firſt Iudges, and as their ſtate increaſed, they had Kings. God
him ſelfe likewiſe firſt dwelt as a ſhepheard in a Tabernacle
built by Moſes, but afterward as a king, in a houſe built by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.
And the tree of life beareth twelue fruicts, according to
the twelue ſeaſons of the yeare, whereby we are taught, that
ſuch as haue charge of the Lords garden, muſt vſe the fruictes
thereof according to their ſeaſons. It is alſo to be thought, that
the Miniſters of the Reformation, which planted Reformation
in Fraunce, had reſpect to their buſineſſe, and to the worke they
tooke in hand, when they brought in this equalitie, which was,
to plant a Church, and to begin after the maner of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
when they planted the Church at Hieruſalem: as alſo they
meant not to reuerſe the ſtate of the Clergie, either to ſubmit it
to their orders, whenſoeuer the Clergie or whole ſtate of France
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2815:41"/>
ſhould happen to admit Reformation. But their purpoſe hath
tended to ouerthrowe ſuperſtition, and in the meane time to
beare them ſelues according to their ſimple equalitie, which in
deede was the true meane to Reforme the Church, whereas had
they meant both to aboliſh ſuperſtition, and to reuerſe the ſtate
of the Clergie, they ſhould with one hand haue reformed the
Church, and with the other haue deformed the ſtate. And they
that preſumed that Reformation muſt needes ſubuert the ſtate
of the Clergie, conceaued that foreiudgement out of ſeaſon, and
without any ſufficient cauſe, &amp; their foreiudgement hath bred
great calamities in Fraunce. Wherupon I inferre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he which
would take occaſion, of the equalitie brought in into Fraunce,
to reuerſe the eſtate of the Epiſcopall Clergie among the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
ſhall greatly wrong the cauſe of thoſe, who therevnder
haue reformed Fraunce, and had neuer that intent: as alſo they
ſhould reſemble the dogges that would go into the vineyard,
but carie a yoke at their neckes that keepeth them out: for they
ſhould carie with them the let, that ſhould hinder them from
compaſſing their intents: for there is nothing that hindereth
from achiuing to perfection, but it may be accompliſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preiudice to the ſtate. Ieſus Chriſt taught perfection, yet
ſpake he neuer againſt the ſtate, but alwayes excepted it, ſaying,
that theſe things we muſt do, yet not leaue the others vndone,
neither can there be any good thing done with the ouerthrow
of the ſtate, but may more commodiouſly be done without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
to the ſtate. And Chriſt when they came to tempt him,
excepted the ſtate, not onely in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, but alſo
in Ciuill, ſaying, <hi>Giue vnto Ceſar that belongeth to Ceſar, and to
God that belongeth to God:</hi> as alſo he would take no notice of
Ciuill iudgement, when he was required to agree a man with
his brother, teaching vs by his example, diſcretly to vſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
in time and place. As alſo it were but a bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to ſay, there be abuſes in the ſtate, and therefore we muſt
ſubuert the ſtate, but it were a good conſequent to ſay, there
be abuſes in the ſtate, they muſt then be corrected, albeit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preiudice to the ſtate. I ſay the reaſon is not altogether
like when there be ſuperſtitions contrary to conſcience: for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2815:41"/>
then muſt we forſake them, and ſeparate our ſelues therefro, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that which is ſpoken of the whore of Babylon: <hi>Come
forth of her my people, leaſt you be made partakers of her woundes
and plagues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Miniſters haue vſurped their equalitie prouiſionally,
after the example of the firſt ſtate of the Apoſtolicke Church,
not to intrude them ſelues to eſtabliſh a gouernement in a
kingdome: for it was not Aaron that built the Tabernacle,
but Moſes, neither was it the high Prieſt that built the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but Salomon: no it was not Aaron that ordeined the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
gouernement euen in Iſraell, but Moſes, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth
it to the paſtors, to ordeine Eccleſiaſticall gouernement,
but to Princes. The paſtors duetie is to cauſe it to be obſerued
&amp; inſtruct the conſciences: and alſo the Princes might do well
to cauſe that which God hath eſtabliſhed to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can reproue the Recabites for their auſtere life, in that
they would not vſe either wine or houſes, but were content to
drinke water &amp; to dwell in tentes or tabernacles: but had they
condemned all that vſe wine or houſes, then had them ſelues
bene condemnable. Euen ſo man can condemne the French
Miniſters for being content with their equalitie and with litle.
But if they ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne all that vſe Eccleſiaſticall dignities
&amp; Church goods, them ſelues ſhould therein be condemnable,
neither doe they condemne them. S. Paule ſpared the Church
and laboured with his hands, yet did he not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne thoſe that
vſed the Church goods which he ſpared, but ſhewed that that
which he did was vpon fauour, not of duety, as acknowledging
the Churches to be poore, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo likewiſe may a man forſake a
benefice offered him, yea &amp; admoniſh others to do the like, but
he may not compell any.</p>
               <p>Other matter doe I not require, but that we may be more &amp;
more circumſpect, as ioyning diſcretion with zeale. Zeale is a
goodly matter, and it is good to vowe the harte vnto God: but
all ſacrifice muſt be ſeaſoned with ſalt, and this ſacrifice of our
hartie zeal and voluntary oblation muſt be ſeaſoned with the
ſalt of wiſedome and circumſpection.</p>
               <p>Hetherto haue I ſpoken onely of ſimple ceremonies, to ſhew
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2815:42"/>
that they are no cauſe of our ſeperation from the Pope, becauſe
they be of them ſelues indifferent, or at the leaſt tollerable, as
not being forbidden by Gods word, ſo long as we attribute no
vertue of holineſſe vnto them. For the reaſons that moued the
Apoſtles ſo ſore to beate downe the ceremonies of the law, was
becauſe the people did ground their righteouſneſſe and merite
of workes thereupon, yet can not we condemne the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that vſe any ceremonies, neither the French Miniſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they vſe none. The French Miniſters doe reiect them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they will not retaine any token of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Popiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
whereas others haue ſtill kept ſome, becauſe they wil
not ſeeme to innouate too much: either part haue their diuers
conſiderations, yet neither contrary nor wicked. But this I may
ſay, that in theſe thinges the greateſt ſimplicitie is beſt, but this
ſimplicitie may be moderated hauing reſpect to ſuch as we are
to deale with, neither doth circumſpection any whit hurt at all.
And I commende our French Miniſters, for that albeit they vſe
none, yet they teach them to be thinges tollerable. For in deede
they are ſuch, as no man ſhould be bound vnto, except vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Princes pleaſure, who is not to be diſobeyed or ſtriuen withall,
for matters of them ſelues tollerable: for the which we ought
not to condemne one an other, as we proue by the Apoſtles
wordes, where he ſpeaketh of thinges ſacrificed to Idols, for the
which he will not that we ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne, but beare one with
an other: and with all haue a reſpect to the conſciences of the
weake: For if for the foode that entreth into the body, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
bene ſacrificed to heathen Idols, we may moue no ſtrife,
much more ſhould we make none for apparell, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
onely a gowne or ſuch like, which haue bene vſurped
by ſuch, as imagined by ſuch ſuperſtitious habit to ſerue God
and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now to the Reformed againſt whom the whole furie of the
League is bent.<note place="margin">8</note> They are to ſuffer, yet neede they not greatly to
feare, for their deliueraunce is at hand. And what ſhould they
feare? the world? it is a vanquiſhed monſter that is ouercome,
ſaith not Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Reioyce my little flocke, for I haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the world?</hi> Shall they then feare leaſt the ſclaue of ſclaues
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2815:42"/>
ſhould ouercome the Lord of Lordes, and triumph ouer the
king of kinges?<note place="margin">Iudg. 14.</note> If the Philiſtins aſſaile vs, we haue in heauen
a mighty and valiant Sampſon that will deliuer his people, yea
ſuch a one as is not ſubiect to the deceit of a wench. Shall we
then feare a wench, whom we ſee buſie about ſpinning of lines,
whereof to make a League, to binde our Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pſons hands &amp; feete
with a thred of towe? League well thy League thou Romiſh

heape League vpon League, and corde vpon corde, that he
eſcape not, for thou muſt not hope to pull of the haire of our

ſleepeth, for if he begin to wake and ſo breake thy bondes, and
vnleague thy League, thou ſhalt ſee thy Philiſtins take their
carrier after a ſtraunge maner. But let vs looke vpon the ſtate
of the Church heretofore, thereby to be taught hereafter. The
Iſraeliticall Church began by ſhepheards, that were captiues in
Egypt, and came thence triumphantly hauing Princes for their
Iudges, and afterward Kinges that ſubdued their neighbours.
The Chriſtian Church began by the imagined ſonne of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter,
and grew forward by the poore Apoſtles, of whom the
beſt qualified were fiſhers, who with one hand fiſhed for fiſh,
and with the other for men. The Romain Emperours their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
perſecuted them, ſo did alſo the Apoſtates, yet was the
Galilean at the laſt faine to ouercome. And the Reformed
Church began by poore men, whom a marchant of Lyons fed,
adminiſtring vnto them both bodely and ſpirituall food. They
haue bene perſecuted, yet haue they ſtill encreaſed, ſo as at this
day there be Kinges and Princes, that accompt them ſelues ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
by this profeſſion, and we ſee Pharao the perſecuter of
Gods people periſhed in their deliueraunce. The kingdome
alſo of Babylon, which had bene the mightieſt Empire of the
world, &amp; of largeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance, hauing perſecuted the Church,
is come to an end vnder the deliuerie of Gods people by Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.
And euen ſo alſo the Popes kingdome, who hath afflicted
the faithfull, ſhall ſhortly ceaſe by the deliuerie of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
True it is that the Pope is not ſo perſwaded, but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the contrary, becauſe that Daniell teacheth that Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2815:43"/>
kingdome muſt continue vntill the day of iudgement,
&amp; the Pope taketh this iudgement to be the end of the world.
But Daniell ſpeaketh of the iudgement of Babylon, which alſo
is the iudgement of Antichriſt, and to that are we come, which
began by the bloud of the Martirs, &amp; ſhall end by the ruine of
the Papacie, and of all the kingdomes that ſhall oppoſe them
ſelues againſt Chriſt, which ſhall be broken as a glaſſe vnder
an iron ſcepter. Hitherto it hath ſeemed, that to raigne,
it needed but to turne the backe to Chriſt: But all things haue
their tyme and their courſe, and now is the periode come, and
the caſe altered, and euery kingdome muſt periſh that ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it ſelfe againſt Chriſtes kingdome. Hitherto the daughter
of Babell hath made the daughter of Sion to drinke of the cup
of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but hereafter her ſelfe ſhall drinke the dregs therof.
For the Lord ſhal take the cup of his wrath out of the hands of
the daughter of Sion, and make Babylon dronken therewith.</p>
               <p>Moreouer I ſay, tht ſith God hath giuen vs a King, we muſt
loue and honor him: and ſpeake of him wiſely and modeſtly,
becauſe he is our ſuperiour, and our ſoueraigne, we owe him all
honor &amp; duetie. We know how Manaſſes afflicted the people
that defended the puritie of Gods word,<note place="margin">2. Paralip. 33.</note> him ſelfe maintaining
Idolatrie, yet did God ſo teach his harte, that through a goodly
conuerſion he glorified God: neither is Gods power or mercy
leſſe now then it was then. The hartes of kings are in his hands,
&amp; he is able to turne the harte of our King, yea God can make
of a hart of Manaſſes perſecuting the Church,<note place="margin">2. King. 18. 4.</note> the hart of
an Ezechias or a Ioſias, Reforming the Church: and he can doe
vs more good in one day,<note place="margin">2. King. 23.</note> then hitherto he hath done vs harme.
Alſo we muſt not onely haue a reſpect to our King, in yeelding

the feare of God, the end is charitie, &amp; the foundation is Gods
word, the building is faith, &amp; the crowne of the worke is glory
euerlaſting. But each glory hath his triumph proceeding of
ſome victorie, and the victory of faith is the victorie ouer the
world: howbeit our faith muſt be armed with diſcretion, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
&amp; pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for by ſuch weapons ſhall we obteine more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
then by the ſword: neither is the victorie ouer the hart
gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſword, well may it be wonne by modeſtie. By mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
may the harts of the mighty be wonne to do vs good, or at
the leaſt to do vs leſſe harme then they would. Beſides if ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
your ſelues according to that wiſedom, which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
of his people, you ſhal no more but ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your hands, &amp; you
ſhall finde them repleniſhed with Gods bleſſinges. Open your
mouth ſaith the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.</note> and it ſhall be filled with meate: God
will ſtirre you vp ſuch friends, as you haue not ſought: He will
make you to eate the fruictes, which you haue neither planted
nor ſowen: and he will giue you the victorie, when you do but
looke on. I would not wiſh you to defend Religion with the
ſword, which ſhould be defended with ſpirituall weapons: but
in deede it is one thing to defend Religion, and an other to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the people that mainteine Religion. For Religion muſt
be defended with the ſword of the word, but as for Religious
people, God hath alwayes in ſtore a Dauid to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
the ſword,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> when ſoeuer neede ſhall require: you know that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaell
and his angels, doe fight for vs againſt the Dragon and
his angels: what ſhall we then feare? Let vs feare God, and we
ſhall be freed from the feare of the world: let vs be wiſe and
circumſpect in our deliberations, modeſt in our actions, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in our diſcourſes: let vs repoſe our confidence in God, and
endeuour to do well, ſo will God be vpon our ſide and ſo take
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2815:44"/>
our partes, as nothing ſhall be able to hurt vs.</p>
               <p>The difference betwene the Catholiques and the Reformed
hath ſeemed greater then it is,<note place="margin">9</note> becauſe the world hath imagined
that ſome part of the controuerſie conſiſted in the ſtate, yea
there are ſome that haue ſuppoſed, that ſimple abuſes and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
onely were in part cauſe of the ſchiſme: but now may
we eaſily perceaue by the reaſons hitherto deducted, that there
remaineth no farther difference but the ſuperſtition, that is to
ſay,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> for the Idols which S. Paule tearmeth deuils, and for the
ſuperſtitious traditions,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> which he calleth the doctrine of deuils,
ſo that ſuch as hereafter ſhall fight againſt vs, can not fight but
for deuils, which are the Dragon and his Angels, whereas we do
fight for the contrary part, which is the part of Michael and his
Angels,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> neither fight we in doubtfull hope: for we know that
our Michaell who is the King of Kings,<note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 14.</note> ſhall ouercome the ten
hornes of the Beaſt, which are the confederates in the League.
Now therefore let the Catholques looke to their buſineſſe, to
wit, whether they will defend the deuils cauſe: for whatſoeuer
ſhift they find, yet can they not eſcape, but S. Paule will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
them, in proofe that ſuperſtitions are the cup of deuils.
To new occurrences, we muſt haue new deliberations. They are
therefore now to deliberate vpon the argument which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.
I do here ſummon them to the throne of God the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of all things, and of Ieſus Chriſt the redeemer of his people,
to looke well to their doings, for it is no ſmall matter that they
haue in hand: I waſh my hands before God, that if any euill
happen them, it ſhall from henceforth be through their owne
fault: let them conſider whether they will fight for the doctrine
of deuils: for there is if they marke it, no queſtion but of that
point, and ſo much the better both for them and vs: but if they
obſtinately will ſupport the cauſe of deuils, ſo much the worſe
for them, and they ſhall find a puniſher, and yet ſhall we neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
be releeued. If they will not ſee or heare the iuſt exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
made vnto them, their contumacie alſo will condemne
them. For contumacie is imputed to the wrongfulneſſe of the
cauſe, and maketh the contumaxe guiltie of the crime whereof
he is accuſed. I ſumme, howſoeuer it be, our cauſe can not but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2815:44"/>
be holpen, becauſe it referreth it ſelfe to trial, and that God hath
remitted it to ſuch a paſſe, that euery way it is iuſt, and the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
thereof is cleare and euident: and our aduerſaries cauſe is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
conuicted. Moreouer it may be the Catholiques at the
firſt bluſh, will thinke theſe to be but vaine ſhapes, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
will not comprehend how profitable our aduiſe may be to
the King, to the Clergie, and to the Commons, and yet ſhal not
our aduiſe be altogether vnprofitable. If a man that were to
paſſe ouer a riuer, which he had heard to be wadeable, and yet
vpon the ſhore ſhould find one that knew it better, who ſhould
warne him of the contrarie, if yet notwithſtanding ſuch aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,
he would needes trie, would you therefore take the
aduertiſement to haue bene vtterly vnprofitable? No, for had
not the aduertiſement bene giuen, he might haue aduentured, &amp;
waded ſo farre, that he could not recouer: for the aduertiſement
will procure him to ſwimme betweene hope and feare, and to
looke better to the danger, the which as he ſhall find too great,
he will turne backe before he go too deepe: and ſo experience
ſhall make them knowe the commoditie of this aduiſe, which
otherwiſe were ignorant, &amp; by diſcourſe could not haue known
it. But let them proceede, the ſucceſſe of matters ſhall inſtruct
them, when they ſhall ſee their purpoſes haue none other iſſue
then this riuer that is vnwadeable, yea a bottomleſſe gulphe: &amp;
when they ſhal haue ſought in vaine for the iſſue of theſe things
and ſhall not find it, they will reclaime them ſelues, and come
to that reaſon which we ſhew them. If there be a blind man in
the midſt of a great hall, and ſome one will direct him out at
the dore, it may be he will not follow him, that offreth him ſelfe
to guide him, but leauing him, will feele along the wall, which
alſo may conduct him, &amp; ſo go groping till he come to the dore.
But experience is a maruelous matter, which teacheth the hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brained
by effect, that which they could neuer comprehend by
diſcourſe. It is ſayd, that none are more deafe, then they that wil
not heare, and I ſay that none are worſe blind, then they that
will not ſee reaſon, and yet is experience their guide and wall, all
along the which, as it were groping, they may ſometimes get
forth of thoſe places, where they find them ſelues encloſed: and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2815:45"/>
thus doth experience ſerue for a ſound, to ſound the depth of
the affaires of this world, for a wall, to conduct ſuch as can not
go but by groping. Let vs therefore let our enemies paſſe on, &amp;
let vs ſuffer them to make triall of their wiſedomes: for in the
end they ſhal find by experience, that there is no other iſſue, but
the ſame which we do ſhew them. But as for vs, let vs repoſe
our confidence in God, and enforce our ſelues to do well, and
well will come to vs.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that we are greatly to reioyce,<note place="margin">10</note> ſeing our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

<hi>When you ſhall ſee theſe things come to paſſe, reioyce, for your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
is at hand:</hi> For all the ſignes and tokens that ſhould go
before the fall of Babylon, are already come to paſſe. Firſt, the

1260. yeares, ſo as there wanteth no more but her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
through the battell of Michaell againſt the Dragon.<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> As
alſo we ſee the accompliſhment of that which is ſayd, <hi>Wo be to
you, ye inhabitants of the earth, for Satan is come downe among you
in great furie, becauſe he hath but a ſhort time.</hi> Now doth Satan
lay open all his furie, for he knoweth his time to be ſhort, much
like as when the vncleane ſpirites were to depart the bodies of
the poſſeſſed, they rent them, as Satan at this day renteth the
world through the League. Likewiſe we ſee the ſaying that the
Beaſts mortall wound was healed,<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 3.</note> fulfilled, in that the Papacie
hauing bene ſhaken and readie to fall, hath ſince bene reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.
Moreouer we ſee that come to paſſe, that is written of
the ten hornes of the Beaſt,<note place="margin">Apoc. 17.</note> that ſhould make warre againſt the
Lambe, for it is ſayd, that theſe ten hornes are ten kings, which
at once ſhall take counſell with the Beaſt to warre vpon the

paſſe in the League, in caſe we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vnder the name of king, is meant euery ſoueraigne prince.
And it is moſt certaine, that there are ten ſoueraigne Princes
that at once tooke counſell with the Beaſt, which is the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2815:45"/>
to warre againſt Chriſt, that is, againſt his Reformed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
namely thoſe Princes that did vnite them ſelues together
vnder the League, onely it reſteth that we ſee them ouercome,
as ſhortly they ſhall be, that is to ſay, part of them, as it is ſayd,
that the Lambe ſhall ouercome them, and that in the reſt ſhall
be accompliſhed that that is ſaid, that they ſhall hate the
Beaſt, and yeeld him naked and deſolate, that is, that the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
or ſome part thereof, ſhall bend them ſelues againſt the
Pope, and the Pope ſhall haue no greater enemies the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers,
who ſhall depart from the Pope, &amp; bind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to the

and it is ſuppoſed that the French Clergie may grow to that
paſſe, yea and euen the Gentlemen Leaguers, if once they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to ſmell out the Popes entent, to be preiudiciall to the
Crowne and ſtate of France: neither is that altogether to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
which ſundry haue foretold concerning the yeare 1588.
that it ſhould be a yeare of marueiles. For yet remaine ſome
Reuolutions depending thereof, neither is euery Reuolution
accompliſhed one ſelfe yeare: and this marueilous yeare hath
not yet layd open all her marchandiſe, but will ſhortly: much
leſſe is it to any purpoſe to ſay, that there is no likelihood of
theſe matters, for we know that the great whore of Rome ſhall
ſay: I ſit a Queene and am no widow, neither ſhall I ſee any
mourning, then ſhall come vpon her nakedneſſe and widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
with weeping, mourning and ſorrow. Howbeit if any
ſhall obiect, that the faction of the Reformed is to weake to
bring this to paſſe, I aunſwere with the Reuelation, that God
her Iudge is mightie. To be brief, let men ſay and thinke what
they pleaſe, but I doe well know that we are in a marueilous
periode and great Cataſtrophe, at the point to ſee a ſtraunge
alteration. For it is moſt certaine that Babylon ſhall fall, and
that ſhortly and with a ſodein fall, and it can not fall but with
great murmure. It ſhalbe a wonderfull doome, when by the
effectes, we ſhall heare the voyce of the maiſter of the houſe
and king at his returne, as it were from a long iourney, ſaying,
Bring vnto me theſe my enemies, that would not that I ſhould
raigne ouer them, and ſlay them before my face.</p>

Where our Lord ſaith, Reioyce for your deliueraunce is at

we be deliuered from the tyranny of Babylon through her
ſodein fall, wherein it ſhall be ſaid, reſtore vnto her dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

that ſaith, I ſit a Queene, and am no widow, neither ſhall

ſhall we no longer be ſubiect to the Babylonian yoke of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

ſpouſe, and decke her vp in her goodlieſt ornamentes, that ſhe
may be worthely preſented to her bridgrome: let the Stewards
labour to become ſuch, as may yeeld a good accompt of
their adminiſtration: and let the Virgines prepare their
lampes, as knowing the bridegromes comming to be at

vpon the ſtate of matters, and the bringing in of
ſuperſtition by Helene the mother of Conſtantine
the Great, I knewe we ſhould ſhortly ſee the ende
therof through the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Babylon, accompanied with a
triumphant deliuerie of the Church, triumphing at full ouer
the Beaſt mentioned in the Reuelation. This knowledge was
pricked forward, with a deſire to ſtand in ſome ſtead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
I ſuddenly purpoſed to make a ſearch throughout Gods
word, for matter conuenient thereto. And for as much as the
knowledge of humane ſciences was not vtterly vnprofitable,
I determined to ſeaze vppon an <hi>Encyclopedie.</hi> This pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
haue I continued theſe twelue yeares, with great labour &amp;
ſmall helpe, neither could I be drawen therefro by mine owne
particular affaires, as preferring the ſtudy of Diuinitie, before
all other things: as alſo Gods word is my heart, life, ioy, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
peace and contentation, my delight, and vnto me all in all.
Then began I to peruſe Gods lawes more exactly then as yet
I had done, and to diſtinguiſh them into a lawe ſimple figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
and figuratiue Ceremoniall: then into a law of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Pollicie, and Ciuill Policie: thirdly into a Morall law, and
an Euangelicke Morall, which teacheth that perfection whereat
we ought to ſhoot, and whereof the naturall man is vncapable.
Theſe be ſixe kinds of law, after all which, there is particularly a
ſeuenth, whereby the ſpirit of God giueth to ſome, albeit to few
the things that he will bring to paſſe in ſundry ages, as he did
the comming of the Meſſias vnto Simeon. Neither would I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

be figures, and moſt of the ſimple figures be hiſtories,
hauing relation to ſome end out of the hiſtorie, yet following
the ſame, as alſo doe the ceremonies. As alſo I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Eccleſiaſticall gouernement with the ceremonie, no
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2815:47"/>
more then with Ciuill gouernement.</p>
               <p>Conferring therefore the Eccleſiaſticall Moſaical gouernment
with the Euangelical, laying ſundry peeces into one ſelf worke,
I found that the gouernement of the Newe Teſtament did no
whit abrogate the Old. By the ſame meanes alſo I came to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that we did not ſo farre differ from the Catholickes; as
before I ſuppoſed, as thinking that we had bene in ſtrife both
for the eſtate and ſuperſtitions, and that the troubleſomneſſe of
theſe two points, which ſerued for a bad ſurmiſe, to retaine the
world in ſuperſtition, might be taken away.</p>
               <p>Herupon I conferred with ſome miniſters of the Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who liked of this purpoſe, alſo with ſome of the Catholique
Clergie, who likewiſe thought it to be good, ſo as I was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirmed, in hope to ſee ſome good attonement come ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Then hauing layed my matters in ſteepe, I went to Bourges
in Berry, where the warres ſoone after ſurpriſed me: ſo as I
found my retraite into Germany; to be more ſafe then into the
Low Countries. There co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſed I a treatiſe, which I communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with ſundry notable perſons, both Diuines, Lawyers, and
men of eſtate, who all liked of my purpoſe: neuertheleſſe I could
not find opportunity there to publiſh it: afterward comming
into England I ioined this my firſt purpoſe with the argument
of an Apologie, ſo of one ſtone to make two caſtes: and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this former Treatiſe, which was in good time finiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
the ſpring &amp; aſcention of the ſunne, which was about the
time of the Duke of Guiſes death.</p>
               <p>My intent was to fruſtrate Achitophels counſell, that is, to
ſcatter &amp; breake the purpoſes both of the Pope &amp; the League.
Alſo my booke was no ſooner done, but at the ſame inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, God
began to effect my propounded purpoſe: whereuppon I had a
more faire path and free courſe for my booke. Which fauour of
Almightie God, can not be but a good foreiudgement for the
reſt of the ſucceſſe thereof. For it as a goodly matter, when a man
findeth himſelfe a fellow labourer with God, and that God ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condeth
his purpoſes with the effects and ſucceſſe of matters.
Moreouer, I will boldly ſay, that we may now aſſuredly affirme,
that Babylon is fallen that is to ſay, that the Papacie is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,

death, then of the deſtruction of the Papacie: for the diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the League, is the ſubuerſion of the Pope, &amp; the League
is now ouerthrowen both by ſea and by land. In the purſute of
the League the Duke of Guiſes greateſt ouerſight was in that
he dalied with the king, after him ſelf had offended him at Paris.
And now hath the king as much offended the Pope: The king
can therfore no longer truſt him, for he will with one eye laugh
vpon him, and with the other betray him. God preſerue vs
from Iudas Iſcariotes kiſſe. The Serpent that lurketh in the
graſſe is daungerous, for we feele her before we ſee her, neither
doe we perceaue her, but by the wound that ſhe hath made in
vs. Thus may the Pope be diſmembred: Spaine lyeth too farre
from the reſt of the dependances of the Papacie, to be able to
ioyne or ſuccour them: beſides that it is weake of bloud: The
king of Spaine ſhall find enough of the Defenſiue, albeit he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not into the offenſiue: The Prince of Parma can not doe
much for the League, he acquits him ſelfe well if he keepe his
owne, which he hath gotten by force, and roughneſſe, and by
money, neither is he beloued of the inhabitantes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
who will eaſely reuolt, as reaping but ſmall contentment
at his handes, and being but badly affected toward him. Many
Italian Princes and Lordſhips alſo do hold of the Pope in Fee,
that had rather be their owne men then an other mans, and
therefore will not faile to take occaſion if it be offered, and
would ſoone condiſcend to a Counterleague, ſo as if any man
would but renew the path which Charles of Bourbon firſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out, theſe would ſoone enlarge it, and vpon a neceſſitie finde
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enough to ſhare in the bootie, by reaſon of the great wealth
that Rome hath long gathered together, ſo did Darius riches
draw his enemies to his deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Of the King we may with the old Poete ſay.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Vnus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem,</l>

               </q>
               <p>For he hath ſuffered them to ſpeake that accompt his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
timorouſneſſe, &amp; ſuffring thoſe to ſpeake, hath done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then to haue ſpoken. He hath bene wiſe enough to bring his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2815:48"/>
purpoſes to their point &amp; period, with great dexteritie, &amp; hath
wiſely holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe with the Prouerbe, He that can not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
can not raigne. To be brief, he hath bene able enough
to ouercome the League, for the death of the Duke of Guiſe is
the victory ouer the League, to which victory we may alſo adde
an other, that is that he hath ouercome many a mans hope. It is
nothing for Hanniball to know how to ouercome, if he know
not how to vſe his victory: But I hope the king will crowne
this his good beginning with a better proſecution: for in
theſe purpoſes it is requiſite to vſe great circumſpection, diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and moderation, and that the king haue honeſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men about him. For more are the Popes ſecrete driftes to
be feared, then the open forces of the League. And ſith the king
is ſhipt in this action, he can not but ſaile on while the winde
bloweth. Theſe three thinges were neceſſarie, to abandone the
Papacie: to ſtrengthen him ſelfe with the Clergie: and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
of his ſubiectes to reunite his forces. There is nothing
more weake then the Papacie, yet is it ſtrong, if it be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Clergie: but if the Clergie be ſeparated from
the Pope, he is vtterly ouerthrowen: if we abandon him, he can
not reſiſt. He can do no hurt to thoſe that forſake him, but to
thoſe that take part with him. Alſo albeit the Clergie were of
the League, yet doth it not follow that the king ſhould impute
vnto them the conſpiracie of the League: for the principall
heades thereof, did ſtill perſwade the reſt, that the king had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
with them, neither did it fully appeare to the
contrary, but by the Duke of Guiſes death. Alſo it is not
good for a maiſter to ſee all that his ſeruaunts doe, but he muſt
ſee ſome part and paſſe ouer the reſt. And clemency is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
in a king.</p>
               <p>I would wiſh the king not only to mainteine the ſtate of the
Clergy, but alſo to relieue them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the exactions of the League:
&amp; I wold wiſh the Clergie to prouide for the ſchiſme by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
all ſuperſtition, and ſurely the ſooner the better, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the calamities of this warre: for they may ſee that a
great part of the burden lighteth vpon their backes, which to
remedie, the firſt point were to quench the ſchiſme, to the end
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2815:48"/>
the king might reunite his forces to withſtand the League: and
that were the ſureſt way for their eſtate, which ſtill tottereth
vntill there be ſuch a Reformation as may no whit preiudice
the ſtate, neither ſhall they euer finde fitter occaſion then now,
while the king ſtandeth in neede of their amitie, that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
may be his ſhield againſt the Pope and the League. Beſides
that, our king is a wiſe and diſcret Prince, who will make no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation
in his ſtate: beſides that in all euents, if once there
were a Reformation of ſuperſtitions made, they might more
eaſily maintaine their eſtate only, then both their eſtate and the
ſuperſtitions together: conſidering that their eſtate is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God,
and inſtituted by Gods lawes, whereas the ſuperſtitions are of
deuils, as Sainct Paule teacheth, to whom God is an enemy,
and it can not be but God will deſtroy them, and that can no
worldly man preuent: yet may we prouide for the eſtate. Let
vs looke that we reſiſt not God, leſt he continue his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by warres: but let vs appeaſe his wrath by framing our
ſelues after our duetie, ſo will God conuert our calamities into
felicitie, and doubtfull warre into an aſſured peace. I pray you
are not an infinite number of liuing Images of Gods making,
who by theſe warres are oppreſſed, of more importance then a
few dead Idols, hewen out by caruers of Images, which by the
Catholicke Romiſh Religion, are mainteined in temples and
Churches? Let vs take care for Gods Images.</p>
               <p>The laſt yeare at the Eaſter faire at Francfort, I cauſed to be
printed a Latine Treatiſe of the day of iudgement, or of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
general iudgements, wherin I proued ſeauen general iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, whereof fiue are already paſt, and the ſixt or laſt
ſauing one, is the iudgement of Babylon, whoſe principall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
was in the yeare 1588. which many haue noted as a yeare of
maruels: and the laſt is to come in the end of the world. I ſayd,
that in that iudgement the Papacie ſhould come to ruine: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it any apparance that cauſed me ſo to ſay, euery thing
ſeemed to premize the contrarie. The League ſwelled vp in
Fraunce, but eſpecially in Spaine: euery man looked after great
effects: there was no ſpeech but of great preparations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions
for warres, made both in Spaine and in the Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2815:49"/>
There was no diſcourſe, but of the wonderfull effects of
the Spaniſh Nauie, ioyned with the Prince of Parmaes power.
There was great preparation in Flanders of ſadles &amp; bridles for
the Engliſh geldings. I ſaid alſo, when the whore of Rome ſhal
ſay, I ſit a Queene, &amp; am no widow, neither ſhal I ſee any ſorow,
then ſhall there fall vpon her widowhood, weeping and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
For we know, that the Beaſt muſt be wounded to death,
and then recouered againe, which I ſaw accompliſhed: as alſo
the ſame that is ſpoken of the ten hornes of the beaſt, that toke
counſell together, is fulfilled in the counſell of the League. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, ſeing Satan worke his laſt endeuor to ouerthrow the
partie of the Lambe, I doubted not but Ieſus Chriſt wold like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
work his, for our deliuery. I wiſt not that the League ſhold
be ouercome by ſea, or that the King ſhould withſtand it, as
he hath done: yet now do I ſee the effects ſucceede according to
my diſcourſe and ſaying in my Treatiſe. In the Apologeticall
Treatiſe going before, I alſo ſayd, that the League would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
breake, yet knewe I not that the Duke of Guiſe
ſhould be ſlaine: howbeit thereby I ſee my ſaying come to paſſe,
before it be brought to light. And now do I not feare to ſay, that
the Papacie ſhall fall, yea euen with a maruellous and ſudden
fall. The death thereof will be knowen in a maner as ſoone as
the ſickneſſe. I was not daunted at the great preparations of the
League, neither ceaſed I in my Treatiſe to publiſh the ſame to
be the reuolution of the Papall fall. For I diſcourſed thus. Cirus
wrought great matters with ſmal power, but that came to paſſe
becauſe the ſame was the reuolution of the Babylonian Empire,
and the accompliſhment of the 70. yeares of the captiuitie of
Iuda. Alexander the Great vanquiſhed the power of Darius,
which was farre greater then his: but it was in the time of the
period of the Perſian Empire. Iulius Caeſar wrought wonderful
exploits: but in the ſame ſeaſon wherein God was preparing
the world, that the Meſſias might be borne vnder the Romane
Monarchie. Sith therefore the Pope and king of Spaine, made
all theſe warlicke prouiſions to the end to eſtabliſh the Papacie,
in the ſame ſeaſon wherein it ſhould be rooted vp, I concluded,
that their endeuors ſhould be in vaine: and that now the time
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2815:49"/>
of ſuperſtitions, which haue detained the woman in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
being at an end, Babylon can no longer continue. And
God who hath the hearts of kings in his hand, will ſtir vp ſome
one that ſhal deſtroy it: yea that albeit no king would take that
in hand, yet that it is in Gods power, to make ſome vnder bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch
to ſpring vp in one night at the roote of the tree, that may be
able to preſcribe law to the tree, from out of whoſe roote it may
be ſprong. Howbeit if it be lawfull to ſpeake by coniecture, I
will ſay, that the name of Henrie ſeemeth fatall to the Papacie:
for Henry the 8. in England gaue the Pope a maruelous checke,
and now in Fraunce we ſee an other Henry giue him an other
checke, after this let him beware the Mate.</p>
               <p>The order of the League at Paris is a good order, where por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and day labourers are in greater credit then the Preſidents.
It ſeemeth that Spaine meaneth by her proctors to attempt
ſomewhat againſt Fraunce: but ſhe were not beſt. Spaine hath
more neede to feare then to hope, and to keepe her ſelfe, then to
enterpriſe againſt others. She is but weake of walles and blood,
and hath no ſtrength but in penſe and Miluedies, and thoſe are
alſo well ſhronke and waſted, through the continuall warres in
Flanders, Hannibal ſuppoſed that for the pinching of Rome, he
needed not go to ſeeke her out of Italie. I thinke if the Spaniard
were well tickled in his owne countrey, it would trouble him
ſhrewdly, and that were the ſureſt ſuccour that might be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to the Low countreys. But eſpecially it were requiſite to
carie thither ſome ſtore of New Teſtaments, and Bibles in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
with other ſmall Treatiſes againſt ſuperſtition. For Gods
word is a good ſeede, which can not but fructifie when once it is
planted and hath taken roote in a place, neither will it eaſily be
plucked vp againe. But in matters of eſtate I would wiſh cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection,
and with moderation and modeſtie to win mens
hearts, rather then to ſtir them vp with vanitie, idle ſpeech, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
&amp; inſolencie: for ſuch things do rather deſtroy then edifie.</p>
               <p>The League hath ſharpned it ſelfe to cut of the Huguenots,
but the edge is wel broken by the Duke of Guiſes death. Theſe
be two bad prognoſticatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for the good ſucceſſe of the League,
that is, the ſcattering of the Nauie, and the death of Guiſe: as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2815:50"/>
alſo they be good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples to teach ſubiects to attempt nothing
againſt the ſtate of their King: for the Maieſtie of a king is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
matter, &amp; it is dangerous attempting any thing there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.
When a man hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted a fault, the beſt way is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame
himſelf by making amends, rather then obſtinatly to caſt
away him ſelfe therin. And therfore the Duke of Neuers, &amp; the
Lord of Antragues dealt wel &amp; wiſely in taking the kings part
as alſo the King did well and wiſely in taking all that they had
done vnder the League which return to him, as not done at all.</p>
               <p>If a man will be wicked, he muſt execute his buſineſſe cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,
or not meddle at all, otherwiſe he doth iniurie to his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation.
Euen ſo if they would needes enterpriſe the League,
they ſhould haue begun by ſeazing vpon the Kings perſon, &amp;
ſeeing they could not compaſſe that, they ſhould haue attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing. But what? euery one hath his time: and he that
muſt make a bad ende, muſt labour to doe euill, for euil neuer
commeth of well doing: for it is an excellent thing, to do well
to haue well: to liue well, to die well: and to begin well, to end
well, ſith vertue only is to be rewarded with honor.</p>
               <p>It is not impoſſible for a conſpiracie againſt a King to take
effect: but linger it neuer ſo little it is hard to bring it to paſſe.
And the League hath lingered too long in France to be able to
attaine any good ſucceſſe. It is ſaid that the Portingall mares
do conceiue of the wind: euen ſo was the League conceiued, but
that which is bred of wind, ſhall returne into wind and ſmoke,
Euery thing ſhal return to his firſt originall, &amp; ſo the beaſt that
came out of the bottomleſſe pit ſhall returne to perdition: yet
will ſhe make ſome defenſe, ſet a good face on a bad game, and
with her only countenance ſeeke to terrifie the King &amp; his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes:
but what? ſuch a dogge barketh, that maketh her ſoule to
quake in her belly. She wil waſt of her ſelf, ſhe wil breed brauls,
quarels &amp; diſcontentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Where there is no lawfull head euery
man will be Maiſter, &amp; when by reaſon of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petitors they may
not, they grow to diſcontentment: alſo not ſeeing any ſufficient
recompence preſently, or any future hope, will knowe that
without any net they haue ſnared themſelues in too great a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth,
&amp; therfore will retire before they be deeper in, and the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2815:50"/>
wiſer ſort will be the firſt that will do ſo. If I would hazard my
ſelfe for the purchaſe of a hope, truly it ſhoulde be both an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
and a certaine hope: but it is not great wiſedom to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
both life and goodes vpon a doubtfull hope, full of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and infamie. If therefore in this action there were no more
in effect, but the Kings demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration by the death of the Duke
of Guiſe, that he holdeth the League for a conſpiracy, yet cannot
the end be honorable, and it is too great a hazard to meddle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a King.</p>
               <p>There is without compariſon, more honour and ſafetie on
the Kings ſide, then in taking part with the League: for albeit
the League ſhould ouercome, yet can ſhe reproch nothing to
thoſe that ſerued their Prince: whereas they that ſtand with the
League againſt the king, can no way ſhunne great reproch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the danger. Yet will I excuſe ſuch as following the Duke
of Neuers example, ſhall returne to the king, for peraduenture
they knew not the drifts of the League, when they embraced it,
and when a man is once in, he can not ſo ſoone reſolue how to
get out againe. Euery nouelty delighteth the French, but after
ſome taſt, they are ſoone glutted, and the French man remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
him ſelfe. Euen ſo was the League embraced as a noueltie,
but at length men will grow wearie and giue it ouer. I will not
forget one pretie part that the League played with the Lord of
Boneide Gouernour of Thoul. For he vpon great goodwill to
the Duke of Guiſe yeelded him the towne, but he was ſo diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of his gouernement, &amp; in recompence the Duke of Guiſe
gaue him the gouernement of a paltry Caſtle. It was pitie the
Lord of Moncaſſin did not the like, for ſo might he likewiſe
haue had the cuſtody of ſome baggage cabbin, in ſtead of the
Citadel of Mets: but he was wiſer and truſtier then ſo.</p>
               <p>Surely the League will yet make ſome a do, but we ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the vaine endeuors thereof. Being armed with the Kings
fauour, it could do nothing againſt the Reformed onely, how
then can it now continue hauing both partes againſt it? After
ſome gorgeous entrie, it will returne vs ſome leane and pitifull
iſſue, and the good ſhall haue the vpperhand: for God is the
protector of the righteous mans cauſe. Confidering the Duke
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2815:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Guiſes death, it can not be but there will be perpetual enimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
betweene the houſes of France and of Guiſe: and how good
a face ſoeuer the Pope ſet on the matter, yet is he no leſſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as being chiefe of the League, and therefore I dare auowe,
that the King and France can not be both friends to the Pope
and enemies to the League. All theſe do ſeeke by ſecret meanes
to attempt againſt the Kings perſon, and to annoy the ſtate of
Fraunce. Neither can the King better prouide here againſt, then
by aduauncing the houſe of Bourbon, eſpecially the king of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,
a Prince well borne, who will neuer abandon his fidelitie
and due obedience to the King, as alſo he is a valiant Prince, &amp;
one to whom the houſe of Guiſe beareth no leſſe malice, then to
the King him ſelfe. Beſides, if the ſayd King of Nauarre were
dead, they would the more boldly attempt againſt the kings
perſon, whereas while he is in credit, they ſhall haue the leſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
ſo to do. And had the League preuailed in Fraunce,
it might through the Popes fauour, haue ſhut vp the king into
ſome Monaſterie, which the king of Nauarre neither will nor
can do: neither is there like fidelitie as in the Huguenots.
For rather will they take then do harme.</p>
