            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ONE OF
ANTICHRISTS VOLUNTIERS
DEFEATED,
AND THE
TRUE LIGHT VINDICATED.</head>
            <p>AMongstall the opposers of the truth that yet hath appeared
among the black army of the old <hi>Dragon,</hi> who like the
<hi>Philistims</hi> hath alwayes defied <hi>Israels God,</hi> and also their
camp, through their ostentation and boasting, and with
their clamorous loud cryes in the ears of the people, like
<hi>Rabshekah,</hi> to dishearten and dismay <hi>Israel;</hi> none hath appeared more
out-ragious and virulent then one who subscribes himselfe, <hi>R. I.</hi> who in
vindication of his brethren in iniquity, <hi>Edward Dod,</hi> drunkard, and <hi>Samuel
Smith</hi> an unprofitable talker, otherwise called a Minister at <hi>Cresige,</hi> who
hath preached that which he calls the Gospel there divers years, and yet
sees no fruit at all, and yet this impudent <hi>R. I.</hi> whom I beleeve to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dreamer like him, for his language do manifest him to belong to <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
Babilon,</hi> the great City, the <hi>mother of Harlots,</hi> he saith, <hi>One may
minister and preach the Gospel, and the people not be profited at all, as</hi> Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Smith <hi>hath done at Cresige;</hi> And he saith farther, <hi>that they are barren
professors,</hi> yet saith R. I. that S. S. <hi>need not be abashed at it;</hi> And for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
he saith, <hi>Was Pauls preaching of less credit, because there were many
Runnagates, in the end shewed themselves hypocrites?</hi> yet this comparison
will not excuse S. S. neither E. D. nor R. I. who would cover them with
an old patched Cloak, some peices he hath scraped up out of <hi>Aesop's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
a book full of lies and altogether compacted and patched up of ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and some out of <hi>Ovid</hi> &amp; <hi>Seneca,</hi> Heathens in their own account, &amp; the
like frivolous stories, and <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Diogenes,</hi> they must serve for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
if it will, to the two former opposers of truth: but stay R. I. <hi>Did
Paul stay seven years in any place, and saw no fruit?</hi> And though there
were many unbeleevers among the Jews notwithstanding the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the word and the miracles of Christ, yet some beleeved; and though
the Apostles and Ministers of Christ laboured in the work of the Lord,
yet some beleeved and clave unto them: but there is no fruit at <hi>Cresige</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100860:3"/>
at all, but they are barren professors, as R. I. saith; <hi>but if this will not serve,
take another of R. I. his arguments; That God sends his word sometimes for
the hardning of people,</hi> and upon this account, S. S. teaching and Ministry
must be kept in credit. A sad thing for the people of <hi>Cresige,</hi> that they
should hire a man for seven years together, and pay him wages for hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their hearts, and for counting them barren professors, yet I judge,
S. S. E. D. &amp; R. I. counted them fruitful, and abounding in zeale and
fervency to God, when they came into the meeting of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> some
ringing <hi>Pans,</hi> some <hi>Candlesticks</hi> and <hi>Frying pans,</hi> and throwing water, like
people void of understanding, and saith this R. I. <hi>these yeelded a better
sound then the Quakers;</hi> So that thou may see what will not this R. I. vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,
and what wickednesse as can be acted and spoken, here they may
look for a shelter, rather then they shall want a Guardian (as <hi>Pictures,
images, crosses, cuffs, ribons, lace,</hi> and such other like things invented by
the Devil to draw people from serving and worshipping the living God)
R. I. will patronize them all being brought forth, and when they are not
brought forth he will reach forth his hand to help to elevate iniquity, and
to under-prop the Devils kingdom, which is exalted in the children of
disobedience, as all along may be seen in his Fabulous Scrole, called <hi>Ignis
Fatuus,</hi> when like his two brethren before him, he goes about to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Idolatry, <hi>Images, Hirelings, Mass-houses, Cuffs and Ribons, Tithes,
Flattering Titles, and vain Customs, and Popish practices, Pride, Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and lying;</hi> all those things he pleads for, and hath used many vain
arguments and false interpretations of Scripture, so that the two former,
it may truly be said they have done wickedly, but this R. I. exceeds them
all, who is so stout hearted against the truth and power of God, that
whatsoever he can invent in his corrupt heart against it, and gathers up
the rest of the Priests lies that they have vomited up before, and cast in
the face of truth, and tenders them as good proof, and some Scriptures
perverted with <hi>Aesop</hi>'s <hi>Fables,</hi> and <hi>Ovid,</hi> and <hi>Diogenes</hi> stories, and upon
such materials he hath framed his book (called <hi>Ignus Fatuus</hi>) which he
hath writ in vindication of E. D. his book called <hi>A pair of Spectacles for
a dark-sighted Quaker,</hi> and S. S. <hi>Malice striped and whipt,</hi> three Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
whole Title will discover what the substance of their matter is, and
whose work they drive on, so that I need not say much, some of them
vindicating persecution, and incouraging the rude behaviour of the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
another mocking at <hi>innocency</hi> and scorneth them who <hi>trembles at the
word of the Lord;</hi> and last of all, R. I. who hath made a Fortresse for both
the other, and hath cast up a heap of confused darknesse to guard his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100860:3"/>
he mocks at the light within, and calls it <hi>Ignis Fatuus;</hi> and the <hi>law</hi>
which is <hi>light</hi> which God hath promised to write in his peoples <hi>hearts,</hi>
this he calls an <hi>imperfect thing, and therefore to be ruled, and not fit to be a
rule of the Saints,</hi> as may be seen in the 55 page of his book, and so ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
spoken contrary to the Spirit and Scripture of truth, <hi>Prov: 6.</hi> and the law
of the Lord which is the law that endureth for ever, this saith R. I. <hi>is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
and the letter or law without written is perfect, and is a standard,</hi> as
R. I. saith, <hi>for all controversies,</hi> then if it be so perfect and so fit to decide
all controversies, why doth R. I. borrow his proofs and raise his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from <hi>Aesop</hi>'s <hi>Fables, Ovids stories, Plato</hi> and <hi>Diogenes</hi> discourses,
and to omit <hi>Seneca,</hi> because R. I. saith, <hi>Ambrose hath reckoned him in the
Bead-row of Saints,</hi> it may be wich Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> and Saint <hi>Patricke,</hi>
Saint <hi>Francis</hi> and some others of the <hi>Popes</hi> Canonizing; but however, I
shall set many of his envious and frivolous and impertinent arguments
passe, as things of no validity or worth, being they have been answered
over and over by mony hands, &amp; all the fortresses &amp; strong holds thrown
down, so that to any judicious man they will appear, to be but rubbish,
however R. I. would be gathering together the rubbish again, and would
make it appear as goodly a fabrick as he can, when indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it all; so thou may see Reader, in R. I. his <hi>vindication</hi> of this
<hi>mouldey cankered ware of Babylon</hi> which he would hold up, his own folly,
ignorance, and error made manifest in the ensuing discourse of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and most of his principles thou may view and see which I have
taken up and answered, and his confusion and blindnesse thou may see,
and also view the Spirit that acts this man, and how this man is like to
convince any who hath not power over his tongue, but lets it run to utter
forth the deceit that proceeds out of his own corrupt heart, thinking
thereby to blind peoples eyes that they should not see, how ignorant and
light, vain, and treacherous, these Priests are, who would monopolize all
into their own hand; nay though God command and move by his Spirit,
yet this must not speak nor declare the mind of God, except these
Priests will allow of it, (in whom the welfare of all people lyes, if thou
wilt beleeve R. I. in the 11 page of his book, yet if these count it disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for any to speak as he hath received of the Lord, from his Spirit) it
must go for such, and be accounted such, as disorderly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Epistle to the Reader R. I. saith,</hi> Such Schismaticks as these
Quakers, hath torn the Church in peeces, and its authority condemned, and
the Ministry slighted, and false Religion advanced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It seems that the Church that R. I. is of, is none of the true
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100860:4"/>
Church which is built upon the rock (Christ) which the <hi>gates of hell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
not against, neither any weapon that is formed against it, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,</hi>
but R. I. his Church is torne in pieces and may be prevailed against,
sure it is but <hi>Babylon,</hi> whose stones must be scattered, and whole building
must be thrown down, and it is but the whores attire which is renting off,
that her nakednesse may appear, and her deceit made manifest; and the
authority which is condemned and reproved, is no authority but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the beast, upon which the false Church hath ridden, and hath
call'd it by the name of higher power; and the Ministry, is but such as
traffick with the whores sorceries, by which she hath deceived the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and this indeed, and those Ministers indeed are slighted by us,
because we know him who is the Minister of the <hi>everlasting Covenant,</hi>
whose Spirit is manifest according to his promise, <hi>to lead his people into all
truth;</hi> and so the Religion which standeth only in the traditions of men,
and in idolatry, such things as R. I. goes about to maintaine, as <hi>Images,
Crosses and Picture, Mass-houses, Hirelings, Priests, Popish tythes, and
Popish-ceremonies,</hi> which R. I. so much pleads for, all these are slighted,
as not to be consistant with the true Religion, or the true Church of
Christ.</p>
            <p>Yet neverthelesse saith R. I. in his Epistle, <hi>I have adventured volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to side with those that contend for the truth against the Quakers,</hi> and
yet in the same Epistle, saith, <hi>He was moved of the Lord thus to declare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What confusion and lying, and blasphemy is here, hath R. I.
adventured voluntarily in his own willfulnesse and perversnesse, to take
part with those contenders against the truth, in which the <hi>Quakers live
and worship,</hi> and God must be made as the author of this, and all the heap
of lyes and confusion, which is declared and uttered forth in his <hi>Ignis
fatuus,</hi> which if no more were said then hath been, were answer enough
unto his railing discourse; and yet what impudency this man hath to say,
<hi>he was moved of the Lord,</hi> when as he hath confest, he hath <hi>voluntarily took
part with the contenders,</hi> so that it is manifest to all reasonable men, who set
thee awork, and whose work thou hast been doing, for which thou shalt
be sure to receive a reward, in the mighty day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And R. I. saith,</hi> Forasmuch as their counterfeit coin, hath been offered
to me for good silver, I thought it fit to nail it to the Market-Post, that it
might not deceive others, and instead thereof I have here made a tender of
other Money <hi>(viz:)</hi> this ensuing Treatise, which I doubt not, but that it may
passe with truths approbation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That which R. I. calls <hi>counterfeit coin,</hi> was made publick by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100860:4"/>
our selves, and it hath been and shall be received by them that know
Gods Image and the inscription of the Spirit, and though R. I. hath deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it when it was proffered to him, the value and worth of that, which
hath been proffered, is no worse; <hi>For though a price be put into the hand of
a fool, he regards it not.</hi> And now Reader thou shalt see, what kind of
Coin he hath tendered, and how thou judges it may pass with truths
approbation, as hereafter will be made manifest in his further discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore Reader, saith R. I.</hi> Have not so great regard to the authority
of the Writer, as the truth of the matter written by him, who was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the Lord, as thus to declare against those who are adversaries to
truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed the authority of a writer or of that which is written, is
of no great moment, seeing he is but one of <hi>Antichrists Voluntiers,</hi> who
hath not only belyed them that feared the Lord, but also hath uttered
forth many damnable doctrines, and yet would fasten all these upon the
Lord, so that his deceit might be of more authority, and none might que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the matter thereof, because the Lord allwayes <hi>moveth to truth and
righteousnesse,</hi> and so R. I. is one of them that hath taken the name of the
Lord in vain, which will not be <hi>holden guiltlesse,</hi> but will be found guilty,
when the searcher of all hearts shall make all things manifest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then R. I. further saith,</hi> That sprinkling of infants is commanded
by the Scriptures, and is a seale of the Covenant; and baptisme of infants is
that which answers to circumcision, for mortification of the flesh and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sins, and admission into the Church, are sealed unto infants by sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or that which R. I. calls baptizing.</p>
            <p>I say Baptisme of infants, is a <hi>Popish-Tradition,</hi> as hath been proved by
divers, so that of it I need not say much, but where it is commanded in
the Scripture as R. I. saith. <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. 11, 12. is but a bad proof for R. I. for
the <hi>Colossians</hi> were circumcised with the circumcision made <hi>without
hands,</hi> and they were <hi>buried with him in baptisme, baptized into the death
and sufferings of Christ,</hi> such a baptisme as the Priests never administred
with their hands, and the Spirit of the Lord was wont to be the seal of
the Covenant to them that did beleeve, but now it must be turned out
of doors, for <hi>visible water</hi> hath taken up its place in R. I. his judgement,
which is corrupted, and how doth sprinkling answer to circumcision, the
<hi>Males</hi> onely were circumcised, and not the <hi>Females,</hi> and why doe you
sprinkle <hi>Fenales,</hi> if baptisme must <hi>answer</hi> to circumcision, and if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the one, must be as large as the other: and as for mortification of
the flesh and remission of sins; that which mortifies the deeds of the flesh,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100860:5"/>
hath <hi>life</hi> in it, and that gives a living testimony <hi>within,</hi> and remission of
sins is in the blood of Christ, and the seal thereof is by the Spirit unto
them that beleeve; but this Popish tradition hath a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en up all in R. I. his
account, if his argument be true; Nay the Papists themselves who are as
zealous for sprinkling of infants as R. I. or any of his brethren can be, yet
one of their own Bishops (at a Council in <hi>France,</hi> of both Protestants and
Papists, at <hi>Pisoy</hi> 15 61.) <hi>Claudius Espencious</hi> saith, <hi>Many things are to
be beleeved by tradition only, as the baptisme of infants, which cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from Scripture,</hi> but this R. I. would have the Scripture to be a Cloak
and a cover not only for Popish Traditions, but for his own invented
imaginations, which he hath set forth to blind people withall.</p>
            <p>The next thing that R. I. goes about to vindicate, is <hi>swearing,</hi> which
their Ministers teach men to <hi>sweare,</hi> which ought to be in <hi>righteousnesse
and truth,</hi> and for his proof, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 20. he brings, and he saith,
<hi>Christ only prohibits rash and vain swearing, and superfluous oaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ:</hi> Unto this much hath been said and answered allready by many
pens, and so that in the answer thereof I shall be brief; in the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
it was lawful to <hi>swear</hi> in truth and righteousnesse, and likewise all
rash and vain oathes under the Law were forbidden, but <hi>Christ who is
the end of the Law for righteousness,</hi> who is greater then the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and
greater then <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and greater then the <hi>Angels,</hi> unto whom
they all worship, he saith expressely, <hi>swear not at all;</hi> Now whereas R. I.
and others have said, Christ onely in these words prohibits vain oaths,
or false oaths, then he had reproved nothing but what the Law had repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but he saith, <hi>It hath been said of old time, thou shalt not forswear thy
selfe,</hi> but Christ saith, <hi>I say swear not at all,</hi> so that it is manifest, that all
oaths are forbidden by him, who is the <hi>oath of God;</hi> and why saith R. I. it
is not contrary to the Gospel of Christ for to swear, and yet doth account
the <hi>writings</hi> which is called the New Testament the <hi>Gospel,</hi> wherein
Christ hath expressely forbidden it, and therefore those Ministers that
teach men to <hi>swear,</hi> are not the Ministers of Christ, but teach those things
that are repugnant to the Gospel of Christ, <hi>For he that breaks one of the
least of the commands of Christ, and teacheth others so to do, is least in the
Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that R. I. would vindicate, is their singing of <hi>Davids</hi>
Psalmes, in invented Tunes, such as pleaseth the carnal mind, and for
his proof he brings <hi>Matth. 26. 30. They went out and sung a Hymn, and
Paul and Silas sang in prison, and singing is divine worship for the praise of
God, and the comfort of our soules, and it is a soul-ravishing, and heart-rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100860:5"/>
               <hi>Answ:</hi> It is acknowledged, and allwayes hath been by us, that
praises belongs to the Lord, and that they that are made alive, whose
souls <hi>are raised out of death,</hi> can, and doth praise the Lord, and they
that sing with the Spirit and with understanding, are acceptable unto
God, and they that are in the Spirit, doth that which the Spirit moves
unto, and so worships in the truth, and is accepted of God; and
<hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> and many more praised the Lord, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
now doth praise the Lord, and he that hath a <hi>Psalme</hi> may sing, but
what of all this? what doth this prove for R. I. and the rest of the
<hi>Masse-house-singers?</hi> and what doth this prove, as to the singing of
them that is void of understanding, who sometime sing, <hi>I go mourning
all the day long,</hi> and just at that moment are singing, and what doth
R. I. think it cannot be a <hi>Psalme,</hi> unlesse it be in <hi>Meeter?</hi> or doth he
think it is not accepted, except it hath a <hi>Tune</hi> with so many stops, and
to sing <hi>Davids</hi> prayers, and call it praises, is this with understanding?
and even to return R. I. his words upon himselfe; <hi>A more ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
opinion was never invented by the Devil;</hi> For them to sing or to
pretend to praise God, whose soules <hi>lyes in death,</hi> and do not know
what it is to partake of Gods benefits, neither the unsearchable gift;
This kind of singing and imitation doth not comfort the soule, but
burden it, and this doth not raise the witnesse, but kills it, and you
make merry over it; and this kind of singing must be turned into
howling and lamentation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And saith R. I.</hi> Our worship doth not differ neither in whole, nor in
part, in matter or manner from the Saints worship in the Primitive
times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This mans confidence or rather impudence, is in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to knowledge and wisdome, for it were easily proved, that it
neither in whole; nor in part, neither in matter nor manner agreeth
with the Primitive times; as for example, it is no where recorded in
the Scripture, that any Apostle, Minister, or Ministers, did take a
little water and did sprinkle a few drops on a childs face, and call'd
this an ordinance of God, and say, it is a seal of the Covenant, and
mortification and remission of sins, neither any such doctrine did
they declare; neither did any of the Ministers and Apostles of Christ,
cause people to buy them bread and wine, and then give it the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
back again, a bit of bread and a sup of wine at the middle of the
day, and call this the Lords Supper, or a great Sacrament; neither
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100860:6"/>
had they bels in their Churches to call people together; neither had
they soft cushions, and pulpits, and a hour-glasse hanging by them;
neither did the primitive Churches prohibit, or limit the Spirit of the
Lord God amongst any, but if any was moved to speake any thing,
or had any thing revealed from the Lord, the first was to hold his
peace.</p>
            <p>These and many more things you differ in, both in matter and
manner, which largely hath been declared by other pens, and so in
this I shall be briefe; neither had the Ministers of the Gospel their
maintenance by force; neither had they <hi>Easter Reckonings, Midsum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
dues, Mortuaries,</hi> money for <hi>Churching</hi> of women, <hi>Marriages,</hi> nor
for the <hi>burials of the dead,</hi> nor money for <hi>Funerall Sermons,</hi> neither
did they preach over the dead: all these and abundance more of
such like invented things, was never practised nor found amongst the
Churches before the Apostacy; which things considered may cause
<hi>R. I.</hi> to blush, that ever he durst be so impudent as to say, they differ
not, neither in whole, nor in part, in matter nor in manner, from the
primitive Churches; and untill such time as <hi>R. I</hi> and his Brethren
contenders can clear themselves of these things, let them not think
any whose eyes God hath opened can receive them for a Church of
Christ; nay most of the parish Ministers holds up those practises which
the Papists did deny, as money for Marriages and burialls, baptisme,
the Sacrament, or the ground in which the dead were buried, this
was reprehended and condemned by the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the
height of all Popery, 1547.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saith</hi> R. I. It seemes these tythes are a great matter to many, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a great trouble for them to pay the Ministers, though <hi>Abraham</hi> paid
tythes of all to <hi>Melchizadeck</hi> before the Law; <hi>and this proves</hi> E. D.
<hi>his Argument as saith</hi> R. I. That it is contrary to the Light and Law of
God to withhold them from the Ministers, because they were given by
<hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Yea, It is a great matter with many to pay tythes, and a
great trouble too, because he that confesseth Christ is come in the
flesh, cannot uphold the shad owes of the first Covenant, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to a changeable priesthood, having no other portion among
their brethren, which was given unto them for the service which they
performed unto the Lord, and likewise were a Twelfth Tribe, and
near a Twelfth part of the people; And now the Law being changed,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100860:6"/>
and the Priesthood changed, and the Covenant ended, and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
thereof abolished, that such a company of covetous men, as the
<hi>Parochiall</hi> Priests generally are, that they should claime the tythes
that belonged to this Priesthood, and not doe the worke which they
did, and yet hath a portion among their Brethren in this land, neither
are they the three hundred part of the people; and that such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
I say, as these should claime the tenth part of all the increase in
the Land, this is a great matter, and a thing not consistent with the
Law of God, neither equity or reason.</p>
            <p>And it is but a poor and feeble argument neither of <hi>E. D.</hi> or <hi>R. I.</hi>
that <hi>because Abram gave the tenth part of the spoyle to Melchizadeck
before the Law,</hi> that therefore it must be a <hi>binding thing</hi> to all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to pay the tenth part as due to such as are neither after that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> neither after the order of <hi>Melchizadeck. Abram</hi> gave
the tenth, and that but once, and freely, and <hi>Melchizadeck</hi> brought
forth bread and wine to <hi>Abram</hi>'s Army; and we may as justly, and
upon as good ground, demand bread and wine for our whole families
of the Priests, as the Priests can demand the tenth part of our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from <hi>Abram's</hi> gift to <hi>Melchizadeck,</hi> and say, <hi>it is against
the Law of God, nature, and reason,</hi> as <hi>E. D.</hi> and <hi>R. I.</hi> doth conclude
by their feeble arguments which they make upon <hi>Abrams</hi> giving the
tenths, for if the example of the one be binding, then the example of
the other is also as binding; <hi>Abram</hi> gave the tenth part of the spoile
and that but once, and <hi>Melchizadeck</hi> demanded none, then why doe
the Priests who are but usurpers claime it every yeare? and where
they cannot get it freely, as few will give it them who witnesse
Christ come in the flesh, then they take it by force and constraint; or
would <hi>Melchizadeck</hi> have pleaded with <hi>Abram</hi> (as this ignorant
<hi>R. I.</hi> doth) that the spoyle was none of his own? as he saith Tythes
<hi>are no mans own;</hi> or as I said before to <hi>E. D.</hi> would <hi>Melchizadeck</hi>
have taken away <hi>Abrams</hi> Oxen, Cowes, or Horses, Sheep, or Camels,
if he had not given him the tenth part? Or did any of the Ministers
of Christ require or demand, force or constraine any maintenance
whatsoever from any, which this <hi>R. I.</hi> saith <hi>they differ nothing from,
neither in whole nor in part, in matter or manner, neither in practice;</hi>
but saith <hi>R. I. This is nothing to the purpose, unlesse it could be proved
that the Apostles might have had tythes, which they could not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted.</hi>
Yes it is something to the purpose if you take them for an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100860:7"/>
example, as you say you doe; and though it be granted the Apostles
were persecuted from place to place, and sometimes went from place
to place when they were not persecuted, which <hi>R. I.</hi> would have
condemned for runnagates, if he had lived in that time: But without
all controversie, if it be a duty now to pay tythes unto the Ministers
of the Gospell, then it was a duty in the Apostles time, that though
the Rulers were persecutors, yet the Apostles would have minded
them, whom they had begotten into the Faith, of their duty; but we
find no mention neither by Commandement, Reproof or Exhortation,
unto any of the Churches, about any such thing, and so thy argument
<hi>R. I.</hi> is foolish and frivolous; for it may be easily proved, that tythes
was never demanded, not for 7 or 8 hundred yeares after the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention
of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And R. I. saith,</hi> The Apostles took whatsoever was given them, and
this satisfies the Ministers Conscience to take tythes which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
give them, so they may of such maintenance live of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Answer, If the Apostles took nothing but what was given them,
then this shames your forcing, and also your seeking it of them who
receives you not, which manifests you are out of the Apostles exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and though it satisfies your Consciences to take tythes (which
thou saith the Magistrates gives you) both of them that owns you,
and them that owns you not; yet I beleeve it would not have satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Apostles of Christ, if any Magistrates would have sent them
back to the Jews who believed not, or the Gentiles who received
them not, this they would not accounted as a free gift; though this
divers hundred years many Rulers have drunk of the Whores cup,
and hath given their authority to the beast, and hath forced and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to a worship, and also to give to the Whores Merchants, yet
this is but bad proof that they ought to have done so; and the Apostles
never counted this living of the Gospell to live of tythes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
maintenance, which none of the Ministers did receive, or ever
will. And so for shame call in thy <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> again, in which thou
hast published so many lyes, among which this is one, [which will
stand as a record against thee] <hi>(viz.) That ye differ not in doctrine
and practice, matter and manner, neither in whole nor in part, from the
Apostles and Primitive Saints.</hi> And this is another lye, that <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> was settled in a parochiallike way in their quarters. Nay
the Parochiall quarters, is all people, old and young, beleevers and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100860:7"/>
between such a water and such a wall, or betwixt such a
hedge, and such a ditch. And because thou said I had not named the
Apostate that builded your <hi>Masse-houses,</hi> I shall take away the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of thy clamouring this, and tell thee who invented your Parishes,
and your parochiall way, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Pope <hi>Dyonisius,</hi> which it may
be thou wilt calculate among the Bead-row of Saints, for his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
as thou said <hi>Ambrose</hi> did with <hi>Seneca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that <hi>R. I.</hi> contends against, is no lesse thing then
the Doctrine of Christ, and yet it may be he reckons himself as one of
his Ministers, and yet he raises arguments strongly against the
Doctrine of Christ, <hi>viz. Be not ye called Masters.</hi> But it may be thou
wilt say as one of thy generation said lately of some of the Doctrine of
Christ, <hi>that these words give an uncertain sound,</hi> and therefore they
must have an exposition, and it is this, that <hi>Christ condemneth ambition,
and superiority over our brothers Religion and faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer. Then all your parochiall Ministers by thy own Exposition
falls under condemnation; for this is a poynt of our faith, that if we be
moved of the Lord and by his Spirit, to come into your Assemblies
to speak the word of truth, that we ought to speak it, and you ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
would arrogate unto your selves superiority over our faith and
Religion; like as we beleeve that we ought not to give flattering ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
to men, neither to give maintenance unto them, of whom we are
perswaded, and doe believe are no Ministers of Christ; And in these
and many more things that pertains to Religion, faith and godlinesse,
you ambitiously and proudly have arrogated unto your selves superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
over Religion, faith and consciences: Therefore repent of it,
and see you doe so no more left you fall into condemnation. And as
for calling any man Master who is our Master we own, and it is the
practice of such as are servants; but to call him Master who is not our
Master, is to speak an untruth, or else to give flattering Titles, and
we have not so learned Christ; but enough of this hath been spoken
by divers, so that I shall pass on and touch a word about complements,
<hi>and doffing off hats,</hi> and <hi>bowing of knees,</hi> a thing that <hi>R. I.</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
so dearly loves that they are loath to part with it, and these
things we beleeve we ought not to doe; and although <hi>R. I.</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that none ought to usurp authority or superiority over his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
faith, yet notwithstanding he hath forgotten his own Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in a moment, and falls a wrangling about <hi>hatts</hi> and <hi>Caps, Knees</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100860:8"/>
and <hi>Complements,</hi> which we cannot doe for conscience sake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And saith</hi> R. I. If the Quakers will not put off their hatts because
it is a custome, or bow the knee because they are abused, they must not eat
nor drink because it is abused by gluttons and drunkards.</p>
            <p>Answer. A pittifull lame argument, we eat not, nor drinke not,
because it is a custome, nor wear apparell, but because of their service
and of necessity; and yet I would have <hi>R. I.</hi> know, that we have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to distinguish betwixt a thing that may be customary and good in
it selfe, and a custome which is vaine; and the Saints did not salute
one another because it was a custome, but because their hearts was
joyned to one another in love and in truth. But for <hi>doffing the hart</hi>
and bowing the <hi>knee</hi> to a fellow with a <hi>feather,</hi> or a woman with a <hi>fan,</hi>
or a <hi>Gold-Ring,</hi> or <hi>powdered hair,</hi> this is a vain Custome, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of a thing doth not prove the goodnesse of it, neither custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marinesse
the worth of any thing, nor because a multitude of <hi>Roysters</hi>
and <hi>Ruffins</hi> do practice such things, that therefore they are lawfull;
for we know <hi>broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there
be that enter in,</hi> and we have learned not to follow a multitude to do
evill, though <hi>R. I.</hi> be untaught.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But saith</hi> R. I. When sallutations are observed with a good decorum,
they are like a hand diall which shews what order the wheels observe
within, and the abuse of any thing doth not abollish the use thereof.</p>
            <p>Answer. Now what R. I. doth count a good <hi>decorum,</hi> Reader thou
may judge by what he hath before pleaded for; for <hi>doffing of hatts,
bowing the knee,</hi> and saying <hi>Your Servant Sir,</hi> or, <hi>if it please your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
or, <hi>if it like your excellency,</hi> with such feigned practises, and this
is the <hi>decorum,</hi> which is counted civill; and so reader thou may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
how the <hi>wheels runs within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It so came to passe that I was amongst a Company of these that
would be called Ministers of the Gospel, in number no lesse then ten,
and in the Room I was when they all came in, and they courted and
bowed, and scraped with their feet, with their hats to the ground ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them one to another, and reeling up and down the house in
this manner, and one striving to outstrip another in complements;
and though they had all intentions to sit down, yet they strave among
themselves who should be last, and in this posture they continued
halfe an hour together, at the which I admired, and indeed was asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that men who professed godlinesse should be found in such
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100860:8"/>
transgression; and it is like R. I. will count these <hi>civill salutations
with a good decorum;</hi> And now Reader observe again how the
<hi>wheels went within,</hi> and what they did drive after, but to gratifie one
another in deceit, with these kind of <hi>decorums,</hi> like stage-players and
Fidlers; and thou errs not knowing the Scriptures neither the power
of God; when that which was commanded by God came to be abused
they came utterly to be abollished, as the Brazen Serpent came to be
idolized it was taken away, though there was no command for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but they might have pleaded the former against them; likewise
the Temple commanded to be built by God, and was to have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for ever, yet being abused and made an Idoll of, it was utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bollished
and was left unto them desolate, and the glory of God did
not appear in it as before, and because of the iniquity of such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Priests, <hi>Sion became as a plowed field, and Jerusalem became
heaps, and the dayly sacrifices ceased, and not one stone left upon another</hi>
of the Temple that was not thrown down: And so for thee or any
other to plead custome or antiquity, and examples, which was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commanded or commended as to be standing and a binding rule
to all generations, demonstrates thy great ignorance and blindnesse,
and manifests thee to be one who pleases the spirit of the world, in
whom the love of God dwells not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next thing that R. I. falsly accuseth, and impudently affirmeth
against the Quakers, is,</hi> That they deny honour to Superiours, and to
them to whom it is due, and so blasphemes the name of God and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
<hi>and further saith,</hi> Charity, though shooting at randome, cannot
misse the right mark.</p>
            <p>Answer. It is one thing what God accounteth true honour, it is
another thing what R. I. counteth honour. True honour is to obey
the commands of Superiours who rule in the power of God, and this
the Quakers doe, submitteth to all the just and equall commands
which are required of them that rule in the power of God, and this
is not to blaspheme the name of God and his Doctrine; but this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
would have accused the Apostles, as his generation did, who put
them out of the Cities charging them to speak no more in the name
of Jesus, and then when the Apostles returned, plead their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
saying, <hi>Did not we command you to speak no more in his name, and
now you are disobedient, blaspheming the name of God and his Doctrine.</hi>
Is this good reasoning R. I. <hi>And charity shoots not at randome, neither
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100860:9"/>
misses the marke,</hi> but it is pure, and singles out its object to joyn unto,
and joynes not unto deceit; But this is R. I. his charity, to think wel
of them that are doing evill, and joyne to them who are doing the
Devils worke, but this man honours charity as he doth the Scriptures,
he saith <hi>charity shoots at random,</hi> and the Scriptures are the <hi>true cards,</hi>
as hereafter thou shalt see.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And saith R. I.</hi> F. H. labours to disgrace, if not to deface our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
he like a cunning gamster knows how to alter the course of true
cards, the Scripture, <hi>as R. I. calls them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer. Because F. H. would have them to take away their crosses &amp;
Pictures and Images, which was set up in the time of grosse idollatry,
this R. I. counts <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>adorns</hi> their churches, and so he is joyned
to Idolls I shall let him alone; and the Reader may see how R. I.
honours the Scriptures, when in one place he pleads for the same Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
to be given unto them which is given to God; And saith <hi>No
man can dishonour Christ by giving as honourable Titles to the Scriptures,
as to God or Christ;</hi> Then by his own argument he hath brought a
great dishonour to God and Christ and the Scripture by giving them
so base a Title as the name of <hi>Cards,</hi> and so in going about to exalt
his own imaginations, he hath villified the Scriptures of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And saith R. I.</hi> To call steeple-houses churches is no addition to the
Scripture, but a true exposition thereof; and what if there be some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of Idollatry in our materiall Temples, as thereis some reliques of sin
in our living Temples, must they therefore be called Idoll Temples?</p>
            <p>Answer. The Temple in which the Jews worshiped was builded
by the command of God, which all these <hi>Steeple-houses</hi> cannot be
compared unto, which was invented and set up in the Apostacy since
men hath departed from the faith, and turned into formallities and
Idollatry. When Christ was offered up the everlasting offering, them
that did beleeve in Christ separated from the Temple; and the
Gentiles who believed separated from their <hi>Idolls Temples</hi> and they
met together in houses, which we do not read of was fill'd with pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Images, and Crosses; and Steeple-houses now was not then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
and the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> diverse hundred years after the
Apostles, decreed that Images and Crosses were to be placed in the
churches, and also worshiped; and there is the Originall of those
things which R. I. saith, <hi>doth grace and adorne their Church.</hi> And if
some of the Reliques of Idollatry doe abide in your Temples, then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100860:9"/>
it demonstrates that you are in the same spirit as they were that set
them up. And if your Temples take its denomination from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that met therein, as R. I. saith in the 32 page, then they may be
truly called popish houses and Mass-houses from the people that meet
therein. And if the reliques of sin abide in your living Temples and
bear rule there, then they <hi>that defile the Temple will God destroy, for
holiness becomes the habitation of his house for ever,</hi> and the 1 <hi>Kings 8.
11.</hi> will be but a bad proof for thee, <hi>for the glory of the Lord shall fill
the House of the Lord,</hi> for that is the Temple, blind man, which was
commanded by God, and the glory of God did appeare there; but
if this will not serve we must have another proof, <hi>Psal. 76. 2. In Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Sion,</hi> which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<hi>allegorically</hi> of our <hi>Temples</hi> saith R. I. Doth the glory of
the Lord fill your Mass-houses, you glory in deceit, and in pride, and
your glorying is not good, and thy allegory is false, though his <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi>
was in <hi>Salem,</hi> and his dwelling in <hi>Sion,</hi> and his presence in the
Temple; is yours the Temple, or <hi>Salem,</hi> or <hi>Sion,</hi> or the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi>
if not, for shame pervert not the Scripture, nor bring it to cover your
idollatrous practices, which R. I. pleads for, and saith <hi>Images, Pictures,
and Crosses, may be continued in some places:</hi> and it is like R. I. would
count it <hi>sacriledge</hi> to take them away, he is far from the exhortation of
the Apostle, abstain from every appearance of evill, and hate the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that is spotted with the flesh.</p>
            <p>And R. I. saith, <hi>I plead not for Baal, nor for proud phantastick, spirits,</hi>
and yet a little after, saith <hi>that putting off lace, ribbouds and costly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell,
may be putting on of pride.</hi> Now who will believe this R. I.
that he pleads not for <hi>Baal,</hi> when he pleads for Pictures, Crosses and
Images, for cuffs, ribbonds, lace and costly apparell. Now Reader
thou may observe by R. I. his <hi>decorum</hi> how the wheels goes within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further R. I. saith,</hi> It is utterly unlawfull, for any Christian
whatsoever, gifled or not gifted, to preach the word in the name of the
Lord before the Church publikely assembled, unlesse they be ordained
and set apart by the Church for such a work.</p>
            <p>Answer. This man is farre from <hi>Moses</hi> spirit, who wished that all
the Lords people were prophets, and would not forbid <hi>Eldad</hi> and
<hi>Medad,</hi> to prophesie in the <hi>Camp,</hi> which was a publick assembly, and
<hi>Israel</hi> then the Church of God, and R. I. hath made too hasty a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
who would prohibit all from speaking the word of God, if
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100860:10"/>
they wanted outward ordination; then <hi>Paul</hi> was a great transgressor,
who consulted not with flesh and blood, neither with any other of the
Brethren, nor went not up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for ordination, but preached
three yeare the word of God, and then afterwards went up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
and saw none except <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and had no ordination
then as we read of; and afterward he went into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Celecia,</hi> and
furthermore saith, he <hi>was not known by face to the Churches of Judea;</hi>
So who ordain'd him all this time, for there was no Churches of the
Gentiles but what he had planted then, and so they could not ordaine
him, <hi>Gal. 1. 17, 18, 19, 21, 22.</hi> And who ordain'd <hi>Apollo;</hi> but it
may be that R. I. will say that <hi>Paul</hi> was ordain'd at <hi>Antioch, Act. 12.</hi>
2. But I would have R. I. to understand that here was 17. yeares
that he preached publickly before that, and where was his ordination?
Many of the Brethren who was scartered abroad in the persecution
that was at Jerusalem, went every where preaching the word of God,
and when or where was these ordained? and who ordained the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that was persecuted after <hi>Stephens</hi> being put to death, who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villed
as far as <hi>Phenecia,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> preaching the word
and the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and turned unto the Lord, <hi>Acts 17, 19, 20, 21.</hi> Yet these things
I bring not as to deny but that many went out with the consent of the
Church, and many were ordained Elders who were grown up in the
truth and established, who had received the Holy Ghost, by whom
many was confirmed and strengthned in the faith; but what is all
this R. I. to your ordination, and who ordained you, the <hi>Pope,</hi> a <hi>Bishop,</hi>
or a <hi>Councell,</hi> or a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and what are they you irdaube? such as
learnes the art of speech seaven yeares at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who hath read <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and <hi>Aristotle, Plato</hi> and <hi>Diogenes,</hi> and learned to play on a Fiddle;
These are no <hi>Mechanicks</hi> but gifted men indeed and quallified, and
fit to be ordained and made Ministers, Pastors and Elders to carry a
broad the Traffique of <hi>Mistery Babylon;</hi> but this <hi>R. I.</hi> is very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory,
and saith, <hi>it is utterly unlawfull for any that are gifted to
preach the word;</hi> Contrary to the Apostles doctrine, who saith, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one hath receiveth the gift so let him administer, and not such as
R. I. would have to be Ministers, who hath learned an art to speak,
and this must be called a gift, and a quallification, and a fit man to be
a Pastour, and thus they have ordained one another, and hath set up a
trade of preaching, and with their confused stories hath fill'd the world
with darknesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100860:10"/>
               <hi>And as concerning an infallible Spirit, saith R. I.</hi> None except
Christ who was without sin can challenge it, or lay claime to it, and I
may say of such runnagates and wandering starrs, as this F. H. and
the Quakers are, as <hi>John</hi> did, 1 Joh. 2. 9. They are gone out from us,
because they were not of us.</p>
            <p>Answer, However this R. I. hath cleared himselfe and the rest of
his brethren for being Ministers of Christ, for they doe not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
an infallible Spirit, neither look to be made partakers thereof, but
quite shut out all the Saints from enjoying it; and though in Christ
<hi>the fullnesse of the Godhead dwelt,</hi> who was full of <hi>grace and truth;</hi>
he is the Root from whence all that believe come to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his virtue, and so many of his members may lay claime to it,
as they have received it by a free gift according to the promise of
Christ, <hi>I will send you the Spirit of truth which shall lead you into all
truth,</hi> and the Apostle had received the <hi>Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,
who had freed him from the Law of sin and death,</hi> and the sons of God
had received it, and they were led by it, and the Ministers of Christ
was made Ministers of it, who hath made us able Ministers as it is
written, <hi>not of the letter, but of the Spirit,</hi> and that Spirit was infallible
and true, and that Spirit which they declared of, was an unerring
Spirit, and as they were led by it they erred not, but were kept by
it that the <hi>evill one touched them not,</hi> and they spoke from it, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Church in it in the wisdome of God. But what doth these
men minister from, who waits not to be made partakers of this, but
denyes that ever any had it, or even shall have, and so are but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of dreamers, and tells their dreame that they dreamed in the
night, or at best steales the words from their neighbour, and saith,
<hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi> when God hath never spoken to them. And
though thou may say we are runnagates, because we sit not dreaming
over 30 or 40 families 20 yeares, but travills from city, and from
country to country to publish the word of truth freely, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Ministers of Christ did; We must by such as this <hi>R. I.</hi> and
his Brethren, who hath gotten holes and nests in the earth to creep
into, be counted as runnagates; and though <hi>John</hi> said, <hi>they are gone
out from us, because they were not of us,</hi> this he spoke of them who went
out of the light, in which he and the rest of the Disciples had fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with God, and one with another; and they that went out from
this, went into the spirit of the world; and you are such as they that
are gone out already, and blasphemously calls the light of Christ
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100860:11"/>
               <hi>Ignis fatuus;</hi> and so all that fear the Lord will come out from you, and
out from <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the blood of the prophets hath been shed,
and the witnesses kill'd; you who deny an infallible Spirit, is like to
be in blindnesse and follow the spirit of errour, for you have nought
else to cleave unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further, R. I. saith, When the Lord said by</hi> Joell, <hi>that he
would</hi> pour out his Spirit upon all flesh, and his sons and daughters
should prophesie; the prophet speaks not of a ghostly power to open the
Kingdome of Heaven, given by Christ to his Apostles and Successors,
but of an extraordinary measure of enlightning grace, and a more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
effusion of the Spirit, and also to pastors to whom more is given, more
is required; and this Text doth not prove that all sheep shall be Pastors,
and all schollars Teachers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Nay this Text doth not prove all Sheep to be Pastors,
neither all that are taught to be teachers, for all are not Prophets,
neither Pastors nor teachers, for as Christ said the <hi>Labourers are but
few,</hi> but this man is afraid that there should be too many, and indeed
there are too many hireling loyterers, that are ready to supplant one
another for filthy lucre; and though many may be said to beleeve, yet
all have not received the Spirit of prophesie, or a gift to be pastors, but
onely they to whom it is given of the Lord for the worke sake, yet
notwithstanding they who have received it ought not to be limitted,
either Son or daughter, for them who doe, quenches the Spirit, and
despises prophesie, as this R. I. doth, and how should he doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
seeing he hath denyed the infallible Spirit, from which all the
Ministers ministred, and all the prophets prophesied and spoke as
<hi>they were moved by the holy Ghost.</hi> But <hi>R. I.</hi> saith, <hi>the Prophet spoke
not of a ghostly power to open the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> if by ghostly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
he meane the Spirits power, as I beleeve he will not deny, then
was it not by a spirituall power, sons and daughters prophesied, and did
not this power open the Kingdome of Heaven, and if it be a more
<hi>Copious effusion</hi> of the Spirit which is given under the Gospell then
the Law; then how is it that <hi>R. I.</hi> would straiten or lessen the effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof under the Gospel; for there was Daughters that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
under the Law, and many Sons that spake by the Spirit of God;
but now all must be confined to the letter, and your Pastors now
hath far lesse of the Spirit, if any at all, who speaks from the strength
of naturall parts, and denyes the unerring Spirit, and so shuts up the
Kingdome of Heaven against men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100860:11"/>
And R. I. is so grieved at this infallible Spirit, or this spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
that he cannot endure that a Daughter should prophesie or
speak by the Spirit of God in the assembly of the Saints, and the main
stresse of his or all their arguments is the <hi>1 Cor. 14. 34. Let your
women keep silence in the Church, for it is not permitted for them to speak
and if any woman speaks in the Church, it contradicts the Spirit,</hi> and
<hi>though they have a gift, they ought not to improve it in a disorderly way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer. That which hath been said in this perticular unto <hi>E. D.</hi>
is sufficient to them whose eyes God hath opened, but this <hi>R. I.</hi> is one
of the evil beasts that the Apostle speaks of, <hi>whose mouth must be stopt.</hi>
And so I further say, that the Apostle writ to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
which were beleevers, which few will deny but that it consisted both
of men and women, and he expressely saith, <hi>ye may all prophesie one by
one,</hi> and, furthermore, <hi>if a woman prophesie with her head uncovered dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoureth
her head;</hi> so that it is manifest that thee was women did
prophesie and also laboured in the Gospell; but saith R. I. <hi>that was
but in a private way, or amongst some few,</hi> this had been lawfull or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
in <hi>R. I.</hi> his account, and if she might speak to two or three, or
twice three it may be, as there is in many houses, is not this call'd a
Church, and doth not Christ say, <hi>Where two or three are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in my name, I will be in the middest of them.</hi> Moreover, was not
that a Church which was in <hi>Aquilla</hi> and <hi>Priscilla's</hi> house? <hi>1 Cor. 16.
19.</hi> and was not <hi>Priscilla</hi> a Daughter that did prophesie? what must
<hi>Priscilla</hi> goe out of her house in which was the Church if she had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to speak by the Spirit? was it lawfull to speak without doors
and not in the house? and if she might speak in her house, then she
spoke in the Church, and <hi>R. I.</hi> would have said she had <hi>contradicted
the Spirit of God;</hi> and is not Christ one in the Male and in the female?
and is not male and female both one in Christ Jesus? is Christs power
and the Spirits authority any whit lesse efficacious or powerfull when
he speakes in the female? or is it the sects only that addeth or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
from the authority of the Spirit; thou ignorant man who art
voyd of the knowledge of God? and was not <hi>Mary</hi> a woman, and did
not she preach Christs Resurrection to the Disciples, and were not
they the Church? but this is like will not satisfie <hi>R. I.</hi> his unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mind who doth not beleeve that a woman may prophesie or speak
in the Church, for <hi>this would contradict Pauls saying;</hi> not at all, I
grant <hi>Pauls</hi> words to be true, this was spoke occasionally to one
Church? concerning them that were unlearned and untaught of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100860:12"/>
Spirit, that usurped authority over the man, and such as was disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whose spirit was not subject to the <hi>Prophet,</hi> and what must this be
a binding example, as to quench the Spirit, and limit the Lord from
generation to generation as to binde or limit them, who are in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to their <hi>husband</hi> and who usurped not authority? for it is one
thing to have authority, and another thing to usurp authority; now
they that are come to feel the power of God, and thereby be moved
to speak, the <hi>power</hi> gives her authority, but she that is not in the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
neither doth feele the motion of the Spirit, such a one usurps au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and is unlearned, and such, and they only were prohibited by
<hi>Paul</hi> and no other; for if it had extended unto all, then the women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned had been transgressors; and likewise further for the
satisfaction of all; <hi>Anna</hi> a prophetesse, the Daughter of <hi>Phanuell</hi> of
the Tribe of <hi>Aser,</hi> she coming into the Temple <hi>gave thanks unto
the Lord, and spake of Christ unto all them that looked for Redemption
in Jerusalem,</hi> and that was in a publick place, and in a publick congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<hi>Luk. 2. 36, 37, 38.</hi> And last of all, if E. D. and R. I. will
not confesse that the meeting neer <hi>Cond,</hi> in which the women spake,
was a Church, which <hi>F. H.</hi> justifies, then E. D. and R. I. hath lost
their cause, and wrangled about nothing, and the thing proved against
them both, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That a woman declaring, speaking or prophesying
by the Spirit of the Lord and in the authority of God, is a lawfull and
a commendable, and a justifiable act in the sight of God and all the
children of light: And therefore cease your foolish clamour, and let
no such ignorant stuffe come in print again, lest your folly be more and
more made manifest, and the stone fall upon you which will <hi>grind you
to powder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing which R. I. quarrells about, is a lye, which <hi>Edward
Dodd</hi> asserted, that some of the <hi>Quakers</hi> should say they were <hi>equall
with God,</hi> unto which F. H. replyed and said, he that hath the Spirit
of God, is in that which is <hi>equall,</hi> and he that is joyned to the Lord is
<hi>one Spirit,</hi> there is unity, and that unity stands in <hi>equallity,</hi> and these
expressions saith R. I. <hi>offers violence to God and his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer, This R. I. is so in love with the spirit of errour, for he
hath denyed the infallible Spirit, and is in such love with an unequall
spirit, that he cannot endure to here that any should be joyned
to the Lord in an <hi>equall</hi> Spirit, and so quarrells with plain Scripture,
and saith, <hi>it doth violence to the Majesty of God;</hi> the Spirit of the
Father, and the Spirit of truth, is an <hi>equall</hi> Spirit, and them that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100860:12"/>
are led by it and are in it, are in that which is <hi>equal,</hi> and so are joyned
to the Lord, and are neerly related to him; but that I said or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the creature is <hi>equal</hi> to the Creator, in <hi>power,</hi> or in <hi>glory,</hi>
is false and a lye, and let <hi>E. D.</hi> and <hi>R. I.</hi> know, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> are for the
lake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R. I.</hi> saith, <hi>Christ is glorified in his humane nature, and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and flesh may be understood of the regenerate part, and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may be understood both of soul and body, and this may confute</hi> F. H.
<hi>that doth contend against humane nature,</hi> and goes on and tells ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lye, as every page is fild with some, and saith F. H. saith, <hi>Christ
hath no real body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This man speaks out of thick darkness, and intrudes into those
things he hath not seen, being vainly puft up in his fleshly mind;
I said unto <hi>E. D.</hi> that Christ was the seed of <hi>David according to the
flesh,</hi> and according to the Spirit, <hi>the son of God;</hi> And furthermore
said, and new saith, that Christ is glorified in a spiritual body, and
incorruptible body; and so by incorruptible body and spiritual body,
according to <hi>R. I.</hi> his dark understanding, must also be understood <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature;</hi> and again, <hi>humane nature may be understood of the soul,</hi>
O dark and fortish man, what art thou like to confute, who saith <hi>the
humane nature may be taken for the soul,</hi> and also it may be taken for
<hi>flesh,</hi> and also it may be taken <hi>for the regenerate part,</hi> and thus like a
blind man hath lost all aime, thou runnest rambling up and down in
every by-path, but how should thou doe otherwise, seeing thou hast
denyed that Spirit that doth not erre? and also would have all others
to deny it, and saith, <hi>that none may lay claime to it,</hi> although God
hath promised it, to give the spirit of truth to lead his people into all
truth; and if into all truth, then out of all error, but this doctrine of
Christ comes too neer <hi>perfection</hi> for <hi>R. I</hi> to own, which is a doctrine
so offensive to him, that he cannot endure to hear of it, or that ought
should be <hi>perfect,</hi> and therefore he hath condemned the law of the
<hi>spirit of life,</hi> and saith it is <hi>imperfect,</hi> as may be seen in the 55 page
of his book, and if flesh, and the <hi>regenerate</hi> part of man, and the <hi>soul,</hi>
may all be understood by <hi>humane nature,</hi> then they are all one, and
then the soul is humane and earthly, but the soul is spiritual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
and flesh and blood inherits not the kingdome of God, and
the regenerate part is that which is begotten and brought forth by the
immortal word of life, <hi>and that which is born of the spirit is spirit,</hi> and
so the ignorance of this man is made manifest, and so <hi>R. I.</hi> may take
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100860:13"/>
his lye home unto himselfe, as that <hi>F. H.</hi> denyes <hi>the reall body of
Christ,</hi> for <hi>F. H.</hi> hath said, and now saith againe, and that according
to knowledge, that Christ hath an incorruptible body, and a glorious
body, and a spiritual body, and in this body is Christ glorified with
the Father, and <hi>humane nature,</hi> is no where taken for <hi>a spiritual and
incorruptible body,</hi> in the Scriptures account, as this <hi>R. I.</hi> and his blind
tribe doth imagine, and yet the flesh of Christ is owned, and the
word that was made flesh the Saints know and doth feed on, by
which they are nourished up into everlasting life, and so I say unto
thee, as I did to <hi>E. D.</hi> when thou writes again speak plainly, if by <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature</hi> thou intend <hi>a carnal body,</hi> or the same flesh thou art on, &amp;
thou would devide the flesh of Christ from his Spirit, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
Christ, &amp; Christ is not divided; and thus he goes quarrelling on
and heaps lye upon lye, and saith that <hi>F. H.</hi> saith, <hi>Christ hath no real
body, but his mystical body,</hi> which thing is thy own and never affirmed
by me either in word or writing, and so repent of thy lyes, and for
shame call in thy Book least the judgements and plagues of God be
multiplyed upon thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further saith R. I.</hi> How do the Quakers condemn themselves,
when they so proudly boast themselves, as the Pharisees did, to be clear
from sin, who needs not Christs righteousness for their justification; how
then can they say that Christs righteousness is their justification, when
they are so righteous in their own eyes, for Christ hath not promised to
justifie any, but those that confess their sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We have confest our sins, and also departed from them,
and not like you feigned hypocrites, who are confessing from year
to year with your feigned lips, and your hearts never turned to the
Lord from iniquity, and takes the name of Christs righteousnesse to
be a cloak to cover your iniquity withall; and we do not say, that we
have no need of Christs righteousnesse for our justification, for if we
should say so, we should be lyars like thy self, for we have need of
Christs righteousnesse, for he is our life, who is called <hi>The Lord our
righteousness,</hi> he is our justifier, and who art thou that condemns any?
but the false accuser of the brethren, for Christs righteousnesse is
our covering, and we are not righteous in our own eyes, but in the
eyes of him who hath made us so; and we never said that we have not
sinned, and so we have not made God a lyar, as this vile slanderer
would make men beleeve through his false aspertions, for we say, we
were once darknesse, but now are we light in the Lord, and he who is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100860:13"/>
our light and life, is our justification and righteousnesse, and his blood
cleanseth from all sin, and the power of God keepeth us <hi>that the evil one
toucheth us not,</hi> and yet all boasting is excluded.</p>
            <p>And the further R. I. goes on the lower he sinks towards the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
pit, and there we shall find him at last before we have done with his
book, and speaks out of thick darknesse, like a man that never saw the Sun,
who hath altogether taken up his dwelling place in Deaths Region, and as
though that were the Land of his nativity, and thou shalt see Reader by
what ensues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R. I. saith,</hi> Though it be said, He that commits sin is of the Devill; not
that the Devill can claime him for his own, or that he is in his possession, but
he is captivated of the Devill and everpowered. <hi>And for his proof he brings</hi>
Peter was cryed up to be a Saint, and at that same time when he was cryed
up to be a Saint, Christ called <hi>Peter</hi> a devill, and that must be understood a
Saint had sinned.</p>
            <p>Answer. He that is captivated by the <hi>Devil,</hi> hath gone from the <hi>power
of God,</hi> and he that commits sin doth the Devils work, and he may claime
him for his workman; and he that is overpowered is brought into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and he that carryes into captivity hath the Captive in his possession,
as it is written, <hi>his servants you are to whom you obey,</hi> and he that commits
sin is the servant of sin. And these black confused distinctions R. I. maketh
to make people beleeve that they are Saints of God, when they are the
Devils captives, and that they are in the possession of Christ, who yet doe
the works of the Devill who is an enemy to Christ, and thou knows no
more of a Saint then thou knows of a devill, who saith that <hi>Peter</hi> at the
same time that Christ called him a Saint, <hi>called him a devil;</hi> for thou must
know, that <hi>Matthew</hi> recorded many things it may be in one Chapter,
which was acted and done, and spoken in many dayes and weeks, for when
<hi>Peter</hi> confessed Christ to be the Son of God, he was in the faith, and Christ
said, <hi>flesh and blood had not revealed that to him,</hi> but at this time had spoken
little of his sufferings; as it is written, <hi>Mat. 16. 21,</hi> from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
began Jesus to shew unto his Disciples, how that he must goe unto
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> and suffer many things, and be kil'd, and rise again the third day;
So that it is manifest, that here was distance of time and space betwixt <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
confession of Christ and of his rebuking of him; however the unbelief
was gotten up in <hi>Peter,</hi> and he that had need to be taught, came to be a
rebuker of him who was his Teacher, this was another state then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
but of these things R. I. is ignorant, and let the Serpent feed upon
dust, for I desire to give him no other food.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100860:14"/>
               <hi>And further R. I. saith,</hi> Though Saints sin not Devil-like unto death, yet
if any man say he hath not sinned ofter the similitude of Adam's transgression,
he, <hi>saith John,</hi> is a lyar and the truth is not in him, for when all is done the
best men are men still, and the best earth is earth ever, and will bear nettles
and brambles; me and if these things were well considered by <hi>F. H.</hi> he would
not say and <hi>E. D.</hi> for pleading for sin or Satan, for we plead against
those who say they have no sin.</p>
            <p>Answer. This R. I. is so in love with sin, that by his arguments which
he makes, one would judge that he accounts it as necessary as his dayly
food, and these are strange kind of Saints that R. I would make, at the best
they are but still sinners, and unsanctified; but they that are called to be
Saints, who are begotten by God the father and preserved in Christ Jesus,
they are sanctified and made clean through the washing of Regeneration,
&amp; through the sanstsification of Gods holy Spirit which divelleth in them,
by which they have power to mortifie the deeds of the fiesh, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
and to be made partakers of the promises; but here lyes the
difference in R. I. his account, betwixt his Saints and his Sinners, <hi>The sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
sinneth devil-like, yet the Saints sin not devil-like,</hi> I say they that sin
are in one nature, notwithstanding R. I. his blind distinctions, for they that
sin are liker the Devill then God, and liker his image then Gods Image,
for Gods Image consisteth in righteousness and ture holinesse, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
image consisteth in unrighteousness, sin, and unholiness. And now
Reader thou may judge whose Image R. I. his Saints bears, and if thou be
one that can plead against them who are born of God, and sinneth not, and
who are cleansed from all sin by the blood of Christ, then R. I. will rank
thee with E. D. and himself in his Bead-row of Saints, as he calls it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if any man say, he hath not sinned after the simititude of</hi> Adam's
<hi>transgression, he is, saith</hi> John, <hi>a lyar;</hi> Nay it is R. I. that saith it and not
<hi>John,</hi> and so R. I. is the lyar, for the Scripture saith on this wise, <hi>Rom. 5. 14.</hi>
Death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> even over them that had (not) sinned
after the similitude of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression. So that it is manifest, that
there were many that death reigned over, and yet they sinned not after
the similitude of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression. But this R. I. will accuse every
man with whom he hath a mind to quarrel, and will not only tell lyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but publish false Doctrine, but he will bring the Saints for his author;
and <hi>John</hi> saith not, If any man say he hath no sin; And thou that sayest,
when all is done, <hi>the best men and the best earth, will bear nestles, brambles,
and tricks,</hi> as I said to E. D. so I may to thee, thou hast given thy verdict
for the Devill, and not for God and his Saints, for <hi>They that are born of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100860:14"/>
God sin not,</hi> and them that are cleansed by the bloud of Christ from all sin,
and are clear in his sight, and are kept by his immortall word which dwells
in them that the evill one touch them not, but hath overcome the wicked
one, and the best earth is that wherein righteousnesse dwells, which R. I.
is altogether a stranger too, and that brings forth no bryars, no brambles,
nettles nor pricks, for that ground is curst; so this man by his devillish
Doctrine, hath made the coming of Christ of none effect, and the bloud of
Christ of none effect, and so have denyed the work of redemption to the
best of men, and deliverance to the Creature who hath travelled in paine.
This dreamer is far contrary to the Prophet <hi>Daniell,</hi> who saw by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Prophesie (which this <hi>R. I.</hi> so deadly hates, both in men and women
that if it be not allowed of by such as he, it must not speak nor they by ir)
This Prophet I say testified of the coming of the just one, and of his work,
that he should <hi>make an end of sin, and finish transgression, and bring in ever-lasting
righteousnesse;</hi> but saith <hi>R. I. The best men are men still, and the best
Earth earthever, and the best saints sinners, though they sin not devil-like, &amp;
nettles and brambles and pricks they will all bring forth.</hi> Now if this doctrine
be true, how is the soul raised out of death, and where is the restauration
of the creature from under the bondage of corruption, and where is the
redemption of the seed which is heir of the promise. Nettles and bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
bryars cumbers the ground, and choakes the seed, and these things
F. H. hath well considered, and I see more and more that thou art a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for sin and Satan, and imperfection, for a spirit of errour, for Images,
Pictures and Crosses, for Cuffs, Ribbonds and Lace, for Nettles, Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and bryars, and art a man that doth lay claime to the utmost borders
of the Devils Kingdome, and a greater servant of his Master I have not
met with long, whose reward will be according to his works.</p>
            <p>And the lye being the chief cognisance of his Master, in which he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gloryes in, he goes on and saith, <hi>Another errour of the Quakers is, they
do not beleeve the Scriptures to be true, because they deny them to be the word
of God; for if they beleeve what the Scriptures say of themselves; and they say
of themselves that they are the word of God,</hi> and for his proofs he cites,
<hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 25.</p>
            <p>Answer. The Scriptures we own to be true, and whatsoever the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
say of themselves, that we own them to be (to wit) a declaration,
Scriptures of truth, holy Scriptures, the words of God, of Christ, and of his
Apostles, a Treatise; And for his proofs I could wholly referre them to
the Readento examine them himselfe, and to discover the ignorance of
this <hi>R. I.</hi> who tenders these Scriptures aforementioned for sufficient
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100860:15"/>
proof, as that the Scriptures calls themselves <hi>the word of God,</hi> as for <hi>Mark</hi>
7. 13. making the word of God of none effect by your tradition; He doth
not say of making the word of God, the Scriptures of none effect; neither
doth he say you make the Scriptures, which is the word, of none effect by
your Traditions, and as for <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. <hi>The word is nigh thee in thy mouth
and in thy heart,</hi> And this is the word of faith which we preach; Here the
Apostle saith, <hi>the word is nigh thee in thy heart,</hi> but he doth not say, the
Scriptures is nigh thee in thy heart, which is the word of God, And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2. 17. <hi>For we are not as many which corrupt the word of God;</hi> he doth not
say, we are not as many that corrupt the Scriptures, which are the word of
God, or the word of God which is the Scriptures. And as for 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 25.
<hi>But the word of the Lord endures for ever, and this is the word which by the
Gospel is preached unto you;</hi> he doth not say the Scriptures endures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or this is the word, the Scriptures, which by the Gospell is preached
unto you. And as for 1 <hi>Thes</hi> 4. 15. <hi>For this we say unto you by the word of the
Lord, that we which are alive, and remaine unto the coming of the Lord, shall
not prevent them which are asleep;</hi> He did not say, this we say unto you by
the Scriptures, for there was not such a Scripture written before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we say this unto you by the <hi>Word of the Lord:</hi> And what a foolish man
is this, to assert his own imaginations, and then imagins the Scriptures will
prove it; and what an improper speech were this, to call twenty thousand
Sentences one word; and it is called a declaration; and what a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would that be which consisted but of one word; But enough of this
hath been published before concerning this perticular by divers hands,
so I shall be brief. However <hi>R. I.</hi> doubts his proof allready, that it will
not satisfie F. H. and therefore he thought good to make this conclusion
upon him, <hi>That he does not believe the Scriptures at all;</hi> and though F. H.
say, that these Scriptures are nothing at all to prove that thing; to deny his
imaginations, is not to deny the Scripture; But F. H. beleeves what the
Scriptures saith of themselves, and doth not deny the Scriptures at all, but
<hi>R. I.</hi> his lye, and also his false conclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further saith</hi> R. I. The Scripture was delivered to the Church in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that it might be an infallible standard <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f true doctrine, and a determiner
of controversies, and the Saints Rule of knowing God and living to him.</p>
            <p>Answer. Reader take notice here is no roome for the Spirit at all, the
Scriptures and writings have taken up the room of it in <hi>R. I.</hi> his account, for
it hath lost its office, if his doctrine be true; the letrer is become the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
judg and standard to try doctrine, and a determiner of all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
and of the Saints rule of knowing God, and living to him, and indeed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100860:15"/>
is become all in this mans account, then what doth <hi>R. I.</hi> bring <hi>Aesops Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Ovids fictions, Plato's</hi> and <hi>Diogenes</hi> stories, in this controversie to joyn
with this infallible rule; &amp; because he hath the Scriptures so high to be a
tryer of doctrines without the Spirit, doubtles is the cause here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of it, and so he shall be judged by his rule; in the 42 page take
his Exposition upon the words of <hi>Joel, I will pour out of my Spirit upon sons
and daughters, and they shall prophesie; This is not meant of a ghostly power,
but of an extraordinary measure of enlightening grace.</hi> Ignorant man, is not
Ghostly power of spirituall power an extraordinary measure of enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
grace? and was it not as spiritual power, and an extraordinary light the
Prophets prophesied by; But it is this mans meaning that must be the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
when all comes to all, and the determiner of cases; and he speaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto his own rule, as may be seen through his whole book, who hath
either added to the Scriptures, or perverted them, or otherwise given his
false interpretations, or villified them in calling them the <hi>True Cards,</hi> and
so though he extolled them in words, he denyes them in practice; The
Jews tryed Christs doctrine by the Scriptures, and judged him a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and a breaker of the Law, and the Apostles seditious; and so though
a man have the Scripture, and have not the Spirit, it is all as a sealed book,
wherein such unlearned men as this <hi>R. I.</hi> is cannot read; and therefore he
saith in his 55 page, <hi>That it is a great fault in us,</hi> because we say <hi>the Law of
the Spirit of life is the Rule,</hi> &amp; so like him will not say <hi>it is imperfect,</hi> as he
doth, &amp; so saith <hi>R. I. it is not fit to be a rule,</hi> &amp; so blasphemously he detracts
from the authority and power of the Spirit, and like Antichrist and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
sets the letter above it, &amp; cals it <hi>living &amp; an infallible standard,</hi> and
saith <hi>the Scripture inclines the heart unto obedience</hi> and like a drunken man
this <hi>R. I. reels</hi> up and down and contradicts himself: Before he said <hi>The
law of the Spirit chiefly gave power to conforme to the Rule,</hi> and within four
lines contradicts himself, and saith <hi>The Scriptures inclines our hearts to the
obedience of the Rule, and the Scriptures it self hath caused us to know it, as we
have it from the Church, it is a probable aid, and yet giveth but a confused
beliefe, with a light impression. Answ.</hi> It is probable enough indeed that thy
faith is confused, &amp; the faith of your church, &amp; that makes thee utter forth
all this confused heap, but in what hath been said, the spirit of this man and
his doctrines will be manifest to all whose eyes God hath opened, and so
will depart out of his paths and not give heed to his fabulous stories.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is true saith</hi> R. I. There is an inward law written in our hearts, called
the law of the Spirit of life, <hi>Rom. 8. 2.</hi> And there is the outward Law written
in the Scriptures; Now the outward and externall law is properly the Rule of
a christian life, and not the inward and internall law; for the outward law is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100860:16"/>
perfect in that it declares in what is the will of God, and in what it is not;
but the inward law received and written on the heart is imperfect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unfit to be our rule, the law within is that thing that is to be ruled, <hi>Psal.
17. 4.</hi> The outward law therefore is the Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> This man would set the Sun by his diall, as it might be said, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he confess in the very same page, that the Law of the Spirit of life
giveth power to the creature, yet now it is become imperfect, &amp; not fit to
be a rule; this man like one unlearned, sets the Law which was written in
Tables of stone, which the Apostle calls <hi>the Ministration of condemnation</hi>
and was <hi>glorious,</hi> this he sets above <hi>the Ministration of the Spirit of life,</hi>
which the Apostle saith <hi>is much more glorious;</hi> but nay saith <hi>R. I. The law
written in the heart is imperfect and not fit to be a rule, but to be ruled;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Apostles doctrine; and so this R. I. is tryed by his own infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
standard, to be a deceiver, who teaches contrary to that which he cals
his law and testimony; and the Law which is outward, is the Law of the
first Covenant, which made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better
hope did, by which we draw nigh unto God, <hi>Heb. 7. 19.</hi> Therefore the
Lord said by the mouth of the Prophet, <hi>Behold the dayes come that I will
make a new Covenant with the house of Israel, not according to the Covenant
I made with you when I brought them out of the Land of Egypt, when I was
as a husband into them, which Covenant they brake; but I will write my Law
in their hearts, and put my spirit in their inward parts; I will be to them a
God, and they shall be unto me a people,</hi> Jer. 31. 33. <hi>Heb. 8. 9, 10.</hi> Now this
blind man, who gropes as at noon day, saith, <hi>This is imperfect which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the heart,</hi> and so faulty with him, and <hi>therefore to be ruled over;</hi> and
the other which is <hi>outward is perfect,</hi> and faultlesse, and so ought to be a
<hi>Rule;</hi> but saith the Apostle contrary to R. I. If the first Covenant had
been faultlesse, there had been no place for the second, which second the
Apostle saith, is a better Covenant, and stands upon better promises; but
yet saith <hi>R. I.</hi> this is not the rule, not fit to be a rule; And furthermore the
Apostle said, <hi>as many as are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God,</hi> and
this was their rule, and the Law of the Spirit of life made the Apostle free
from the law of sin and death, and was the new creatures rule by which
they were led into all truth, and as many as did walk in it, out of all sin:
But nay saith <hi>R. I. It is not sit to be a rule, for this is imperfect, and is that
thing to be ruled,</hi> and for his proof brings <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>By the word of thy lips
I have kept me from the path of the destroyer;</hi> and how doth this prove that
the Law in the heart is to be ruled. Thou ignorant man, who litters forth
nothing but deceit and error? and so the Scriptures declares against thee,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100860:16"/>
for they say, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul; The Commandement of
the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes,</hi> Psal, 19. 7, 8. <hi>For the Commandement is a Lamp and
the law is light,</hi> Prov. 6. 23. And the Commands of the New Covenant are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and not carnall, and they are perfect and fit to be a rule to guide all them that
beleeve in a perfect way, and not as this R. I. saith, <hi>unfit to be a Rule because of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,</hi>
and would in his blind distinctions, cast a mist before peoples eyes; and all
may judge not only of this R. I. his mistake, but of his wilfull impudence, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that which is visible and outward, and may be seen, which was given forth in
time, (viz.) the Commands outward, and the letter outward, above the Law of
the Spirit of Life, which is invisible, spirituall and eternall: And as I said to S. S. So
I may say to thee, <hi>Leane souls are they like to be, who receives such damnable Doctrine as
this for Articles of Faith.</hi> But however Reader thou may take notice of R. I. in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the Reader, he saith, <hi>The Quakers money is counterfeit coyne, which he hath
nailed on the Market post, and instead thereof hath tendered other money;</hi> and that thou
may see what kind of other money the Priests is, and what Image it hears by the
Principles here discovered, which is altogether. <hi>Tin and drosse and Reprobate Silver,</hi>
which will be received by none, but them whom the God of this world ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h blinded
the eyes of, that they should not see the things that belongs unto their peace.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Edward Dodd</hi> being sensible that he &amp; all his stuffe, or he and all his arguments
was carried Captive, and become a booty and a prey, he is glad that any will step in
and rescue him, and flatters R. I. and saith, <hi>I am engaged to you, to imbrace you as a precious
friend, that of so weake principles as mine, have raised so perfect a structure, so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
rationall, and demonstrative, that more need not to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. R. I. his Vindication hath not redeemed E. D. his principles at all, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath laboured in vain, and spent his strength for naught, and hath brought forth
such a birth as sober men will blush at, made up of Ignorance, Blasphemy, Derision,
and lyes, which they that have the lest moderation will abhorre and detest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
the Principles of E. D. and R. I. are not only weak and feeble, but wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
as is manifest in what hath been declared; And the structure that R. I. hath
made, is but builded with untempered Morter, lyes, falshood, errour, false Doctrine,
which the stormy wind of the Lord will Rent and scatter, and confound, and exalt
his Truth above it all. But E. D. saith, <hi>What can be said to reduce such a people I know
not, since so many convincing arguments cannot prevaile.</hi> Alass poor men whether
would you reduce us, or bring us back, to the slime pits of <hi>Sodome,</hi> where E. D. fell
with his stuffe, or turn us back again to Images, Pictures and Crosses, to Mass-houses,
Hirelings and Tythes, to Lace, Ribons, and Cuffes, which both E. D. and R. I.
hath strongly pleaded for, as faithfull Servants to their Master, who would not have
him loose a foot of his Territories; however E. D. hath resolved to continue one in
life and death with R. I. who hath shaken hands with the Prince of darknesse, and
made a Covenant with death, which must be broken; and though S. S. E. D. &amp; R. I.
joyne hand in hand, yet the wicked shall not goe unpunished, for every one shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a reward according to their works.</p>
            <p>And so I have done with R. I. his Book called Ignis fatu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> , whose arguments, false
doctrines, errours and lies are dissolved into nothing; his Vindication made voyd,
his ignorance made manifest, his false Doctrines brought to light, and reproved by
the <hi>word of truth;</hi> Only I shall returne him a few of his lyes back again for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
the second time, and repent of them, and remember the sentence for all Lyars
<hi>is, The Lake that burneth,</hi> Rev. 22. 15.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100860:17"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> That their worship differs not in whole nor in part, in matter nor in manner from the
Churches in the Primitive times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> According to the Scriptures their whole worship is framed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Jezabel was never more madder against the Prophets, then these <hi>Quakers</hi>
are against Christs Ministers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Quakers contemn Magistracy &amp; infect the Common-wealth with <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the <hi>Quakers</hi> burnt some houses at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That <hi>Timothy &amp; Titus</hi> were setled in a Parochial way in their quarters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That <hi>F. H.</hi> complains of the darkness of the Sun, when the fault is in his own eys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> deny honour to Superiors, &amp; to whom it is due, and so blaspheme the
name of God and his doctrine</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly, F. H.</hi> would never have cryed out of deceit, but a purpose to deceive the more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> That the <hi>Quakers</hi> bid open defiance to the worship of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> That <hi>I. N.</hi> did say, That he was as just, and holy, and good, as God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> That <hi>F. H.</hi> said, That Christ Jesus was not glorified in Heaven with a real body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> Humane nature is taken for the regenerate part of man, and the soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> That the best men (though regenerate) bears Nettles, Brambles, and Pricks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifteenthly,</hi> There is an inward law, called the law of the Spirit of life, which is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
and not fit to beare rule, but to be ruled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixteenthly,</hi> And the Scriptures leads us to the Spirit, and enclines our hearts to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the rule.</p>
            <p>Seventeenthly, <hi>And</hi> F. H. <hi>preferreth</hi> Ignis Fatuus, <hi>before the clear light of Gods word.</hi>
Eighteenthly, &amp; lastly, when he hath spoken all these lies, &amp; publish'd them in Print to
the world, he blasphemously saith, in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the Reader, Have not so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the authority of the Writer, as the truth of the matter written by him, who
was <hi>moved of the Lord thus to declare.</hi> So all these lyes with many more, and all these
damnable Doctrines which he hath uttered forth against the truth, these things he
would fasten upon the Lords motion, and so make him the Author of iniquity, and a
cloak for his ungodly speeches against them who love the truth as it is in Jesus, who
hath suffered many reproaches for its sake, and hath been killed all the day long by
this Generation, amongst which <hi>R. I.</hi> is, who hath bent his tongue to mischief, and his
lips to utter forth deceit; and as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> resisted Moses, so hath this <hi>R. I.</hi>
resisted the truth, being a man of a corrupt mind, and concerning the, faith, reprobate;
but he shall not proceed much further, for in what he hath written his folly will be
manifest unto all men, and them that fear the Lord will depart out of his foot-steps,
which leads to the chambers of death, and from those dark paths in which <hi>R. I.</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
which leadeth into utter destruction.</p>
