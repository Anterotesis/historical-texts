            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Protestant Reader.</head>
            <p>AS we have immortal Souls of infinite more value than all transient glories and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary advantages; so ought we both in obedience to the tender and compassionate advice of our blessed Redeemer (who purchased them with his own dear Blood,) and out of a true concern for our Eternal Welfare, to live such lives here as we may be happy hereafter. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant to this excellent design, We
<pb facs="tcp:46562:4"/>
ought carefully attend to that Holy Religion we have so long professed, which teaches no Doctrines that are not agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, and to the practice of the best and purest Ages of Christianity. A Religion, which neither robs God of his Honour, nor the King of his due; a Religion, whose venerable Rites keep a just <hi>medium</hi> betwixt vain Popish Pomp, and Fanatical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency; a Religion that not only teaches us how to be good, but obliges us so to be, that is, a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion truly Christian, and a Copy of that perfect Original which our Lord and Saviour hath left us for our direction. And therefore as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to be dearer to us; so we cannot be sufficiently thankful to his Sacred Majesty (whom God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve) for the Gracious assurance he
<pb facs="tcp:46562:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
has given, that he will support it, and defend us in the profession of it. A King whose Royal Progenitors of Immortal Memory for above 100 years, have not only been the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but the Supports too of the Protestant Religion; His fam'd Grandfather King <hi>Iames</hi> Learnedly defending it by his Pen, and thereby justly meriting the glorious Title of its <hi>Defender;</hi> His Excellent <note n="a" place="margin">For so doth <hi>Mons. Militere,</hi> in his Epistle to His late Majesty, confess.</note> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dying a Glorious Martyr, and his late dearly beloved Brother being a long time Exile for our Reformed Religion. Let us then strive to shew that we are not unworthy of so Illustrious and Valiant a Protector, by our Loyalty to him; not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of such a Religion, by our conformity to its Principles, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Sobriety and Charity, and a stedfast adherence to it, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:46562:5"/>
to any other that will destroy that which our Church hath built upon so sure a Foundation. And that we may rightly understand what this Religion is, and the difference betwixt that which is established in our Church, and what is owned in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I have made the following Collection; wherein is demonstrated how contrary the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Religion is to our Church, and how inconsistent with Scripture, the practice of the Primitive and best Ages of Christianity, and that prov'd, not only from the Writings of the Apostles, and choice Records of Antiquity, but even granted to be so by the most <note n="b" place="margin">Vives de Instrumentis probab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> learned and no less impartial Papists themselves; which as it is the testimony of one Friend against another, is lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an undenyable Evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46562:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Before I conclude, I must admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Reader, that I have not rendered the Authors at large, but so quoted them, that the Learned may examine them, nor have I drawn Arguments (as usually) from them, because that would have made this Book (design'd for a Pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companion) to have swell'd into a great Volume; yet to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital for that just omission, I have, at the conclusion of each Section, directed the Reader to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writers of our Religion, which treat of that particular Controversie at large.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May then the All-wise God, by whose Divine permission thus much hath been perform'd, so bless this poor labour of his unworthy Servant, that</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:46562:6"/>
               <hi>it may be instrumental to the good of his Church, and the confirming of all our weak Brethren in our most Holy Faith; which was the principal design of its publication.</hi>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though she talk aloud of the Antiquity of, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal consent in her Doctrines, is so far from either, That therein she will be tied to no Rule, nor observe any Law, as if she would verifie that Remarque of <note n="1" place="margin">Crantzius Metropol. 7. 45.</note> 
               <hi>Crantzius</hi> upon her in another Case, <hi>Nunc ad se omnium Ecclesiarum jura traxit Romana Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> That she hath engrossed to her self all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges or rights of other Churches. Her greatest <note n="2" place="margin">Bellarmin de verbo dei, l. 4. c. 4.—Pighi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Eccles. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarch. l. 3. c. 3.

And good reason why, <note n="3" place="margin">Concil. de stabilienda Rom. sede, p. 6.</note> because her Doctrines are repugnant to the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. What then will she trust to? Tradition: that she equals with <note n="4" place="margin">Concil. Trident. Sess. 4. decret. 1.</note> the Scriptures themselves. And yet her great Annalist, Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> who was once, as it were, a living Library, while he kept the <hi>Vatican</hi> 
               <note n="5" place="margin">Dr <hi>Iames</hi> his Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Part 4. p. 26.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:46562:7"/>
given by so skilful an Artist, dashes all the Characters wherein the defence of Oral Tradition should be legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And, if Tradition in true Writers be so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to preserve, how can it be expected to be safe from spurious ones, or without any Writers at all?</p>
            <p>However, though the Papists do not grant, that this ruins their Tradition, I am sure, it cuts off that definition of it, by <note n="†" place="margin">Bellar. de Tradit. cap. 9.</note> Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that to be a true Tradition which all former Doctors (mind that! or then will the Fathers come in for a share) have successively in their Ages acknowledged to come from the Apostles, and by their Doctrine or Practices have approved, and which the Universal Church owns as such.</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Definition of Tradition gives us this encouragement and liberty to try Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity by Fathers, Councils and Papal Decrees.</p>
            <p>For the Fathers, I hope, the <hi>Romanists,</hi> who boast so much of their being on their party, will not refuse to be try'd by them, when <note n="7" place="margin">Coster En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirid.

               <hi>Coster</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make such a fine flourish in their pretensions to Antiquity. No, the Fathers shall not be Iudges of the <hi>Papists:</hi> the <hi>Romanists</hi> will not be controlled by the Fathers. For Cardinal <note n="8" place="margin">Baronius ad <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Baronius</hi> saith, <hi>The Catholick Church</hi> (and this they would have you to believe, is their own Church; but against all Reason and Sense) <hi>doth not in all things follow the interpretation of the Fathers.</hi> This is a fair but modest Confession. But Cardinal <note n="9" place="margin">Bellarmin de Concil. au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torit. l. 2 c. 12. Sect. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondeo.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmin</hi> goes further, <hi>The Writings of the Fathers</hi> (saith he) <hi>are not rules to us, nor have the Authority to bind us.</hi> This is an <note n="10" place="margin">How the Papists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and condemn the Fathers, See Dr. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Corruption of the Fathers, part 4.</note> home thrust: and yet <note n="11" place="margin">Salmeron in Ep. ad Rom. cap. 5. disp. 51. p. 468.</note>

               <pb facs="tcp:46562:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is more incivil with those Ancient Doctors, when he saith, That the latter Doctors are sharper-sighted than they, and therefore pronounces of many of them at once, That we must not follow a multitude to deviate from the Truth. I am afraid he gave his own Church a rude blow there; for we may turn that Argument of his against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ever and anon is pleading her great number of Professors. To which let us add, what another Romanist saith in this point. And <note n="12" place="margin">Corn. Muss. Episc.

            </p>
            <p>This indeed is plain dealing, and no mincing of the matter! But then again it is wholly opposite to their vain Pleas for Antiquity, and wholly different from the modest procedure of <note n="13" place="margin">Apolog. adv. Rufin. l. 2. p. 219. tom. 2.</note> S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who thinks it great rashness and irreverence, presently to charge the Antients with heresie for a few obnoxious terms; since, when they erred, they erred perhaps with a simple and honest mind, or wrote things in another sense than they were (afterwards) taken. But, if this be all the esteem the Papists have for the Ancient Doctors, then adieu to the Authority of the Fathers in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, even the Councils fare no better in the Papists hands: For it is usual in their Editions of the Councils, to have some printed with this Title, <hi>Reprobatum</hi> (or disallowed) others <hi>Ex parte Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probatum,</hi> 
               <note n="14" place="margin">Vid. Bin. not. ad 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Constant. tom. 1. part. 1. p. 541. Item not. ad Concil.

Vives in Aug. de civit. Dei, l. 20. c. 36.</note> smart censure of <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> That <hi>those are accounted Decrees and Councils,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:46562:8"/>
               <hi>which make for their purpose, and all others are no more valued by them than the meetings of some tatling Women in a Weaving Shop, or at the Baths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although they reject both Fathers and Councils, (when they are pressed by the Protestants with their Authorities) yet, to take away all testimonies of the Fathers from us, the politick Council of <hi>Trent</hi> set up their <hi>Indices Expurgatorii,</hi> which they referred to Pope <hi>Pius IV.</hi> whose Bull for that end bore date <hi>March 24. 1564.</hi> 
               <note n="16" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Iumes</hi>'s Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Scriptures, Fathers and Councils, Printed 1611. Part 4.</note> And in these Tables they set down, what Books were by them forbidden, and in which to be purged, and what places ought to be left out. Thus design'd they, that both Fathers and Councils should lisp their Language.</p>
            <p>But, though it be contrary to that Rule, by which <note n="17" place="margin">Joh. 5. 31.</note> Christ himself was willing to be tried, If I bear witness of my self, my witnes is not true; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all equity and the old <note n="18" place="margin">Capitul. Carol. Mag. c. 88.</note> Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> That they which are brought out of our own House, ought not to be witnesses for us; yet, since they have disowned (when pressed with strength of Reason, and oppressed with Truth) the Scriptures, the Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, We will pursue them to their last fort; to wit, to the Decrees of their Popes, which they so much adore. If they gain-say these, then <hi>Conclamatum est,</hi> their Case is desperate.</p>
            <p>Well, then it must be so; for they have rejected the Traditions of old Popes for those of new ones: One would have thought, that old Friends and old Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines had been the surest and soundest; but it is not so at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For they have slighted and contradicted that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <note n="19" place="margin">Anaclet. Epist. ap. Bin. Tom. 1. Part. 1. p. 43.</note>

            <p>But because in the following Book I have produced the Testimonies of the Fathers voting against Popish Doctrines, it will not (I judge) be unnecessary to subjoyn, That, although we highly esteem and respect the Fathers, and especially those of the first Three hundred years after Christ, and make use of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as explaining the sense of the Scriptures, and handing to us the Opinions of the Ages they liv'd in; yet we never receive any of them with the same respect and esteem that we do the Word of God: And that with good reason: For though they were learned and pious men; yet they were but men, and consequently were lyable to error as well as other men.</p>

            <p>These things being premised, I shall renew that five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Challenge about the Popes Supremacy, formerly propounded by a Reverend and Learned Bishop of our Church; which the Papists ought first to answer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can justly obtain what they in vain pretend to as Consequences of that Supremacy. For, they failing to prove this, (which, I think, they will never be able to do) their Attempts in the points depending thereon must needs be fruitless and ineffectual.</p>
            <list>
               <head>The Challenge is this:</head>
               <item>1. Whether our Saviour before his Ascension did constitute S. <hi>Peter</hi> his Vicar, and gave him a monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Supremacy over the Apostles and the whole Church?</item>
               <item>2. Whether the Papists can prove, that S. <hi>Peter,</hi> while he lived, exercised such Power and Supreme Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, even over the Apostles? In such Cases as these, <hi>Idem est non esse &amp; non apparere.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Whether, if S. <hi>Peter</hi> exercised any such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it was not temporary, and ceased with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as the Apostleship did?</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46562:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. Whether (if all these were true, as they are wholly the contrary) they can make it appear, That the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was the Successor of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and not the Bishop of <hi>Antioch?</hi> and whether ever he was at <hi>Rome</hi> or no?</item>
               <item>5. Whether they can make it appear, That our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, when on Earth, exercised such a temporal Monarchy as the Pope now challengeth?</item>

               <p>I think there needs no better evidence of the Pope's good intentions towards the Secular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor what ill effects the practice of this sort of Confession can and may produce than this.
