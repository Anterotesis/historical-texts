            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>SEing these Epistles are now at length made publique, it is imagined that I ought to bee accountable to the world of my priuate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, chiefely for mine own discharge, least being mistaken, I fall in hazard of a iust &amp; vniuersall reprehension, for — <hi>Itae nugae seria ducent In mala derisum semel exceptumque sinistre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three poynts are especially therefore to bee explaned. First, why I entitle this worke <hi>Englands heroicall Epistles;</hi> then why I obserue not the persons dignitie in the dedication; lastlie, why I haue annexed notes to euery Epistles end. For the first, the title I hope carrieth reason in it selfe, for that the most and greatest persons berein were English, or else, that theyr loues were obtained in England. And though (heroicall) be properly vnderstood of demi-gods, as of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> whose Parents were said to be the one celestiall, the other mortall, yet is it also transferred to them who for the greatnes of minde come neere to Gods. For to be borne of a celestiall Incubus, is nothing els but to haue a great and mightie spirit, farre aboue the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakenes of men, in which sence <hi>Ouid</hi> (whose imitator I partly professe to be) dooth also vse heroicall. For the second, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none to whom I haue dedicated any two Epistles, but haue their states ouer-matched by them who are made to speake in the Epistles, how euer the order is in dedication, yet in respect of
<pb facs="tcp:12233:3"/>
theyr degrees in my deuotion, &amp; the cause before recited, I hope they suffer no disparagement, seeing euery one is the first in theyr particuler interest, hauing in some sort, sorted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection of the Epistles, to the character of theyr iudgements to whom I dedicate them; excepting onely the blamefulnes of the persons passion, in those poynts wherein the passion is blameful. Lastly, such manifest difference beeing betwixt euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where or howsoeuer they be marshaled, how can I be iustly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached of vnaduisement. For the third, because the worke might in truth be iudged brainish, if nothing but amorous humor were handled therein, I haue inter-wouen matters historicall, which vnexplaned, might defraud the minde of much content; as for example, in Queene <hi>Margarits</hi> Epistle to <hi>VVilliam de la Pole,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Daizie flower, which once perfum'd the ayre,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margarite</hi> in french signifies a Dazie, which for the allusion to her name, this Queene did giue for her deuise: and this as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more, haue seemed to mee not vnwoorthy the explaning. Now, though no doubt I had need to excuse other things beside, yet these most especially, the rest Iouer-passe to eschue tedious recitall, or to speake as malicious enuie may, for that in truth I ouer-see them. If they bee as harmelesly taken as I meant them, it shall suffise to haue onely tonched the cause of the title, of the dedications, and of the notes, whereby emboldned to publish the residue, (these not beeing accounted in mens opinions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) I shall not lastly be afraid to beleeue &amp; acknowledge thee a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader.</p>

            <p>MAdam, after all the admired wits of this excellent age, which haue laboured in the sad complaintes of faire and vnfortunate <hi>Rosamond,</hi> and by the excellence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, haue sounded the depth of her sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry passions: I present to your Ladiship this Epistle of hers to King <hi>Henry,</hi> whom I may rather call her louer then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. Heere must your Ladiship behold variablenes in resolution: woes constantly grounded: laments abruptly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off: much confidence, no certainty, wordes begetting teares, teares confounding matter, large complaints in little papers: and many deformed cares, in one vniformed Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell. I striue not to affect singularity, yet would faine flie imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and prostrate mine owne wants to other mens perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Your iudiciall eye must modell forth what my penne hath layd together: much would shee say to a King, much would I say to a Countesse, but that the method of my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle must conclude the modestie of hers: which I wish may recommend my euer vowed seruice to your honour.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Henrie</hi> the second of that name, King of England, the sonne of <hi>Geffrey Plantaginet,</hi> Earle of Aniou, &amp; <hi>Maude</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, hauing by long sute and princely gifts, wonne (to his vnlawfull desire) faire <hi>Rosamond,</hi> the daughter of the Lord <hi>VValter Clyfford,</hi> and to auoyde the danger of <hi>Ellinor</hi> his iealious Queene, had caused a Labyrinth to be made within his pallace at VVoodstocke; in the center whereof, hee had lodged his beautious paramore. VVhilst the King is absent in his warres in Normandy, this poore distressed Lady, inclosed in this solitarie place, tucht with remorse of conscience, writes vnto the King of her distresse and miserable estate, vrging him by all meanes and perswasions, to cleere himselfe of this infamie, and her of the griefe of minde, by taking away her wretched lyfe.</p>

               <l>IF yet thine eyes (great <hi>Henry</hi>) may endure</l>

               <l>Heere let them surfeit, on my shame to reede;</l>
               <l>This scribled paper which I send to thee,</l>
               <l>If noted rightly, dooth resemble mee:</l>
               <l>As this pure ground, wheron these letters stand,</l>
               <l>So pure was I, ere stayned by thy hand;</l>

               <l>Now like these marks, which taint this hatefull scroule,</l>
               <l>Such the black sinnes, which spotte my leprous soule.</l>
               <l>O <hi>Henry</hi> why, by losse thus shouldst thou winne?</l>

               <l>Fame neuer stoopes to things but meane and poore,</l>
               <l>The more our greatnes, makes our fault the more.</l>
               <l>Lights on the ground, themselues doe lessen farre,</l>
               <l>But in the ayre, each small sparke seemes a starre.</l>
               <l>VVhy on a womans frailetie wouldst thou lay</l>
               <l>This subtile plot, mine honour to betray?</l>

               <l>T'was not my minde consented to this ill,</l>

               <hi>MY verie good Lord, let mee not need by tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous protestation to expostulate the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued desire I haue had to honour you: your owne noble inclination can best conceiue, what greater testimonie coulde bee demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate: and I had rather abreuiate what I woulde say, then by saying too much, to giue doubtfull construction, of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted well meaning. Let this my Epistles be one staire or little degree, whereby I may ascend into the entrance of your good opinion, as one whom I haue chose, amongst the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of mine honourable friends, whose patronage may giue protection to my newe aduentured Poesie. Thus leauing your honour to your hopefull fortunes, and my Muse to your gracious acceptance, I wish you all happines.</hi>

            <p>FAire and vertuous Mistresse, since first it was my good fortune to be a witnes of the many rare perfections where-with nature and education haue adorned you: I haue been forced since that time to attribute more admiration to your sexe, then euer <hi>Petrarch</hi> could before perswade mee to by the prayses of his <hi>Laura.</hi> Sweete is the French tongue, more sweet the Italian, but most sweet are they both if spoken by your admired selfe. If Poesie were prayselesse, your vertues alone were a subiect sufficient to make it esteemed though amongst the barbarous Getes: by how much the more your tender yeres giue scarcely warrant for your more then womanlike wisedom, by so much is your iudgement, and reading, the more to be wondred at. The Graces shall haue one more Sister by your selfe, and England by your birth shall add one Muse more to the Muses: I rest the humbly deuoted seruant to my deere and modest Mistresse: to whom I wish, the happiest fortunes I can deuise.</p>
