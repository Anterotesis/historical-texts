            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And to tell the world how much, &amp; in what way, your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> hath obliged me, is but

an Eaſy and Trivial kind of Gratitude. But as mean a Return as it is, I must make <hi>This</hi> or <hi>None.</hi> For, as your <hi>Honours Soul</hi> is too <hi>Generous</hi> to expect, and your <hi>Fortunes</hi> too <hi>ample</hi> either to need or admit, a juſt Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe; ſo are <hi>mine</hi> too <hi>ſlender</hi> to make one.</p>
            <p>The truth is, where there is an utter <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi> to <hi>repay</hi> a Kindneſs, it would be ſomething like <hi>Ingratitude</hi> ſo much as to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> it; and he, who doth but offer at a Return for <hi>Great mens</hi> favours, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by derogate from them; he makes them leſs by thinking them capable of being recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>But though it be too great a Preſumption, in ſuch a caſe, to attempt a <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> yet, that debt, which can never be <hi>diſcharged,</hi> must be upon all Occaſions, and now is upon This, Gratefully <hi>acknowledged.</hi>

               <p>But how ſmall ſoever any Star among the Six ſeveral Magnitudes, may ſeem to be; we may rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally preſume, that this Star in the Text, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its glorious light, was yet far leſs. For, had it been of any ſuch Magnitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as came any whit near to that of other Stars, it could never have led the Wiſe men ſo directly, as it did, to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place, where our bleſſed Saviour was found by them. For, had the Circumference of this Star been any way proportionable to that of other Stars; when it came to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and there ſtood ſtill, it muſt have hung,, like a Vaſt Canopy, not only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole Town, but the whole Country round it; and ſo having an equal aſpect upon all the Houſes there, it muſt needs have left the Wiſe men very uncertain, which might be the right One. But ſince we have a very fair intimation from the Evangeliſt, that, by the ſtanding ſtill of this Star, the Wiſe men were enabled ſo readily to know and diſtinguiſh the Houſe, where our Saviour was, from all its Neighbours; we may thence inter, that this Star was ſo little, as to be no real Star at all.</p>

               <p>Wherefore 'tis generally believed, that this Star did only give theſe Wiſe men ſome little Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence thereby to prepare them for a Greater; that God was pleaſed to deal with them, as being Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,

according to their Art; and by the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation af a new Star to fit them the better for ſome other way of Revelation. About which, there are theſe Three Opinions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are ſome, who think that God might be pleaſed to reveal the birth of his Son to theſe Magicians by the Teſtimony even of thoſe very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, with whom they are ſuppoſed to have had very frequent dealings.</p>
               <p>But, whether theſe Devils themſelves had yet any certain information concerning the birth of Chriſt, is a thing, which admits of ſome debate. 'Tis thought by ſeveral Interpreters, that the Devils had no certain knowlede of our Saviours Perſon till after his Baptiſm and Temptation in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and 'tis probable enough, that God might conceal his birth from them, leaſt otherwiſe they ſhould have raiſed more bloudy Tyrants, than one ſingle <hi>Herod</hi> to have deſtroyed him in his Infancy.</p>
               <p>And yet ſome ſtrong ſuſpitions of his Birth the Devils might have from ſeveral Circumſtances; for there were ſuch and ſuch things already done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it; the Prophecies, which concerned it, were Accompliſhed, the Time was come, and the Birth of their Meſſias was now grown the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the common Diſcourſe of the Jewiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <note place="margin">

               <p>And truly, this unexpected and ſuddain failing of the Devils Power, being added to the couſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſtupendous Star, might well fill theſe Magicians with wonder, and give them juſt occaſion to believe, that there was now upon earth ſome Greater Power then that of Hell, though where, and in what Perſon that Power did reſide, the Star as yet had not ſhewed them.</p>

a great deal of time to go it; and get perhaps not ſo much as he imagined.</p>
               <p>And how doth the Practiſe of theſe Magicians condemn many of Us, who declare to the world that we have nothing more of Chriſtianity, then the Name? The Text tels us of certain Strangers, men of great Note in their Country, and came many Scores of miles to find out, and wait upon our New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Saviour; but, alas! what do we do? we think it much to come One mile, perhaps one Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; nay, ſometimes we will not come from the very next Door to worſhip God.</p>
               <p>Certainly, God is much more indulgent and kind to us of the Chriſtian Church, then ever he was to the Members of the Jewiſh, both as to the Materials and Circumſtances of his Worſhip. He requires not from us either ſuch coſtly Sacrifices, or ſuch chargeable Journeys, as he did from them. For thus did <hi>Moſes</hi> command the Jewiſh nation, <hi>Three</hi>

                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 20.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:109925:17"/>
And yet notwithſtanding this expreſs command from God; <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that notorious Hipocrite, for his own ends, could tell the People thus, <hi>It is too much for you to go up to Hieruſalem.</hi> He ſeemes cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly to conſult his Subjects eaſe; but, in truth, his deſign was to ſettle himſelf the more firmly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne.</p>
               <p>And thus doth the Devil, for his own deſignes, deal with many of us; though the Place, where we are more publickly and ſolemnly to worſhip God, be at no great diſtances from us; not half ſo far as the Markets and Faires, which we readily go to; yet this cunning Devil, for the Eſtabliſhment of his own Kingdom, is apt to tell us, either more immediately by himſelf, by our own ſeduced Hearts, or elſe by ſuch and ſuch curſed Tooles and Inſtruments of his, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 12. 8.</note>
                  <hi>It is too much for you to go up to the Temple of God.</hi> And that the Enemy of our Salvation may have the fairer pretence to withdraw ſilly ſouls from our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſemblies, he takes the ſame courſe, which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, He ſets up his Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> an Anabaptiſt prating in this Conventicle, and a Quaker in that; Only here's the difference, whereas <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Calves were made of Gold, theſe of ours are made of a far more ignoble Metal; Men ſo Dull, Heavy, and Ignorant; but withall, ſo Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, Bold, and Confident; as if their Skuls were made of Lead, and their Browes of Braſs.</p>
               <p>But were all our Calves like his, Golden Ones indeed; were all the Teachers of our Private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings perſons of Inoffenſive lives, and as Choyce A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities as ſome few of our Diſſenters are or have

been; yet methinks to worſhip our God in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> when we ſhould be doing it at <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> to worſhip God in this Corner and that, when we ſhould be in the Temple, were a thing more inexcuſable in Us then in the Jewes, becauſe We have not ſo fair a Pretence for it, as They.</p>
               <p>For, we cannot well pretend, what <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, <hi>It is too much for you to go up to Hieruſalem,</hi> the Way is too Long, and the Charge too Great; Their Temple ſtood at a far greater diſtance from moſt of them, then our Churches do from us. But ſuppoſe we were at much greater diſtances from the place of Gods publick worſhip then indeed we are; yet to encourage our coming to it for the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſervice of our God, we have a fair example in the Text; where we find ſome Perſons of Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Quality, Men of Great Parts and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Wiſe men, who did not ſtick to come a very great number of Miles purpoſely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our bleſſed Saviour, and ſhew him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which was his due; for, they tell us, <hi>We are come to Worſhip him;</hi> Come, though their way was Long, and their Journey exceeding great.</p>

                  <hi>Bethlehem</hi> on the Twelfth day after that of Saviours birth; ſo teſtifieth St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> who ſpeaks of the Epiphany thus, <hi>Hac die magi Dominum noſtrum ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe perhibentur,</hi> The Wiſe men are reported to have worſhiped our Lord upon This day; and that <note place="margin">

That this muſt needs be St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s meaning, is evident from what he ſaith elſewhere. For. having newly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the birth of Chriſt, he adds theſe words, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> Ser. <hi>7.</hi> in Epiph.</note>
                  <hi>Paucis diebus inde tranſactis, hodie magi ab oriente veniſſe creduntur,</hi> The Wiſe men from the Eaſt are believed to have come this day, being but a few daies after that of our Saviours birth.</p>
               <p>And if ſo, we muſt needs grant, that when once they were ſatisfied &amp; fully informed, what the Star
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109925:20"/>
did mean, and that our Saviour was now newly Born, they made very little delay, at leaſt if the Star appeared not, 'till his birth was over. But they quickly mounted their ſwifteſt beaſts, their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyprianus</hi> de ſtella &amp; magis.</note>Camels, ſay ſome; their Dromedaries, ſay others, that ſo they might with the more ſpeed attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our New-born Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And doth not this Practiſe of theirs condemn a great deal of ours? For, when they came to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip our bleſſed Saviour, they were very Nimble at it; quick, even to admiration. For, conſidering the great diſtance of their own dwellings from the place of our Saviours birth, the difficulty and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their coming ſo ſoon, is one of the greateſt Arguments, that are urged againſt it. But it ſeems, come they did, a vaſt Journey, ſome hundreds of Miles; and yet within a very few daies too.</p>
               <p>Such was the Practiſe of theſe Men in the Text; but pray tell me what is ours? Certainly, we have as much need, as great Reaſon, as high Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and many more Invitations to worſhip Chriſt, then they. What Invitations they had, more then that one of a Star, we are not ſure. But ſuppoſe that according to the ſeveral Conjectures of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, they knew and reſted upon the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Balaam;</hi> or, ſuppoſe they had ſome glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angel to be their Informer, yet their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of knowing Chriſt were not like ours. For, whereas they had a Star to guide them, we have a Sun; whereas they had one ſingle Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that was Myſterious and dark, we have a great many cleer ones; and whereas 'tis poſſible that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109925:21"/>
they might have an Angel to inſtruct them, 'tis ſure that we have a God.</p>
               <p>And ſince our Informations concerning Chriſt are more and much clearer then theirs were, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether our Practice be ſuteable to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; whether we attend our Saviours ſervice with the ſame readineſs and eagerneſs as theſe Men did.</p>
               <p>For, no ſooner were theſe Wiſe men ſatisfied of our Saviours birth, but away they went, that they might wait upon him with all ſpeed imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. The ſame thing the Evangeliſt obſerves of the Sheepherds too; for, when the Angel had informed them that Chriſt was born, telling them the Place, wherein they might find him; and giving them a Sign, whereby they might know him, the Text ſaith, they came with haſt, they did not loyter <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lu.</hi> 2. 16.</note>and delay their Attendance, as we do.</p>
               <p>There is not a man amongſt us, but is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed where our bleſſed Saviour muſt now be waited on; not in a dirty Stable, not in a Barn, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apot.</hi> 2. 1.</note>but in his Holy Temple; not lying in a Manger, but walking in the midſt of his Golden Candleſticks. And perhaps we are ſo conformeable to the Antient Practice of all other Churches, and the preſent Commands of our own; as that we do repair to thoſe Places, that are conſecrated and ſet apart for the Publick and Solemn worſhip of our Holy God. But, are we as quick as the men in the Text? alas! we are generally too ſlow and backward; we are eaſily detained from the Temple of God, and that perhaps by Profaneſs and Irreligion; perhaps by ſome trivial buiſineſs; perhaps by ſome idle and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109925:21"/>
wicked Companions; upon one account or other, we do not come to attend our bleſſed Saviour, 'till the better part of his ſervice be over.</p>
               <p>Sure I am, this of ours, as 'tis bad in its ſelf, ſo is it a very ſad thing in its Sgnification too: for, 'tis a ſhrewd Symptom that our Hearts are naught; it betrayes the Hypocriſy of our Spirits, and gives the World juſt occaſion to ſuſpect, that although we do at length betake our ſelves to the Publick Service of God, yet we do it againſt our Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For, were we as willing to attend our bleſſed Saviour, as the Shepherds or the Magicians were; there is nothing, but invincible neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that ſhould hinder us from being with him as quick, as They; who tell us in the Text <hi>we are come,</hi> and upon what Errand they came, the next words inform us, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Firſt, One part of their worſhip, Homage, and Reſpect to Chriſt, did conſiſt in their Humble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porment and Reverential behaviour whileſt they were in his Preſence.</p>

               <p>And how ſtands the caſe with us in this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? when we come to worſhip our bleſſed Saviour, as theſe men did, what Geſtures do we uſe? are we in all our Addreſſes to God, as Humble and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as They? are we upon our Faces or Knees? are we down upon the Earth, and, were it in our power, would we yet be Lower ſtill? No; we are, many of us, grown too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bold with Heaven; ſo Rude and Slovenly are we in our addreſſes to the Son of God, that we behave our ſelves towards him, as if we were, not Servants, not Petitioners, but rather his Equals. When we are in his Preſence; when we ſpeak to him, or he to us, ſo clowniſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly are we in our deportment towards him; that he might well ſay to us, what an Emperour once did to a ſawcy Petitioner, <hi>Neſcivi me tibi eſſe tam familiarem,</hi> I did not know that you and I were ſo familiar.</p>
               <p>But O! may me learn a more Chriſtian behaviour in our worſhip of God even from theſe very Pagans in the Text! <hi>They fell down and Worſhiped,</hi> There is no one Poſture, that can poſſibly become us more then this; theſe men have ſet us ſuch a Copy, as we cannot mend, but ſhould Tranſcribe; they

have given us ſuch an Example, as we cannot better, but yet muſt Imitate and Reach.</p>

               <p>Secondly, we ſhall conſider the Motive of their reſpect to Chriſt, the Ground and reaſon why they worſhiped and preſented him ſo and ſo.</p>
               <p>Paſt all peradventure they did not do, what they did, from any deſigns of their Own, ſuch at leaſt as related to the advantages of this World. 'Tis St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s demand, <gap reason="foreign">

or Honours from a new born Babe, and ſuch a Babe, whom they found yet lying in a Manger? No; the great Motive, why they came and worſhiped him, was the Conſideration of his Perſon.

               <p>And if we may ſuppoſe that the Wiſe men in the Text had indeed theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apprehenſions concerning Chriſt; if we may take it for granted, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great Poverty of his preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they did yet believe him to be a King and a God; we have very little reaſon to wonder that they ſhould come ſo many Miles to attend, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and preſent him ſo and ſo.</p>
               <p>'Tis fan greater wonder, that we, who are the Members of the Chriſtian Church, ſhould fall ſo extreamly ſhort even of theſe very Strangers in ſhewing thoſe reſpects, which We, much more then They, do ow to Chriſt. For, although that of St. <note place="margin">

his Son, had alſo himſelf taught them; that he was his Son indeed; yet 'tis not eaſy to imagine, that theſe Wiſe men ſhould know as much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Saviour, being then but in his Cradle, as we do now. 'Tis like enough that they might hear him Crying like a Child in his Mothers Armes; perhaps they might ſee him, like other Babes, Sucking his Mothers Breaſts; 'tis certain that they could then ſee nothing about him with an Eye of Fleſh, but ſuch mean Circumſtances, as might have rendred him an Object rather of Compaſſion and Pity then of Worſhip and Adoration. We cannot ſay, that They did then foreſee, what we do now know of Chriſt; the ſtupendious Miracles of his Life, the mighty wonders of his Death, his Raiſing himſelf and others from their Graves; and whether they had yet any diſtinct and explicite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and his Seſſion at Gods Right Hand, we cannot tell.</p>
               <p>But yet notwithſtanding, though they ſaw ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidences of his preſenc Poverty, but poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as yet knew very little of his Future Glory, having ſeen no other viſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Character thereof, for ought we know, ſave only that of the Star; yet, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Procidunt,</hi> They fall down <note place="margin">

               <p>And if ſo, how much more are we obliged to do ſo, who have his Goſpel, and are acquainted with all the Stories which concern him? We do not now ſee him in a Stable, but do verily believe him to be

upon a Throne; we do not now find him in the Arms of <hi>Mary,</hi> his Poor Mother, but do believe him to ſit at the Right Hand of God, his Father; what Signal Teſtimonials he had of his Divinity both from Heaven and Hell; from the voyce of his Father, from the deſcent of his Spirit, and from the Confeſſions of the very Devils themſelves, 'tis like enough, that theſe Wiſe men in the Text did never know, as we do. 'Tis very probable, that they might be all in their Graves, before our bleſſed Saviour did manifeſt any thing of his Glory; and by his holy Life, excellent Doctrine, and mighty Works, declare himſelf to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>And if They, long before any thing of this was done, did thus adore him, even when he was but a Babe, and that, in all outward Appearance, but a very Poor one too, what then ſhould we do? We, who know what incomparable Sermons he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what ſtupendious Miracles he wrought; We, who find him ſo often waited on by glorious Angels; We, who may well be ſuppoſed to have many more Demonſtrations of his Deity then theſe great Men in the Text, what muſt we do?</p>
               <p>'Tell me, ſhall we, who have a long time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the name of Chriſt, deal more rudely with him, then theſe Magicians did, who were mere Strangers to him and Proſelytes but of a Day? They came a long Journey to Worſhip him, and ſhall we think much to ſtep over the Threſhold? They fell down before him in a Stable, and ſhall not we do as much in a Church? They preſented him
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109925:26"/>
with Gold, Frankincenſe, and Myrrhe; and have we juſt nothing for him? He was pleaſed to give himſelf both to and for the Sonns of Men, and ſhall we make him no Returns at all? Yes; let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him with our ſelves, and when we do ſo, we ſhall but give him, what's his own.</p>
               <p>Let us ſhew our ſelves to be like the Perſons in the Text, Wiſe men indeed, by offering to our bleſſed Saviour the ſelf ſame Preſents, which They did. Let us give him ſomething of our Gold by works of Charity to his diſtreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Members; Let us give him ſomething of our Spiritual Myrrh by the Purity of our Lives, and Acts of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let us alſo preſent him with our Spiritual Frankincenſe by our Prayers and Praiſes in this World, that ſo we may do it in the next by our Thanksgivings, Doxologies, and Hallelujah's, for ever and ever.</p>
