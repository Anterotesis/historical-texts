         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Obſervations of both Houſes of Parliament, upon
the aforeſaid Letter.</head>
            <p>VVHereas many and fervent prayers have beene
ſent up to God for his bleſſings to be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
downe upon the Endeavours of the Parliament in
maintenance of his owne Cauſe, and Religion, now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
aſſaulted by Papiſts, and becauſe it is moſt juſt
and neceſſary to obſerve the returne of theſe Prayers,
that our mouths and hearts may be as much enlarged in
prayſes, as they have beene in Prayers. The Lords and
<pb facs="tcp:54510:6"/>
Commons have thought fit to pnbliſh ſome late good
ſucceſſes, as ſo many Anſwers from Heaven which God
hath given to the Prayers of his ſervants.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſundry late Declarations have ſhewed
to the world divers Informations and proofs concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the rayſing of a Popiſh Army with an intention
to ſubvert Gods true Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> profeſſed and by Law
eſtabliſhed in this Kingdome and to introduce popiſh
Idollatry, and Superſtition, that it may appeare that,
what was before an intention is now matter of fact, and
really put in Execution, a moſt certaine and true Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is here offered to publique notice and obſervation
wherein it may be ſeene that this Popiſh Army hath ſet
up the open practiſe of their abhominable Idolatry in
<hi>Yorke</hi> the ſecond City of this Kingdome, and are grown
to that height of Inſolence that they terrifie and drive
away Proteſtant Miniſters and people from frequenting,
their owne Churches and from the practiſe of their own
Religion, wherein they have given a patterne and pledge
what they intend to doe, and what muſt be expected from
them through the whole Kingdome, the conſideration
hereof (whereby the moſt precious things in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Gods Glory and true worſhip, and the ſalvation, and
ſoules of men are brought into danger) ought to excite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſtir up (and we are confident it will) the ſtrongeſt
endeavours and moſt vnited coniunctions of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and well affected Proteſtants and Patriots <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 words">

and ſuppreſſe theſe common Enemies of God, Piety
their Country and common-Wealth, for now, it plainly
appeares that how ever they pretend to defend the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and the Lawes, yet their maine intention is to
Eſtabliſh Popery in this Kingdome, and to extirpate the
Proteſtant Religion which cannot be done without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
of the Lawes, as the Papiſts have all moſt effected
in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
