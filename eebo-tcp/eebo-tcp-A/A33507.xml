            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> To which I reply, that the true Church, of which Chriſt alone is Head, and Supreme Governour, is in it ſelf one, holy, Apoſtolick Church, &amp;c. I ſhall not go about to deny: but as touching that grand Queſtion by <hi>A.S.</hi> ſtated before his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here inſerted (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>which is this Church,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, this is a thing indeed diſputable amongſt many, yea, amongſt many thouſands, yet not at all queſtionable, nor yet doubtful unto me; for I am well ſatisfied therein, and in all other things that appertain to the way of Life and Salvation, but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church, (as <hi>A.S.</hi> affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, Although the true Church, of which Chriſt is inviſible Head, is one, yet the oneneſs of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument to prove her to be the true Church; for wherein doth her oneneſs conſiſt, farther than in Idolatry, Superſtition, Murther, and ſuch like abominations, of which much might be mentioned (which was never practiſed by the true Church in the Apoſtles dayes) but in theſe things the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is one: witneſſe her worſhipping Idols, or images, bowing to that ſhee calls her Altars, and the reſt of her Superſtitious Ceremonies; witneſſe the killing, burning, or drinking the bloud of ſo many thouſands, as ſhe hath done for many hundred yeares p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt, as the whole Chriſtendome full well knows; therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And conſider, was not the company of Prieſts one in <hi>Hoſea</hi>'s dayes, who murthered in the way by conſent? whom the Prophet compared to troops of Robbers, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.9. And is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> one as they were? for hath not ſhe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered many (by conſent of moſt of her members) in the way that ſhe is in? conſider theſe things.</p>
            <p>But then <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith, that ſhe is one in matters of Faith, and governed by one inviſible Head, Chriſt; and by one viſible Head, the Pope, the true ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore ſhe is the true Church.</p>
            <p>

I anſwer, that ſhe is perfectly united in matters of Faith, I utterly deny: witneſſe the Hiſtory of the Counſel of <hi>Trent,</hi> which copiouſly relates the Diviſions and Contradictions amongſt them there about matters of Faith. But admit tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it were ſo, that ſhe were one in matters of Faith, that doth not prove her to be the true Church, unleſſe ſhe could prove her Faith to be the true Faith, <hi>by which righteouſneſſe is wrought, Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>And which is made perfect by works of righteouſneſſe, James</hi> 2.22. But the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Faith, (as her works of unrighteouſneſſe before mentioned clearly make manifeſt) therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is governed by one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Head, Chriſt, that I alſo deny, and her fruit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, and which I ſhall hereafter mention, ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the contrary; and as Chriſt ſaid to the Jews, <hi>If you were of</hi> Abraham, <hi>you would do the works of</hi> Abraham, <hi>but now you go about to kill me; thus did not</hi> Abraham. So ſay I of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> If ſhe were governed by the one inviſible Head, Chriſt, as the true Church was, then ſhe would have the mind of Chriſt, (who came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them) as the true Church had, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. but ſhe hath not the mind of Chriſt: Witneſſe her deſtroying the lives of many, not onely of thoſe that believe not, but of thoſe that beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ve: Therefore ſhe is not governed by the inviſible Head, Chriſt, and conſequently is not the true Church, but the Whore that drinks the blood of the Saints.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is governed by her viſible Head, the Pope, I ſhall not go about to contradict; for although that proves her to be one, in ſubjection to the Pope, yet it doth not prove her to be the true Church; becauſe Chriſt never ordained a viſible Head to his Church; but that the Pope is the true ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter</hi> (as <hi>A.S.</hi> affirms) that I do deny; and it remains for him to prove it, or for ſome of his ſervants to do it for him; for after <hi>Peter</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, he never gave conſent to the murthering of any, as the Pope hath done many; Therefore he is not the true Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>Peter.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. For the ſpotleſſe body of Chriſt (the true Church) was baptized with the holy Ghoſt and with fire, the ſpirit of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of burning, and thereby her filth and her ſpots were purged away from her, and ſhe was waſhed from Idolatry and covetouſneſſe, &amp;c. as the Apoſtles teſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe was fitted for Gods Kingdom, and was made to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, and had the mind of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. who came not to deſtroy mens lives, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.56. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not waſhed from Idolatry, nor free from Murther, as her worſhipping of Idols or Images doth teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; and as her killing and deſtroying about Religion, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip beareth witneſſe (which the ſpirit of Chriſt never allowed of, nor the ſpotleſſe body of Chriſt never practiſed.) Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not holy, nor the ſpotleſſe body of Chriſt. And as to that affirmation of <hi>A.S.</hi> in the third Number of his firſt Chapter (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Every man as he is Regenerated in Chriſt, and a member of his body, is holy, and a ſaint, though as he is the ſon of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>he is a lyar and a ſinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, That the moſt part of all the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the world will joyn with him in that particular; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he need not ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe it is the Doctrine of Devils, and the ſpirit of God teſtifies againſt it. For it is impoſſible for any man to be both a ſaint and a ſinner at one ſeaſon: for if that could be, then might a man ſerve two Maſters, which Chriſt ſaid could not be, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.13. And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>He that commits ſin, is the ſervant of ſin,</hi> Joh. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>34. and is free from righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. So hath no part in Chriſt, who is the righteouſneſſe of God. And whoſoever lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth or maketh a lye, ſhall not enter the holy City, which is the true Church, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.27. Therefore is no member of it. Now let <hi>A.S.</hi> conſider his ignorance, for according to his own confeſſion, the true) Church is built of living believers (elect and precious) but he that is a lyar and a ſinner, is dead (<hi>for the ſoul
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105762:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ſins ſhall dye,</hi> Ezek. 18.4.) Therefore, he that is a lyer and a ſinner, is not a living believer, nor yet holy and a ſaint. Yet I do not deny, but that he that is regenerated in Chriſt, and is baptized into him, and is thereby made a member of his ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe body, is holy and a ſaint; for by and through the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he is redeemed out of the firſt fallen <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate.</p>
            <p>Well,</p>
            <p>But <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That all the members of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>are baptized and ſanctified in Chriſt, and that all her Inſtitutes and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonies, &amp;c. are holy, and therefore ſhe is holy.</hi>

But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not the mind of Chriſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth ſhe live holy (as afore proved;) Therefore ſhe is not holy. And as concerning her Inſtitutions and Ceremonies, as Bowing to Images, and Altars, and ſuch things, we never read that the holy Church in the Primitive times, did practice ſuch things; therefore we have no ground to believe they are holy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the true Church is Catholick or Univerſal, I ſhall not go about to deny: but I do deny that the Univerſality of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a ſufficient Argument to prove her to be the true Church; for conſider,</p>

            <p>Fourthly, Again, That the true Church is Apoſtolick, and built upon the foundation of the holy Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. and was propagated through the world, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that I acknowledge, but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick, or had her beginning in Chriſt and his Apoſtles, (as <hi>A.S.</hi> affirmeth) or that ſhe was propagated through the world by the Apoſtles, in that diſcipline (Ceremonies, worſhipping of Idols, or Images, Murthering the people of God, &amp;c.) in which ſhe now ſtands, that I doe deny, and its abomination in <hi>A.S.</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it. For conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, When, or where did Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, begin the practice of bowing to Images, or worſhipping Idols? or when did any of them bow to an Altar of wood, or pray with a ſtring of beads, or pray to Saints, or carry a ſilver, or wooden Croſſe about with them, or murther any becauſe they were not of their Faith? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot prove that ever Chriſt or his Apoſtles began, or practiſed any of theſe things; nor that they were in being in their dayes, we defie them; but they are inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſet up in the falſe Church, in the dark night of Apoſtacy, that hath been over the Nations ſince the Apoſtles dayes, and are practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to this day; Therefore ſhe is not Apoſtolick, but Apoſtate like.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That the true Church, or the Members of it, is viſible, I ſhall not deny; and that ſhe is the Light of the world, I do confeſſe, but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church, or the Light of the world, becauſe ſhe is viſible, that I do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but deny; for although the true Church, or the Members of it, is viſible, yet ſo is the Whore alſo.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> dayes; therefore though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be viſible, yet her fruits teſtifieth, that ſhe is not the true Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Again <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith, (and diabolically affirmeth in the ſecond Page of his pretended Reconciler of Religions) <hi>that the true Church is compoſed of both good and bad, wheat, and tares</hi>; which I do abominate to acknowledge and is blaſphemy in him to affirm: for, the true Church is built of <hi>Living ſtones,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. <hi>elect and precious</hi>; or (as <hi>A.S.</hi> affirmeth) of living believers: but no living believers can be truly called the bad, nor the tares, but elect and precious, and all that are living, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, are the good; therefore the true Church is built of the good only.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But if the Church of Chriſt (which <hi>A.S.</hi> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond page, affirmeth is the kingdome of Chriſt) be compoſed of both good and bad, then according to his own affirmation, the kingdome of Chriſt is part good, and part bad, which is horrid blaſphemy in <hi>A.S.</hi> to affirm.</p>
            <p>Oh groſſe darkneſſe and confuſion! Are thou a Member of that Church that calls it ſelf the light of the world? Oh, dark, dull, gloomy light! the Lord God Almighty bring all his people out of that dark Cell, that they may wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in his marvellous light, which (lighteth every man that cometh into the world) which makes all things manifeſt of what ſort it is.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, But if you ſay that Chriſt likened the kingdome to a net that was caſt into the Sea, which gathered of all kinds;— I anſwer he did ſo; yet when it came to land, there was none compoſed, or gathered into the veſſels, but the good only, and the bad were caſt away, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.48. Therefore the true Church is not compoſed of both good and bad, but of the good only.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, But if you object, that the tares and wheat were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105762:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both to grow together in the field; I anſwer, they were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the harveſt; (<hi>and the field is the world,</hi> Mat. 13.39<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the true Church is not of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sixthly, Farther, If you ſay that there was ſome in the true Church, in the Apoſtles dayes, that were falſe brethren, and theſe were bad; I anſwer, Though they were amongſt them, yet they were not of them: as the Apoſtle ſaid, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true Church is not compoſed of both good and bad, but of the good only.</p>
            <p>But to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to the fifth part of <hi>A.S.</hi> his argument, where he ſaith, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is known to the world, in her Biſhops, Paſtors, and Believers, &amp;c. and therefore ſhe is viſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although that proves her viſible, yet it doth not prove her to be the true Church, but the contrary; for the true Church that was the light of the world, was not known to the world, <hi>John</hi> 17.14. but the viſible Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is known to the world, (as <hi>A.S.</hi> himſelf affirmeth) therefore ſhe is not the true Church, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>Again, the true Church wreſtled not with fleſh and bloud, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was her weapons carnal, but ſpiritual, and ſhe wreſtled with ſpiritual wickedneſſes that were in the high places, and broke down the ſtrong holds of iniquity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wreſtles with fleſh and blood, and kills mens bodies about Religion, as the whole Chriſtendome knoweth, and the ſpiritual wickedneſſes are ſtill ſtanding in her, as afore proved, and as all the world ſufficiently knows; therefore ſhe is not the true Church.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The infallibleneſs of the true Church, of which Chriſt is ſupreme head and governour, I do not go about to deny, but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is infallible, that I do deny. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Although <hi>A.S.</hi> hath affirmed, that ſhe hath alwayes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105762:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
remained ſince Chriſts time unto this day, without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. yet he never proved it; neither can he do it; for, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ſaid, we never read that the true Church in Chriſts dayes was found in ſuch things, neither was ſuch things then found in her, as is now found in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is now found in: by which it is clear, that ſhe hath not alwayes remained ſince Chriſts time, in the ſtate ſhe now ſtands.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But if ſhe hath alwayes remained, ſince Chriſte time to this day, without interruption (a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith ſhe hath) then ſhe cannot poſſibly be the true Church; for the true Church was interrupted ſince the Reſurrection, and Aſcention of Chriſt, (and yet remained, as hereafter I ſhall ſhew;) and in the Apoſtles dayes her interruption began, and ſome of the Apoſtles fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw it, and ſaid, <hi>of your ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things,</hi> Acts 20.30. and when they were ariſen, <hi>they withſtood the truth, as</hi> Jannes <hi>and</hi> Jambres <hi>withſtood</hi> Moſes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. ſo here the interruption of the true Church began: and after this <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Dragon (interrupting, or) perſecuting her into the Wilderneſſe, <hi>where ſhe had a place prepared of God, that they might feed her there, a thouſand, two hundred, and threeſcore dayes,</hi> Rev. 12.6. &amp; 13.14. ver. concerning which, I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more hereafter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo on this wiſe the true Church was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſince Chriſts days: But <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath alwayes remained ſince Chriſts time without interruption; Therefore ſhe is not the true Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And whereas <hi>A.S.</hi> farther ſaith, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall alwayes remain, to the end of the world, and therefore ſhe is infallible,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, He hath not at all confirmed that by any proof, neither hath he any farther proof than his own affirmation; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he would produce that ſaying of the Mother of Harlots, (viz.) <hi>I ſit as a queen, and am no widow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow,</hi> Rev. 18.7. And indeed what would be a very pittiful Argument to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> infallible; but none other can he produce (except he could firſt prove her to be the true Church, which he is never able to do, his beſt argument by which he hath undertaken it, being already confuted) Therefore we have no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105762:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more cauſe to believe his affirmation, than we have to believe the ſayings of the forementioned mother of Harlots, for they are both alike to us; and though ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould ſee no ſorrow, yet <hi>John</hi> (who was in the ſpirit of the Lord) ſaid, <hi>that in one day her deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould come,</hi> Rev. 18.8. And although <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall alwayes remain to the end of the world, yet I ſay, in the name of the Lord, and by the ſame ſpirit that <hi>John</hi> was in, That the one day, of which <hi>John</hi> ſpake, is already dawned, in which the deſolation of that Great Whore, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall come; and as ſurely, as when <hi>Sodom</hi> was overthrown, the Cities round about it were overthrown alſo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 7. ſo certainly, when this great City <hi>Babylon</hi> is overthrown, and made deſolate, the ſuburbs thereof ſhall be overthrown, and made deſolate alſo. The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, and therefore ſhe muſt fail in her propheſies, and ceaſe in her being, which, as <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith, the true Church cannot.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, And farther, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is variable in her Judgments, as the diverſities of Councels that ſhe hath held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matters of Faith, beareth witneſſe; for the following General Counſel hath oft times excluded that, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on by the former: and ſurely both cannot be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>llible, they being quite contradictory one to the other. Read the 15th chapter of <hi>F. H.</hi> his book, entitled, THE GLORY OF THE TRUE CHURCH DISCOVERED, &amp;c. wherein the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the General Counſels which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath held, are ſufficiently made manifeſt; ſo that I need not trouble my ſelf to inſert them here: and thereby its evident enough, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not infallible.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Again, if <hi>A.S.</hi> or any other, could prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had alwayes remained ſince Chriſts time; yet, as aforeſaid, that is not a ſufficient argument to prove her infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, or that ſhe cannot fail, nor ceaſe. For conſider, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, that old S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rpent, called the Devil, who was a murtherer from the beginning, (who gave power to the beaſt that carries the Whore, that drinks the Saints blood, that ſaid ſhe ſhould ſee no ſorrow) wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> before the dayes of Chriſts appearance in the fleſh, yet the Dragon is not infallible; But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the Murtherer, or carried by the Dragons power in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105762:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beaſt, as the Murthers acted by her beareth witneſs; therefore ſhe is no more infallible than the Dragon is.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, And as to the 7th part of <hi>A.S.</hi> his Argument, wherein he ſaith, <hi>the true Church is inerrable,</hi> and then ſaith, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is this inerrable true Church: for all the Sectaries, Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks in the world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>could never yet ſhew wherein ſhe erred, nor ever ſhall: Therefore ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, although the Hereticks could not prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erred, yet there are many, who are members of the true Church, of which Chriſt is Head, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour alone, that can prove wherein ſhe hath erred, and doth ſtill groſly erre, from the Doctrine, Practice, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the true Church, as it ſtood in the Apoſtles dayes: for the Apoſtle in his dayes ſaid, <hi>let every man be fully perſwaded in his own conſcience,</hi> Rom. 14.5. and did not go about to force people to conform to ſuch things, that they were not perſwaded of in their conſciences, nor to compell them by outward laws to conform thereunto; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not admit, that every one ſhould walk, or act according as they are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their own conſciences, but goes about by outward laws to compell them to conform to that which ſhe calls her holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Inſtitutions, which many, for conſcience ſake to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, dare not conform to, becauſe they know them to be invented Idolatries; and they, who cannot for conſcience ſake ſubmit to her impoſitions, or drink of her cup of abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to be ſure ſhe will drink their blood: Witneſſe the blood ſhe hath drunk (for above this thouſand years paſt) of them that could not, for conſcience ſake towards God, conform to her Ordinances: And therefore ſhe hath erred from that ſpirit which was in the true Church, and from the Apoſtles Doctrine, and is ſtill in the errour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the true Church in the Apoſtles dayes, every one as he had received the gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105762:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to all Chriſtendom, therefore ſhe hath erred from the Apoſtles Spirit and order, and is ſtill in the error: And thus I might produce many more arguments, to ſhew wherein the church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and doth erre, only my deſire is to be as brief as may be, ſo that ſatisfaction may be given; for which I doubt not but this is ſufficient as to that particular.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And as concerning miracles in the true Church, I do confeſſe and be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r witneſſe, that there are miracles wrought in her daily; but that all miracles are an argument ſufficient to prove a people to be the true Church; that I do not acknowledge, but deny: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Magicians of <hi>Aegypt</hi> could by their Sorceries, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments imitate thoſe things in the ſight of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did by the power of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7. and he falſe prophet he wrought lying miracles before the beaſt that carries the Whore, inſomuch that he cauſed fire to come down out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the ſight of men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13, 14. and <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. And this the Whore might have ſaid was done in confirmation of her faith and doctrines; (as <hi>A.S.</hi> doth) yet nevertheleſſe it was done by the Dragons power, who was a murtherer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the beginning, For he gave power to the beaſt (that carries the Whore) to do ſuch things, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. and therefore the miracles in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (if now there be any) is no infallible evidence to prove her to be the true Church.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, we have an infallible way to judge in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; For, all miracl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the miracles wrought by Chriſt, the power of God, are not wrought by a murdering power) But the miracles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, but for all <hi>A.S.</hi> in his Epiſtle Dedicatory, hath made ſuch a great noiſe about miracles wrought by a Roman Catholick Prieſt in and about <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> yet when he comes to prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is powerful in miracles, then he doth juſt as much as nothing, but takes an eaſie way to get out from that thing, which ſeemingly he undertook to go thorow with, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of us for a witneſſe of his affirmation to <hi>noſtre, dame de Loretto, noſtre dame de montague, noſtre dame de hall,</hi> and to the whole world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now what a pittiful proof or witneſſe is this, which <hi>A.S.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us to; For as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the whole world lies in wickedneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.19. and wonders after the beaſt, by whom lying miracles are wrought, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13 3.

            <p>Fourthly, and for <hi>noſtre dame de loretto</hi> and the reſt mentioned, they ſignifie nothing as to our ſatisfaction in this particular, becauſe they are altogether unknown to us; neither can we attain to a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them if we would; for the information of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to us no ſatisfaction, ſo as I ſaid before (that <hi>A.S.</hi>) for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of proving his affirmation, hath done juſt as much as nothing; only made a ſhew, like a cloud without rain: But methinks, if there were ſo many miracles wrought daily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a Roman Prieſt about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>A.S.</hi> ſeems to make a noiſe of; he ſhould have inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſome of them particularly for our ſatisfaction: but ſeeing he hath not inſtanced any, we have juſt cauſe to believe, that there are none at all.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that thing I do not at all deny, for all that are ſaved are of the true Church, but that none can be ſaved out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that I do deny, for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church, but the Whore that drinks the blood of the Saints, as afore-proved, therefore out of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> people may be ſaved. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all who expecteth or deſireth ſalvation make haſt out of this great City <hi>Babylon</hi>: And run for your lives towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the holy City, the true Church, the Lambs wife, in whoſe light the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them that are ſaved muſt walk, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.24. leſt you periſh within the borders of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe deſolation ſhall certainly come in one day: Yea, Death, and Mourning, and Famine, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſay, that ſhe doth not drink the blood of the Saints,<note rend="inter">The myſtery of the Whore farther diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> but the blood of hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore ſhe is the true Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, ſo, or to that effect, ſaid the deſtroyers and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in all ages, even they that put Chriſt to death; they did it not in their own account, as he was the Son of God; but as a blaſphemer, and the Apoſtles were perſecuted as ſpreaders of hereſie, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſedition, and not as Saints and ſervants of the Lord, in their adverſaries account, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.5. and thus the murthering perſecuting ſpirit hath in all ages; as at this day ſought to ſhelter it ſelf; but this covering muſt now be ript off, for the power of God is ariſen that rends the vail of darkneſſe, and the day is dawned that makes all things manifeſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And farther; If they were hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe blood the Church of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. So its clear, that Chriſt the power of God, and the true Church that had the mind of Chriſt, did never kill, nor perſecute any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

they were hereticks, or did not believe, nor yet becauſe (after they believed) they made ſhipwrack of faith; But laboured in the ſpirit of love and meekneſſe, to reſtore them, and to convince them by ſound doctrine; but if they refuſed to receive admonition, or to ſubmit to the Church after due admontion given, then they, let them receive the puniſhment aforeſaid, and refuſed to have fellowſhip with them, and this was the greateſt puniſhment that ever the true Church inflicted upon any, though they were rebellious, and this was the way to make true believers of people, which force and compul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus much in brief to the nine particulars of <hi>A.S.</hi> his firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, by which (I perceive) he thought he had infallibly proved the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church, but what his Argument is worth for his purpoſe, let all who reads this, Judge.</p>
            <p>And the next thing he undertakes, is, to prove <hi>Peter</hi> to be the rock or foundation upon which Chriſt builds his Church; and to accompliſh this deſign, he rambles through ſeveral languages, into which the Scripture hath been tranſlated; and in the concluſion he ſaith (a great lie) <hi>to</hi> Peter <hi>then Chriſt ſaid, upon thee I will build my Church,</hi> &amp;c. when neither of the ſeveral Languages (which he makes uſe of to prove it) ſaith any ſuch thing, according to his own interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them; and indeed its blaſphemy in <hi>A.S.</hi> to affirm it: But then he ſaith <hi>that Chriſt is the primary rock, and</hi> Peter <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary rock.</hi>

But his fourth and fifth Chapters contains ſeveral Arguments, by which he undertakes farther to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church; together with ſome Queries propounded. To which I intend to return a brief and ſober An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt.</hi> A. S. ſaith, <hi>That which was once the true Church is now, &amp;c. But the</hi> Roman <hi>Pontificial was once the true Church, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, I do not deny but that there was a true Church at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes, but that the Church now at <hi>Rome</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true Church, that doth not follow; for as I have before proved, the true Church in the Apoſtles dayes was far different, both in Diſcipline and Practice, from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is.</p>
            <p>But then A.S. ſaith, <hi>If the</hi> Roman <hi>Pontificial did fall, what Church did ſhe fall from? If ſhe did faile, when, &amp;c</hi>? I anſwer, <hi>Paul,</hi> in the firſt Chapter in his Epiſtle to the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſpake of ſome, who <hi>when they knew God, did not glorifie him as God, but became vain in their imaginations, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible man; and ſo not likeing to retain God in their knowledg, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, and they were filled with unrighteouſneſs, fornication, and wickedneſs, covetouſneſs, envy, murther, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 1.21.23.28, 29. And is not this the very ſtate of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day? is ſhe not now filled with theſe things? Surely yes. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of thouſands muſt acknowledg it, if they conſider it and ſpeak the truth. Oh the murthers acted by her, and the blood ſhe hath drunk, as before hinted, and the adulteries committed within her borders. Indeed theſe, and many other her abominations, are innumerable, as ſhe her ſelf full well knows; therefore ſhe is indeed falne, and deeply revolted from that pure ſpirit in which the true Church ſtood in the Apoſtles dayes: Thence ſhe is falne, and the time when ſhe fell, was, when ſhe began to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe aforeſaid abominations that is now found in her. Well:</p>
            <p n="2">2. But then <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That if the true Church be infallible, ſhe

muſt have alwayes remained without interruption, ſince Chriſts time, to this day, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, although the true Church be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet it doth not abſolutely follow, that ſhe muſt have always remained without interruption unto this day; for, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, the true Church was interrupted by the Dragon, and was perſecuted into the Wilderneſſe, but ſhe did not fail, but remained there, and had a being there, a place prepared of God for her; concerning which, I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more fully ſhortly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That no other Church on earth hath remained unto this day without interruption, beſides the Roman Pontificial, and therefore ſhe is the true Church.</hi> I anſwer no, ſhe is not therefore the true Church, but the Whore; for as I have already proved, the true Church was interrupted, and yet remained.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, ſhe hath not been in a capacity in her wilderneſſe ſtate to hold general counſels, as in the time of her flouriſhing ſtate, yet the mighty God hath alwaies been her wonderful counſellor, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. and the members of her hath ſtood in (and held to) his counſel, according to the manifeſtation thereof received by them; Not loving their lives unto death, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> well knows, (who have drank the blood of many of them) or ſhall know to her ſorrow and pangs. And as for the true Churches condemning he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> knows, that thoſe members of her, whoſe blood ſhe hath drunk, did alwaies condemn thoſe hereſies that are healed, and the idolatries acted in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies give teſtimony againſt her ſuperſtitious inventions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to have fellowſhip with her therein, and looked upon her as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated from the true faith (as <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts</hi> copiouſly relates) and this was a great condemnation, as the Spirit of Chriſt gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the true Church to paſſe upon hereticks.</p>
            <p>And again, as to that queſtion, <hi>viz. What Academies did ſhe erect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, A peoples Erecting of Accademies, is not an argument ſufficient to prove them to be the true Church; for what A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies, or Univerſities did the Apoſtles Erect or confirm, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the knowledg of God in? Was it not the light that ſhined in their hearts, that gave them this knowledg? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. And was not this light the Law, that was the Apoſtles Schoolmaſter till Chriſt? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. And is not the Law which is light, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.23. written in the hearts of all people? And is it not a ſufficient Schoolmaſter now, to bring people (who are taught by it) unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the glory of God, in the face of Chriſt, as it did the Apoſtles then? What need then is there of erecting Academies, for people cannot attain to the knowledg of God by Natural learning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. Nor thereby be made true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. Yet I am not againſt having an outward School houſe, or ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place for the educating or bringing up of children in Natural Learning, which is good in its place; but that any can thereby be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105762:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brought to the knowledge of God, or made true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt; that I cannot own. Neither was this way of making Miniſters by natural learning, or ſetting of them up by man, in being, untill people had forſaken the right way, and went into <hi>Cains</hi> way, and <hi>Balaams,</hi> and then the envy and murther began amongſt the profeſt Chriſtians, and then they could not endure ſound Doctrine, but heapt up to themſelves teachers according to their own hearts luſts, who knew nothing but what they knew naturally, as bruit beaſts, &amp;c. and this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> foreſaw; and wrote of to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. and <hi>Peter</hi> propheſied of them alſo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> ſaw them come; 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. <hi>Jude</hi> 10.11. ſo that by natural learning, and ordination of man, no true Miniſter of Chriſt was ever made, or ſent forth; but contrariwiſe, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was made a Miniſter, <hi>viz.</hi> not of man, nor by man, nor yet by natural learning, <hi>but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 1.1. ſo we do not underſtand that in the Apoſtles dayes they did erect Academies, or that they had any need of them, and indeed I cannot but look upon it as an ignorant queſtion to be propoſed by <hi>A.</hi> S. upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But to his next Query, <hi>viz. What Churches and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries did ſhe build</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, this is as ignorant a queſtion as the former, and great fooliſhneſſe to ask, what Churches the Church built? however this I ſay, they who were Members of the true Church, did <hi>build up one another in their moſt holy faith,</hi> Jude 20. And as for Monaſteries, or Monk houſes, we hear of no ſuch thing that was in being in the Apoſtles dayes, neither do we believe that there is any need of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we do not read in the holy Scriptures, that ever the true Church, in any generation, built ſuch places, but we know, that many ſuch places have been erected and built within the borders of the great City <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſince the Apoſtacy began, and ſince the right way was forſaken, and many other Superſtitious inventions and Idolatries, as before hinted, hath been ſet up, relating to the beaſts and Dragons worſhip, <hi>all which God hath determined to throw down; and when the deſolation of all theſe things cometh, and the ſeven Mountains upon which the Whore ſits, comes to be laid waſte, according as hath been propheſied in ages paſt,</hi> Iſa. 42.15. <hi>And when the great Whore comes to drink the cup of

            <p>But then he ſpeaks of another clear and eaſie way to find out the true Church, to try all Churches by the true Catechiſme, and ſee which of them all ſayes it truly, believes it rightly, &amp;c, and that which doth, is the true.</p>

And they who are detected to be in the ſteps, practiſes, and Doctrines of them whom the holy Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles teſtified againſt, ſhall be concluded to be the falſe Church, now at this day: and upon theſe termes, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we ſhall be very ready and willing to joyn iſſue with you, at any time or place, that you wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And whereas <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith, that all the Schiſmaticks, Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Hereticks in the world, cannot truly ſay that prayer that Chriſt taught his Diſciples, <hi>viz. Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. for, ſaid he, they are continually doing the works of the Devil, and are his children, and conſequently cannot truly call God Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:105762:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>I anſwer, therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſhe is, and long hath been, doing the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the murtherer, as before proved, therefore ſhe is of her father the Devil, and cannot call God father in truth and in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Then <hi>A.</hi> S. rambles through ſeveral other particulars, in which he controverts with Sectaries, &amp;c. whoſe cauſe I am not concerned to plead, only this ſmall hint before I have given to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> one of thoſe Sects, who cannot ſpeak the fore-mentioned words truly, and ſo I ſhall leave the Sectaries, with whom <hi>A.</hi> S. controverts, to plead their own cauſe; for the thing that was chiefly in my heart, when I took in hand to write this brief reply, was to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not to be the true Church, and the chief Arguments by him produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to prove her the true Church, I have already in brief an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>A.</hi> S. in his 6th Chapter, makes it his buſineſs to prove the Church to be the Judge of all controverſies in matters of faith, and ſaith, <hi>that not every man, nor human reaſon, nor the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpirit, nor the Bible is this Judge</hi>; and to prove it, he quotes <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. where Chriſt ſaid, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I anſwer, That the Judgement of the true Church, of which Chriſt is Head, in matters of faith, I do not deny for being governed in all things by the Head Chriſt, (<hi>to whom all Judgment is committed,</hi> John 5.20.) the Judgement thereof muſt of neceſſity be true, (for the ſtrength of Iſrael can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye) and ought to be ſubmitted unto by all; But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being not the true Church, (ſhe being not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the inviſible Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt, to whom all Judgment is committed, as before proved) Therefore ſhe is not Judge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in matters of Faith. And the true Church, to whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>he that heareth you, heareth me,</hi> were ſuch as heard Chriſt, and in whom the ſpirit of the Father ſpake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not hear Chriſt, as hereafter I ſhall prove; therefore they who heare the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do not hear Chriſt. But ſurely when <hi>A.</hi>S. began this work of deciding controverſies, he had forgotten that the Church was the only Judge in that particular, and not every man, nor the private ſpirit; for had he conſidered that, (he being but a particular
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105762:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man, would not have undertaken the Churches work; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Title of his book he hath, for he calls it, <hi>A brief Decider of all controverſies in matters of Faith,</hi> which book we have cauſe to judge is his own only work, and not the Churches; in which we find him condemning himſelf for the thing which he is doing; for, as appears by his aforeſaid Title, himſelf under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to decide controverſies; and in his 6th Chapter he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Church is the only Judge, or decider of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies: But this is, that his confuſion may the more appear, as it hath done in many other things, as may be ſeen in this ſmall Treatiſe; and ſurely, if the Pope have no better ſervants than <hi>A.</hi> S. to do his work for him, he had better keep them idle, than to employ them in ſuch a work; for in the end they will bring more ſhame to him than they will honour, for ſuch like confuſione, and other abominations, hath already made the very name of the Pope an ill ſavour to all true Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And one thing more in <hi>A.</hi> S. his 6th Chapter, I cannot well omit to obſerve, where he ſaith, the ſpirit inſpireth when he will, and you hear his voice, but cannot tell whence, from God or the Devil, he doth come, or whither, to heaven or to hell, he doth go; and then ſaith, ſo is every one that is born of the ſpirit; and to prove this, he quotes <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55. where Chriſt ſaid, <hi>ye know not what ſpirit ye are of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſider the blindneſſe, and ignorance, or elſe the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wickedneſſe, of <hi>A.</hi> S. who jumbles a deal of Scriptures toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, blaſphemouſly wreſting of them to his own deſtruction, or at leaſt, to the deſtruction of his own work in hand, thinking thereby to blind the minds of people, and with his good words, (mixed with blaſphemies) and fair ſpeeches, to deceive the hearts of the ſimple, as his predeceſſors have done in the long night of Apoſtacy which hath been over all nations, ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes.

Chriſt ſaid no ſuch thing, as <hi>A.S.</hi> doth, although that bleſſed worthy ſaying of our Saviour and Lord Chriſt, was, and is very true, (<hi>viz</hi>) <hi>Marvel not that I ſay unto you, that you muſt be born again, for the wind bloweth where it liſteth, and men hears the ſound thereof, but cannot tell from whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth</hi>; adding, <hi>even ſo is every one that is born of the ſpirit,</hi> John 3.7, 8. (Mark) they that were born of the ſpirit, were unknown to the world; for ſaid the Apoſtle (after they were born again) <hi>the world knows us not.</hi> So, although they were in the world, and men ſaw them, yet the world knew them not, no more than they knew from whence the wind came, and whither is went, which they heard the ſound of; and indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo is the ſtate of the true Church in the world at this day.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtles did know from whence the ſpirit came, and of what ſpirit they were, after they received the ſpirit of truth, and were born of it, for Chriſt told them, <hi>John</hi> 14.16. <hi>that he would pray the Father, and he ſhould ſend them the Holy Ghoſt, the Comforter,</hi> John 16.7.13. <hi>which ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with them for ever; and they did receive it, and were led by it into a heavenly habitation,</hi> Eph. 1.3. <hi>for they were made to ſit together i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to return to the matter concerning the Churches being Judge.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I find <hi>A.S.</hi> in the beginning of his ſeventh Chapter, ſaying, <hi>Methinks I hear a Quaker whiſpering, the Light that is in thee is the Judge of all controverſies, and the law and rule according to which thou muſt walk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Yea, the people called Quakers do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and ſay, that the light which every man is enlightned with, is the law and rule according to which every man ought to walk, and is the Judge in all controverſies in matters of faith, for, (as before) <hi>All Judgement is committed to the Son,</hi> John 5.22. <hi>who lighteth every man that cometh into the world</hi>; ſo all Judgement being committed to the light, that lighteth every man, the light that is in every man muſt of neceſſity be the Judge of all controverſies: and this I farther adde, that all who are baptized into Chriſt, hath put on Chriſt, and all who are by one ſpirit baptized into one body, (though they were ſometimes darkneſſe) are made light
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105762:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Lord, and ſo they being in him, and he in them, are all one, even as Chriſt and the Father is one, and he that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one; by which its clear, that Chriſt in his Church, who is light with him, is the onely Judge of all controverſies: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this ſupernatural Light is the true touchſtone, by which all ſpirits may be tried, whether they be of God, or not, for, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>whatſoever makes manifeſt, is light, Epheſians</hi> 5.13. ſo that without this touchſtone none can try ſpirits, becauſe an evil ſpirit may ſpeak good words.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt is in all things to be the Example of all believers; <hi>and he lighteth every man that cometh into the world, John</hi> 1.9. ſo every man being enlightened with the light of his ſpirit, who is to be our example in all things, it muſt of neceſſity be, that the light that is in us is this Judge, and the law and rule according to which all ought to walk.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But then <hi>A.S.</hi> replyes, <hi>that the light that is in thee tells thee, that thou muſt hear Chriſt, and Chriſt tells thee, that thou muſt hear the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Yea, the Light that is in us teacheth us to hear Chriſt, who hath enlightened us, and alſo to hear his Church, with whom he dwells, and that hears him, and in whom his ſpirit ſpeaks, ſo, as I ſaid before, I ſhall not go about to deny the Authority of the true Church; but the uſurped authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> I do deny; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp'd, I ſay, becauſe ſhe hath been, and here is, ſufficiently proved not to be the true Church (to whom Chriſt gives pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority both to bind and to loſe) therefore her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is uſurp'd, and ſhe is not to be heard, but to be turned away from.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>A.S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>If you object, that the ſpiritual judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, and the ſpiritual is judged of no man</hi>; I anſwer, that the godly ſpiritual judgeth all things, &amp;c. But I deny that you, or any other Sectaries in the world, is godly ſpiritual, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, they have not the Holy Ghoſt that are out of the Church.</p>

               </gap>feſſed, <hi>That the ſpiritual man judgeth all things,</hi> its according to my own belief; but what doth this avail the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who as I have proved is not godly ſpiritual; but is ſenſual and deviliſh, and is not the true Church, but the Whore; for although as he ſaith, The godly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual is judged of none, yet the Whore is judged of all who are godly ſpiritual; and although <hi>A.</hi>S. denyeth that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Quakers are godly ſpiritual, yet he is never able to prove his affirmation; for though they have not the holy Ghoſt who are out of the Church, yet it doth not follow, that they have it not who are out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> except ſhe could be proved to be the true Church.</p>
            <p>The contrary whereof I have already proved; for the people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Quakers (though they are out of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) are led by that ſpirit which teacheth them to live ſoberly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> righteouſly, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this preſent world, as thouſands of their Neighbours can bear witneſſe; therefore the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> are godly Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
            <p>Again, That Prophet which is of God, is godly ſpiritual, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.9. and that Prophet which ſpeaketh a thing, and the thing come to paſs, that Prophet is of God: But the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> have propheſied ſeveral things, as to the late over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd Powers of this Nation <note n="*" rend="inter">Witneſs the Book Intituled, Good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Advice Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</note> (with divers other things) which accordingly came to paſs, (as to their ſorrow they were made to know) therefore they are of God, and godly ſpiritual.</p>

            <p>But <hi>A.S.</hi> contrarywiſe (in effect) ſaith, <hi>That the Devil draws people to come unto Chriſt and to hear him.</hi> By which he hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſhewed, that he is of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And although <hi>A.S.</hi> ſo much pleads for the church (whom I know all will hear that hears Chriſt) yet upon ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration, I find its of purpoſe to deceive Chriſtians, and ſo he hath ſhewed himſelf as bad as the Devil he ſpeaks of, being found doing the ſame work, of which he ſeems to accuſe the Devil; for in his ſixth chapter I find him (as afore declared) in effect perſwading people, <hi>Not to adhere to the motions of the Spirit of Chriſt, under pretence that they cannot tell whence (from God or the Devil) it comes, or whither to (Heaven or Hell) it goeth,</hi> &amp;c.

But I never read or heard before, that any ſpirit did invite people to hear Chriſt, but the ſpirit of the Father, and his ſpirit ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, him hear ye,</hi> Mat. 17.5. Therefore that ſpirit that invites people to hear the Son of God, is not the Devil, but the ſpirit of the Father, and ought to be heard and obeyed by all.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial</hi>: but as Chriſt ſaid, that cannot be. And indeed we do experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally ſee and finde, that the Devil alwaies oppoſeth the keeping of Chriſts commands: As now in <hi>A.</hi> S. <hi>Who would diſwade them from it, under pretence that its the devil that leads them to it: And as to his ſaying, this Devil follows all Quakers.</hi> I anſwer, its true, but alas its intentionally to deſtroy them; for it was ſaid to the Serpent in the beginning, that the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe his head, and he ſhould bruiſe its heel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And even ſo its now come to paſſe, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the promiſed ſeed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. being become the leader of his people, and the Angel of Gods preſence going before them, the Devil, as <hi>A.</hi> S. ſaith, comes after them, and follows them with his fiery darts of perſecution, and Serpent like is ſnarling at the heel: But bleſſed be the Lord, he that goes before them, and is in them, is greater and mightier, then the Devil that follows them, and he hath been their preſerver hitherto, and I doubt not but he will unto the end preſerve all who truſt in him.</p>
            <p>And as concerning Chriſts words, there needs no meaning to be given to them, for he meant as he ſpoke, but if they did according to <hi>A.</hi> S. his own concluſion, he is not the interpreter, but the Church; Therefore (<hi>A.</hi>S. being not the church, but a particular man) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own argument, his interpretation is not to be heeded. Again he ſaith, <hi>every man is not the Interpreter,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>every man is a liar</hi>: and indeed he hath confirmed unto us, that himſelf is a liar, becauſe he hath belied the intent of Chriſts words aforeſaid, by giving his meaning to them.</p>
            <p>Then ſaith <hi>A.</hi> S. <hi>Yet theſe deluded ſouls think that this their delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſpirit is of God, and why forſooth, becauſe it reprehends them of ſin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and did not</hi> Judas <hi>his ſpirit rebuke him of ſinne, and notwithſtanding induce him to deſperation, and to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here <hi>A.</hi> S. is again putting light for darkneſſe, or calling the ſpirit of truth a deluding ſpirit, for is not that the ſpirit of truth that reproves the world of ſin, <hi>John</hi> 16.7, 8. Did not Chriſt ſay, that he would ſend the comforter, that ſhould reprove the world of ſin, and we never read of any other ſpirit that did reprove ſinne, but the ſpirit of truth, which <hi>A.</hi> S. (blaſphemouſly) calls a deluding ſpirit, neither did I ever read that a deluding ſpirit was the comforter, which that ſpirit that reproves for ſin is, as Chriſt ſaid. And again, is it not clear that <hi>A.</hi>S. puts light for darkneſſe, in calling that a deluding ſpirit, which reproves ſin, for the Apoſtle ſaid, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are reproved, are made manifeſt by the light, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever makes manifeſt is light, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13. and the deluding ſpirit is darkneſſe it ſelf, ſo that hereby it manifeſtly appears, that <hi>A.</hi>S. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern betwixt light and darkneſſe, ſo is a miſerable blind guide indeed. And though the ſpirit of truth did rebuke <hi>Judas</hi> for his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, doth it therefore follow that it was the ſame that led him to hang himſelf; no, this is great ignorance in <hi>A.</hi>S. to affirm, for he might as well have ſaid, That the ſame ſpirit that led him to betray his Maſter, did afterwards rebuke him for it; but then his ignorance would have ſomewhat more plainly appeared: But it was indeed the ſame ſpirit which led <hi>Judas</hi> into that preſumptuous act, as to betray his Maſter, that afterwards led him to deſperation, and to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that ſpirit which let him ſee his wickedneſſe which he had done, and rebuked him for it, was light, <hi>for whatſoever makes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt is light,</hi> Eph. 5.13.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, then laſtly he ſaith, <hi>Thus far have we degreſſed for the Converſion of Quakers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Thus having briefly anſwered the moſt remarkable arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>A.</hi> S. to prove the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the true church, and alſo the ſeveral particulars, by which he endeavoured to render the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105762:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people called Quakers, as a people led by a deluding ſpirit: I find the reſt of his book conſiſts of divers arguments, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverts with Sectaries, and their Bibles, and Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe cauſe (as aforeſaid) I am not ingaged in, therefore it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me to anſwer his charges againſt them, but ſhall leave them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Although there are indeed many things contained in the remaining part of his book, from which I might lay open much of the deceit and ignorance of <hi>A.</hi> S. and the abominations of the church of <hi>Rome</hi>; But the generality of people being already ſo fully ſatisfied concerning her: and the confuſion and ignorance of <hi>A.</hi> S. alſo being herein ſo fully manifeſted already; I look upon it as ſuperfluous at preſent to inlarge on this account, and indeed if never a word had been ſaid, the very fruits brought forth by the church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the view of all Nations, are enough to forewarn them of adhering to her, for can a man touch pitch and not be defiled.</p>
            <p>But for all that hath been ſaid; It may be ſome will ſay;<note rend="inter">A hint towards the diſcovery of the true Church.</note> that grand queſtion propounded by <hi>A.S.</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of his booke; Remaines yet unanſwered, (<hi>viz</hi>) which is the true Church &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To which I anſwer; that is the true Church; (and no other) whoſe fruits makes manifeſt that they are governed by the inviſible head, Chriſt, and that continues in the doctrine of Chriſt and his apoſtles, and that are found in the ſame order, or diſcipline in their Aſſemblies, that the true Church was in the primitive times; and that have the ſame way of ordaining miniſters; that the true Church had, And that lives ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent world; as the true Church did; But the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> are ſuch as hereafter I ſhall prove, Therefore the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> are the true Church;</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is manifeſt by the fruits of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they are governed by the inviſible head, Chriſt, for Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes his followers; not to ſweare at all, which command the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid people obſerves and keeps, as this nation of <hi>England</hi> full well knowes;</p>
            <p>Againe Chriſt came not to deſtroy mens lives; but to ſave them; and commanded his followers to love their enemeis; And it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> have the mind of Chriſt; becauſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105762:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they ſeek not the deſtruction of any, but the preſervation and good of all, and that they love even their enemies, who hates, and perſecutes them; becauſe they are ready to aſſiſt, or be helpfull to them upon all occaſions; or opportunities, in any thing that may tend to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and future well-being; therefore, they are governed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible head, Chriſt; againe, Chriſt commanded ſaying, <hi>whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you even ſo do ye unto them.</hi> Mat. 7.12 which command the aforeſaid people obſerves, and keeps, as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands can beare witneſs for them; Therefore they are governed by the inviſible head, Chriſt, and are the true Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Againe the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> continues in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for Chriſt preacht the doctrine of perfection, ſaying, <hi>be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> Math: 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 48. And the Apoſtle preacht the ſame doctrine: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6: 1: and laboured to preſent every man perfect in Chriſt; <hi>Col</hi>: 1: 28: having received guifts for that very worke, <hi>Epheſ</hi>: 4: 11: 12: And the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> do preach the ſame doctrine of perfection, and laboures in the power and ſpirit of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

contrary of both which may be eaſily proved by plaine ſcripture, for at that time when <hi>Iſraell</hi> were ſtrangers unto God, and were all gon out of the way, and none amongſt them did good &amp;c. even then did God promiſe that the day ſhould come in which he would make anew cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and with the houſe of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> (who were in the tranſgreſſion, of the firſt covenant <hi>Jer:</hi> 31: 31:) and that he would finiſh tranſgreſſion, and make an end of ſin, <hi>Dan</hi>: 24: which had hid his face from them (and by which they were made ſtrangers to him, <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>: God having provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us could not be made perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and although ſome of them had been Idolators, and had lived in the pollutions of he world, yet they were waſhed and clenſed, yea, and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus and by the ſpirit of our God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, 11: and ſo though they were ſome times Ignorant of God, yet, God cauſed the Light to ſhine out of darkneſſe in their hearts to give them the Light of the knowledg of Gods glory in the face of Chriſt who dwelt in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2.20. ſo that both ſin and Ignorance was don away in them through the power and coming of the Lord Jeſus, and ſo they did not alwayes remaine in their ſins, but was freed from them, as the apoſtle teſtified <hi>Rom.</hi> 18. &amp; 8.2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But then Antichriſts miniſters ſaith, that if they were free from ſin, why did the apoſtle ſay, that if we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves and the truth is not in us, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer he did not ſay ſo becauſe people could not be made free from ſin, but he ſaid ſo that they might not ſin, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.1. and conſider who they were that he then wrote to for, he ſometimes wrote to children, and ſometimes to young men, and ſometimes to fathers in the truth, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.13. But when he ſpake thoſe words (<hi>viz</hi>) <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin,</hi> &amp;c. he then ſpake to children; for ſaid he, <hi>my little Children, theſe things I write unto you, that you ſin not,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. Now if they had been already perfect, or fully freed from ſin, then had they attained to the mans ſtate, which the apoſtle laboured to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105762:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bring them to <hi>Colo.</hi> 1.28. But they having not attained to that ſtate, he would not have them to deceive themſelves, (nor to think more highly of themſelves then they ought to think, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3.) which children in underſtanding are ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(who is <hi>the one offering that perfects for ever, all them that are ſanctified, Heb.</hi> 10.14.) and he laboured to build them up in the holy faith which gives victory through Chriſt, that ſo they might be borne up to a mans ſtate, for ſaid he, he that is born of God doth not ſin, John. 3.9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But then, it may be ſome will object, that the apoſtle ſpake not only of children, but of himſelfe alſo, ſaying, if we ſay &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, that although the apoſtle numbred himſelf with them, yet that doth not argue, that he was in their ſtate, or that he was not ſet free from ſin, no more then <hi>Iames</hi> his numbring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt the ſcattered Jews, (ſaying, <hi>with the ſame mouth curſe we men &amp;c.</hi> Jam. 1.9) doth argue that he was one of them that did curſe men, for its evident that the apoſtle became as weake to them that were weak, and to the ſtrong, as ſtrong, and to them that were under the Law, as under the law, and to them that were without the law, as without the law, though not without law to God, and <hi>became al things unto all, that he thereby might gaine ſome</hi>; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.20.21.22. ſo although he did condeſcend to them that were weake, as children or babes in Chriſt, as to number himſelf amongſt them, for the gaining of them to a farther ſtate, yet that doth not at all argue, that he was, as they were, for the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſaid, <hi>that he was ſet free from the law of ſin and death,</hi> Rom. 8.2. all which being rightly weighed, and conſidered, It manifeſtly appeares, that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or freedom from ſin, is attaineable according to the doctrine of Chriſt and his apoſtles, which by the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and continued in, as before aſſerted, therefore they are the true Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, The Order and Diſcipline of the true Church in the Apoſtles time, was, That the Propets might ſpeak two or three, and the reſt might judge; and if any thing was revealed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſate by, he might ſpeak, and the firſt was to hold his peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29, 30. and the ſame order the people called Quakers have in their aſſemblies, as is known to thouſands, by

which it appears that they are the true Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again, The Miniſters of Chriſt in the true Church in the primitive times (who turned people from darkneſſe to light, and from Satans power, to the power of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1.) were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and made Miniſters, not of man, nor by man, nor of the letter, but of the ſpirit, by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. and ſo are the Miniſters amongſt the people called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, made Miniſters of the ſpirit, by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, as the effects of their miniſtry doth teſtifie; for many are turned from darkneſs to light, and from iniquity to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſpirits in priſon is by them miniſtred unto, and the dead are raiſed unto life, and the captives are ſet at liberty, as thouſands can and muſt bear witneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. The true Church in the primitive times, was taught by the grace of God, <hi>that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, they ſhould live ſoberly and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus I might produce many more arguments to prove the aforeſaid people to be the Church of true Chriſtians, but much of this kind hath been by ſeveral of them already written; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
