         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auyng of late (gentle reader) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the expert Artificer Ro. Norman, his booke intituled The newe Attractiue (who of the great good will, and affection he beareth, hath attributed in his dedication, that, whiche I acknowledge not to bee dewe) in the whiche amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest other diuers vertues and properties of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes or Lodestone, he intreateth of the declinyng of the Needle touched there with from the plaine of the Horizon, (a matter neuer before found, or written of by any). For the further behoofe and benefite of all traueilers and Seamen, I tooke occaſion to inlarge the ſame with this diſcourſe of the variation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, wherein I haue handled the whole varietie of that ſubiect, bothe Practically, and Mathimatically, to the ende I might partly ſatiſfie bothe the vulgar, and alſo the learned ſort. For, knowyng the variatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Cumpaſſe to bee the cauſe of many errours and imperfections in Nauigation, and perceiuyng that all thoſe that haue as yet gone about to giue rules in that
<pb facs="tcp:12722:3"/>
arte, haue left this (beyng a principall poinct, and eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the grounde of all the reste) vntouched, or at least ſo ſleightly handled the ſame, that little or no benefit could be gathred therby: I haue here ſet doune the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie waies to obſerue the ſame at all tymes &amp; places, that the inconuenience beyng knowne, might be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of, and auoided. VVherein, although my cheefeſt intent hath been to pleaſure thoſe that ſhall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to put the thyng in practice by their owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and experience, yet becauſe ſome of the rules are deducted from the fountaines of the Mathematicall Sciences, and wrought by the doctrine of Sines and Triangles, whiche maie ſeeme ſtrange in our Engliſhe tonge, &amp; wherwith fewe Seamen are yet acquainted, I maie ſeem to haue miſſed of my first good meanyng, but I would wiſhe them to chuſe that whiche is plain, and conformable to their capacities, and make their profite thereof, and for the reste vnderstande, that of ſuche obſeruations as thei them ſelues can not preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly applie to the purpoſe, by others that are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructed in theſe Mathematicall ſupputations, or by them ſelues when thei ſhall attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therof, maie be inferred ſuche effectuall matter as is by theſe rules and preceptes promiſed. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would haue all Seamen to vſe ſuche diligence in
<pb facs="tcp:12722:3"/>
their trauailes, that no oportunitie be omitted, when, or where any obſeruation maie be made, either for the variation, or latitude of places, or of any other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie poincte incident to Nauigation, and thereof to keepe continuall notes &amp; memoriall. For theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, there needeth not many troubleſome Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, onely for the variation, the newe Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ende of this treatiſe I preferre before all other. And for eleuations, a plaine Astrolabe exactly made, and a croſſe ſtaffe, are ſufficient. (The Globe were alſo a verie good and neceſſarie Instrument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for beſides many pleaſaunt concluſions that maie be tried by it, it doeth lighten verie muche the conceiptes, for vnderstandyng diuers important poinctes, but it is too troubleſome [or otherwiſe not fit for euery Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner] to be caried to the Sea). Vnto the whiche maie bee added the Topographicall Instrument, for taking of diſtances, and making deſcriptions vpon the land. VVith theſe Instrumentes, and the ſailyng Cumpaſſe and Marine plat, (whiche are alwaies to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode the principall, and moſte neceſſarie Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for Nauigation, for by them onely any voiage maie bee made, but without them no Nauigation can bee performed.) the whole worlde maie bee traueled, diſcouered, &amp; deſcribed. Theſe are ſufficient for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
<pb facs="tcp:12722:4"/>
Mariner, and more then theſe were ſuperfluous, onely the runnyng glaſſes, leades, lines, and ſuche like appendances of the other excepted.</p>
            <p>But to haue all theſe Inſtruments, and not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande the groundes how to vſe them, were a great vanitie. Therefore I wiſhe all Seamen &amp; Traueiler's, that deſire to bee cunnyng in their profeſſion, firste to ſeeke knowledge in Arithmetik &amp; Geometrie, whiche are the groundes of all Science and certaine artes, of the whiche there is written in our Engliſhe to gue, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for an induſtrious and willyng minde to attain to greate perfection, whereby he maie not onely iudge of Instrumentes, Rules, and preceptes giuen by other, but alſo bee able to correcte them, and to deuiſe newe of hym ſelf And this not onely in Nauigation, but in all Mechanicall Sciences. As by the ſtudious practiſe and exerciſe in theſe artes, haue attained to rare and ſinguler knowledge: In Architecture, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itriuuius the Romaine: In paintyng that famous Germaine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Durerus: And in buildyng of Shippes, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe Baker our countrieman: And others in other faculties as thei haue been moste ſkilfull herein, ſo haue thei excelled. Hauyng theſe helpes and groundes with the Instrumentes before ſpecified, a Mariner maie bee able to make deſcription in platt of the coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

And not be alwaies tied to the reportes of other, or to the Portugale, or Spaniſhe Marine platts, whiche are made by the Cardmakers of thoſe Countries, men that are no trauelers them ſelues, but doe all thinges ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by information, and vppon the credite of others, whiche onely committ to memorie the forme and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Sea coaſtes, with making ſome fewe notes of the liyng of one place from an other, whiche can neuer bee ſo perfecte as the deferiptions that are made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the preſent ſight and vewe of places, albeeit he be neuer ſo ſkilfull and cunnyng, that ſhall ſo cary the ſame by memorie, how muche leſſe then by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfull. By this meanes the Cardmakers ſet doune thei knowe not what: as maie appeare by the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their owne coastes, whiche are verie groſſely and vnperfectly dooen, whereas the Marine plattes ought to bee deſcribed by ſuche as can giue reaſon, and ſhewe obſeruation of euery particularitie contained in the ſame, aſwell for the latitude of places, as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng by the Compaſſe of the Capes, Headlandes, Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes,

The errors of thoſe deſcriptions, I maie not attribute to the Card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, but to the vnſkilfull Seamen of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, for if thei were otherwiſe, as thei haue been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted the moste ſkilfull of the worlde, thoſe errors could not haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued as thei doe: true it is that for their great trauailes, thei haue been worthely famous aboue all other nations, till now at length our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieman Sir Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis Drake for valorous attempt, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proceadyng, &amp; fortunate performyng his voiage about the worlde, is not onely become equall to any of them, but in fame farre ſurmounteth them all. But thoſe Cardmakers, and all other that collecte and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hydrographical, and Geographicall deſcriptions of other mennes trauatles or reportes: as their paines maie bee greate, and deſerue due commendation, ſo their doynges maie bryng commoditie diuerſely. And in this behalf Abrahamus Ortelius in his Theatrum, hath deſerued immortall praiſe, for collectyng to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and reducing into one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious volume, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers plattes and deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, made by diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie men.

            <p>
               <hi>The magneticall meridian</hi> is to bee vnderſtood a greate circle paſſyng by the Zenith and the Pole of the <hi>Magnes,</hi> deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the Horizon into two equall parts croſſyng the ſame at oppoſit points: which interſections or croſſynges, are ſhewed by the Needle or wiers of the Cumpas touched with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes</hi> or the <hi>Lodeſtone.</hi>

               <hi>The Azimuth</hi> of the Sun is a great circle, paſſyng by the Zenith and the true place of the Sun: croſſyng the Horizon at right Angles in oppoſit poincts, and diuidyng the ſame into two equall parts.

            <p>The Azimuths of the Sun vpon equall eleuations in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone and afternoone, haue equall diſtances from the true meridian, ſo that the middle poinct of the whole difference of any two Azimuths obſerued vppon equall eleuations in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone and afternoone, is the true meridian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12722:8"/>This difference of Azimuths is found vppon the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Uariation, by addyng together the Uariations of the Sunnes ſhadowe at equall eleuations in fornoone and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone.

            <p>The Inſtrument beyng duly placed in forme aforeſaid, it differeth nothyng from the Cumpas of Uariation, but onely in this poinct, that whereas the Flye of the Cumpas of Ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, is ſo turned by vertue of the Magneticall wiers, that

the North poinct thereof doeth ſhew the Pole of the Magnes or line of Uariation: In this Inſtrument, the North poinct of the Needle doeth ſupply that, whiche the North poinct of the Cumpas ſhould doe.

I take the leſſer out of the greater and finde remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>22. d. 35′.</hi> the half thereof is <hi>11. d. 17′. ½.</hi> So much I ſay is the Pole Artik, and true meridian line that paſſeth to the Pole by our Zenith at <hi>London,</hi> to the Weſtwardes of the North that the Needle ſheweth. And therefore the Needle or Cumpas varieth from the true Northe <hi>11. d. 17′. ½.</hi> to the Eaſtwardes.</p>
               <p>Alſo at <hi>25. d.</hi> eleuation in the fornoone the variation is <hi>22. d. 20′.</hi> from North to Weſt: at the ſame eleuation in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone the variation is <hi>0. d. 8′.</hi> from North to Weſt. Now becauſe the variations are both one way, (that is to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes) I adde them together (and ſo ought you to doe as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as you finde the variations ſo to agree) and I finde that they amount to <hi>22. d. 28′.</hi> the half thereof is <hi>11. d. 14′.</hi> which is the variation.</p>
               <p>The variations of the Needle or Cumpas by the former obſeruations, are ſet out towardes the right hand againſt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degrees eleuation; and conferryng them all together, I do finde the true variation of the Needle or Cumpas at <hi>Lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi>

to be about <hi>11. d. ¼.</hi> or <hi>11. d. ⅓.</hi> whiche is a poinct of the Cumpas iuſt or little more. So that in a Cumpas whoſe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ſet directly vnder the flowre de Luce, the North and by Weſt, and South and by Eaſt poincts doe ſhewe the true meridian.</p>

            <head type="sub">¶ The fourth Chapter.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former declaration, the onely way to try the variation, is by comparyng of the ſeuerall correſpondent obſeruations of the Sunnes eleuation in the fornoone, with thoſe of the afternoone, ſo that if the Sunne ſhould bee obſcured, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion like obſeruation can not be made in the afternoone, then the former rule giueth not the deſired purpoſe. Therefore I thought good to ſhewe, how by any one obſeruation in the fore or afternoone, the eleuation of the Pole and place of the Sunne giuen, you maie knowe the true meridian and the variation of the Needle from the ſame in any place, whiche thing maie be done and aptly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the Globe, but moſte exactly calculated by the <hi>Table of Sines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To finde out the variation vpon the Globe, you muſt firſt ſet your Globe to ſtande dewly accordyng to the eleuation of the Pole at the place propoſed. Then ſeeke in the <hi>Ephemeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> for the true place of the Sunne that daie, and note it with ſome ſmall prick in the ecliptik of the Globe. And placyng the Quadrant of Altitude or moueable verticall, at the verticall poinct or Zenith, take the eleuation of the Sunne obſerued by the Aſtrolabe or other Inſtrument at the tyme propoſed, and
<pb facs="tcp:12722:11"/>
note it iuſtly vppon the ſame quadrant of altitude. Then turne your Globe and quadrant towardes that part of the Horizon that the Sunne was in at the tyme of the obſeruation, till the pricke you made for the place of the Sunne in the ecliptik, concur and agree iuſtly with the eleuation marked in the ſaid quadrant of altitude. So ſhall you ſee the quadrant ſhewe you vpon the Horizon, the Azimuth and diſtance of the Sunne from the true meridian of that place, whiche you ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the variation obſerued vppon the Inſtrument at that inſtant of the Sunnes eleuation, And if they agree and concur iuſt, then ſhall you bee in the true and common meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, whiche ſheweth the Pole of the worlde and Pole of the <hi>Magnes</hi> or <hi>Lodeſtone:</hi> But if thei differ, you ſhal ſubtract the leſſer from the greater, the remayner ſheweth the variation. And if the variation vpon the Inſtrument be greater then the true diſtance of the Azimuth from the meridian founde vppon the Globe, the ſame ſurplus is to be accompted for variation, vpon the contrary ſide of the meridian: if it bee leſſe, it is to bee accompted on the ſame ſide of the meridian that the variation is taken, whether it bee in the fornoone or afternoone. This precept needeth no further demonſtration, then the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, the Globe I meane.</p>
            <p>But for example of the worke, I take the firſt obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the former Chapter ſperified, made at <hi>Lymehouſe</hi> the ſixteenth of <hi>October</hi> 1580. in the fornoone, which is <hi>17. d.</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and variation <hi>52. d. 35′.</hi> from North to Weſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt I ſet my Globe at <hi>51. d. 32′.</hi> for the eleuation of the Pole. Secondly I take the place of the Sunne <hi>2. d. 55′.</hi>m. and note it vpon the Ecliptick. Thirdly I note vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the quadrant of altitude, the eleuation of the Sunne <hi>17. d.</hi> This done, I moue the quadrant of altitude towardes the Eaſt of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and turne the Globe till the prick in the Eclipticke for the place of the Sunne, doe agree iuſtly, with the eleuation noted vppon the quadrant of altitude, and finde the true Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth ſhewed by the ſaid quadrant vpon the Horizon to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, about 41. ⅔ from the meridian. And conferryng the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:12722:11"/>
with the variation founde vppon the Inſtrument <hi>52. d. 35′.</hi> I find the difference <hi>11. d. 15′.</hi> And becauſe the obſeruation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be in the fornoone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the North to the Weſt, or South to the Eaſt, and the variation vppon the Inſtrument greater then the Azimuth founde on the Globe, I accompt the ſame from the North to the Eaſt, or from the South to the Weſt. So I conclude the variation at Lymehouſe to be about 11. ¼. from North to Eaſt, or South to Weſt.</p>

For attaynyng of the ſame arke. Firſt it is neceſſarie to haue the arke of the Equinoctiall betweene the Sunne at the tyme of the obſeruation, and the meridian, which ark is thus found.</p>

               <p>But comparyng the ſame arke of the Horizon <hi>41. d. 31′. 22″.</hi> with the variation founde at the correſpondent eleuation in the afternoone, which is <hi>30. d. 0′.</hi> I ſubtract the leſſer from the greater, and finde the exceſſe <hi>11. d. 31′. 22″.</hi> whiche ſhould be the variation. And becauſe the variation founde vppon the Inſtrument is leſſe then the arke of the Azimuth vppon the Horizon, I accompt the variation on the ſame ſide of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, whiche is from South to Weſt, or North to Eaſt.</p>
               <p>This varietie betweene the obſeruation made in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, and that in the afternoone, proceedeth either of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the Inſtrument, or negligence of the obſeruer. For in the rule there can bee no error, beyng grounded vppon Geometricall demonſtration, then whiche nothyng can bee
<pb facs="tcp:12722:15"/>
more certaine.</p>
               <p>The former preceptes and examples doe ſerue when the Sunne doth decline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Equinoctiall either Northwards or Southwardes. But if the Sunne be in the Equinoctiall, then the maner of the workyng is more eaſie and brief. For if you multiplie the ſine of the Sunnes eleuation at the tyme of obſeruation, by the whole ſine, and diuide the product by the ſine of the eleuation of the Equinoctiall, whiche is the meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an altitude, the quotient giueth the ſeconde right ſine of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Sunne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meridian, whiche is the firſt right ſine of the complement of the ſame arke: And entryng the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſines with it, you ſhall finde his arke, whiche if you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the quadraut or <hi>90. d.</hi> leaueth the arke of the diſtance of the Sunne from the meridian. And hauyng the ſame work thus. If the ſine of the complement of the eluation of the Sun at the tyme of the obſeruation, giue the ſine of the forſaid arke of diſtance, what ſhall the whole ſine giue. Multiplie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, the quotient ſhalbe the ſine of the ark of the Horizon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned betweene the Azimuth of the Sunne and the meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Which arke being compared with the variation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in maner as before is ſhewed, giueth the variation required.</p>
               <p>But the Sunne beyng in the Equinoctiall, if the place where the obſeruation is made, bee likewiſe vnder the ſame circle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then is the variation moſt eaſely obſerued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that the Equinoctiall is the Azimuth of Eaſt and Weſt, therfore tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng your Inſtrument onely to receiue the ſhadowe of the Sunne, and looking then to the North poinct of the Needle, if you finde the ſame to aunſwere to the quadrant or <hi>90. d.</hi> you ſhall be in the meridian of the Magnes, whiche paſſeth by the Poles of the world, but if it doe differ from <hi>90. d.</hi> the ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is the variation of the Needle.</p>
               <p>But admittyng the obſeruer to be vnder the Equinoctiall, and the Sunne to haue declination, then the proportion of the ſine of the complement of the eleuation at the tyme of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, vnto the ſine of the declination, ſhalbe ſuche, as the
<pb facs="tcp:12722:15"/>
whole ſine, is to the ſine of the arke of the Horizon included betweene the Azimuth of Eaſt and Weſt, which is the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall it ſelf, and the Azimuth of the Sunne for the tyme of the obſeruation, the complement whereof giueth the true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, whiche complement you maie compare with the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſhewed vpon the Inſtrument, the difference is the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>Diuers other caſes might bee propoſed, and rules giuen for them, whiche for breuitie I omit.</p>
               <p>But one thyng I thought good to admoniſhe you by the waie, that whereas I haue ſhewed in the firſt part of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the maner to finde the two verſed ſines, the one of the Semidiurnall arke, the other of the arke of the diſtance of the Sunne from the meridian. By the firſt, the Semidiurnall arke being found and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> quantitie of the daie. And by the arke of the other likewiſe reduced, the houre of the day, or the tyme contained betweene the noonſteed and the inſtant of the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. As in the ſame example. The verſed ſine of the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diurnall ark <hi>LS.</hi> is giuen 70386. in ſuche parts as the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter of the Equinoctiall <hi>BD.</hi> is 100000. therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame into ſuch parts as the Semidiameter of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel <hi>LF.</hi> is 100000. and finde it to be 72095. which ſubtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the whole ſine <hi>LF. 100000.</hi> there reſteth <hi>SF. 27905.</hi> whiche is the ſecond right ſine of the Semidiurnall ark <hi>LR.</hi> and the right ſine of <hi>RH. 16. d. 12′.</hi> whiche is the complement of the Semidiurnall ark <hi>LR.</hi> wherefore ſubtractyng it from the quadrant <hi>LH.</hi> or <hi>90. d.</hi> reſteth <hi>73. d. 48′.</hi> the Semidiur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ark <hi>LR.</hi> the ſame reduced into partes of tyme allowyng <hi>15. d.</hi> for an houre 15′. for a minut, and 15″. for a ſeconde of tyme, and for euery degree 4. minuts of tyme, for euery mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut 4″. and for euery ſecond 4″. &amp;c. I finde the time of that ark from the poinct aſcendent, to the meridian, whiche is halfe the day, to bee 4. houres 55′. 12″. and conſequently the whole day beyng the 16. of <hi>October</hi> aboue written, to be 9. houres 50′. 24″. long.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12722:16"/>This example maie ſerue for a generall precedent, whiles the Equinoctiall is betweene the Sunne &amp; the eleuated Pole, but if the Sunne be between the eleuated Pole and the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, then will the verſed ſine fall out to be greater then the whole ſine, and the Semidiurnall arke to exceede a quadrant. Wherefore hauyng reduced the ſame into his proportionall parts, as before is ſhewed, ſubtract from it the whole ſine, the ſurplus is the ſine of the exceſſe of the Semidiurnall arke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a quadrant, whiche beyng added to the quadrant, giueth the Semidiurnall arke.</p>
               <p>By the other verſed ſine of the diſtance of the Sunne from the meridian, which is <hi>LK. 23952.</hi> in ſuch parts as the whole ſine or Semidiameter <hi>LF.</hi> is 100000. ſubtracted from the whole ſine, is giuen <hi>KF. 76048.</hi> the ſecond right ſine of the ſame ark of diſtance, and the firſt right ſine of <hi>49. d. 30′. 24″.</hi> which is the complement of the ark of the Sunnes diſtance from the meridian: therefore ſubtractyng the ſame from <hi>90. d.</hi> reſteth <hi>40. d. 29′. 36″.</hi> the arke of the diſtance betweene the Sunne and the meridian, which beyng reduced into partes of time as before, giueth 2. houres 41′. 58″. and the ſame (becauſe it is in the fornoone) deducted from 12. houres the noonſteed, reſteth 9. houres 18′. 2″. the iuſt inſtant of the tyme of the day.</p>
               <p>But if this verſed ſine be found to be greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole ſine (as it maie when the Sunne is betweene the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and the eleuated Pole, and before the houre of ſixe in the mornyng and after the houre of ſixe in the euenyng) then doth the arke of diſtance conſequently exceede a quadrant, the ſine of this exceſſe is the ſurplus of the verſed ſine aboue the whole ſine. Whoſe arke added to the quadrant giueth the arke of the Sunnes diſtance from the meridian, and reducyng the ſame into parts of tyme, is giuen the inſtant of tyme of the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As by this meanes (the eleuation of the Sunne being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely obſerued and Latitude knowen), the inſtant of time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daie is giuen more exactly, then by any Clock, Diall or other Inſtrument. So if there might be had a portable Clocke that

And in this ſort trauelling and obſeruing from place to place, might the longitudes of any Countrey be perfectly deſcribed.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12722:19"/>
then the cheef matter that is by them required. For the common precepts, whiche as yet haue cheefly been giuen for the findyng thereof, depende onely vppon the obſeruation of the meridian altitude of the Sunne or Starres, or els vppon certaine falſe and groſſe rules of the guardes and Pole ſtarre. Therefore I haue thought good, that as I haue ſhewed the waie to know the variatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon any one obſeruation, either in forenoone or afternoone, the latitude of the place preſuppoſed: ſo likewiſe, vpon twoo obſeruations by the Sunne, either in forenoone or afternoone, to ſette doune the waie and maner how to finde the eleuation of the Pole, ſituation of the meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and variation of the Needle in any place by the Globe.</p>
            <p>But this you muſt alwaies regard, that your two obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions maie haue conuenient diſtance of tyme betweene them, the greater the better: So as the higher eleuation bee not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nere the meridian, the lower eleuation the nerer it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Azimuth of Eaſt or Weſt, or to the Horizon, the better, with which eleuations, you are to note the difference of the Sunnes Azimuths or variations founde by the ſhadowe vppon the Inſtrument exactly, for without that, the eleuations onely are in vaine.</p>
            <p>Firſt it is requiſit, that your Globe be ſo fitted, that the meridian circle and the Horizon doe croſſe eche other at right angles, and diuide them ſelues equally into Semicircles. And alſo that the quadrant of altitude (or moueable verticall) bee placed duly vpon the meridian circle at the Zenith, ſo as being turned circularly, it may touche the Horizon equally in euery part. Theſe thinges beyng duly conſidered, there needeth not any further regard to bee had for placyng of the Globe, onely this you may reſpect in ſettyng the Pole at aduentures aboue the Horizon betweene it and the Zenith, that the meridian cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle may cut the Horizon in iuſt degrees, ſo may your quadra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of altitude be placed at your Zenith iuſtly vpon a degree alſo.</p>
            <p>Then muſt you faſten your Globe to the Horizon, ſo as it may remaine immoueable, but in faſtnyng the ſame you muſt regard that you force it not from one ſide of the Horizon to an
<pb facs="tcp:12722:19"/>
other, but that it reſt equidiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the ſame. And hauyng your Globe thus diſpoſed, it is ready for you to apply your obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon, which you ſhall thus doe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, take your higheſt eleuation, and note it vpon your quadrant of altitude, and place the ende of the ſaied quadrant vpon the Horizon at 10. 15. or 20. d. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meridian circle, (but the nerer you ſet the ſame to the meridian, the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently, without impechement, will your triall bee made.) Then giue a pricke vpon the Globe in the Azimuth, that the quadrant ſheweth at the degree of the eleuation, noted vpon the quadrant, then againe note the leſſer eleuation vpon the quadrant of altitude, and remoue the ſame vpon the Horizon (from that place where it was firſt fixed, towardes the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth of Eaſt or Weſt, whiche ſhalbe nereſt the ſame) ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees as you finde the difference of Azimuthes betwene the twoo eleuations by the ſhadowe of the Sunne, vpon the inſtrument of Variation, and ſtaiyng your quadrant of alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude vpon that poinct of the Hozizon: note alſo your leſſer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuation in the ſame Azimuth vpon your Globe. This doen you muſt haue a paire of Calliper compaſſes, ſuche as maie conueniently reche to <hi>113. d. ½.</hi> of the Equinoctiall of your Globe, (whiche is a quadrant, and the greateſt declination of the Sunne) then you muſt conſider whiche of the Poles of the worlde is eleuated aboue your Horizon, and whether your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination bee towardes, or from that Pole, that is to ſaie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sunne be betweene the eleuated Pole and the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, or the Equinoctiall betweene the Sunne and the Pole. If the Sunne bee betweene the Pole and the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, then are you to ſubtracte the declination from <hi>90. d.</hi> If the Equinoctiall bee betweene the Sunne and the Pole, you muſt adde the declination to <hi>90. d.</hi> And take the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainyng or collected number of degrees &amp;c. with your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes vpon the Equinoctiall. And ſett the one ende of your compaſſe at the pricke made vpon your Globe, for the higheſt obſeruation, and with the other ende deſcribe an arke or peece of a circle, vpon the ſame ſide of the meridian that your pricke
<pb facs="tcp:12722:20"/>
is on, from the meridian to the Horizon. Then againe with your compaſſe vnaltered, ſettyng the one foote in the pricke for the loweſt obſeruation, deſcribe an other peece of a like circle croſſyng the former. The poinct of the interſection, or croſſyng of theſe twoo circles, is the eleuated Pole, to the whiche if you remoue the quadrant of altitude, you ſhall finde what the eleuation thereof is. And the poincte that the ſame quadrant ſheweth vpon the Horizon, is the interſection of the meridian and the Horizon, the Horizontall diſtance betweene this interſection, and the Azimuth of the leſſer obſeruation, ſubtracted from the ſemicircle, or <hi>180. d.</hi> leueth the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall diſtaunce of the ſame Azimuth from the true meridian. So haue you the eleuation of the Pole, and ſituation of the meridian.</p>
            <p>Now if you compare the Horizontall diſtance of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth of the Sunne, from the meridian at the tyme of the obſeruation, with the variation by the Sunnes ſhadow found vpon the inſtrument, at the tyme of the ſame obſeruation, and takyng the one out of the other, the remainer ſhalbe the true variation, whiche you are to accompte, as in the latter ende of the third Chapter is ſhewed. So haue you giuen the eleuation of the Pole, the meridian, and Variation of the Née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, the thynges propoſed to be ſhewed.</p>

               <p>In this example the declination is ſubtracted from the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, becauſe the Sunne is betweene the Equinoctiall and the eleuated Pole, but if the Equinoctiall were betweene the eleuated Pole, and the Sunne then ſhould you adde the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the quadrant, and with that diſtance taken vpon the Equinoctial with your Cumpaſſes, proceede as in the former example</p>
               <p>Theſe examples that I haue ſhewed, and ſuche like expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments to be done vpon the Globe, are eaſie to be conceiued, and the reaſons very manifeſt: but the truth of the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the exactnes of the Inſtruments, and the orderly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and handlyng of them.</p>
               <p>I might here haue annexed the maner, how vpon two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations of the Sunnes eleuation in fornoone or afternoone and difference of the Azimuths, to calculate the premiſſes more exactly by the table of Sines and doctrine of ſphericall triangles: but that it is a very tedious way, and my meanyng is rather to giue the Reader a proof of the pleaſant vſe of theſe calculations (whiche I thinke I haue ſufficiently done in the former Chapters) then to cloy hym at the firſt with the hard
<pb facs="tcp:12722:21"/>
and painfull practiſe of many examples. Notwithſtanding, for the ſatiſfaction of ſome, I will breefly ſet downe the grounde and ſumme of the work, which is this.</p>
               <p>The complements of your two eleuations, are two ſides of a ſphericall triangle not rectangle. The angle by theſe two knowen ſides contayned at the Zenith, is giuen by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Azimuths or variations vppon the Inſtrument. Wherefore by the 28. of the 4. of <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> the third ſide (whiche is the ark comprehended betweene the two eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) and the other angles may be giuen.</p>
               <p>Then haue you an other like triangle, whoſe three ſides are theſe: the firſt, one of the foreſaied complements of eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the ſeconde, the arke of the circle of declination, betweene the Sunne at the inſtant of the ſame eleuation, and the eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pole. The third ſide is an arke of the meridian betweene the Zenith and the Pole: whiche is the complement of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Pole, or latitude of the place. The twoo firſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des are alwaies giuen. For findyng the third ſide, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to knowe the angle that the twoo giuen ſides containe, whiche is the difference of twoo angles, whereof one is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the firſt triangle giuen, the other an angle contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the arke of the circle of declination, and the third ſide of the firſt triangle, whiche angle is diuerſly founde, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng founde and ſubtracted from the other angle, or that from it, the difference is the angle of this other triangle: And ſo haue you in the Sphericall triangle twoo ſides, and the angle by the ſame twoo ſides contained, giuen. And by the ſame 28. of the fowerth of <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> the thirde ſide is found, the complement whereof is the eleuation of the Pole.</p>

            <p>But thoſe defectes of the latitudes, haue been verie well reformed, by the famous and learned <hi>Gerardus Mercator</hi> (whom I honour and eſteeme as the cheef Coſmographer of the world) in his vniuerſal Mapp, which though he haue made with ſailyng lines, and dedicated to the vſe of Seamen, yet for want of conſideration of the Variation, and partly by angme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng his degrees of latitude towardes the Poles, the ſame is more fitte for ſuche to beholde, as ſtudie in Coſmographie, by
<pb facs="tcp:12722:26"/>
readyng aucthours vpon the lande, then to bee vſed in Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at the ſea.</p>
            <p>There is alſo in the ſame Vniuerſall Mappe, and likewiſe in all other moderne Mappes of the North partes of <hi>Europe,</hi> a greate fault, by placyng twoo <hi>Wardhouſes</hi> diſtant one from the other aboue <hi>20. d.</hi> in longitude, whereas indeede thei are but one thyng, and no ſuche diſtance betweene them. This er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror hath growen by taking <hi>Wardhouſe,</hi> and the Sea coaſtes, from thence to <hi>S.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries togethers, and confounded the whole deſcription.</p>
            <p>And albeeit he had had the entire ſailyng plat, that wee vſe for thoſe partes, yet if he had not knowen the <hi>ſecret effect</hi> of the Variation in the makyng thereof, he might haue fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like abſurditie or worſe. But of thoſe coaſtes and of the inwarde partes of the countries <hi>Ruſſia, Muſcouia &amp;c.</hi> I haue made a perfect plat and deſcription, by myne owne experience in ſundrie voiages and trauailes, bothe by Sea and Lande to and fro in thoſe partes, whiche I gaue to her Maieſtie, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1578.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe and like imperfections proceadyng of the Variation, there is yet an other inconuenience, whiche often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes encreaſeth the former errours, and that is, the diuers
<pb facs="tcp:12722:26"/>
placyng of the wiers fixed to the Flie of the Cumpaſſe.</p>
            <p>This varietie ofſettyng the wiers, hath cauſed greate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in Nauigation, and in other accomptes of Sea cauſes, for when it is ſaied, that from ſuche a headlande, to ſuche a place is ſuche a courſe, or at ſuche a place the Moone vppon ſuche a poincte of the Compaſſe maketh the full Sea, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to bee demaunded, by what Cumpaſſe the obſeruation was made, whereas if the wiers had not been altered from the North poinct of the Flie, (whiche I wiſhe had neuer been any where) theſe doubtes had been auoided.</p>
            <p>It behoueth therefore all men that will make <hi>Hydrogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall diſcriptions</hi> for the vſe of ſaylyng, to haue ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the Cumpas by which their obſeruations are made, and if they collect notes made by ſundry Cumpaſſes of diners ſetts, they ought to reduce all the varieties vnto ſome one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and to giue notice of the ſame, in their platt: And not to make a confuſed mingle mangle by ioyning together all vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of obſeruations, notes and reportes, as the <hi>Portingales</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue done, in compoundyng theſe North parts of the worlde, with their owne diſcoueries, without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diuers ſorts of the ſeuerall cumpaſſes by which thei were made.</p>
            <p>Alſo it importeth all Maiſters, Pilots and others by what name ſo euer that ſhall giue directions in Nauigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to looke circumſpectly to the ſettyng of the wiers of the Cumpas by whiche they ſhall ſayle, that the ſame Cumpas be correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to the lines of the Sea Card that they ſhall vſe: that is to ſay, that it be of the ſame ſet for the Uariation, that the Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas was of, by which the Carde was made.</p>

For where as he pretendeth by it, to giue the eleuation of the Pole and the houre and inſtant of the tyme of the day, by any one obſeruation in any place, beſides that it is of all other that hitherto haue been vſed at Sea, the moſt tedious and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for that purpoſe, it is alſo by reaſon of the variation not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iere falſe and erronious. For, the true meridian which is the grounde of his purpoſe, is as farre to ſeeke as the thyng he promiſeth to giue by the ſame. The like may be ſaid of al other Inſtruments made vpon the ſame ground whether they ſerue for the Sea or Land.</p>
            <p>The ſame Author in the 4. Chapter of his booke, entreting of ſaylyng vpon the poincts of the Cumpas, ſaieth, that in ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling South or North, he ſhall paſſe by the Poles of the world, and keepe vnder one meridian, till he come to the place from whence he firſt departed. And vppon the poincts of Eaſt and Weſt out of the Equinoctiall, he ſhall ſaile vnder a parallell, till he returne to the place from whence he went. But in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
<pb facs="tcp:12722:27"/>
vppon the poinct of Northeaſt, he ſhall deſcribe a ſpirall line inclyning by little and little to wardes the Pole, as in his demonſtration thereof in the ſame Chapter appeareth. But for want of due conſideration of the variation, his rules, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and demonſtrations, and ſuche others hitherto giuen for like purpoſes, are friuolous and falſe.</p>
            <p>For if he direct his ſaylyng by the Cumpas (as of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he muſt, beyng the onely Inſtrument for that purpoſe) it is manifeſt, that whether he ſayle North or South, Eaſt or Weſt, or by what other poinct ſo euer, the Cumpas not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectyng alwaies the Pole of the world, as he ſuppoſeth, but ſome other poinct or poincts diſtant from the ſame, ſhall leade hym accordyngly, whereby he ſhall neither keepe vnder one meridian, nor vnder one parallell of latitude, neither make ſuch a ſpirall line to the Pole of the world, as he demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrateth. His fault in ſettyng downe thoſe rules is ſo muche the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in that he acknowledgeth in the Chapter next before the variation at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> to bee about 9. d. from North to Eaſt accordyng to <hi>Mercators</hi> poſition, of the Magneticall Pole, which he alſo confirmeth by his owne experience.</p>
            <p>But it ſeemeth he hath followed, that excellent Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician <hi>Petrus Nonius,</hi> eſpecially concernyng the ſaylyng vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the poincts of Eaſt and Weſt. For he, in his firſt booke of the rules and Inſtruments of Nauigation, enforceth hym ſelf to proue and demonſtrate, that in ſaylyng Eaſt or Weſt, out of the Equinoctiall, the courſe is performed by peeces of great circles, and yet deſcribeth a parallell. But how that may ſtande with the principles of Geometry, I referre the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the expert Mathematicians, for it is like as a circle ſhould be made of ſtraight lines, which is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>It appeareth in the diſcourſe that he hath made of thoſe matters, that he had not a right iudgement of the nature of the Cumpas in ſaylyng (admitting the ſame to ſhew the Pole without Variation) for if he had, he would neuer haue entred into ſuche a Labyrinth as he did. But he thought it a great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie that the Cumpas in euery Horizon ſhould ſhewe the
<pb facs="tcp:12722:28"/>
meridian and Poles of the world by the poincts of South and North, and by the poincts of Eaſt and Weſt to ſhewe in the Horizon the verticall and Equinoctiall Eaſt and Weſt (being a great circle) and yet in ſaylyng Eaſt or Weſt, except in the Equinoctiall, it ſhould performe but a parallell.</p>
            <p>But it is to be vnderſtood, that albeit the poincts, or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Cumpas doe alwaies in euery Horizon repreſent great circles in the Heauens, the points of South and North the meridian, and the poincts of Eaſt and Weſt the verticall circle of Eaſt and Weſt, eche croſſyng other at right angles, and likewiſe of the other poincts. (The reaſon whereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cumpas lieth euery where leuell with the Horizon, ſo as a perpendicular line deſcendyng from the centre thereof at right angles with the plaine of the ſame, will alwaies fall vpon the centre of the earth, and conſequently be the Semidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of a great circle.) So that where ſo euer the Cumpas be caried, theſe circles are ſuppoſed to be caried about with it, and the view of euery thyng in the Horizon repreſented by the poincts thereof, is likewiſe in great circles: Yet in ſaylyng by the Cumpas, the poincts of South and North onely, deſcribe great circles generally, which are the meridians, &amp; the points of Eaſt and Weſt, deſcribe a great circle in the Equinoctiall onely: in all other places out of the Equinoctiall, they deſcribe but parallells. And the ſaylyng vppon any other poinct of the Cumpas, from any place, deſcribeth a ſpirall line, according to the angle it maketh with the meridian. And hereby in ſaylyng vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poincts of Eaſt or Weſt, out of the Equinoctiall, (the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> North poinct alwaies reſpectyng the Pole) the courſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a parallell, accordyng to the diſtance of the centre of the Cumpas from the Pole. The maner thereof you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by faſtnyng a ſmall threed or Virginall wier at the Pole of a Globe, or centre of a circle, which ſhall repreſent a moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meridian to bee caried about the Globe or circle, and fixe vppon the ſame, a ſmall Flye of a Cumpas, ſo as the line of South and North be anſwerable to the thréed or wier, and the North poinct thereby alwaies reſpect the North Pole: then
<pb facs="tcp:12722:28"/>
in turnyng the threed about the Globe or circle, vpon the Pole or center, if the center of the Flye bee out of the Equinoctiall (between it and the Pole) albeit the points of Eaſt and Weſt croſſyng the ſame line and moneable meridian at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, doe ſhewe the verticall Eaſt and Weſt vpon the Globe, which is a great circle, yet in cariyng the ſame Flye vpon the threed or moueable meridian, about the Pole or center, you ſhall by the center of the ſame Flye, deſcribe but a parallell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the diſtance thereof from the Pole of the Globe, or center of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circle, not vnlike the circular motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Horſe dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng in a mill, who though he looke forth ſtraight in a right line, yet beyng faſtned to the beame of the mill, is forced to make his courſe in a circle, whoſe Semidiameter is the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the beame contayned betweene the Horſe, and the centre of the mill, or miſpoſt.</p>
            <p>And as in the Equinoctiall, the line of South and North in the Cumpas (by ſuppoſition repreſenting the meridian) is parallell to the Axis of the earth (which is the common ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the meridian plaines) and the line of Eaſt and Weſt croſſyng the ſame Axis at right angles, repreſenteth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Eaſt and Weſt, which is the Equinoctiall, imaginyng to deſcende from the centre of the Cumpas a line, to fall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly, and at right angles with the Axis of the worlde (whiche ſhall bee at the centre of the earth) and in ſaylyng Eaſt or Weſt by the Cumpas, the imagined perpendicular line being caried about with the ſame (makyng alwaies right angles with the Axis) ſhal deſcribe the plaine of the Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall equidiſtant from the Poles of the world, and at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with the Axis, and the poinct of the ſame line at the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the Cumpas, the circumference of the Equinoctiall, vppon the ſuperficies of the Sea: So beyng from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall on either ſide, imaginyng the line of South, &amp; North in your Cumpas to repreſent alwaies the Axis of the world, and to lye parallell with it, the line of Eaſt and Weſt moſt croſſe the ſame Axis alwaies, at right angles: and ſuppoſing a line to fall from the centre of your Cumpas to the Axis of
<pb facs="tcp:12722:29"/>
the world, makyng right angles with the ſame Axis. In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng Eaſt or Weſt, that imagined line beeyng caried about with the Cumpas (alwaies at right angles with the Axis) ſhall deſcribe the plaine of a parallell, equidiſtant to the plaine of the Equinoctiall, and the poinct thereof at the centre of the Cumpas, the circumference of the parallell vppon the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Sea: which parallell ſhould be repreſented by the poincts of Eaſt and Weſt of the Cumpas, if the line of South and North of the ſame-were parallell is the Axis of the earth, as was ſuppoſed: but it is not. And therfore as they decline one from the other, ſo doeth the verticall circle of Eaſt and Weſt ſhewed by the Cumpas, decline from the parallel circle euery where.</p>
            <p>The angle of whiche declination, is alwaies equall to the latitude of the place, or diſtance of the parallell from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall.</p>
            <p>But as I haue already ſufficiently declared, the Cumpas ſheweth not alwaies the Pole of the worlde, but varieth from the ſame diuerſly, and in ſayling deſcribeth circles accordyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Whiche thyng if <hi>Petrus Nonius</hi> and the reſt that haue written of Nauigation, had ioyntly conſidered in the tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their rules and Inſtruments, then might they haue been more auaileable to the vſe of Nauigation, but they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuyng the difficultie of the thyng, and that if they had dealt therewith, it would haue vtterly ouerwhelmed their former plauſible conceits, with <hi>Pedro de Medina</hi> (who as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hauyng ſome ſmall ſuſpition of the matter, reaſoneth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clerkly, that it is not neceſſary that ſuch an abſurdity as the Variation, ſhould be admitted in ſuch an excellent art as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation is) they haue all thought beſt to paſſe it ouer with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But I hope ſuche as intende hereafter to write of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation, will either frame their rules, precepts, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with regarde of the Variation, as herein I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, or els eaſe them ſelues of that trauaile, for as good none as vnprofitable.</p>

as the angle of Variation from hence Eaſtwardes in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell of <hi>70. d.</hi> ſhould encreaſe and growe wider, till it came to <hi>81. d. 14.</hi> from North to Eaſt as before. At the Iland <hi>Vaigats</hi> beyng in longitude from <hi>London 58. d.</hi> and in the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell of <hi>70. d.</hi> where, by the Hypotheſis, the variation ſhould be <hi>49. d. 22′.</hi> from North to Eaſt, I finde the Needle to vary <hi>7. d.</hi> from North to Weſt. And the like effect I haue found by diuers obſeruations in ſundry other places of the Eaſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Whiche obſeruations with many more that I haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee made, and dayly procure to be done in diuers other Countries, I reſerue, with intent (if it bee poſſible) to finde ſome Hypotheſis for the ſaluyng of this apparant confuſed ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularitie.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Ratiſbona</hi> or <hi>Regenſburg</hi> in <hi>Bauaria,</hi> beyng in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <hi>48. d. 52′.</hi> and in longitude <hi>36. d. 20′.</hi> where, by the former poſition of the magneticall Pole at <hi>25. d. 44′.</hi> the Variation ſhould be <hi>16. d. 44′.</hi> from North to Eaſt. <hi>Gerardus Mercator</hi> found the ſame to be onely 11.¾. as I gather by his placyng of the magneticall Pole at <hi>16. d. 22′.</hi> from the Pole Artik vpon his obſeruation made at that place: whiche confirmeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde qualitie in the Variation from hence Eaſtwardes, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Whiche ſtraunge varietie, I haue here plainly propoſed, to the ende that the learned ſorte might conſider thereof, and ſharpnyng their wits, ſee what probable cauſes and grounds they can aſſigne for the ſame. For, conſideryng it remayneth alwaies conſtant without alteration in euery ſeuerall place, there is hope it may be reduced into method and rule.</p>
            <p>As for that Weſtwardes, becauſe it carieth proportion, and hath ſome apparant regularitie, I will apply the ſame to the generall commoditie of all ſuche as ſhall trauaile that waies: which if I ſhould here particularly decipher, it would require a volume, whereby (contrary to my firſt intent) I ſhould farre exceede the bounds of an addition, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abridge it to a <hi>Hydrographicall Plat,</hi> wherein all ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and defects as haue been hither to vſed, ſhalbe reformed,
<pb facs="tcp:12722:30"/>
which ſhall be eaſy for the meaneſt capacities to conceiue, and ſerue more effectually in vſe, then if I ſhould haue expreſſed the ſame by multitudes of rules in writyng. Therefore for this matter I referre you to the ſame, the whiche you ſhall looke for very ſhortly.</p>
