         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Moſt Dread Sovereign, and ever
Bleſſed of the Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MAY it ſuffice to ſhew and ſay unto
Your moſt High and Sacred <hi>Majeſty,</hi>
That the Deſign of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College
(which I now, in the demonſtration of it, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and moſt humbly dedicate unto Your
<hi>Majesty</hi>) was firſt of all by Your Royal Grand-Father
King <hi>James</hi> graciouſly and greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded,
whoſe moſt excellent Sagacity ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
underſtood the wiſdom of God in it, gave
thereunto, with his Parliament, it's Feat and
glorious Form. Afterwards it was no leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
off by Your Royal Father of ever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Memory; by Him it was abundantly
Commended, who with great zeal comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:41498:4"/>
his late Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> to promote to
the utmoſt this admired Deſign, and ſpeedily
to put it into all good poſture and Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
And therefore this Plot is of moſt
pretious Concernment in all ſorts of due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences,
for the great and incomparable well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Church of Chriſt: For ſo it was in
the real and tender account of thoſe Noble Sons
of Honour and true prudency of the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of Your Royal Grand-father: which
is therefore above all recommended to Your
Gracious <hi>Majesty,</hi> whom the moſt High and
Holy One hath ſo Miraculouſly Preſerved, ſo
wonderfully and bleſſedly Reſtored, to be in
many things and waies the Repairer of decayed
Perſons and Places. And eſpecially, becauſe
the Caſe and Dignity of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College had a
known and very large intereſt in the pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of Your famous and Glorious Uncle,
Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> which he ſet his heart upon, to get
immortal Honour by his moſt endeared fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Princely reſpects thereunto, ſtudying
with all his power and prudence to advance
this College to be the Pillar, yea, the ſtanding
and living Monument of his flouriſhing Fame
and deſerved Glory. But the Lord made and
<pb facs="tcp:41498:4"/>
found him fully ripe for his Celeſtial Throne;
that he might make Your Bleſſed Father (the
Mirrour of Princes) moſt fit to ſway the Scepter
of theſe Kingdoms, whoſe Princely Affections
and Commands were full of integrity for the
Compleating of this Seat and Nurſe of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Truth. Now, if Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſhall be
pleaſed in regard of this, with the aforeſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
to eſpouſe this College, and to meditate
the perfecting of it, for the moſt Bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
thereof; oh then, how ſhall the Hearts
and Tongues of all Good men (whoſe eyes
behold You as moſt Happy, propenſe, and
Pretious) bleſſe Your Sacred Self, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their delight and moſt holy Prayers in and
for You, that from the firſt entring upon Your
temporal, You readily Contemplate to make
this Your eternal Praiſe and Dignity? The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let Your moſt Admired <hi>Majeſty</hi> humbly be
beſeeched to ſet Your Kingly Countenance on
this Deſign of ſo much weight and worth,
for that the <hi>King of Kings</hi> hath in his amazing
and aſtoniſhing way of never-to-be-forgotten
Mercy, now at length, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
You without Gall (in all gracious Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency)
with an Olive hopefull branch of
<pb facs="tcp:41498:5"/>
long-deſired and bleſſed Peace into the Ark of
our moſt happy Church and State; where, let
the High and Lofty One ever delight in and
over Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> to doe You good, with the
Richeſt and Choiceſt Bleſsings of this and the
next life poured out both into and upon Your
gracious Heart and Head. And the Lord grant
that You may be Crowned with the Glory of a
long, proſperous, and uninterrupted Reign over
us, That holy Truth and Peace being perfected,
You may ſo have the Heavenly and eternal
Kingdom begun in You,</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IF thou ſhalt wonder that a Man ſo near his grave,
and withall ſo far from <hi>Chelſey,</hi> ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to revive and give a Reſurrection to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
ſo long buried in its duſt; let me then aſſure
thee, it is not from any hope or deſire of ſelf-prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this world, being daily about to ſtrike ſaile,
and run my aged, weak, and infirm veſſel into the
harbour of Common (but ſure) Rest. Nor is it
from any Corrupt Principle of vain-Glory and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.
That were to leave my ſpirit in the greateſt
darkneſs, by ſinning against the clear Light of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
taught in the Princely Preacher, <hi>Prov. 25. 27.
For Men to ſearch their own Glory, is no Glory.</hi>
But forasmuch as ſome broken thoughts upon this
Subject had for ſundry years laſt paſt lyen by me,
which were peruſed by ſome of my Judicious Friends
and Faithfull fellow-Labourers in the Goſpel, after a
review, they exhorted me to print my Schedules and
papers in theſe Halcyon-times (and to trust the Lord
with Iſſues, who can make this good work ſo Joyfully
begun, yet to flouriſh for <hi>Sion</hi>'s higher Riſe, and
<hi>Babylon's</hi> deeper Ruine.) Which I have done, not
<pb facs="tcp:41498:6"/>
ſo much in full hope of effecting what I would, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unwilling to refuſe them, and deſirous of making
tryall: for I had rather (as <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> once
ſaid) that Godly and Learned men ſhould find in me
want of Prudence, then accuſe me of Negligence.
Beſides, ſome Worthies having gone before me in this
way, I was thereby further perſwaded to caſt my
Mite into their treaſury, that they might be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
remembred by me, and diligently followed by
others. Again, that which did ſet a little ſharper
Edge on my willingneſs herein was, that I might take
an occaſion to clear the innocency of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Feately,</hi> (the
late Provoſt of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College, and one that is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in his duſt for his known Vertues, eminent Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
abundant Learning, and Labours) ſomewhat
blotted by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fuller</hi>'s pen, proceeding rather (in my
Judgment of Charity) from an Error in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then Will. But that which principally moved
me was, a clear perſwaſion of heart, how much the
perfecting and compleating of this College would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
Glory to God, Honour to the true Religion,
encouragement to Learning and Learned men in every
Age; what invincible help and aſsiſtance it might
afford our Gracious <hi>King</hi> and his Royal Succeſſors
againſt the many ſubtil and unwearied Adverſaries of
Chriſt's Kingdom, Goſpel, Faith, Doctrine, and holy
<pb facs="tcp:41498:6"/>
Diſcipline; lastly, what chearfull and beautifull light
of divine and heavenly knowledge, what ſoul-reviving
and refreſhing ſatisfaction the Lords People in theſe
three Nations (yea, in all the world) continually in
every Age and Condition might receive from the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Diſputations, and Writings of ſuch eminently<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified
Perſons, as ought to have been choſen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

muſt be avoided: I therefore reine in, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring

OF
CHELSEY COLLEGE
REVIVED.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not by any needleſs flouriſh of my own
words begin this Treatiſe of CHELSEY Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
but Firſt, deliver the diſert words of the Act
of Parliament made in the ſeventh year of King
<hi>James</hi> of Bleſſed Memory in the behalf of the
ſame College; as alſo a Declaration publiſhed by Authority in the
year 1616. concerning the Reaſons that moved his Majeſty and
the State to erect the ſame (God aſſiſting me) as I find it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
Collected and extracted to my hand by the Author of the
moſt Remarkable Monuments of <hi>London</hi> and the Precincts
thereof: Then, Secondly, give you Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s Judgement
and Recommendation, with Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> his more ſpecial report of
it; as alſo Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Inſtigation for it, and Grounds of the
Neceſſity of prudent proviſion of Able and adequate Men for
the work: And ſo I ſhall in the Concluſion adde ſomething
concerning Dr. <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> his being the firſt Mover (under God)
to advance the deſign in this beginning of the Embryo that it
now appears in. Thirdly, I ſhall intimate the Obſtructions and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41498:8"/>
Impediments of it: Fourthly, adjoin ſome prevalent Motives
for the Renewing, or rather the reviving of the Deſign to it's
original intended perfection: Fifthly, ſtop the mouth of the
chiefer Objections againſt it: Sixthly, propoſe the means
(though in theſe hard and Exhauſted times) to compleat it:
Laſtly, conclude with prayer for <hi>Grace, Grace unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The Abſtract of the Act runs thus:</p>
            <q>Whereas his Majeſty, of his Royal and zealous Care for the
defence of true Religion now eſtabliſhed within this Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and for the Refuting of Errors and Hereſies repugnant to
the ſame, hath been graciouſly pleaſed by his Letters Patents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to found a College in <hi>Chelſey</hi>
near <hi>London,</hi> and therein to place certain Learned Divines, and to
incorporate the ſame by the Name of the Provoſt and Fellows of
the College of King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Chelſey,</hi> of the foundation of the
ſame <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>England;</hi> and hath of his moſt gracious
Goodneſs and Bounty not only endowed the ſame with certain Lands,
Privileges and Immunities, but hath alſo, for their further Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and ſuſtentation, given unto them a Capacity and Ability
to receive and take from his Majeſty, or any of his Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
any Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments, Gifts, Benefits
and Profits whatſoever, not exceeding in the whole the yearly
value of three thouſand pounds, as in and by the ſaid Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
doth more at large appear: And whereas alſo it is manifeſt
and evident, that the bringing in of ſuch ſtreams of Running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the City of <hi>London</hi> is very convenient, neceſſary and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
as well for the private uſe of ſuch as ſhall rent the ſame,
for the help of cleanſing the ſaid City in the time of ſickneſs, and
preſerving the ſame againſt all ſuddain Adventures of fire, &amp;c.
whereby they had the free Grant of and for draining the field
and Mariſhes between the Bridge called <hi>Lock-bridge</hi> in or near the
pariſh of <hi>Hackney</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the Bridge
called <hi>Bow-bridge</hi> at <hi>Straford-Bow,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Stepney</hi> in
the ſaid County, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Which by reaſon of the Ample Grant, may ſeem to be a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41498:8"/>
Royal Privilege indeed; yet by reaſon of the vaſt Labour and
Coſt, not only of digging and trenching, but of buying leave
of the owners of the grounds, fields and limitations, may ſeem
(with Reverence be it ſpoken, and regard had to Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
not verſed in ſuch Affairs) not only like that in <hi>Holland,</hi>
but ſomewhat reſembling that of <hi>Hercules</hi> his Labour of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<hi>Augeas</hi> his ſtable, wherein 3000 Oxen ſo long were tyed
up, by drawing the River <hi>Alpheus</hi> to run through it. When I
conſider the many Proviſions in that Grant, it appears ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like the Arduouſneſs of their task and undertaking. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
Chriſtian duty ought (eſpecially when back'd with
ſo many advantageous incouragements) to ſwallow up greater
difficulty. It is the moſt holy exhortation Jude 3. <hi>Earneſtly to
contend for the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> And it is the
delight of the Holy One, to behold his enabled Servants ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and labouring to ridd the Land of the immenſe Dunghill of
Errors and Hereſies; which is not for every hand that can make
of Scripture fine Poſies in Preaching, but are too tender to
pluck up or thruſt away <hi>thorns:</hi> this can be done only by <hi>men
fenced with Iron, and the ſtaffe of a ſpeare,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 6, 7. And
this above all is now (if ever) eſpecially to be looked unto,
that the Cauſe of Chriſt be not betrayed and loſt in this Age
abounding with ſo many Anti-Chriſtian deceipts.</p>

deſire, and perfection to this Honourable Deſign.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, It was conſidered, That the Popes Agents travelled Sea
and Land, wrote Books in favour of their Faction, deviſed Lyes
and Slanders to bring Religion and Profeſſors thereof into hatred,
and not ſparing any ſtanding in their way, by falſhood and
Treachery oppugned Kings and Princes that could not endure the
Popes Tyrannical Government: and to this end, men of ready
Wits, good Speech, long Experience and competent Learning, have
been maintained in Colleges, furniſhed with Books, holpen with
Counſell and Direction, bound with Laws and Oaths to uphold
the Papal Hierarchie and Hereſie, and (which moveth moſt with
moſt men) encouraged with great Promiſes and large Rewards:
Whereunto albeit private men, piouſly affected, have from time
to time oppoſed themſelves; yet becauſe they wanted incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to undertake ſo great a labour, Counſels of the Ancients to
direct them, Books and Libraries to inſtruct them, Forms of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
to keep them in compaſs, and Rewards to maintain them,
(thoſe excepted that are due for Eccleſiaſtical Cures) it was
further adviſed, That to make a ſufficient defence for the Truth of
Religion and Honour of the State, and a ſtrong and continued op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
againſt the continued Lyes, Slanders, Errors, Hereſies,
Sects, Idolatries, Blaſphemies of our Adverſaries, that it was
neceſſary to unite our forces, and to appoint ſpecial men that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
other diſtraction might attend the Cauſe of Religion and of the
State; being furniſhed with Directions, Inſtructions, Counſels,
Books, Preſſes, competent Maintenance, and other neceſſaries.</p>
                        <p>This then was the reaſon why this College by his Majeſty and
the State was firſt deſigned, and a Corporation granted, with large
Privileges, viz. That a ſelect number of Divines and others
ſhould be gathered together into one body, and united with one form
of Laws, and there maintained, who being furniſhed with Books,
and directed by men of experience and action, might alwaies be
ready to maintain our Chriſtian Faith, to anſwer the Adverſaries
Calumniations as wel againſt Religion as the State, to defend the
Majeſty of Kings and Princes againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of Popes,
the Liberty of Chriſtians againſt the yoke of Superſtition, to ſupply
the defect of Teaching where Appropriations have devoured Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,

write and publiſh Books for confirming of Erroneous Doctrine
and impugning the Truth, and now of late ſeem more carefull
then before to ſend daily into Our Realms ſuch their Writings,
whereby Our loving Subjects, though otherwiſe wel-diſpoſed, may
be ſeduced, unleſs ſome remedie thereof ſhould be provided: We,
by the advice of Our Councel, have lately granted a Corporation,

learned Divines to be imployed to write (as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire)

            <p>The like Letters are written to my Lord Chancellor, and
my Lord Maior of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that by this that has been ſaid it muſt manifeſtly appear,
that <hi>Chelſey</hi> College has not only King <hi>James</hi> his Majeſties and
his firſt full Parliament's and Convocation's (the intire repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
body, with the Head of Church and State) but that
of the prime Powers and Prudencies of both of them, the
Archbiſhops, the Chancellour, and the Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi>
the acclamation of their Energetical Prudence and Zeale.</p>
            <p>By theſe Letters it may appear that this College is not an idle
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41498:10"/>
Project merely of any private man, but a moſt Pious Work,
projected, or rather approved and applauded, by the King and
State (for Dr <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> muſt have the eternal Honour, in that
his moſt pious and ſedulous wiſdome moved the firſt ſtone, as
from God, about it;) and that all that profeſs Religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the continuance and advancement thereof, yea, all that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
his Majeſty, and wiſh the proſperity of the State, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the increaſe of Learning, have Intereſt therein, and I hope
ſhall receive comfort, content and good ſatisfaction by the ſame,
if they put their hands and hearts unto it.</p>
            <p>Being then ſuch a work of Piety, for the maintenance of true
Religion, who can be accounted truly Pious and Religious, and
yet yield no help to advance it? Being a Project to maintain the
honour of the State, what good Subject will not contribute to
ſet forward this Project? But to touch only the point of Gods
Honour,<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 9.</note> let us remember the words of the Wiſe man, <hi>Honour
the Lord with thy ſubſtance:</hi> let us alſo conſider what the Lord
himſelf ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they
that deſpiſe me, ſhall be deſpiſed.</hi> Now who can ſay that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth
God, that ſuffereth him by Idolatry, Superſtition, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
to be diſhonoured, and will give nothing to ſuppreſs
<hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts, but is content that the Pope be worſhipped like
the Idol <hi>Bel?</hi> Can God's Honour ſtand with the Superſtition,
Hereſie, Idolatry and Blaſphemy of Papiſts, and the Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Atheiſts? It is not ſufficient for true Chriſtians to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
true Religion, but they muſt with zeal maintain it, and
with heart abhor, and with hand ſuppreſs Idolatry and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Who will riſe up with me againſt the wicked?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>An odious thing alſo it is either to ſuffer Truth to be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
or Lyes to be received. St.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>in his Epiſtle</hi> ad Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanum,
<hi>ſaith, it is a foul Fault to hide Truth, as well as to tell
Lyes:</hi>

him to be a traitor to Truth, that dares not boldly utter it, to

No more agreement may we have, who are temples of the
Living God, with Idols. There is great oppoſition between
Righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs, greater between Light
and darkneſs, greateſt of all between Chriſt and <hi>Belial.</hi>
Righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs, the one being a Vertue
and the other a Vice, are oppoſed contrarily; but Light and
darkneſs privatively, which is a greater oppoſition: but Chriſt
and <hi>Belial</hi> contradictorily, which is the greateſt of all. Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and unrighteouſneſs ſo oppoſite, as that they cannot
ſubſiſt in the ſame Soul; Light and darkneſs ſo oppoſite, as
that they cannot ſubſiſt in the ſame room; Chriſt and <hi>Belial</hi>
ſo oppoſite, as that they cannot ſubſiſt in the ſame heaven.

no ſodering of Religion; no pulling of <hi>Rome</hi> to Proteſtancy,

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41498:11"/>

The Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> was reproved for ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them that taught the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the Biſhop

the <hi>Romiſh Balaamites,</hi> the falſe Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> (maintained by
the <hi>Romiſh Jezabel</hi> and her Conſorts) to ſeduce God's people?
The falſe Prieſts of <hi>Bel</hi> uſed all Arts and cunning practices to
deceive, and now will not ſuffer any Religion but that of their
God <hi>Bel,</hi> the Pope. And ſhall not true Chriſtians uſe equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence

ſaving Truth, and ſuppreſs Popery, and all other Idolatrous and
falſe Religions? <hi>Ingemui (fateor</hi>) (ſaith <hi>Hierome) minus nobis

cupiditas ad inculcandum mendacium.</hi> I ſighed (ſaith he)
ſeeing leſs deſire in us to defend Truth, then in our Adverſaries
to maintain Lies. Are not here motives of moment enough to
be mighty with any that have any true tender Conſcience, more
then to perſwade them, even to make them zealous after the
Work? Yet there is added more yet moving ones, as followeth.</p>
            <p>The College being erected then for the maintenance of Truth
and God's true Service, and for a reſolute oppoſition againſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and falſe worſhip of God, it cannot but pleaſe God and
content godly men, if it be help'd onward. The ſame alſo will
be a means to increaſe Learning, and prevent the dangers of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
haunted with the ſpirits of Antichriſt, the Jeſuits and Maſs-Prieſts;
and therefore cannot chuſe but be well accepted of all
that either deſire a learned Miniſtry, or love Learning. Finally,
ſeeing the Church hath received no greater diſhonour by any
then by inſufficient and unlearned Church-men; I hope this
may be a means to recover ſome part of their loſt Honour.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, whether we regard the Service of God, or the
Honour we owe unto the <hi>King,</hi> or the love we bear unto our
Country and State, and above all, that which <hi>omnes omnium
complectitur charitates,</hi> the Piety to our Church, let us not ſhew
our ſelves ſparing and backward in yielding our aid to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
a Work ſo religious and profitable for the Church, ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
for the State, ſo neceſſary in regard of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

Malice, and the defects and diſcouragement of our own
Forces. Other Collections have been either for private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or Strangers, or places remote, or matters concerning
ſome particular occaſions: This concerns a general good, and
toucheth every man both in Honour and Conſcience. Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have endeavoured to maintain Religion, and favour
others abroad: let us not therefore now neglect our ſelves, and
our own honour and profit and neceſſary ſervice at home.
Neither let any man think it ſtrange, that a work of ſuch great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhould be advanced by this weak means; or that a Project
ſo neceſſary ſhould proceed ſo ſlowly. Almighty God, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
ſufficient, yet would have his own Tabernacle built by the
voluntary Offerings of his own people. <hi>Speak</hi> (ſaith he to
<hi>Moſes</hi> Exod. 25. 1, 2, &amp;c.) <hi>to the children of Iſrael, that they
bring me an offering of every man, whoſe heart giveth it freely:</hi>
and Exod. 36. 3. there it followeth, <hi>they brought</hi> ſtill <hi>unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
free gifts every morning,</hi> and they ceaſed not till they were
ſtayed from offering. King <hi>Solomon</hi> likewiſe was greatly hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the building of the Temple by the contribution of his
Subjects, as appeareth by the words of Scripture, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.
6, 7. Further, by voluntary Offerings and Contributions the
Temple was repaired by <hi>Joaſh, 2 Kings</hi> 12. and by <hi>Joſiah
2 Chron.</hi> 34. And this has been the uſe and practice of ancient
times, in building and endowing moſt famous Churches, Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Schools, and other monuments of Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
both in our own and other Countries. Our Adverſaries
by this courſe have had means to build many Monaſteries, Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Schools, for their <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and Friers, as propugnacles
of Superſtition, Hereſie and Idolatry, and Antichriſt his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to uphold and make good their own Corruptions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Uſurpations upon the Magiſtrates Government, and
every Chriſtian mans Liberty. And this have they done not
only in <hi>Europe,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>Indies;</hi> and not only one in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Kingdom, but in ſome States divers, and almoſt in every
City one. And ſhall not our flouriſhing Kingdom build and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
one College for the maintenance of God's true Service, and
the Honour of the whole State? It were a diſhonour to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the whole Church and State, to think the contrary.</p>

               </hi>'s Arke, God's Tabernacle and Temple, and famous
Schools and Colleges, albeit founded by Kings and great men,
were long in building: and do we wonder that this College is
not yet finiſhed? Further, it pleaſed God to deprive us of
Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> our principal hope, and the chief Author of this
Deſigne. Laſtly, who knoweth whether God hath appointed
theſe weak Means to ſet forward a great Work, that his Power
in our Weakneſs might have the whole Glory?</p>
            <p>Let us therefore (good Brethren and Country-men, yea
Chriſtians) hearken willingly to his Majeſties motion, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
follow his Example: Let it appear by our Bounty, how
bleſſedly zealous we are to maintain the everlaſting Truth, and
to root out Error and Idolatry: Let us by effects declare how
ſtudious we are to doe good works, and to advance God's and
our Churches honour. They that have much may give of their
abundance; the reſt, according to the meaſure of their means:
God as well accepteth of the widows mite and poor mans
good will, as of the rich mans treaſure.</p>
            <p>If we honour God with our ſubſtance, he will honour us,
and increaſe our ſubſtance: if we build an houſe for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of his Truth, that it may continue in our Poſterity, God
will build us an houſe, reſtore it to us, and double it to our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.

Temple, <hi>in Honour and Riches paſſed all other Kings,</hi> 1 Kings
3. 13. How can we excuſe our ſelves at the laſt day, if we now
deny God a ſmall Offering, who daily offereth unto us many
Graces, and giveth to us all good things that we poſſeſs? Pſal.
68. 9, 10. Yea, our ſouls are a ſacrifice due unto him, 1 Cor.
6. 20. and Rom. 12. 1. And then much more our external
things. And therefore no Chriſtian may deny to him an offering
out of his wordly goods, if God's ſervice (for God's members
and Church) require it. That in 1 Theſ. 5. 23. and, indeed,
whatſoever it is that we have, more or leſs, is God's; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
we give, we give unto God but of his own, which he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41498:13"/>
hath firſt given unto us, 1 Chron. 29. 14. For <hi>all that is in heaven
and earth is his.</hi> For <hi>the Lords is the Kingdome, and he is to be
exalted as head above all. Both riches and honour come of him,
and he reigneth over all, and in his hand is power and might, and
in his hand it is to make great and to give ſtrength unto all,</hi> 1 Chron.

            <p>As for thoſe that draw back in this his Service, and refuſe to
concur in promoting God's Honour, let them marke the words
of our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 12. 30. He that is not with me is againſt
me:</hi> and the Curſe of the Angel on the people of <hi>Meroz,
Curſe ye Meroz (ſaith the Angel) for they came not up to help

            </p>
            <p>But we hope we ſhall not need many more words, to move
them that are (already) ſo well perſwaded, nor perſwade men
that in Religion and Devotion are ſo forward, who know and
take to heart that ſevere increpation of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 32,

            <p>It is the duty of good Chriſtians to advance God's Honour,
and repreſs Superſtition, Hereſie, Idolatry, Blaſphemy. It is
the office of good Subjects to defend the Honour of the State
againſt the Sycophancies of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fugitives, and the ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of foreign Enemies their adherents. The Adverſaries
uſing all their skill, and joyning their forces againſt Religion and
the State; it behoveth us likewiſe to unite our forces, and to
joyn in Confultation how to reſiſt them. This Common buſineſs
requireth Common help; the practice of our Adverſaries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
us to uſe ſpeed; and there is too much precious time alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
let run in waſte, almoſt, if not altogether, or more then full
forty years, from the firſt Commencement. And ſince the
Work has been let lye abſolutely dormant, if not dead, what
tares of Hereſies of all ſorts has the Vigilant and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
envious man ſown and fomented, as in the field of the
ſluggard? ſo as there is nothing appearing but Camelions of
monſtrous uncouth Errors.</p>
            <p>The Quality of the work, being for the defence of true
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41498:13"/>
[pure] Religion, and the State, will move any (whoſe heart
is not hardned and leavened in errors) chearfully to give: For
whoſoever ſhall give, ſhall receive of God a full reward in this
Life, and when they dye, their works ſhall follow them; and
then whatſoever they have ſown in righteouſneſs on earth,
that ſhall they reap in heaven in mercy; whatſoever they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

            <p>Wherefore recommending the College of <hi>Chelſey</hi> to every

them, but only deſire them, in the words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the excellency of this good deed, in advancing and laying
out themſelves, to advance this College; <hi>Whatſoever things are
true, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are honeſt, and
lovely, and of good report; If there be any vertue, any praiſe,
think upon theſe things,</hi> Phil. 4. 8.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for ſatisfaction of thoſe that deſire to know why this
College is erected at <hi>Chelſey,</hi> and not in one of the Univerſities,
this we thought fit to add; That this place was thought fitteſt
to receive directions from our Superiours, to conſult with men
of beſt experience, to obtain intelligence from foreigne parts,
to print books and to diſperſe them, and laſtly, to obtain the
favour of the State and City. Farther, hereby as all emulation
may be avoided, ſo the help of both the Univerſities may as
well be had by intercourſe, as if the College ſtood in either of
the Univerſities. Thus all things now ſtand, God bleſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
of this College, &amp;c. and give Grace, Grace unto it.</p>
            <p>Thus have you (by the Author of the remarkable Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

gather from the latter words of his <hi>goads,</hi> of his <hi>wiſe words,</hi>
where he ſaith, that the reaſon of this College it's fitneſs to be
more reſpectively at <hi>Chelſey,</hi> is <hi>becauſe of receiving directions
from our Superiours.</hi> In which exhortation, even in the whole
carriage of it, I appeale unto the Godlieſt Judgements, whether

an Angel of God; ſo that now, <hi>nihil ſupra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet to him let me joyn or adde another Angel of our

of <hi>Exceter,</hi> afterwards of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who, upon this Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College, may well come after and ſecond the
buſineſs, as <hi>Nathan</hi> after <hi>Bathſheba;</hi> who in his <hi>Peace-maker</hi>
(wherein he moſt truly ſaith, one of the principal means
of Peace-making in the Church and State for ever is, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
ſilencing of Schiſmaticks and Hereſies) is pleaſed in his
prudence to ſhew and ſay, and ſet down at full his Judgement
of this <hi>Chelſey</hi> College, ſuppoſitively, if promoted and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and ſo according to the end proſecuted and adorned, as
to be the undoubted and bleſſed means both to purifie Truth,
and to ſet up Peace for ever; not Peace alone without Truth,
nor Truth alone without Peace, but both Peace and Truth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the two Chapiters upon <hi>Solomon</hi>'s two pillars with
their carved works, called <hi>Jachim</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> that <hi>Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and this <hi>Strength,</hi> 1 Kings 7. 21. For the moſt reverend
Biſhop and Father in God, (as I muſt ever in honour mention
him) in that precious piece of his <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> (for which he
muſt of future Generations be bleſſed) O that he had not had
the fate of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> to propheſie truth, but not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and obeyed! For upon rich grounds, his divinely-illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
heart, foreſeeing the Calamities which turbulent ſpirits
in malecontents would bring by ſtorm, through Civil Warrs
and inteſtine Contentions, bethought himſelf (as a true <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi>)
of this Remedy, ſhewed to K. <hi>James</hi> and to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(whilſt God's Good Spirit was with them and in them,
and before he ſuffered the Evil ſpirit, the foul and Rebellious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41498:14"/>
ſpirit, to poſſeſs the hearts of <hi>Belials,</hi> to open the poſtern to
act his horrid deeds of darkneſs.) He foreſeeing (I ſay) yea
preſuming, that if the deſign of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
into a forwardneſs, and faithfully effected, ſo as to have
made choice of and placed theſe 20 Colleagues, with two Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
ſworn to defend the publick profeſſed Truth of our
Church, according to the Articles, they might have effected ſo
much by their wiſdome, as with a <hi>Caduceus</hi> to have ſtilled the
furious ſpirits of very many bad ones, and ſo charmed them
to have worſhipped the bleſſed Peace of God, and ſo prevented
a world of Blood, Miſchief and Confuſion and Miſery, and ſtill
peſtilent Conſpiracies, to ſouls as well as bodies on all ſides,
that we might have enjoyed to this day the bleſſed of the Lord,
and ſo only have fed and feaſted with the banquet of the Peace
of the kingdom of God in our Conſciences, and they have had
all their Donatives and Honours bleſſed unto them: The Biſhop
repreſenteth his Judgement (reſpectively about <hi>Chelſey</hi> College)
thus.</p>
            <p>It is Great pitty (ſaith he) that the late <hi>Chelſeyan</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
was ſuffered ſo foully to fall to the ground; whereof had
not the Judicious <hi>King</hi> ſeen that great uſe might have been
made of it, he had not condeſcended to ſo gracious Privileges
as his Majeſty was pleaſed to inrich it withall.</p>
            <p>The wiſe and Learned <hi>Prince</hi> well obſerved how great an
advantage our Adverſaries have of us in this kind, who come
with conjoined forces (on every ſide being ready to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent
upon us with preparations, as flood-gates ſet open and
inlarged) whilſt we ſtand upon ſingle reſiſtance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
without a marvellous providence of Almighty God,
we might have verified the old word, <hi>Dum ſinguli pugnant,
univerſi vincuntur.</hi> Bleſſed be God, the world hath had
ample proof of ſingle (yet ſingularly) learned Champions,
and ſeen and heard ſuch learned Advocates to plead for the
Proteſtant Profeſſion, ſuch <hi>Stephens,</hi> ſuch <hi>Jewells,</hi> ſuch <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi>
ſuch <hi>Fields, Whites, Abbotts, Reynolds, Featlyes;</hi> who
(that is <hi>Featly</hi> eſpecially) alone, as in ſingle duell, incountred
abroad in <hi>France,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

honoribus:</hi> as alſo Univerſity Profeſſors, <hi>Peter Martyr,
Holland, Prideaux, Whitakers, Collins;</hi> ſo as one has been able,
in Spiritual Polemicks, to reſiſt a thouſand.</p>
            <p>But if theſe heads and hands have been ſo powerfull, what
would they have done if united together? <hi>Ne Hercules
contra eorum Duos.</hi> Certainly none of theſe upſtarts, perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
prodigious late Hereſies, would have ſtood before
them, [For the Aſſociating Divines of the Province of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
in their teſtimony to the Truth of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in detecting and
deteſting the Errors and Hereſies, have given them their deadly
wound] nor have breathed ſo long under their hands, to
have brought ſuch Diſturbances [yea ſuch Diſtractions,
Schiſms, Factions, Diviſions, as of late we have ſeen to have crept
in, with their infeſtings amongſt us, and to be lamented, if not
poſſible by ſingle hands to be amoliated, making our preſent
<hi>England</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Scene of new Heretical ſwarming Monſters,
threatning an helliſh <hi>Chaos</hi> of Libertiniſme, Licentiouſneſs, &amp;c.
But yet (if <hi>Chelſey</hi> College find favour) I hope that <hi>Rome</hi>'s
word of hope, for all their inſulting, may never be found to be
verified upon us: <hi>I will ſet (and men ſhall ſee it) the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians
againſt the Egyptians;</hi> that is (ſay they) the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> againſt the <hi>Calviniſts;</hi>
as Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> reports it, and <hi>Breerly</hi> has ſeemed to have
done it; as Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> (I ſay) in his <hi>Catholick Appeale</hi> to
<hi>Breerly</hi> the Prieſt in his <hi>Proteſtants Plea.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But if we may not be ſo happy to ſee ſuch a ſure eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Preſervation of holy Truth and Peace, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 16, 19.
(as our <hi>Palladium,</hi> or holy Arke, which will keep us ſafe unto
Salvation, ſo long as we keep it) it will be requiſite yet, that
order be taken, that none may be allowed to enter into the
liſts to maintain the Combat with Heretical ſeducers, but thoſe
who (upon egregious experiment) are approved Champions.
For certainly there cannot be a greater advantage to prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Error, then a weak oppugnation. I remember S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
profeſſes in his <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> this was it that heartned
him, that he met with feeble Opponents, and ſuch as his nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wit was able eaſily to overturn. When therefore any
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41498:15"/>
overbold Champion ſhall ſtep forth, and caſt down his Gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
in defiance of Truth, it is fit that he be incountred with
an Aſſailant that hath brawn in his Arms and marrow in his
bones; [and holy ſpirit in his head and heart] not with ſome
weak and wearyiſh Combatant, whoſe heart may be, as
his hand is, feeble, and ſo may rather betray the better
Cauſe with an imprudent and impotent managing.</p>
            <p>Now this ſtrong plea for <hi>Chelſey</hi> College thus far having ſo
much Sanctuary-weight in it and witneſs for it, I need not adde
any graine more to it, for it will hold certainly currant in the
ballance of ſanctified Judgment, ſo that it will be vanity to
draw a line after <hi>Protogenes.</hi> But yet further, for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
your Judgments and the attracting of your Affections,

of books to that purpoſe [as a well-furniſhed Armory] where
learned Divines ſhould ſtudy, and write in maintenance of all
Controverſies againſt the Papiſts [the grand Wolves, and

the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in this may riſe up and condemn thoſe of

men for any ſervile work in building the Temple, whereof
the text aſſigneth the reaſon, <hi>For they were men of war:</hi>
ſo the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church does not burden their Profeſſors with
Preaching, or any Parochial incumbrances, but reſerves them
only for Polemical exerciſes and ſtudies; whereas in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
the ſame man Reads, Preaches, Catechiſes, Diſputes,

truth on our ſide, it were (in humane probability) impoſſible

               <p>Loe here (ſaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Fuller</hi>) none who were actual Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
were capable of places in this College, and when ſome
of theſe were advanced to Biſhopricks [as Deane <hi>Morton</hi>
and Doctor <hi>Abbott</hi>] and others tranſlated to heaven, King
<hi>James,</hi> by his new Letters patents 1622. <hi>November</hi> 2 ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted

others in their places.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And yet ſince ſuch Rapine, and
Sacrilegious ſale of Biſhops Revenues has of late been made, ſo as
that they are rather Titular then Real Biſhops; this College (if
Biſhops in true Chriſtian high magnanimity will ſubmit their
necks to this yoak of Chriſt, and what can be more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
may beſt fit and be ordained for ſuch a Patriarchy of
Biſhops, as a <hi>Jericho,</hi> till their beards be grown, and their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be repaired. For <hi>Jericho</hi> was not only the City of Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,
but the City, and the great School, yea the College, of,
and for Prophets; whereof the two great Prophets (that were
in their time called the <hi>Chariots and horſe men of Iſrael</hi>) were
the heads, having younger Prophets under them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 38.
O that by their ſuperintending in this School, they might
ſhew againſt <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prophets the ſpirit of <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi>
doubled upon them! In which College of <hi>Iericho Eliſha</hi> ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Eliah,</hi> as Father of the ſonnes of the Prophets; healing both
their City fountain, and their College common Pot of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
pottage, and multiplying the loaves of barley. So theſe
Prophets are fitteſt to heal the Pot of Proteſtants, which is ſo
poiſoned with the <hi>Coloquintida</hi> of the Popiſh wild gourds of
Traditions, Falſhoods, and corrupting of Scriptures, that there
may be no more evil in them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 41.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Now to theſe, for the building of their College and their
Manſion (as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Fuller</hi> ſaith) <hi>K. James</hi> gave all the Timber
requiſite thereunto, which was to be fetched out of <hi>Windſor</hi>
Forreſt. And that long range which alone is extant, ſcarce
finiſhed at this day, yet thus the College made, not of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
but of free timber, coſt (O the dearneſs of College
and Church work!) full three thouſand pounds. But (alas!)
what is this piece? not an eighth part to a double Quadrant,
beſides wings on each ſide, as it was intended. If the Ancient
Fathers, which remembred the magnificence of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s,
wept at the meanneſs of the ſecond Temple; ſuch muſt needs
be ſad who conſider the diſproportion betwixt what was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and what was projected in and about this College
[as in the Synopſis of the Model in the Frontiſpice may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Save that (I confeſs) the deſtruction of beautifull
buildings once really extant, leaves greater impreſſions in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41498:17"/>
mens mindes, then the miſcarriages of only intentional ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and the faint <hi>Ideas</hi> of ſuch future things as are ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propounded, but fail to be effected.</p>
               <p>But this College when once the Act was made for it, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
thereof, His Majeſty Incorporated the ſaid Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the name of <hi>King James his College in Chelſey;</hi> and
beſtowed upon the ſame by Letters Patents, the Reverſion of
good Land in <hi>Chelſey,</hi> (then in poſſeſſion of <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of

hence:)</p>
            </q>
            <p>and alſo his Majeſty was pleaſed further to grant his
Letters Patents for a general Collection all over <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Wales,</hi> of the free benevolence of the willing people, and the
Biſhops were carefully to urge it: ſo that to go on with, much
monies were gathered; but (ſaies D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fuller</hi>) it was kept in
ſome pockets, and withall wiſheth (as well he might) that
thoſe pockets which yielded not the monies to the right uſe,
might rot, and be broken baggs.</p>
            <p>Something I have ſaid before of King <hi>James</hi> his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,

nor Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> did part with it. A bountifull benefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 
and the greater, becauſe the Doctor had a daughter,
and ſhe children of her own. And although this endowment
would ſcarce make the Pot of the ſons of the Prophets to
ſeeth; yet what Feaſts would it have made in his private
family, if continued therein? Seeing therefore ſo publick a

Doctor was deſerted, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>-like, ingaged in the front, to

which he incountred [or rather took truce with] in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
whilſt ſuch men as were to be the wings retreated from
him, not ſeaſonably ſuccouring and ſeconding him in this
Action, to face the Enemy; which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> the firſt mover
of the firſt fundamental ſtone of this buſineſs, and (as far
as in him lay) the Promoter of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College, was in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to doe.</p>
            </q>
            <p>It may well therefore be ſaid of him, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
There was no man like-minded, who did naturally care
for the College, or for the Cauſe of Chriſt and of his Church, as
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> did, in that vigorouſneſs of ſpirit, and energy of
zeale, and that erogation of large and wiſe charity, to his
power. For all men ſeek, and hugge their own Ape-Cubbs,
their own things, the Minervals and reaches of their own
braines; and not the Man-child of their labouring Mother the
Church, which myſtically is Chriſt and his Cauſe, Rev. 12. 3.
the Child of God, whom the dragon waites even in the
birth to devour, who yet is to <hi>rule all Nations with a rod of
Iron,</hi> and who is <hi>caught up to God,</hi> ver. 5. to his Throne.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Chelſey</hi> College Project, howſoever maligned and
obſtructed in the birth thus long and ſtrongly, (as the beginning
of the building of the ſecond Temple was for 40 years, from
the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the ſecond year of <hi>Darius, Ezra</hi> 4. 24.)
yet though it hath by the negligence of our ſide, and the Policy
and malignancy of the other ſide, been thus treacherouſly impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41498:18"/>
and oppugned, we may not think but in it ſelf, and in the
approvement and purpoſe of God, it is moſt honourable, and
to be advanced in the Lords ſeaſon, and by the men whom he
has ordained and ſanctified: and why not at this ſhining inſtant
(by raiſing up the ſpirits of the Prophets in the Convocation to
ſpeak for it, and by propheſying to promote it?) that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
Adornation may be as <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels fighting
with the Dragon and his Angels, til the Dragon not prevailing,
his place may be no more found in the Heaven of our Church,
but he be utterly for ever caſt out of it.</p>
            <p>Which Impediments and Obſtructions, though they have
tended almoſt unto deſtruction (as the Enemies applaud and
hugge themſelves, ſaying, Have not our foxes, going up with
ſecret and ſubtile Policies and underminings, broken down
their ſtone wall? <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4. 3.) yet we muſt and do ſay, as the
Church in the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi>'s time, yea the College of this
our Church may ſay, <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine Enemy:
though I am let and left to fall, I ſhall ariſe; though I ſit in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and in darkneſs, the Lord ſhall be a light unto me,</hi> &amp;c. Micah
7. 8, 9, 10, 11. And <hi>England</hi> might goe on and ſay, in her late
long ſuffering, becauſe of our late long ſinning, and our long
not perfecting our General Repentance, <hi>I will bear the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him; untill
he plead my Cauſe, and execute Judgement for me. He will
bring me forth to his light, and I ſhall behold his Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here is yet the great wonder unto many Godly mens
hearts, that ſuch a gracious work, in all likelyhood and great
probability, of God, and alſo according to the moſt holy
way of his Wiſdom, ſo wiſely commenced by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
and promoted by King <hi>James</hi> and his Parliament, ſo far
proceeded in and to ſuch a meaſure, in building and endowing,
having by King <hi>James</hi> his Letters Patents ſo much and ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
ſo far and fairly advanced, ſhould yet at length, after
ſo long expectation, be let fall, and ſinke, and dye, and lye in
it's foundation: What might be the cauſe of ſo great a Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity?
to doe, what <hi>Ithacus velit,</hi> what the <hi>Roman</hi> Adverſary
would have to be done, and that without him, yea and for
him too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41498:18"/>
Let me here give you the Impediments, firſt in the diſcerning
and diſcreetneſs of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fuller,</hi> who has gathered and expreſſed
the Obſtructions, not only in oppreſſing the College by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
Lord <hi>Mounſon,</hi> but even in the ſuppreſſing it, unto deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs
of never any more emerging or reſurrection, in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Judgment, unleſs the Lord, who does great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things alone, does give it a joyfull reſurrection. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may you receive them in his own more prudent words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Firſt, the decay of the College (ſaith he) is aſcribed to the
large, looſe, and lax nature of it; no one prime perſon (<hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe</hi>
excepted, whoſe ſhoulder ſunk under the weight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
zealouſly ingaging therein: King <hi>James</hi> his maintenance
making, or amounting but to little more then Countenance
of the work. Thoſe children will have but thin chapps and
lean cheeks, who have every body (and yet no body) nurſes
unto them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Decay of the College is to be aſcribed to
the original means of the College, principally founded on
the fluid and inconſtant means (Element unſtable as water)
the Rent of a new River (when made) which at the beſt
(thus imployed) was beheld but as a religious Monopoly.
And ſeeing that deſign took no effect (though afterward
in another Notion and nature it was perfected) no wonder
if the College ſank with the means thereof. For this firſt
tender and plot for the College profit was cut off by another
allowance of <hi>Middleton</hi>'s plot, of bringing water actually from
<hi>Ware</hi> to <hi>Iſlington,</hi> to be conveyed to Pipe through every
ſtreet in <hi>London.</hi> And now,
<q>
                     <l>—Quis virtutem amplectitur ipſam,</l>
                     <l>Praemia ſi digna juſta negentur ei?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſome of the greateſt Prelates (how much ſelf-ingroſſing
is there in all men?) though ſeemingly forward,
yet really remiſs, in the matter: ſuppoſing thoſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſial
Divines would be looked upon as the principal Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
of Religion, or more ſerviceable in the Church then
themſelves, and haply might therefore acquire Privileges
prejudicial to their Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41498:19"/>
Fourthly, the Jealouſies of the Univerſities, beholding this
deſign with ſuſpicious eyes, as which in proceſs of time might
prove detrimental unto them too.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the ſuſpicion of ſome Patriots and Commons in
Parliament too, ſuch as carried the keys of Countrey-mens
Coffers under their girdles (may I ſafely report what I heard
from no mean mouths) that this College would be too much
<hi>Courtier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and that the Divinity (but eſpecially the Hiſtory)
of it would <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, propend too much in favour of King
<hi>James,</hi> and report all things to the diſadvantage of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
wherefore though the ſaid Patriots in Parliament
countenanced the Act, (as counting it no Policy publickly to
croſs the Project of the then King <hi>James</hi>) yet when retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
home, by their ſuſpicious <hi>Items</hi> and private inſtructions,
they beat off and retarded the peoples Charities thereunto.
The ſame conceived this Foundation ſuperfluous, to keep men
to confute Popiſh Opinions by writings, whilſt the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of them were every where connived at and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and the penal laws not put in any effectual execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, its being begun in a bad time, when the world
ſwarmed with a world of prowling Projectors and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Courtiers, contriving all waies to get Monies We know,
that even honeſt perſons (if ſtrangers and caſually coming
along in the company of thoſe that are bad) contract a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of guilt to themſelves, in the opinions of thoſe to
whom they are unknown. And it was the unhappineſs of this
innocent College, yea the uſefull good deſign of it, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in a time when ſo many Monopolies were on foot.</p>
            </q>
            <p>But was not Chriſt himſelf prejudiced for being with Publicans?
So ſad a thing it is, not to diſcern things that are excellent, and
to diſtinguiſh the Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>To all this, ſeventhly, may be added the Papiſts their conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up again their Project for Toleration (by their great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Patrons, eſpecially <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> ſo
mainly for the bringing of that <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe) to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to be ſtationary amongſt us, partly becauſe <hi>Chelſey</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
was not advanced, (but rather kept under Hatches, for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41498:19"/>
               <hi>Non progredi eſt regredi</hi>) and partly becauſe of King <hi>James</hi> his
Age, and Fears, which then were moſt awakened and revived
in him, and inhaunced, and meeting him in every way, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
12. 5. yea more created; and partly becauſe of the Popiſh
Intereſt which was got on high, near at him, re-inforcing their
Petition for Toleration ſo far as that (in effect) it was ſaid,
The King is not he that can deny you any thing. And
this was about the year 1623. immediately after the diſmal
downfall of the Aſſembly of Papiſts and <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> where
almoſt 300 of them periſhed ſuddainly in the Pit. King <hi>James</hi>
was not long after again ſolicited ſo ſtrongly as he was on the
point of inclining, or (as I may ſay rather) of ſeeming to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
(as wiſe Kings many times, <hi>Jehu</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who
ſucceeded <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> being Preſident.) Partly
therefore to be ridd of tedious importunities, and partly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
which of his ſervants in weighty and right Religious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire
were truly faithfull and conſtant, he began to ſeem
only (I ſay) ſo far to take the Sticklers Reaſons into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to ſuffer a Propoſition at length for a Toleration of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
(that Religion which yet before he had been ſo long
and ſtrong againſt, and in his ſoul abhorrent from) by the
Chancellor, on a Sunday, to be made at the Councel-Table.</p>
            <p>But God ſtirred up, and was with the ſpirit of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>G. Abbott</hi>) our of great dislike, as
became him, though with hazard of his high Favour, to ſpeak
againſt the <hi>Toleration,</hi> and not a little charge the Chancellor
for it; and though his Majeſty himſelf came to the Councel-Table
that or the next day, expreſſing ſome ſeeming high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
the Archbiſhop, like a true Father of the Church
and Maſter in the Place, vented his mind upon the Keeper in
a ſharp reprehenſion of his Error, that ſuited his Conſcience
to the time. But the Propoſition the Archbiſhop abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
and deſired the reſt of the Lords to ſecond him; of whom
there were ſo many for him as made this Reſolution, and ſo it
was laid aſide. The King underſtanding ſoon what was paſt at the
Councel-Table, came in himſelf, and expreſſed ſome diſcontent,
&amp;c. The Archbiſhop maintained the fidelity of his Judgement,
humbling himſelf at his Majeſties feet, and ſeeking to qualify
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41498:20"/>
him with an Oration. Firſt, he acknowledged the Honours he
had received of the King, which he laid down at his Majeſties
feet, remonſtrating the affections he had ſerved him with, &amp;c.
The Iſſue whereof was, that all the Kings great heat of Anger
was by meanes thereof allayed and appeaſed.
<q>Ille regit dictis animum, &amp; pectora mulcet.</q>
And in his inward ſecret affections he was altogether plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
which the Archbiſhop afterwards found, in that, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
after the fatal unhappy killing of the Keeper by him in
the Lord <hi>Zouch</hi> his Park, the King was not pleaſed to hear the
Aggravation of the Crime againſt him, but ſuffered him to live
in place and grace to his laſt period; having received his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
admonition, as the duty of a good Conſcience and zeal
from a Religious Counſellor, for the King's and Chriſt's honor,
as to this effect.

And this, knowing how, and being indeed happily in ſeaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed,
<hi>Eccles</hi> 4. 13. according to the <hi>wiſdom which cometh
down from heaven, being firſt pure, peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be
intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,</hi> James 3. 17. <hi>without
partiality, and without hypocriſy.</hi> And this <hi>fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was ſown</hi> thus, <hi>in peace,</hi> of him that, according to his
Royal Motto (<hi>Beati Pacifici</hi>) made Peace. He (that is, his
Majeſty) therefore conſidered further, preferring the leniment
of a good Conſcience before all the <hi>Sirens</hi> Songs of ſeducing,
<hi>vel tantillum,</hi> from the right way; and concluded as he began,
according to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Motto, and his own Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Religion, not only in ſtyle <hi>Defenſor Fidei,</hi> but in zealous
Vindication, as well in his Apology for the Proteſtant faith, as
in the Oath of Allegiance. And therefore he held out through
the good hand of God helping him, without having that blame
as the Angel of <hi>Thyatira</hi> had, <hi>I have ſomething againſt thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou ſuffereſt that woman Jezabel:</hi> and ſo concluded, as
the Sun in his ſetting, as we ſee, <hi>Intaminatis honoribus, &amp; ut

Inſtitution was his extream aim, to have had it compleated in
his life-time, for after-ages to have the fruit and the fruition of
it, and to bleſs God for his ſo gracious Indulgence. Hereupon
the King conſidered further (I ſay) and would be no more at
leiſure to hear of the <hi>Toleration,</hi> but rather, as <hi>Prov. 25. 23. the
North wind driveth away rain;</hi> ſo did the Kings angry Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the intolerable Solicitors for <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might goe on yet further, in ſhewing not only that <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
<hi>Aquaeduct</hi> from <hi>Ware</hi> to <hi>London</hi> ſpoiled the water-Project
for <hi>Chelſey</hi> College; but that the deſign for repairing of <hi>Pauls</hi>
Church likewiſe quite eclipſed and damped the building of <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi>
College: but above all, the untimely death of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi>
as is afore mentioned, who was the ſtately Elm by which the
Vine of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College did hope to riſe and ſpread; but the
Divine hand having cut him off, the poor and weak Vine of this
Project fell to crawle on the ground, and to be trod under the
feet of wild and impure beaſts.</p>
            <p>Let us hereupon ſtill hear and heed what D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fuller</hi> ſaies, and
he is ever moſt worthy to be heard.</p>
            <q>
               <p>At this time the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
hath but little of the Caſe, and nothing of the Jewel for
which it was intended: Almoſt rotten before ripe, and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
before it was finiſhed. It ſtands bleak, (like a lodge in
a garden of Cucumbers) having pleaſant waters [the River
<hi>Thames</hi>] near it, and ſtore of wholeſom aire about it; but very
little of the neceſſary Element of Earth belonging unto it. Yea
ſince I am informed, that ſith the College taketh not effect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the deſire and intent of the firſt founders, it hath
been decreed in Chancery, by the joynt Conſent of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Daniel
Featly,</hi> the third Provoſt of the College [wherein by the

                  <hi>Featley</hi> was indeed
next to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> himſelf, and but the ſecond Provoſt, whom
indeed the Lord <hi>Mounſon</hi> commenced his ſuit with for the Land
whereon that part of the College is built, to whom D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sutcliffe</hi>
travelled to <hi>London,</hi> on purpoſe to ſeek out D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

I leave, and ceaſe to inquire; it is enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
me, (ſaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Fuller</hi>) it was done in equity, becauſe
done by the Lord <hi>Coventrie</hi> [But I ſay, if D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Featley</hi> had had
any hand in it, then D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> reſigning to him, a condition or
word of Caution had been enough, what needed a ſuit with
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Featley?</hi> More probable rather that the ſuit was commenced
(I ſay) with and againſt D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Slater</hi> (or if not with D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

of the third Provoſt, which was not D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

So that now only the Farm of <hi>Kemerland</hi> in <hi>Devon</hi> of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe</hi>'s
donation remains to the College. All that I will adde
(ſaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Fuller</hi>) is this: As this College was intended for
Controverſies, ſo now there is a Controverſie about the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege;
coſtly ſuits lately being commenced betwixt <hi>William</hi>
Lord <hi>Mounſon,</hi> (who married the widow <hi>Dowager</hi> of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid

of ſome few years, the land it ſelf being Crown-land.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To ſay nothing concerning its Calamity in the extent of late
fury, the Abuſes, the Abominations in the deſolation, it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
as a Cage of (<hi>Horreſco reputans</hi>) unclean birds, a <hi>Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum</hi>

            <p>Now to all theſe three great witneſſes, in their wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
and improving the deſign of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
<hi>Abbott</hi> wiſely and ſedulouſly ſoliciting the Biſhops,

               <hi>Fuller</hi> amply ſetting forth the Inſtitution, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
proviſion, uſes, and end of it at full: let me adde but one
more, that is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> who is ſo learnedly verſt,
eſpecially in the moſt ſubdolous devices of the Papiſts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
the Panurgy of <hi>Adam Contzen,</hi> Jeſuit, his directions
for preſerving and reſtoring Popery, and changing Religion in a
Nation before the people are aware: in the ſaid <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<hi>lib. 2. pag.</hi> 16, 17, 18. Who (<hi>i. e.</hi>) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Common-wealth,</hi> or his <hi>Political Aphoriſms,</hi> expreſſeth his
mind thus, (in his additions to his Preface;)</p>
            <q>
               <p>Conſider how
ſuitable Popery is with a carnal Inclination: Secondly,
what plauſible reaſons Papiſts have to delude poor ſouls with
from their pretended Univerſality, Antiquity, &amp;c. Thirdly,
how few of the vulgar are able to defend their faith, or to
anſwer to the two great Sophiſtical Queſtions of the Papiſts;
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Where hath your Church been viſible in all Ages?
[Only D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Featley,</hi> not only in his Diſputation with <hi>Fiſher,</hi> but
in his Manuſcript dedicated to the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> not yet printed,
and in his <hi>Grand Sacriledge,</hi> particularly concerning the taking
away the Cup from the Laity, has fully (as much as they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
anſwered that other point. For the Nameleſs <hi>Romaniſt</hi> thus
contrives and moulds his ſubtilties, not as Caſes of Conſcience, to
be reſolved by ſome learned Divine, but as it were laying (as
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Featley</hi> reſenteth) a ſnare to intangle the Anſwerers therein.
Let (ſaith he) thoſe points be propounded one after another,
and receive their poſitive anſwer under their hands to the firſt,
before they know the ſecond, and ſo in order to the reſt: when
that is done, you ſhall hear further from me. What is this
(ſaies D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Featley</hi>) but in effect to ſay, draw the Proteſtant
Reſpondents by degrees, and by little and little, into the ſnares
which I have laid for them, and when they are intangled in
them, I will come and take them, and intangle them with their
own ſubſcriptions? Which Tract of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Featley</hi>'s, yea the very
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of it, is in the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Craven</hi>'s
hands, who is extreamly deſired that he would be pleaſed to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41498:22"/>
communicate it for the Churches good, if he have it by him;
or elſe I have a tranſcript, which I ſhall crave his leave to put
forth.] And how prove you the Scripture to be the Word of
God? Though not only the Papiſts themſelves, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our Divines, as <hi>Whitakers</hi> againſt <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and in a large
Tract beſides, yea <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus,</hi> and all our
Catechetical Divines, eſpecially the Confeſſion of our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Churches faith, againſt the Popiſh Traditions and Papal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals,
have abundantly proved the ſufficiency, perfection
and divinity of the Scriptures unto ſalvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.
that they be the word of God only, and not of man, as ſpoken
and delivered by holy men of God, as they were moved by
the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. And therefore we may ſay,
What is the Chaff to the word of God? what are Traditions,
Legends of Saints, to the word of God? <hi>Jer. 23. 28. Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
de Villega</hi> his more refined Legends of the Saints. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
how will it take with the people, to be told that their
forefathers all dyed in the <hi>Roman</hi> faith? which Reverend
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hocker,</hi> that wrote the Eccleſiaſtical Policy in five books,
wil abundantly reſolve them in. And fifthly, above all, what
a multitude of Jeſuits and Friers and Prieſts they can prepare
for the work, and pour out upon us at their pleaſure, from
<hi>Flanders, France,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places: and how
thoſe ſorts of men are purpoſely trained up for this deceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and illuſive work, and have their common Arguments at
their fingers end; which though they are thred-bare and
tranſparent fallacies to the wiſe, yet to the vulgar, and to our
unſtudied Gentry, they are as good as if they had never been
confuted, or as the beſt. [I appeal unto that <hi>glorioſum Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamen</hi>
between King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt and the Marqueſs of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
at <hi>Ragland</hi> Caſtle, who (I ſay, the Marqueſs) wanted
not his College of Prieſts and Popiſh Jeſuits: with what hazzard
did the Kings Majeſty encounter, and eſcape the moſt ſubtile
Circumventings of that night in ſingle Combats, having only
for his ſecond D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Bayley,</hi> a ſingle Chaplain?] Sixthly,
what a world of wealth and ſecular helps is at their becks, in
<hi>France, Flanders, Italy, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Germany?</hi> They have
Millions of gold, and Navies and Armies ready to promote
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41498:22"/>
their work, which other Sects have none of. [So as that the
<hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Collegiated Hives, for them in all Countries, in <hi>Italy,
France, Spaine, Germany,</hi> as one of credible Intelligence has
muſtred (only the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>) and reported them, ſmal and great,
<hi>Tyrones, Veterani,</hi> Pupils, Tutors, Penſioners, Governors, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in their Armies and pay, are ten times more then all the
Students in both Univerſities, and in all the Inns of Court in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
too, (<hi>viz.</hi> 2000000.) Which Computation is taken out of
the Muſter-book of <hi>Harley</hi>'s <hi>Defence Des Jeſuits.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no marvel that theſe hives every where ſo ſwarm, and
ſuch multitudes of them are ſent to ſeek their hiving quarters in
our <hi>England.</hi> For they account <hi>Scotland</hi> as yet too poor for
them, or too cold and barren to thrive in, as not having thoſe
<hi>flores inſcripti nomina Regum,</hi> for them to ſuck their hony out
of.] Seventhly, what worldly motives have their Prieſts
and Friers to promote their zeal? Their Superiors have ſuch
variety of Preferments and ample Treaſures to reward them
with, and their ſingle life alloweth them ſo much vacancy
from domeſtick Avocations, and withall, they ſo much glory
in a zeal, in compaſſing ſea and land to make Proſelytes,
that it is an incredible advantage that they get by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
the Envious man by them ſowing his tares, whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſleep, and are not half ſo induſtrious to reſiſt them.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, What abundance have they lately wone in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
Notwithſtanding they have wanted publick liberty,
and have only taken ſecret opportunities to ſeduce perſons,
many of the Nobility, Gentry, yea and of the Clergy, as
well as of the Common people, and zealous Profeſſors of
Religion (lately,) as well as of the profane, have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by them, and by them Princes in other Countries
have been won, and the Proteſtant Religion cunningly worm'd
out. And what a lamentable increaſe they had made in
<hi>England</hi> before our Wars, by that Countenance and favour
which through the <hi>Queen</hi> was procured them, (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
ſhort of this abſolute Liberty) is ſufficiently
known.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, It is not the leaſt of our danger, that the moſt of
our Miniſters are unable to deal with a Cunning Jeſuite or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41498:23"/>
Prieſt. And this is not to be wondred at, conſidering how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them are young men, put in of late in the Neceſſity of
the Churches, (which the world knows who have cauſed;)
and there muſt be time before young men can grow to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and an unfurniſhed Nation can be provided with able,
experienced men. And the Ceſſation of Popiſh aſſaults of
late hath diſuſed Miniſters from theſe Diſputations. The
Reformation had ſeemed to have brought down Popery ſo
low, that we grew ſecure, and thought there was no danger
of it; and the Papiſts of late have forborn much to meddle
with us barefac'd, and have played their game under the
vizor of their Sects. And withall, young Miniſters have
been ſo taken up with the greater work of winning Souls from
common profaneneſs, that moſt have laid by their defenſive
Arms, and are grown too much unacquainted with Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.
We have ſo much noted how Controverſie in other
Countries hath eaten out much of the power of Godlineſs,
that we have fallen by diſuſe into an unacquaintedneſs with
the means of our neceſſary defence: and whilſt we thought
that we might lay by our weapons [as <hi>Sampſon</hi> his Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,
or <hi>David</hi> his <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword] and build with both
hands; we are too much unready to withſtand the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Alas! what work would liberty for <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi>
make in our Congregations in a few months ſpace? I muſt
confeſs this (though ſome will think it our diſhonour) it is
not from any ſtrength in their cauſe, but from their carnal
advantages and our diſadvantages [becauſe we are not ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with our learned Gariſon, with the Magazine of Library
and maintenance] For it is eaſier to pull down then to build,
and to ſet a Town on Fire then to re-edife one houſe, and to
wound then to heal. [But as the fountain was hid at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from <hi>Hagar's</hi> eyes; ſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Baxter</hi> for the preſent did not
ſee, nor think on the adequate remedy of this (<hi>viz.) Chelſey</hi>
College Project and deſign; this being to this preſent utterly,
to all ſeeming, as it were dead and buried, without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
and ſo diſcovery, unleſs ſome Angel awaken and open
our eyes to ſee it.] And then if Popery ſhould come in again
[through our giving over our watch and guards, and then
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41498:23"/>
doubtleſs if ſo, not without ſeven worſe devils of Infection,
Rage, Thraldom, Superſtition, Tyranny, groſs Idolatry, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciouſneſs]
what meaſure Proteſtants may look for at their
hands, we need not go out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> for proof.</p>
               <p>To uſe therefore a little more M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Baxter</hi>'s words for <hi>Chelſey</hi>
College, which he urgeth indeed for another thing. I leave it
therefore to the Judgment of all men that are not aſleep in
their ſecurity, and utterly unacquainted with the advantages
and vigilancies of Papiſts, whether this deſign of reſtoring
and endowing <hi>Chelſey</hi> College, according to the firſt wiſdom of
it, for the defenſe of our Church Articles and oppugnation of
the Adverſaries, be not altogether of Chriſt, of the Angel
of the New Covenant, having diſcovered it unto our eyes,
and cauſed us to ſee this fountain, for our ſelected and choice
men to draw water out of the Well of Salvation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 19.
as the ſtrong men of <hi>David</hi> out of the well of <hi>Bethlehem,
2 Sam.</hi> 23. 16. with Joy, for the eſtabliſhing of the hearts
of the Saints in the true grace, that they be ſound in the faith,
and ſo be able and furniſhed (when need is) to convince the
gainſayers, and that the ſimple at length may be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
even the Scribes and the wiſe of the world, who beat
their brains with the deceivableneſs of that unrighteouſneſs, to
build, or rather daube up, the Myſtery of Iniquity, the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vableneſs
of unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus have I at large related the nature and Condition of
<hi>Chelſey</hi> College, the nature of the Cauſes, form, uſes, and
ends of prudence, for happineſs to our Church, if we can receive
it, and the condition for the preſent of it in its impediments
and obſtructions; ſo that if it be not now religiouſly looked
unto, it muſt and will be everlaſtingly forlorn and loſt, and
ſuch an opportunity never more can be hoped for. And this
I have related as principal and princely <hi>Bezaliels</hi> have medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and deſigned it, as a well-drawn and wrought fair piece
of Arras, and a Pattern to be made up accordingly, and as it
were from God, in the words of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 40. 4. <hi>Son
of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and
ſet thy heart upon all that I ſhall ſhew thee: for to the
intent that I might ſhew them, am I ſent unto you.</hi>

Wherein you have not only a Synopſis and clear declaration
of a Tower of <hi>Ophel,</hi> a Church Garriſon; but alſo motives pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
and powerfull enough of Archbiſhop <hi>Abbott</hi>'s, or one of
the Fellows, even flexanimous to hearten and help onward the
Affair: 1. From the Papiſts and Jeſuits their induſtry and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing
of gold, for defence of their Idolatry and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm;
2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, From the neceſſity (as they account it) to
uphold the Myſtery of Iniquity, and from the neceſſity for
us alſo to work counter unto them; 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, From the danger
that our Church and Cauſe may be in, if we provide not
in time; 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, From the excellency of being valiant for the
Truth; 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. From the honour of Chriſt and his Church, and
our King and Country; 6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, From the reproach which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
will redound unto us; 7<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, Beſides the ſuffering of the
<hi>Abomination of Deſolation</hi> ſuddenly to overſpread us, and ſo
the adverſaries to work their pleaſure upon mens ſouls, and
have occaſion to upbraid us, ſaying, Why is there a price in
the hand of fooliſh <hi>Engliſh-</hi> men to get wiſdom, and they
have no heart to lay it out for wiſdom?</p>
            <p>So that after all this Remonſtrance about the matter, and
heads of the motives ſo faithfully inforced and improved,
there needs no more inculcating of them, but only praying
to remember and conſider what has been ſo carefully and
conſcionably urged; and the Lord give us underſtanding in all
things. Only may I humbly crave leave to urge in fine, what we
have found, and what was not conſidered, and what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
advertiſeth the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Rev. 3. 10. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou haſt kept the word of my patience</hi> (that is, as the
Apoſtle does paraphraſe 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 3. the work of faith, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

be ingaged in the work) <hi>therefore I will keep thee from the
hour of Temptation, which ſhall come upon all the world, to
try them that dwell upon the face of the Earth;</hi> that is, to
try their Faith, to try their Love, to try their Hope: their
Faith, whether it work by Love; their Love, whether it be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

proſpering and bleſſing to the Lord Chriſt. And this the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if our expectation be according to the fifth-Monarchy
mens perſwaſion, which is not an Hereſie, and ſo not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
but to be looked for, but to be endeavoured after, but
to be prayed for, that Chriſt his ſecond coming, in bringing
and ſetting up his Kingdom, may ſo appear. And, in a ſort, is
not this hour of temptation come upon us of <hi>England?</hi> and
has it not been even for no leſs then fourty years almoſt

our hearts that they faile not in their labour, nor faint in their

            </p>
            <p>Finally, may I humbly adde a word of the probable means
of (as it were) buoying up this Ship of the ſunk College, to
be rigged and to ride again as a Pretorian ſhip, in its haven;
with reſpect to his moſt Gracious Majeſty, and the Great
Wiſdoms of his Councel and Parliament: becauſe it is ſaid
expreſsly, that <hi>Kings ſhall be nurſing Fathers and Queens
nurſing Mothers</hi> to the Church, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49. 23. Whatſoever the
penury may ſeem to be in regard of the late great loſſes and
exhauſtings, becauſe of the ſweeping tempeſts, that have left
(as it were) nothing, or little good; yet is it not the word
of the Lord by <hi>Haggai, The ſilver is mine, and the gold is
mine (ſaith the Lord of hoſts?</hi>) So that if it pleaſe Almighty
God to ſtir up, and put into the Kings Majeſties heart an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
care and reſolution to ſet about the advancing and reſtoring
of this ruinous College, by taking the Courſe which his Royal
Grand-father did, <hi>viz.</hi> granting forthwith his Letters Patents
once again, generally all over <hi>England,</hi> for a Collection of three
years to be made; and that the Archbiſhops Graces would be
earneſt with the Biſhops of their Dioceſes to ſollicit their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Miniſters; and that the Peers of the Upper houſe and the
Burgeſſes of the Commons houſe would by their Munificence
be exemplary Leaders unto the Collective body; more reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
the new Biſhops, revived and reſtored (as men of God)
to their Sees and dignities, to act as Intelligences and Angels of
the Churches in their own Spheres, though poſſible their Sees
are much impaired, as having had <hi>the Line of Ahab</hi> upon them,
and <hi>Plummet of Samaria:</hi> Yet if they ſhall <hi>meditate liberal
things,</hi> Eſay 32. 8. or <hi>deviſe liberal things,</hi> and out of their
grave and gracious wiſdoms prompt and promote unto the
Kings Majeſty a more probable way of wiſdom then at firſt
was projected, and become alſo not only exhortative but exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary,
to their power, for ſo important, godly, and neceſſary a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41498:25"/>
work, eſpecially the moſt Reverend Fathers, <hi>Canterbury, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,
London, Lincoln, Yorke, Durham,</hi> &amp;c. This may doe
much, and much contribute towards the ſpeedy adorning and
advancement of the College to its due perfection, and placing
it in its ſphere of activity, yea and to the ſettling of it, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a pattern and preſident for Imitation to foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Churches alſo in Chriſtendom, not yet in the Popes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity
and dungeon of darkneſs, of his Myſtery of Iniquity
and deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs. And if the late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
<hi>Laud</hi> could have imagined that ſuch Wolves and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Hereſy, upon his being put to death, would have
been in ſuch readineſs, like Serpents and Toads and venemous
creeping, noxious beaſts, at the root of the ſtately Palm-tree
of our Church, in readineſs, I ſay, thronging with their Fry,
whoſe word was, <hi>Viam inveniam aut faciam,</hi> to crawle
up even ſo all over the fruitfull branches of this Palm (for
the ſhepheard being ſmitten, how would the ſheep be ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?)
how would he have rouſed up and awakened himſelf
as the Cock, who with his wings clappeth himſelf, to have been
moſt vigilant over them? eſpecially when D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Featley</hi> (being
aſſigned the Provoſt of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and ſolicitous obtaining of him, and reſigning all his

<hi>London</hi> Houſe) to favour and further the College, when the
Church looked upon him as a ſon upon his Father and Patriot,
becauſe of his fair opportunity, by his high advancement, for
the greateſt affaires of the Church, which King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt was pleaſed to grace and intruſt him withall. How would

him to have ſerved <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> as well as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and have looked upon
<hi>Chelſey</hi> College as a grand buſineſs of Chriſt's, as well as to be
ſo zealous for the re-edifying of <hi>Pauls;</hi> and not have daunted
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Featley</hi>'s ſuit with that ſhort haſty word, <hi>Cui bono?</hi> as <hi>Pilate</hi>
once ſeemed to have done to Chriſt, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> His eye,
with his heart, being ſo immoveably fixed upon the repairing of
the dead and decaying walls of <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, not in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim
providently eying and ſpying the miſchiefs, Calamities,
Chaos of Hereſies, Sects and Schiſms, by Satan's Panurgy, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41498:26"/>
by the madneſs of the people, to be drawing in upon us, like
the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, for want of that publick armature, ſword
and ſpear of the ſpirit, the ſpiritual ſword of God's Word in
the mouths of his more ſelect Miniſters, thoſe living ſtones of
his ſpiritual Tower of Armory. Could, I ſay, his Graces wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(I mean Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s, who was <hi>omni laude dignus</hi>)
have commanded his heart to have beheld and heeded the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
face of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College Project, as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Featley</hi> preſented
it unto him, and on a time did it more fully and freely at <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
when he was better at leaſure; had not the Importunity
of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtill been too clamorous in his ears, for expediting it,
how would he not (doubtleſs) have bleſſed D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Featley,</hi> and
bleſſed his Counſell, and bleſſed God, who filled his heart to
lay before him indeed the <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> of <hi>Chelſey</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
as <hi>David</hi> did bleſſe <hi>Abigail?</hi> So that (as I ſaid) though
that Church, that Carnal Church, (carnal, I ſay, in compariſon
of this <hi>Chelſey</hi> College its pure ſpiritual conſideration and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
the ſpecious repairing whereof could not be without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
charge, did much dazle the Archbiſhops eyes; yet the
apprehenſion and contemplation of future ſpiritual fruit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from right qualified perſons in <hi>Chelſey</hi> College had it
been entertained in his heart, how might it make his Soul
now living under the Altar, though the <hi>Vaſculum</hi> of his
precious body be layed in the duſt, yet (I ſay) how might it
make his Soul ſay, and ſigh, and ſtill wiſh, <hi>Me mortuo, me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſo,
ſeu mactato, floreat Collegium Chelcianum?</hi> Much more
therefore, how may it move the preſent Archbiſhop, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
with his Brethren, to ſay, yea labour and indeavour it,
<hi>Imo nobis quaſi à mortuis reſuſcitatis, unà nobiſcum revire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcat
in aternum Collegium Chelcianum?</hi> And therefore we
will <hi>give no ſleep to our eyes, nor ſlumber to our eye-lids,</hi> until
we have obtained this <hi>Chelſey</hi> College to be ſet upon its
own <hi>Baſis,</hi> and to be the place for the Lord to dwell amongſt
us, as between the Cherubims, and for the moſt honourable
and glorious ſervice of his moſt ſanctifying and ſaving Truth,
ſo <hi>to prepare the way of the Lord, and to make his paths ſtraight,</hi>
that our, <hi>Lord</hi> and great Maſter <hi>when he cometh may find us
thus doing.</hi> moſt diligently with all our beſt prudence and piety
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41498:26"/>
advancing his precious work, for his Glory, and the ſovereign
ſoul-good of his people.</p>
            <p>And though I prudently confeſs, and moſt humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that <hi>non eſt meae tenuitatis dictare viris tantis, &amp; tam
rerum ſapientiam Divinam pariter ac gloriam ſpectanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
perquam ſagaciſſimis:</hi> yet may I (with craving of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)
ſay, that if the preſent Archbiſhop his Grace (as being
the laſt and only man that was, at the dying of King <hi>Charles</hi>
on the Scaffold, privy to the Counſel and boſom of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Royal heart, and to many deſires of his not yet uttered)
if he ſhall think good, yea if God command him to acquaint
his bleſſedly-ſucceeding Majeſty (ſo as it may be no prejudice
any way unto him) with a convenient way for ſettling a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
certain revenue on this College, then (I ſay) the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
may eaſily, ſpeedily, and happily be promoted, and no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
done to, or complaint made by any man: but rather,
by the ſecret bleſſing of the Lord in his acceptance, it may be
made to emerge in Glory. Yet with all moſt prudent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
Caution, that in caſe the Members thereof ſo amply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, ſhould not anſwer the truſt which they are ſworn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and the Articles of Unity, Love and Truth which they are
ingaged in, but ſuffer their fountain to be defiled, and their
waters (like thoſe of <hi>Jericho</hi>) at length to become bitter;
that then all Indulgences, Privileges, Proviſion, return to the
King and State. For, O the ſacred Covetouſneſs, with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and hate that Satan may poſſeſs the hearts of the Adverſaries
with, the <hi>Eccleſia malignantium,</hi> eſpecially againſt Chriſt and
his Cauſe, even to corrupt and to cauſe prevarication in the
beſt and moſt bleſſed things, to cauſe even them to be the more
doubly and dreadfully curſed! according to my compariſon
which I have before hinted of ſnakes, toads and vipers craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at and corrupting the Royal root of the Palm-tree. But
<hi>Abſit omen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I hope the <hi>Kings</hi> Majeſty will ſee not only great reaſon
for it, but gracious Religion flouriſhing in it too (which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balances
all carnal reſpects) and find that God will, as he well
can, multiply his ſeed of Royal Munificence thus ſown, an
hundred fold into his boſom, and heap upon and load him in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41498:27"/>
lieu thereof with Riches and Honour and Obedience and
hearty love of his Subjects, ſo as to make him the Joy and
delight of mankind, and as the man of his right hand, by
multiplying ſtill more Riches and Honour upon him, as he
did to <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> the ſon of <hi>Aſa,</hi> who walked in the firſt
waies of <hi>David,</hi> and abhorred <hi>Baalim.</hi> The like his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
does, and has reſolved to doe; for which God has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
the Kingdom in his hand, by inclining the hearts of
Parliaments and Citizens to bring preſents unto him in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
thereof. I ſay, Riches and Honour ſhall be multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon him, for thoſe that honour God, God will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
eſpecially, that in the midſt of their <hi>deep poverty me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
liberal things,</hi> and ſtudy to <hi>abound unto rich liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
2 Cor. 8. 2. Eſay</hi> 32. 8. and <hi>Eſay 30. 15. In returning and
reſt ye ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But <hi>Eſay 7. 9. If ye will not believe</hi>
—but <hi>Abſit omen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then, men being moved by God's ſpirit ſhall chearfully
and readily lay out themſelves for this College, they ſhall not
repent of this good deed, but find profit by it; as the widows
oil and flower was multiplied by her contributing to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
<hi>And he that miniſtreth ſeed to the ſower, both miniſter
bread for your food, and multiply your ſeed ſown, and increaſe
the fruits of your Righteouſneſs, 2 Cor.</hi> 9. 10. Eſpecially if
there be withall a chearfulneſs of heart; as in ſowing our
ſeed in hope, how gladly with full hands do we diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
it, and what rich return doth the Earth recompenſe us
again withall? As oil therefore which flows of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
from the Olives fatneſs, without preſſing, is much more
excellent and precious, and for many medicaments more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then that which is forced by preſſing: ſo a prompt, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and chearfull Contribution, without any importunate
begging, is moſt gratefull to God, and moſt rich for reward.
But for the work faithfully done to the end, O how rich and
bleſſed a reward is there!</p>
