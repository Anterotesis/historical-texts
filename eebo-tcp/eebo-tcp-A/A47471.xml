            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to advise with the members of both our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Parliament, for the restoring of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to its former peace and happinesse: At least
We doubt not it will appear to all the world, and
to posterity, that there hath not been such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
in the bringing these miseries upon it, or
in compleating that, by the invitation of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign

desire you that you will by no means fail of
giving your attendance at the time and place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
which in respect of the high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Kingdome, We shall not doubt of: And so Wee

JOYFVLL
RELATION
OF THE HAPPY SVC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of the PARLIAMENTS
Forces at the raising of the Siege
from Nantwich, Jan. 26.
1643.</head>
            <p>SIr <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> and Sir <hi>William Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi>
being at Nottingham, marched from
thence unto Hinkley and there quartered;
and from thence the next day they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Bosworth, and so to Tamworth,
where they quartered one night: from whence they
marched the next day to Stafford, and there joyned
with Sir <hi>William Brewerton,</hi> with whom they marched
to relieve Nantwitch, which was besieged by the Irish
Forces from Westchester, and Shrousbury, and raised
the siege. The Enemies being fled to their quarters, Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and Sir <hi>William</hi> marched from Nant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich
to Manchester, and there gathered a body of foot
out of Manchester and other parts in Lancashire, and
<pb facs="tcp:109154:3"/>
caused a Fast to be kept for two dayes, for the Enemy
were of great strength, and the resiege was feared; The
Enemies cruelty did much grieve the Countrey, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
as it was feared the Enemy returned againe to
Nantwich, and laid close siege before it; and did attempt
to scale the works three severall times, and shot almost
100 fiery hot bullets, with a kind of fire balls to burne
the Towne. But blessed be God, there was none of them
that did any considerable hurt: the greatest harme the
Towne sustained by those bals, was by one which light
upon a stack of wood, and fired part of it; which was
quenched without doing any further mischief.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Booth</hi> the Governour of Nantwich, a young
man of about 21 yeers of age, but of a valiant spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
himself bravely; his Souldiers consisting of about
1200 in number, who withstood the Enemy bravely,
and did good execution upon them, and slew Lieutenant
Collonel <hi>Boughton,</hi> and 4 Captaines more: amongst
which, Captain <hi>Stamford</hi> is one, and kept the Towne in
despight of them Cap. <hi>Booth</hi> still encouraging the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and promising unto them that he would loose his
life in their defence before he would yeeld up the town
to such traiterous Irish Rebels.</p>
            <p>Yet Sir <hi>William Brewerton</hi> was in great fear of loosing
the Town; and indeed had not God wrought wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
for us it had been lost.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> returning again from Manchester
marched to Stafford again, and joyned with Sir <hi>William
Brewerton;</hi> who joyning their forces together marched
from thence again to relieve Nantwich, on Friday Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
the 26. with about 6000 horse and foot, the enemy
consisting of about 8000.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109154:4"/>
When our forces came neer the Enemies quarters,
they discovering our Forces, came out of their trenches
into the plain, and gave us battell; wherein our Forces
charged so hot on their right wing, that they caused the
Lord <hi>Byron</hi> with all their horse to run away, leaving one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the foot to stand to it: By this time there were slaine
of the right wing about 200, besides those that were in
the left wing, and the Foot were left to the mercy of our
Forces: And their horse hasted so fast away, that they
threw away their Pistols, and fled for their lives. The
Lord <hi>Byron</hi> himself being one of the first that fled.</p>
            <p>There were also a fort of Irish women, that were in
the Enemies Campe: whose office was to robbe, and
plunder, our men that fell: and with long knives which
they had hanging by their sides, to cut the throates of
those that they found not quite dead.</p>
            <p>C. <hi>Booth</hi> with eight hundred issued out of Nampt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,
and fell upon the back of them, and so our forces
surprised them all, with all their bag, and baggage: of
which here followeth an exact list according to the
copy, by the Scout brought to the Parliament.</p>
