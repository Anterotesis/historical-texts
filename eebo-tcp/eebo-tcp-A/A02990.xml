            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is commonly profeſſed, though
not ſo well known and obſerved
as it ought, that Satan is alwayes
buſie to ſolicite, and our own
deceitfull hearts ready to turn aſide from the
wayes of peace and comfort, either to the
right hand or to the left. To ſay nothing of
the lamentable ſtate of heathen Infidels,
Turks, and Jews, who know not God, nor
believe the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST;
Amongſt them that profeſſe Chriſtianity,
ſome are ſo deeply plunged into ſuperſtition,
that the truth of God and the ordinances of
grace are not prized in compariſon of their
own vain and fruitleſſe traditions. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
on the contrary, do ſo farre diſtaſt all
<pb facs="tcp:23108:3"/>
inventions whatſoever (as they ſpeak) in Gods
worſhip, as they reject that which beareth the
ſtamp and image of God, and might be greatly
profitable to their ſouls. Many come profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Lords table, and pollute the holy
things of God to their own deſtruction: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
through groundleſſe fears of defilement,
do withdraw themſelves from ordinances Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and the ſociety of the godly, becauſe
ſome unworthy are not debarred. To ſatisfie
this latter ſort, who offend out of weakneſſe &amp;
miſguided judgement not of ſtubborneſſe and
contempt, and to ſettle them that are ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I have penned this poore &amp; rude treatiſe,
nothing doubting but the truth will be able to
maintein it ſelf, and that the beauty thereof
will procure favour and acceptance, though
it come arayed in a very homely garment.</p>
            <p>A ſtinted form of prayer hath been chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
as an image forbidden in the ſecond
commandment, a forged and deviſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
unlawfull both in them that uſe it, and
<pb facs="tcp:23108:3"/>
thoſe that joyn therein. To remove this
ſcruple, I have ſhewed the uſe of a ſtinted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,
lawfull and allowable by the word of
God, of ancient uſe in the churches of Chriſt,
approved by all reformed churches at this
day: Upon which occaſion many things are
diſputed touching the meaning of the ſecond
commandment, the nature of true and falſe
worſhip; and what it is to pray by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Many are the objections which are made
againſt ſet forms of prayer, and particularly
againſt our book of common prayer: all
which I have endeavoured to anſwer ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally;
and not becauſe they are of ſo great
weight, but becauſe I deſired fully to ſatisfie
every doubt, and roll away every ſtone I met
withall. If one and the ſame thing be oft
repeated, I deſire it may be conſidered that
one and the ſame objection for ſubſtance is
often brought forth, though perhaps in
new aray, and every plain-hearted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(for whoſe uſe I principally intend
<pb facs="tcp:23108:4"/>
this labour) is not able to apply an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
once given to ſundry objections in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
diverſe though for ſubſtance the ſame.
And I ſuppoſe the prudent will think it
more reaſonable that the wiſe in heart be
burdened with over-much, then that the
weak ſhould remain unſatisfied through
ſome defect. Some ſtagger at this, that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
profane, notorious offenders are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Lords table, and conceive that
communicating with ſuch in the ordinances
of religion they are partakers of their ſinne.
And ſure it is a thing to be lamented with
tears of bloud, that the body and bloud of
our Saviour CHRIST ſhould be profaned,
the houſe and church of God defiled, the
name of the Lord diſhonoured, religion
blaſphemed, and the blind, notorious, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
permitted to ruſh upon their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
But it is not for private perſons to
take that upon them which belongeth not
unto their place; nor, being invited by
<pb facs="tcp:23108:4"/>
CHRIST, to excommunicate themſelves,
becauſe ſuch as are notoriouſly wicked be not
admoniſhed, kept back, or cenſured.</p>
            <p>The main ground of the former doubt and
all others tending to Separation ſeemeth to be
this; That the power of the keyes is primitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given to the community of the faithfull, as
the firſt receptacle. For then they conceive
that it perteineth to them to cenſure offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or elſe to ſeparate from them. Then
likewiſe it will more probably be concluded,
as they think, That that ſociety which hath
not the power of CHRISTS keyes is not the
true church of CHRIST. Therefore to
raze the foundation of Separation, and at
once to overthrow their main objections, this
queſtion is more largely diſputed: wherein is
ſhewed by evidence of Scripture, That the
power of the keyes is given by Jeſus Chriſt,
the Lord and King of his church, and great
Shepherd of his ſheep, to the church-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
whom he hath appointed to rule and
<pb facs="tcp:23108:5"/>
feed his flock in his name, and to whom they
muſt give account.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall think theſe things are ſmall
and not to be inſiſted upon, he may pleaſe
to conſider; How ſmall ſoever the things in
themſelves ſeem to be, the evil conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that follow thereupon be both many and
great: It is no ſmall matter to bury that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the condemnation of falſe worſhip,
which the Lord the authour of all truth, the
determiner of his true, pleaſing and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
worſhip, doth allow in his ſervice. It is
no ſmall offenſe to forſake the prayers of the
congregation, to depart from the table of
the Lord when he calleth to feaſt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and to break off ſociety and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the churches of Chriſt, where
he doth cauſe his flock to reſt at noon; to fill
the hearts of weak Chriſtians with doubts
and diſtractions, as not knowing what to
do, or which way to take; to ſpend time in
reaſonings and diſputations of this kind,
<pb facs="tcp:23108:5"/>
which might much more profitably be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the practice of repentance and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obedience: to expoſe religion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and the truth of God to reproch, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them that delight to ſpeak evil: Theſe
are ſad effects of this Separation which is here
oppoſed. Is it not lamentable to ſee poore
Chriſtians, who ſincerely thirſt after the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of life, and long to meet the Lord in his
holy ordinances, caſt into doubts and fears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the things which ſo nearly concern
their comfortable walking with God and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their ſouls? May not this tend to
the diſcouragement of divers that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, and turn them who are halting clean
out of the way? The rents and diviſions
which have been in the church have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
been one advantage which the enemies
of the truth have taken to ſpeak reprochful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And if the credit of religion, the glory
of God, and the ſouls of our brethren be dear
unto us, what can we do leſſe then by a juſt
<pb facs="tcp:23108:6"/>
and mild defenſe of the truth ſeek the reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſuch as are gone aſtray, the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them that be weak in judgement but
zealouſly affected to the wayes of God; ſtop
the ſtream of ſeducing, free the godly from
unjuſt imputations, and ſettle peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the truth amongſt brethren? I heartily
wiſh we had not ſo much experience to leſſon
us, that when men have once begun to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the publick exerciſes of religion, and to
ſeparate from the churches of Chriſt, they
have run from one errour into another after
the fond imaginations of their own ſeduced
hearts untill they have daſhed themſelves
upon the rocks.</p>
            <p>They that break off communion in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
mentioned, have not proceeded to a
totall Separation from our congregations and
aſſemblies, as no churches of Jeſus Chriſt:
This rigid Separation they condemn, as that
which was never approved or bleſſed of
God. But they have gone further then the
<pb facs="tcp:23108:6"/>
word of truth doth warrant them, or they
have the Lord Jeſus for their guide: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is the duty and ſafety of Chriſtians to
follow after but not to go before their Lord
and Captain. The firſt entrance into an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
way is dangerous: for in the track
thereof there is no ſtop, unleſſe God of his
infinite mercy do prevent. Errours are lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up together in a bundle, and many times
the leaſt onely appear, which yet ſerve to
bring on and uſher in the greater. At once
men fall not into ſtrange and monſtrous
opinions, no more then into outragious evils:
but by degrees they inſenſibly are drawn
from bad to worſe, untill they come to a
great height. At the firſt ſight many a mans
conſcience would have been affrighted with
that errour which after ſome tampering he
highly admireth and is bewitched withall.
How many of great hopes and excellent
parts have been overthrown hereby, is too
evident by lamentable obſervation in all
<pb facs="tcp:23108:7"/>
ages. Rents and diviſions are the diſeaſe,
Separation the wound of the church, unto
which of long time ſhe hath been obnoxious;
but it is the ſinne of them who either lay ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks
of offenſe before their brethren,
or ſeparate raſhly or unjuſtly, being carried
away rather with prejudice then ſtrength of
argument, and commanded more by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of others then by the authority of the
rule of righteouſneſſe. There is but one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the Church; and but one Lord, or head
of the body, Chriſt: And whoſoever ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
from the body the Church, ſeparateth
from Chriſt in that reſpect. And if we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
our ſelves from Chriſt where he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
inviteth us to feaſt with him, may we
not juſtly fear that he will withdraw himſelf
from us, and make us ſeek, when we ſhall not
find him? Voluntary Separation from the
Lords table and prayers of the congregation,
what is it but a willing excommunication of
our ſelves from the viſible tokens of the Lords
<pb facs="tcp:23108:7"/>
preſence and love? And if it be a grievous
ſinne in church-governours, to deprive any
member of the church of all communion
with the viſible church upon light and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
occaſions; is it not a greater ſinne in
the members, to deprive themſelves of the
ſame communion upon the like or leſſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?
Zeal and tenderneſſe of conſcience
muſt be nouriſhed by all good means; but
they are not to move alone without their
guide, that is, the word of God.</p>
            <p>Perhaps this kind of writing may occaſion
more diſputes. If ſo, it is contrary to my hearts
deſire, who intend onely the ſatisfaction of
them that ſtagger, the reclaiming of them that
are gone too farre, and the maintenance of
peace, truth, and communion in the worſhip
of God, as it furthereth communion with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. If I may obtein this end, I have
that which I beg of the Lord. Willingly I
would not offend any that fear God,
but endeavour onely to remove the
<pb facs="tcp:23108:8"/>
blocks at which I ſee ſome ſtumble, and to
further the more comfortable walking of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who deſire to pleaſe God in all things,
but are kept under in the means of comfort
with vain ſcruples. And happy were it, if,
doubtfull diſputations laid aſide, we might
joyn together with one heart and ſoul to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
religion, worſhip the Lord purely, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
one another in our moſt holy faith, and
walk unblameably in the fear of God and
comfort of the holy Ghoſt. I take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in controverſies of this kind, and could
heartily wiſh that, theſe matters rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
we might give heed to that one thing
which is neceſſary: But if it ſeem good to
any man to reply, I earneſtly beg that he
would take the word of God truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
for his warrant, make proof of what he
ſaith, keep himſelf to the points in hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impertinent digreſſions, and proceed on
in love and meekneſſe, as becometh them
that profeſſe the truth, and deſire to preſerve

the peace of a good conſcience. A good
cauſe is no way advantaged by heat and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
We muſt ſo write and ſpeak in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
of religion, as that we remember
we muſt give account to God of that which
we ſay. And if paſſionate and diſtempered
ſpeeches in common talk be no light offenſe;
in matters of religion, which are ſoberly to
be debated as in the preſence of God, to give
way to humane raſhneſſe and diſtemper is
much more diſgracefull. God will not hold
him guiltleſſe that telleth a lie for the glory of
his name. To bear falſe witneſſe in civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
betwixt man and man, is odious and
abominable: Therefore it behooveth us to
fear and ſtand in aw, leſt being tranſported
with miſguided zeal we call evil good and
good evil, and misapply the ſcriptures, when
we ſpeak of our ſelves. Let us weigh all
things, and hold that which is good. The
Lord in mercy look down from heaven upon
his poore church and people, bring his truth
<pb facs="tcp:23108:9"/>
to light more and more, diſpell the miſts of
ignorance, remove all occaſions of offenſe,
ſettle peace and truth, proſper the means of
grace, build us forward in faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and unite the hearts of his people in
love, that they may direct their courſe by
one rule (if they cannot be all of one mind
in every thing) and as one man may walk
together in heaven-way, untill they receive
the end of their faith, the ſalvation of their
ſouls.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Of a ſtinted form of Prayer.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rayer is the ſweet and familiar
conference of a faithfull ſoul with
the Lord his mercifull Father: Or,
A calling upon God in the name of
Chriſt with the heart, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with the voice, according to his will, for
our ſelves and others. In it (to let paſſe other
matters not pertinent to this purpoſe) foure
things come to be conſidered: the Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient,
Authour, Matter, and Manner thereof.
The honour of invocation is due to God onely in
and through Jeſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 15.</note> To God onely,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 5.</note> as
the chief, beſt and moſt perfect good; through
Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 10. 23.</note> as our Mediatour, in whom we have
acceſſe to the throne of grace.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 18.</note> Prayer is not a
work of nature but of grace.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> The principall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
thereof is the holy Ghoſt. Man indeed
doth poure out his ſoul unto the Lord, but he is
firſt taught, moved, and enabled thereunto by
the Spirit of grace; ſo that prayer is Gods gift,
and mans act. The matter of our prayer is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
according to the ſundry occaſions which
happen in this life; but ever it muſt be agreeable
to the word and will of God. Underſtanding,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23108:10"/>
faith, humilitie, reverence, fervencie, holineſſe
and love are required to that prayer which is
acceptable unto God, and doth procure audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
In prayer with others, eſpecially in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
prayer,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 16, 28. Orig. contra Celſum, lib. 8.</note> where the miniſter is the mouth of
the people, the uſe of the voice is neceſſarie for
the edification of the hearers: for they cannot
joyn in ſupplication,<note place="margin">Ambr. in 1 Cor. 14. Hieron. ad Heliodor. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph. Nepotian.</note> and yield their conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they heare and underſtand what is prayed
for. In ſolitary prayer the voice and words are
very uſefull,<note place="margin">Auguſt. De Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt. lib. 1 Idem, De catechiz. rudib. cap. 9. Juſtinian. De Eccleſiaſt. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. capitul.

up affection and prevent rovings; not neceſſary,
becauſe it is the ſoul only that doth animate pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
A man may pray fervently and ſpeak never
a word: but words be of no worth if the heart
be abſent. Prayer endited by the Spirit and
poured out by a ſanctified ſoul is ever ſweet and
pleaſant melodie in the eares of God, though the
tongue keep ſilence, and the phraſe of ſpeech
be rough and unpoliſhed: But let the outward
frame of words be never ſo ſmooth and well
ſet together, the prayer is not pleaſing unto
God if therein we crave things unlawfull and
impertinent, if it be read or uttered without
intention of heart, underſtanding, faith, &amp;c. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
in prayer with others, ſpecially in
the publick aſſemblie, words and decent phraſe
muſt not be neglected; becauſe all things muſt be
done gravely and to edification. To place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
in words, is ſuperſtition; to hunt after
quaint terms, is fooliſh vanity; but to neglect a
decent and comely manner of ſpeech, is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſneſſe.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23108:10"/>
Seeing then the uſe of the voice
is not of the eſſence of prayer, no man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
will deny that to be an holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
prayer which proceedeth from a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and upright heart, feeling its own or others
wants, and craving ſupply thereof according to
Gods will, whether the petitions be put up in the
ſelf-ſame or in other words.<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 44.</note> And yet becauſe
the ordinances of God muſt be kept from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
in the publick aſſembly it is good neither
to be over-neat, nor over-homely, but to uſe
ſuch a mean as doth moſt tend to the glory of
God and good of Gods people.</p>
            <p>Here a queſtion is moved, Whether a ſtinted
Liturgie or ſet form of prayer, publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
be lawfull in the deviſer or uſer?</p>
            <p>A penned or ſtinted prayer I call Prayer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the matter and externall form (becauſe
the matter is delivered in form of a prayer or
ſupplication tendred to God) though properly
it is not a prayer as it is penned or printed, but as
it is rehearſed as our prayer with underſtanding,
feeling of our wants, humilitie, confidence,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The controverſie is not of this or that preſcript
form in particular, much leſſe of one faulty or
erroneous, but of a preſcript form in generall;
Whether it be lawfull, eſpecially in the publick
aſſembly, to appoint any preſcript or ſet form of
prayer, though for matter never ſo ſound and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable.
For if the exception be againſt this or
that form in reſpect of the matter or maner of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23108:11"/>
impoſing, then the queſtion ſhould be, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this prayer for matter or manner of
impoſing be erroneous; not, Whether a ſtinted
form of prayer or Liturgie be lawfull. It is not
queſtioned, whether a man may ask things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
or impertinent in prayer: for the matter
of our prayer muſt be agreeable to the word of
God and our preſent occaſions. A prayer for
matter and externall form holy and fit, may by
accident be ſinfull in the uſer; <hi>viz.</hi> when it is
repeated without underſtanding or intention of
the heart. Of this there is no doubt. It is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alſo, that no one preſcript and ſtinted form
of prayer or Liturgie is ſimply neceſſary, either
in publick or private: for then our Saviour
Chriſt, who would not be wanting to his church
in things neceſſarie, would by his Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
have ſet down one to be an exact and
unchangeable rule to all Chriſtians and churches
to the worlds end, both for matter and form,
words and method, whereunto they ſhould have
been tied, and that alwayes. But ſeeing our
Saviour hath commanded no ſuch unchangeable
form, it is not the Neceſſity, but the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of a ſtinted Liturgie or ſet form of prayer
that is pleaded for; and that as a matter of order,
not of religion or ſubſtantiall means of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
For in this ſenſe, there is no means of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
expedient which is not neceſſary by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.
It was never held, that a man
ſhould ſo tie himſelf or be tied alwayes to a ſet
form without variation, that he ſhould never
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23108:11"/>
offer up any prayer unto God, as occaſion is
offered, and neceſſitie requireth, but what he
findeth in his book. Such uſe of a ſet and ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
form of prayer we do not acknowledge nor
ſeek to perſwade: But to reade prayer as a
prayer upon a book, or to make known unto
God the deſires of our heart in a ſet form of
words deviſed by others or our ſelves, when
the things we beg are allowable, fit and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
and when it is done with right affection, is
contrary to no precept or commandment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
or by lawfull conſequence.</p>
            <p>Amongſt them that oppoſe a ſet form of
prayer we may obſerve differences in opinion.<note place="margin">

<hi>theſe ſtinted and deviſed forms do quench the ſpirit
of prayer which God would have them uſe, ſtinting
the miniſter, yea all the miniſters of the kingdome,
to the ſame meaſure of the ſpirit, not onely one with
another, but all of them with him that is dead and
rotten: and ſo ſtinting the ſpirit, which the Lord
giveth to his miniſters for his church, and that ſo
ſtrictly, as till the ſtint be out, it may not ſuggeſt one
thought or word otherwiſe, or when it is out, one more
then is preſcribed.</hi> Nevertheleſſe his drift is, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to diſprove all ſtinted forms, as it is evident by
that he writeth in anſwer to ſome objections.

                  </gap>ted
as theſe men would have it: yet do I except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their ſervice-book in a double reſpect: The
firſt is, That the reading of prayers upon a book hath
no juſtification from them. If it be ſaid, that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a certain form of words to memory, and from it
to utter them, and to reade them upon a book, be all
one; I deny the conſequence: and though I approve
not the former, yet is the latter farre worſe.</hi> And
in another place;<note place="margin">Idem, pag. 425.</note> 
               <hi>You ſpeak not properly, no nor
truly, in ſaying, you Pray ſtinted prayers; for you
Read them: and who will ſay Reading is Praying? or
if you ſo ſay or do, is it agreeable either to his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23108:12"/>
or common reaſon?</hi> And in the page cited
laſt before, <hi>He that readeth hath another ſpeaking to
him as it were, even him whoſe writing he readeth,
and himſelf ſpeaketh not to God but to the people.</hi>
Thus alſo he ſpeaketh concerning the Lords
prayer,<note place="margin">Pag. 472.</note> 
               <hi>We may uſe a petition, two or more, or all, in
or of it, even word for word, if ſo the holy Ghoſt
(by whoſe immediate teachings and ſuggeſtions all our
requeſts muſt be put up) do direct us, and that we
apply the ſame words to our needs.</hi> And in the ſame
ſection, <hi>So neither is the reading of this preſcript, or
repeating it by memory, praying.</hi> Now let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
conſider and give ſentence, whether this
be not to condemn all ſet forms of prayer to be
uſed as prayer. And if more then down-weight
be required, his fourth reaſon againſt the ſtinted
form of ſervice in uſe in our church, will put
this beyond all exception. For thus he diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth;
<hi>As it were a ridiculous thing for a child,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. pag. 478.</note> 
               <hi>when
he would ask of his father bread, fiſh, or any other
thing he wanted, to reade it to him out of a paper: ſo
it is for the children of God, eſpecially for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpell in their publick miniſtrations, to
reade unto God their requeſts for their own and the
churches wants out of a ſervice-book, wherein they
are alſo ſtinted to words and ſyllables.</hi> So that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſpects and conſiderations laid aſide, for
what advantage ſoever alleadged, the ſimple
uſe of a ſtinted Liturgie or form of prayer, to be
uſed as a prayer, is diſallowed of them. And if
this be once accorded, the other reſpects will
eaſily be wiped away, at leaſt in regard of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23108:13"/>
uſers and them that joyn in prayer and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſacraments. In the copie of a letter
lately publiſhed againſt ſtinted Liturgies, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
willeth us to conſider,<note place="margin">Copie of a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 5.</note> 
               <hi>That the Liturgie he
excepteth againſt was deviſed by men,</hi> viz. <hi>other men
whom God hath not called to ſuch a work as to invent
forms of prayers which ſhould be uſed by all the
churches in the land for their prayers;</hi> and, <hi>That it is
impoſed upon the miniſter and the people of neceſſity;
That it is ſtinted both in matter and words, to be uſed
without variation;</hi> and, <hi>That the ſervice is read out
of a book many wayes faulty and corrupt.</hi> But look
to moſt of the reaſons brought to ſhew the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this exception, and they make againſt
all ſorts of ſtinted forms uſed as prayers, and not
againſt a form corrupt and faulty, impoſed in
ſuch or ſuch a manner:<note place="margin">Pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> as namely theſe; <hi>God did
never command to uſe, nor promiſe to accept ſuch a
worſhip; in which reſpect it is the manifeſt breach of
the ſecond commandment.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> 
               <hi>God hath appointed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
helps for prayer, which are ſufficient without
this.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Publick prayers offered up by the miniſter in
church-aſſemblies muſt be framed according to the
preſent and ſeverall occaſions of the church and people
of God (as alſo mens private prayers ought to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered)
which cannot be done when men are ſtinted to
forms.</hi> If you draw any concluſion from theſe
premiſes, it muſt be, That all ſtinted forms are
unlawfull; not, That a form corrupt and faulty is
to be diſallowed. But if the foreſaid cautions be
added. by way of diſtinction or limitation, as if
all ſtinted Liturgies were not diſliked, but ſuch
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23108:13"/>
onely as be impoſed as neceſſary to be uſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
variation, and for matter or form corrupt and
faulty; then the reaſons fight directly with the
concluſion, and hang no otherwiſe together
then if a man ſhould thus diſpute; All ſtinted
forms of prayer are not to be diſliked, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
onely, impoſed as neceſſary; becauſe God
did never command, nor promiſe to accept any
ſtinted ſervice or deviſed worſhip. For what
purpoſe therefore theſe cautions were added, let
others judge; whether by way of aggravation
onely, or to ſet the greater luſtre upon the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or for ſome other advantage. Some others
profeſſe, <hi>That they oppoſe not all nor any ſet form
ſimply as ſuch; but are perſwaded in many caſes there
is a lawfull uſe to be made of them: but ſuch a ſet form
as is preſcribed amongſt us for matter and manner
they affirm to be againſt the ſecond commandment,
and a ſin in the maker and deviſer of it to ſuch an uſe,
and a ſin in the uſer of it according to that deviſe or
making.</hi> But the lawfull uſe of ſuch forms, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or private, they allow onely in ſome caſe of
neceſſity, which cannot fall out in a miniſter of
the Goſpel, or any man elſe who deſerveth the
name of a ſtrong Chriſtian. For they ſuppoſe
abilities in all miniſters, and in every man elſe
who hath his wits exerciſed to diſcern good and
evil, and deſerveth to be eſteemed a ſtrong
man in Jeſus Chriſt. Their words be theſe; <hi>Set
forms have their proper place and lawfull uſe onely
where abilities are not, as a naturall means and help
to further ſome branch or other of that we call Prayer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23108:14"/>
or conceived prayer, as to ſupply defect of invention,
memory, utterance,</hi> or the like: <hi>So the lawfulneſſe of
it lieth onely in a caſe of ſome neceſſity.</hi> The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
then betwixt them, ſo farre as I can gather,
ſtandeth in this one thing, That theſe latter allow
ſome lawfull uſe of a ſtinted private form of
prayer in ſome caſes of neceſſity, which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
altogether condemned. But whether they
diſſent in any other particulars or no, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
to enquire further; or whether the latter take
away again what they ſeem to grant. In theſe
things they conſent: Firſt, that all publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies
and ſtinted forms of prayer be unlawfull,
a breach of the ſecond commandment both in
the deviſer and uſer. Secondly, that private
forms of prayer, if lawfull for weak Chriſtians
and babes in Chriſt, are unlawfull for ſtrong
men in Chriſt, or Chriſtians that have received
ſome growth in godlineſſe. Thirdly, that a
Chriſtian, weak or ſtrong, may not lawfully be
preſent at the prayers of the congregation read
or rehearſed out of a ſtinted Liturgie, nor at the
ſacraments adminiſtred in a ſtinted form of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
as it is with us. The Queſtion then hath
three branches: Firſt, whether a ſet form of
prayer, ſound and pertinent for ſubſtance of
matter, grave and ſimple for the order and
manner, not prejudicing, abbridging or hindring
by the length thereof the preaching of the word
and prayer fitted to the ſpeciall occaſions, may
in any ſort be tolerated in the church, or read by
the miniſter of the word in the publick aſſembly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23108:14"/>
and congregation of Saints. Secondly, whether
it be lawfull, ſpecially for a ſtrong Chriſtian, to
uſe a ſet form of prayer as prayer; or upon any
occaſion to reade as prayer a prayer upon a book.
Thirdly, in caſe it ſhould be unlawfull for the
miniſter or maſter of the family to reade or uſe a
preſcript form of prayer, whether it ſhould be
unlawfull alſo for the people, children, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to be preſent at ſuch aſſemblies where the
ſaid prayer is read or uſed. To theſe a fourth
may be added, to prevent all exceptions, whether
it be lawfull for a Chriſtian to be preſent at
that ſervice which is read out of a book in
ſomethings faulty either for matter or form.
In the affirmative the aſſertion is, That a ſtinted
Liturgie or form of prayer both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
is lawfull, and in ſome reſpects neceſſary,
both in the congregation, family, and cloſet;
That a miniſter godly, learned, and faithfull,
may ſometimes ſtand in need of the help of a
publick Liturgie or ſtinted form of prayer in
publick, and may make uſe of a ſtinted form at
other times when it is not neceſſarie in reſpect
of inabilitie or indiſpoſition; That though it
ſhould be unlawfull for the miniſter or gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the family to uſe ſuch ſtinted forms,
yet may the people in the congregation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
in the family be preſent at ſuch prayers
without ſinne or ſcruple of conſcience, yea
though the prayers be read out of a book in
ſomethings queſtionable for matter or form:
So that voluntarie and willing Separation from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23108:15"/>
the prayers of the congregation and ordinances
of worſhip for that cauſe onely, is ſinfull in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reſpects. Thus I have laboured plainly to
ſtate the queſtion, that I might neither be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
my ſelf, nor lead others into any by-path,
whiles they take their aim amiſſe. And theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
I purpoſe to diſcuſſe in the fear of God,

            <p>THe two former points may be confirmed
joyntly and ſeverally by theſe reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
1. That is a lawfull prayer wherein the
deſires of our hearts are lifted up or poured out
unto God for Divine bleſſing according to his
will, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, by the help of
the Spirit of grace: But in a ſet or ſtinted form
of prayer the deſires of the heart may be lifted
up or poured out unto God according to his

will,<note place="margin">Publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not made with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and in faith, unleſſe it be in a known tongue. Nor can a man pray in ſaith, and purely lift up his ſoul to God, who prayeth before or unto an Image.</note> &amp;c. Or, That form of prayer is juſt and
lawfull, wherein all things eſſentiall to prayer,
or neceſſarily required in the word of God, may
be obſerved: But all things eſſentiall to prayer,
or neceſſarily required in the word of God,
may be obſerved in a preſcript form or read
prayer. What is required in holy prayer more
then this, That the matter be allowable and
fit; the manner holy, reverent, fervent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;

not the ſame affections be moved in a preſcript
form and read prayer? What neceſſitie is there
that the heart and eye ſhould be at variance in
this duty, when they may be conjoyned in the

cannot be thought a thing impoſſible, to pray
with affection in a ſtinted and preſcribed form.
The differences which ſome put between Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God with a pſalme and Calling upon Gods
name are little to the purpoſe, do not at all
touch the force of the argument. For thus the
reaſon ſtandeth; In ſinging pſalmes penned by
the prophet David or other holy men of God,
the eye doth lead the heart no leſſe then it doth
in a ſtinted form of prayer, and yet they may be
ſung after an holy manner with grace in the
heart: therefore a ſtinted form of prayer may be
read or ſaid without book with that affection of
heart which God requireth in prayer. And let
the differences be as broad as they will in other
things; in this they do agree. This reaſon may
be drawn into another form, thus; Whatſoever
hath the true matter and form of prayer, that is
truly and properly a prayer. For where the true
matter and form of a thing is found, there follow
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23108:16"/>
all neceſſarie requiſites to the true and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
being thereof:<note place="margin">If in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Baptiſme no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the matter or form inward or outward, the worſhip it ſelf or ſubſtantiall means of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is approved of God and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</note> But a preſcript from of
prayer, ſound and fit for matter, grave for the
manner of penning, and read or uttered as our
prayer with knowledge, faith, reverence, and
fervencie of affection, hath the true matter and
form of prayer. For the matter of our prayers
are, thoſe common bleſſings and ſpeciall good
things which according to the will and pleaſure
of God we are to beg of him for our ſelves and
others. The true form of prayer (I ſpeak of
prayer uttered with the voice) is the outward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
and frame of words, and the inward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation
and lifting up of the heart to God by
the holy Ghoſt. Will any man ſay, that all
theſe things cannot be obſerved in a ſtinted form
of prayer? common experience will confute
him. Who knoweth not the matter of many
preſcript forms of prayer to be good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for all men? All our wants and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
occaſions are not mentioned or laid open
in the prayers conceived by the miniſter or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the family; and yet no man judgeth
them for that cauſe unlawfull, though imperfect.
It is not then prejudiciall to the lawfull uſe of a
preſcript form, that many particulars which we
ſtand in need of are not therein mentioned. Can
it not be read or uttered with right diſpoſition
of heart?<note place="margin">A man that readeth a form of prayer in a book, may be ſo affected with it, as in the deſires of his heart to go along with it, and to uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:23108:18"/>
This we have obſerved,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and do acknowledge
the forms of pſalmes, prayers and praiſes given
by the Prophets immediately called and choſen
of God, to be parts of the ſacred Canon, to
which it is not lawfull for particular churches,
or the whole church in generall, to adde the
leaſt jot or tittle. But this is not to the point in
hand: For we do not reaſon thus, That ſeeing the
Prophets by extraodinary and immediate cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
gave ſpeciall forms of prayer or praiſes to the
church upon ſpeciall occaſion, which are parts
of the Canon; therefore the church may do the
like: But thus we conclude, and that according
to the truth, That ſeeing holy men have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
and the faithfull have uſed theſe forms, not
by extraordinary inſpiration or ſpeciall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but upon grounds common to them and us,
the like forms may be preſcribed and uſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpeciall commandment: And ſeeing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and holy men of God, by inſpiration gave
certain pſalmes or forms of prayer and praiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the church, to be uſe upon ſpeciall occaſion,
which have the true matter and form of prayer
and praiſe, when they be uſed as a prayer or
thankſgiving, in faith, reverence, humility, &amp;c.
according to the preſent occaſion; therefore
prayer uttered in a ſtinted form of words, or read
upon a book as a prayer, may come from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and be tendred to God with right affection.
A man may reade when he prayeth, and the eye
may guide the heart, when the holy Ghoſt doth
lift up, and make it able to poure forth its deſires
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23108:18"/>
unto the Lord. And if thoſe forms of prayers
and praiſes which are parts of the ſcripture may
have the true nature, matter, &amp; form of prayer, &amp;c.
when they be uſed in faith, and by the power of
the holy Ghoſt enabling us to pray or praiſe the
Lord in that form; other forms of prayers or
praiſes fit for matter, may have the true matter &amp;
form of prayer, or praiſe, when they be uſed in
faith, by the power of the holy Ghoſt, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
requireth. For the prayers recorded in holy
ſcripture, have not the true nature and form of
prayer in reſpect of us becauſe they are recorded
in ſcripture, but as they are uſed by us in holy
manner upon fitting occaſion; and other forms fit
for the matter, uſed in ſuch manner as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
in faith, humility, reverence, &amp;c. by
the quickening power of the Spirit, have the true
matter and form of prayer as well as they.</p>
            <p>But thoſe forms are not the deviſe of man,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> as
be the other.</p>
            <p>True;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> as they be part of holy ſcripture they
are of God, both in reſpect of matter and form:
but as they be applyed without ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
to be the matter of form of a ſtinted
prayer or thankſgiving at this time, they are the
deviſe of man, that is, they are ſo applyed by man,
without the extraordinary guidance &amp; direction
of the holy Ghoſt. Let us ſuppoſe a ſtinted form
of Liturgie or prayer to be framed of the very
words and ſentences of ſcripture, wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be read by way of prayer, praiſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
or declaration of the end and uſe of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23108:19"/>
the ſacraments, but the very text of ſcripture,
if it be demanded whether this ſtinted Liturgie
be the deviſe of man or no; I conceive our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
will anſwer, That the matter and form
both is of God, as they are parcells of holy writ;
but as they are preſcribed and uſed as a ſtinted
form, it is the deviſe of man. This may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from their grounds: for all ſtinted forms
of prayer and adminiſtration to be uſed in the
publick congregation, not commanded of God,
be the deviſes of men, as they hold: But this
foreſaid ſtinted form is not commanded of God,
as they affirm: Therefore it is the deviſe of
men. There is now no form commanded of
God, as they profeſſe; and therefore to preſcribe
any text of ſcripture to be read in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the ſacraments, or the Lords prayer to
be uſed as a prayer, is the deviſe of man. What
is more conſtantly affirmed by them then this,
That a ſtinted form of Liturgie is no neceſſry
means of Gods worſhip; becauſe in time of the
Law God preſcribed none to his people when
they were in their minority. In times of the

That we are not neceſſarily bound to the very
words of the Lords prayer;<note place="margin">Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 18.</note> becauſe the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts

thoſe words, but uſed others according to their
ſeverall occaſions; nor do we reade in ſcripture
that they laid any bond upon the churches to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
over thoſe very words. Though therefore

be of God, and the form, as it is canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;

the ordinary uſe of the Lords prayer without
variation or addition is either commanded of
God, and ſo neceſſary, or deviſed by men, and
ſo free and arbitrarie; either it is a naturall help
(as ſome ſpeak) to ſupply ſome defect, or taken
up upon free choice: But it is not commanded of
God, it is not neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate praecepti</hi> or
<hi>medii,</hi> nor an help naturall to ſupply ſome defect:
Therefore it is free and arbitrarie, as that which
may be done onely; but it is not neceſſary to be
done.<note place="margin">Copie of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> This being obſerved, it will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
how little that diſtinction of uſing forms
inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, but not of forms
deviſed by men, will avail: becauſe there is no
form at all preſcribed by God, as they maintein.
Secondly, if that diſtinction be granted, it is here
impertinently alleadged, becauſe it cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to any part of the reaſon. For forms of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23108:20"/>
prayer inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, and record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as parts of the ſacred Canon, be not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
uſe for us becauſe they are recorded, have
not the true matter and form of prayer as they
are there regiſtred, but as they are put up in
faith to God, being ſuitable to our occaſions: and
a deviſed form of prayer, fit for the matter, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unto God in holy affiance by the work of the
holy Ghoſt, hath the true matter and form of
prayer. God never gave commandment that all
our petitions ſhould be preſented unto his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
in a form of words inſpired by the holy
Ghoſt immediately: God never diſallowed the
prayers of the faithfull, becauſe the externall
form or phraſe of ſpeech was deviſed by man.
If the deviſed form of prayer before and after
ſermon be worſhip acceptable to God, becauſe
it is deviſed of him who is called of God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
and endite it; then all men living are called
and commanded to deviſe the worſhip of God,
and not for themſelves alone, but others in ſome
caſes: Then the forms of prayer publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
morning and evening: the forms of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
before and after meals, is deviſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
but acceptable for the foreſaid reaſon. But
that God hath called and authorized every man
living, or all in the church, to deviſe a worſhip
acceptable to his Majeſty, is moſt ſtrange. And
ſo this firſt reaſon ſtands firm, That all things
eſſentiall to prayer, or neceſſarily required in
prayer by the word of God, may be obſerved
in a ſtinted from deviſed by men.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. A ſtinted Liturgie or publick form of prayer
is no breach of the ſecond commandment.</head>
            <p>THat which is the breach of no command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<note place="margin">2. Argument.</note> which is no where diſallowed in the
word of God either in expreſſe words or by
neceſſary conſequence,<note place="margin">1. John 3. 4.</note> that is no ſin:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> For ſin is
a tranſgreſſion of the law; and where there is
no law, there can be no ſin. But a preſcript form
of prayer of Liturgie is the breach of no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
is no where diſallowed in the word
of God. The expoſition of the commandments
is to be found in the Prophets and Apoſtles; but
the Lord by his Prophets and Apoſtles doth in
no place reſtrain us to the uſe of conceived pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
ſo to call it. Prayer is Gods ordinance, but
whether our prayers be uttered in our own or
others words, whether by pronouncing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that is not appointed. God requireth that
we lift up our hearts unto him, and ask of him
in the name of Chriſt whatſoever we ſtand in
need of and is agreeable to his will: But when
ſpake he one word of praying within book or
without, in this or that preciſe form of words?
More particularly, a ſtinted form of prayer, for
matter and externall form lawfull and pure, fit in
reſpect of our occaſions and the neceſſities of the
church, read or uttered with knowledge, affiance
and intention of heart, is not a breach of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23108:21"/>
commandment either in the deviſer or uſer.<note place="margin">All uſe of ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: for carving and cutting is the gift of God; and therefore a lawfull uſe thereof may be made, &amp;c. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative ſignes or monuments of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. All images ſimply forbidden must not (as I conceive) be referred to that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Deut. 4. 15. but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made to be worſhipped, or <hi>ad cultum.</hi> And if the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and the generall be of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature, not all inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worſhip or ſervice is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</note>
For if all ſtinted forms of publick prayer be a
tranſgreſſion of the ſecond commandment, then
in their common nature ſuch ſtinted forms agree
with images deviſed for worſhip: But ſtinted
forms or prayer agree not in their common nature
with images deviſed for worſhip. Falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
forbidden in the ſecond commandment is
oppoſite to the true worſhip which muſt in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
be inſtituted by God: But a ſtinted form of
prayer is not oppoſite to that worſhop which
muſt in ſpeciall be inſtituted by God. Falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
forbidden in the ſecond commandment is in
common nature, uſe and end one with that poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
worſhip which is there commanded: But a
ſtinted form of prayer is a matter of order, and
not for common nature, uſe and end one with the
true and pure worſhip of God there commanded.
The pure worſhip of God in ſpirit and truth is ſet
againſt the worſhip of images: But the pure
worſhip of God in ſpirit and truth is not oppoſite
to the worſhip of God in a ſtinted form of
words. Againſt a generall negative command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
no ſpeciall act affirmative is lawfull, unleſſe
the ſame be ſpecially warranted by the Law-giver.
But ſome ſtinted forms of prayer are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
which are not in ſpeciall warranted by the
Law-giver; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as we have liberty to uſe,
but are not tyed to uſe by any neceſſity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
If a publick ſtinted form of prayer be a
breach of the ſecond commandment, then all
publick ſtinted forms whereof there is the ſame
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23108:21"/>
formall reaſon and conſideration,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Semper ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alia generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus inſunt,</hi> Pandect. lib. 50. tit. 17. reg. 147.</note> both for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and things, are breaches of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
at all times and in all men: (for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, that a perpetuall commandment ſhould be
interpreted to forbid an act to one man, when, if
the formall reaſon and conſideration be the ſame in
all, it doth not forbid the ſame to every man.) But
every publick ſtinted form of prayer whereof
there is the ſame formall reaſon and conſideration,
is not a breach of the ſecond commandment in all
men and at all times. For there is the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
reaſon and conſideration of a publick ſtinted
form of prayers to Chriſtians now that there was
formerly to the Jews: The ſame formall reaſon
and conſideration, I ſay, not of this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
rite or ordinance which did peculiarly agree
to them in reſpect of the ſpeciall manner of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
proper to thoſe times; but of a ſtinted form
in generall, which was proper to them in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
but common to us with them. As for
example, If the prieſts might bleſſe in a ſtinted
form of words, the miniſters of the Goſpel may
do ſo likewiſe; If the Levites might praiſe God in
a ſtinted form of thanksgiving, the miniſters of
the Goſpel may uſe the Lords prayer as a prayer
without addition or variation. But all uſe of a
ſtinted form of prayer and thanksgiving was not a
breach of the ſecond commandment in the prieſts
and Levites. If a ſtinted arbitrary prayer be the
breach of the ſecond commandment, then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
prayer, when uttered, a ſin likewiſe: For
they both agree in the matter, as of God; in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

in that which maketh ſtinted prayer a breach of the
ſecond commandment, if it be a breach, there is
no difference. Therefore we conclude, That a ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
form of prayer is not a breach of the ſecond

Book-prayer is a manifeſt breach of the ſecond

            </p>
            <p>The reaſon,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I conceive, is, becauſe words are
ſignes of our conceits, and notes of the things
themſelves; writing is a ſigne or picture of the thing
ſignified: and ſo words deviſed by men, and books
of ſtinted prayers, are images or pictures of our
own deviſing.<note place="margin">Smith, Differ. chap. 6.</note> And in this ſenſe onely can a ſtinted
prayer be called a deviſed worſhip. For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the prayer is of God; it is the frame of words
and method onely that can be challenged to be of
man: and if deviſed words be not images con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
I cannot comprehend how the externall
form ſhould be an apparent breach of the ſecond
commandment. But if this reaſon be ought worth,
it is a manifeſt breach of the ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to preach, pray, adminiſter the ſacraments,
or reade the ſcriptures in a preſcribed tranſlation,
nay in a vulgar tongue. For in preaching and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the matter is of God, holy and good; but the
words and phraſes, of men. In tranſlations the
matter is immediately inſpired of God; but the
words are deviſed of men. The ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are Gods

what ſhall we ſay of the outward form of words

men be images condemned by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
do we not make one commandment of

ſuch as in common nature, uſe and end be one with

images forbidden in the ſecond precept. And ſeeing
for the affirmative part, poſitive worſhip, as it is to

The concluſion that followeth from theſe premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
is evidently falſe; therefore ſome one of them,
if not both, is falſe alſo: For of truth nothing but
truth can follow. And what they can anſwer to
the premiſſes of this latter argument, the ſame will
be ſufficient to overthrow the other. Catechizing
is Gods ordinance: but this or that form of cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme
in reſpect of method and phraſe of ſpeech is
the collection and compoſition of man. Reading
the ſcripture is allowed of God: but the diviſion
of the law into fiftie three or fiftie foure greater
ſections, and the ſubdiviſion of theſe into leſſer
ſections; the partitions of ſeverall books into chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the diviſion of them into verſes; the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
of this or that portion of the law, the
prophets, and the evangeliſts to be read ordinarily
upon this or that day, is the invention or deviſe of
man. Preaching is commanded of God, ſo is the
interpretation of the ſcripture; but the phraſe and
method of ſermons is of men. The matter of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the immediate truth of God, but the words
and phraſes which are as veſſels to convey this
truth unto us (I ſpeak of tranſlations, not of the
originall text) are humane, and not of God by
immediate inſpiration. God commandeth us to
call upon his name both in publick and private; but
the words wherein we expreſſe our deſires are our
own both in conceived and ſtinted prayer. Theſe
are humane in reſpect of the word and form;
Divine in reſpect of the matter. And here it muſt

            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:23108:26"/>
They might eaſily anſwer themſelves; As it is
penned or printed it hath onely the externall form,
and ſo it is not properly a prayer: but as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed
with underſtanding, affiance of heart, and
fervency, it hath the true and whole nature of
prayer. And by what reaſon can a book-prayer be
called an image of true prayer which will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to prayer firſt conceived and then uttered?
For if it be uttered with the lips without the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the heart, it is a bare ſimilitude: and if the
other be read or uttered after an holy manner, with
that affection which God requireth in prayer, it
is true and acceptable prayer. Words without the
heart are but empty ſounds, whether read, or
pronounced out of the memory, or <hi>ex tempore:</hi>
and if the voice be joyned with the heart it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
melody, though our petitions be read out of a
book. But the book then (ſaith he) ſupplieth the
room of the word and ſpirit. Nothing leſſe: For
the word of God directeth us what to ask, even
when we reade our prayers upon a book, ſo long as
we crave with underſtanding things agreeable to
the will of God: And the ſpirit doth enable and
ſtirre us up to deſire that which is according to
Gods will and our neceſſity. We may utter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
with our lips in conceived prayer without

is no ſtrange manner of worſhip; becauſe in it all
things required to the nature of true prayer may be
obſerved. In the word of God we have direction
given, to whom, for what, with what heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
to what end a man ought to pray: but in

we find nothing preſcribed in particular,

then this, That order, decency, and edification be
obſerved. That which hath the common nature,
definition, uſe and end of worſhip, but wanteth
Divine authority and inſtitution to make it appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and true worſhip, that is ſtrange in the worſhip
of God: But the method and phraſe of ſpeech
hath not the common nature, definition, uſe or end

prayer ſo a ſet form of prayer is for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and nature agreeable to the rules of direction
delivered in the word of truth, though for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and words both the humane. Let our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
ſet down out of the word of God what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
and eſſentially required to the nature and
being of true prayer, &amp; ſhew (if they be able) that
ſome one or other condition or requiſite cannot
be obſerved in a preſcript or ſtinted form. If this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23108:27"/>
cannot be done (as I think it never hath nor can
be) how dare they eſteem or ſtyle it a ſtrange wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?
They tell us, God hath not ordained that
manner of worſhip. But this phraſe, <hi>the manner
of worſhip,</hi> is uſed two wayes: firſt, as it noteth the
ſubſtantiall means of worſhip ordained of God by
ſpeciall inſtitution: ſecondly, as it is put for the
outward order or form how this worſhip or means
of worſhip is performed. A third ſignification
might be added, as when we ſay the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
teacheth in what manner the name and
ordinances of God are to be uſed. Now if it be
taken in the firſt or third ſignification, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
frame of words, order, and method is neither
means nor manner of worſhip, either in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
prayer, or adminiſtration of the ſacraments. If
in the ſecond, the word of God doth not preſcribe
any particular form,<note place="margin">Aug. in epiſt. 121. cap. 12.</note> ſtinted or not ſtinted, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,

of God in particular, then that and none

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23108:27"/>
ſignes which God hath deſigned in the covenant,
are neceſſary, and thoſe onely lawfull: and if me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod

ſubſtance a prayer read and conceived is all one,
and the one is no more a ſtrange manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
then the other. And here let it be obſerved,
that all theſe objections are made againſt all uſe of
ſtinted or read prayers, publick or private, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
or impoſed, ſound and pertinent as well as
corrupt, and cannot be reſtrained to a form im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon the miniſter of the congregation to be
uſed continually, and that corrupt and faulty.</p>
            <p>The matter,<note place="margin">Object. 6.</note> if ſuppoſed to be alike from God,
as being truth and according to ſound doctrine;
the manner (in that we call conceived prayer) is
the ſame which nature teacheth and ſcripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth,
and is the onely way in which the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of all holy men recorded in ſcripture ſince
Chriſt have been carried, as the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
grant. But for the manner or way of book-prayer,
we have not ſo much as example in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength of this reaſon let us view in the

againſt the uſe of tranſlations for the hearers thus
he argueth;<note place="margin">Idem, cap. 17.</note> 
               <hi>The Prophets and Apoſtles wrote books,
but did never divide their books into chapters and
verſes: Seeing therefore that chapters and verſes were
of mans invention, hence it followeth, before chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and verſe came in, the hearers could not turn to
ſearch their books in time of hearing. The Apoſtles
in quoting teſtimonies of the prophets do not quote
chapter and verſe, but onely ſay, It is written, The
ſcripture ſaith, The holy Ghoſt ſaith: thereby teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us that there is no uſe of chapter and verſe for
ſearching in time of hearing. Never was there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of any hearer that ever had his book to
ſearch in time of hearing.</hi> The reaſons be the
ſame, and yet I perſwade my ſelf, they that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
a ſtinted form of prayer will not allow of
the concluſion which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Smith would inferre.
As for the reaſon it ſelf, whatſoever can be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpoken of the excellency, profit and uſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
prayer, we freely and willingly admit: but
betwixt it and ſtinted prayer there is no ſuch
diſagreement, that if the one be praiſed, the other
muſt needs be caſt out of doores; if the one be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
the other muſt needs be a breach of the
ſecond commandment. Nature teacheth, that
from the abundance of the heart the mouth ſhould
ſpeak: and in the uſe of a ſtinted form, repeated by
memory, or read upon a book, the mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the abundance of the heart; elſe in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23108:28"/>
ſtinted uſe of pſalms, prayers or prayſes the ſaints
of God recorded in ſcripture ſpake not from the
heart. If no example of any holy man ſince Chriſt
be recorded in ſcripture who hath tendered his
prayers to God in a ſtinted form of words, or read
them out of a book, is this any thing againſt that
practice? Is not the approved practice of the
church of the Jews grounded upon reaſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them and us, and of perpetuall equity, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to juſtifie an act or order, though no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can be brought for it out of the new teſtament?
I have not heard nor read of ſuch an exception in
a matter of this nature in any writer, old or new,
Popiſh or Proteſtant; and conſider, I pray, what
dangerous conſequences would follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon?
I will not preſſe them, becauſe upon ſecond
thoughts (I make no queſtion) it will appear
farre amiſſe. If in that particular of ſtinted prayer
we find not example, will it not ſuffice if from
grounds of ſcripture we can prove it lawfull, and
that all things required in prayer may be obſerved
in a ſtinted form? If in that particular there be
none examples, will it not ſuffice that analogicall
examples of things of the ſame nature and kind
may be produced? And then it will not be hard
to find examples ſince Chriſt for the uſe of ſtinted
prayer, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. But what if
none example could be produced of that or the
like practice? The ſcripture doth not deſcend to
give particular commandment or example for
every thing perteining to order or manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Divine things: It is ſufficient that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23108:29"/>
there be generall rules found for that purpoſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which particulars muſt be directed.
Nay, which is more, ſundry things are not onely
lawfull but neceſſary, for which you can bring no
example out of the word of God, neither before
nor ſince Chriſt. I will ſpare to mention parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
becauſe I would not teach profane men to
wrangle.</p>
            <p>God may have as much honour or more in our
publick aſſemblies,<note place="margin">Object. 7.</note> if a ſtinted form were not uſed.
And this is a certain truth, That whatſoever the
worſhip and ſervice of God may ſpare without
detriment either to the honour of God or edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints, is ſuperfluous, and ſo but a vain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
            <p>If all this be granted, it will not follow,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that a
ſtinted form is againſt the ſecond commandment,
of the ſame common nature with an image. For
in publick adminiſtration of Gods ſervice, in the
outward order, method and phraſe many things
are laid aſide by the moſt, and might be ſpared by
all men, which are againſt no commandment.
And the like may be ſaid of ſundry obſervations.
The cuſtome of godfathers and godmothers in
baptiſme, of calling an aſſembly by the ſound of a
bell, of buriall in church-yards might be ſpared,
and yet not againſt the ſecond commandment.
When there be many wayes or means whereby a
thing may be atteined, it is not an idle invention
ordinarily to chooſe the one or other, as ſeemeth
expedient. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Robinſon diſputeth thus againſt
our ſtinted form of prayer; <hi>It cannot be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23108:29"/>
of Chriſt, becauſe the church may perfectly and
entirely worſhip God without it, with all the parts of
holy and ſpirituall worſhip, as did the apoſtolick
churches for many yeares before ſuch Liturgie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
or impoſed.</hi> I ſhould think both theſe reaſons
carry the ſame ſenſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> That that may be ſpared
without which the church may perfectly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
worſhip God with all parts of holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
worſhip. And if that be the meaning, then
I deny that to be a ſuperfluous or vain invention
which might be ſpared without detriment either
to the honour of God or edification of Saints. For
ſet forms of bleſſing, catechiſmes, adminiſtration
of the ſacraments, be not ſuperfluous and vain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
and yet all parts of Gods ſpirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
may perfectly and entirely be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them.<note place="margin">It is not from God by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial means or help of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that this or that diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſcripture be obſerved, much leſſe that which the Jews uſed, or is now obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in our church: But the diviſion is of God, as that which is done according to the generall rules of ſcripture may be ſaid to be from him: which is not to the purpoſe.</note> The uſe of a ſet tranſlation of holy
ſcripture to be read in the congregation by ſuch
or ſuch portions or ſections, is no vain invention:
the diſtribution of it into chapters and verſes, the
quotation of chapter and verſe, the marginall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
are no ſuperfluous deviſes: and yet the
church may perform all parts of Gods worſhip
entirely and perfectly without theſe, as did the
apoſtolick churches. The preſcribing of a ſet
form of pſalmes to be ſung by all the people joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
together, is no ſuperfluous deviſe, and yet it
may be ſpared without detriment either to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God or edification of the people, as it was
in the apoſtolick churches for many years: Of

which more in the next chapter. Set forms of
confeſſions of churches, ſet forms of profeſſions
of faith to be uſed in the publick worſhip of God,
be not vain inventions, and yet you may ſay of
them as you do of ſtinted forms of prayer, They
may be ſpared, There is no example for them in
ſcripture ſince Chriſt. The word <hi>conſubſtantiall</hi>

that truth of the Divinity of our Saviour Chriſt
cannot be mainteined; (for that were to accuſe the
holy pen-men of ſcripture) yet was it not an idle

churches before preaching-time the church aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
hath the ſcriptures read in ſuch order that the

principall points thereof taken and applyed unto
their auditours: Neither of theſe ſimply neceſſary,

yea to preſcribe that men ſhall ordinarily kneel
in publick prayer, if with conveniency they may,
is not an idle invention; and yet men may pray
ſitting, ſtanding, falling upon the face. Men may

and precedents are not idle inventions. And
though it be poſſible to worſhip God aright and
further the edification of his Saints as much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
as with a ſet form, yet a ſet form of prayer
deviſed and conſented unto (if it were poſſible) by
all the ſound, true, orthodox churches in the
world, is in many reſpects expedient; ſuch a form
as being free from all exception, apprved of all,
might teſtifie their ſweet harmonie and concent.
And the like may be ſaid of forms of cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes,
<note place="margin">See Calvin Opuſe. epiſt. catechiſ. &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 87.</note> confeſſions, &amp;c. A ſtinted form then of
publick prayer is not one in common nature with
images deviſed for worſhip, nor oppoſite to the
worſhip which muſt in ſpeciall be inſtituted of
God; it is no vain or ſuperfluous deviſe, much

pointed to that ſervice. And many things were
lawfull in the old Teſtament, being according to
Gods word, that are not ſo now, <hi>viz.</hi> things that
were proper and peculiar to them and thoſe times
in reſpect of the manner of diſpenſation Divine.<note place="margin">Privilegia quaedam cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae ſunt, quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam perſonae: et id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But things which have grounds and reaſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to thoſe and our times, in reſpect of perſons
and things, and do not in peculiar reſpects belong
unto them onely, theſe, if lawfull to them, are
lawfull to us; and, if forbidden to us, they are
forbidden to them. And of this ſort is a ſtinted
form of prayer or bleſſing, not peculiar to them
but common to us with them, not a priviledge of
the perſons but of the cauſe. It is given for a rule
concerning examples, That a reaſon drawn from
them doth neceſſarily conclude,<note place="margin">See Jun. in Jud. v. 6, 7. &amp; Append. parall. ſacr. par. 11. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold. Cenſur. tom. 2. praelect. 188, 189, 190, &amp;c.</note>

But the publick uſe of a ſtinted, free, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarie
form of prayer, praiſe, or bleſſing, is
grounded upon reaſons and conſiderations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the prieſts or Levites and the miniſters of
the Goſpel; the things are like, and this likeneſſe
is common to the whole kind; not materiall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
can be named which ſhould appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
it unto them onely. Therefore if the publick
ſtinted uſe of prayer or bleſſing was not a breach
of the ſecond commandment in them, it is not a
ſin againſt that commandment in us. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that their forms were not as ours, ſtrictly
impoſed, ordinarily to be uſed without ſo much as
the variation of a word. But this unlooſeth not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23108:31"/>
the knot, but rather tyeth it the faſter. For if it
be a ſin againſt the ſecond commandment to uſe
ſuch a form, it muſt not be done once: If it be
no ſin, it is not made ſinfull by this, that it is uſed
this week, or the next, as occaſion is offered. If it
be lawfull to uſe the Lords prayer as a ſtinted
form, it is not made unlawfull, that I uſe it in theſe
preciſe words without addition or alteration. And
if the prieſts were not tyed to one preciſe form of
bleſſing without addition or alteration, yet might
they lawfully uſe one form without addition or
variation; and that which was allowable in them,
is not unlawfull in us, upon the ſame grounds and
conſiderations. So that we may ſumme up this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thus; If publick ſtinted forms of bleſſing,
prayer, or praiſe, might be uſed ordinarily by the
prieſts, Levites, and miniſters of the Goſpel
without addition or alteration, then all ſtinted
forms to be uſed ordinarily without addition or
alteration be not a breach of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
in common nature one with an image
deviſed for worſhip. But the prieſts and Levites
in the time of the Law, and the miniſters of the
Goſpel in the New Teſtament, might ordinarily
uſe a ſtinted form without addition or alteration.
Or thus it may be framed; If a publick ſtinted
form of prayer be unlawfull, then either ſimply
and abſolutely all ſtinted forms to be uſed in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
or ſuch onely as are to be uſed ordinarily
without alteration or addition, or ſuch onely as
be corrupt and faulty: But a publick ſtinted form
is not ſimply and abſolutely unlawfull: for then
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23108:32"/>
this exception, That it is to be uſed ordinarily and
without alteration, is vain and ſuperfluous; not
onely becauſe it is ordinarily to be uſed without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
or addition: for then that conſideration
taken away, a ſtinted form ſhould be juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
as alſo then it ſhould be lawfull at one time
to uſe this or that phraſe of ſpeech, unlawfull at
another, when yet the ſame occaſion requireth it.
If onely becauſe corrupt and faulty, then a ſtinted
form is not an humane invention, a breach of the
ſecond commandment, an idole-prayer, a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
deviſe to be condemned; then the fault and
corruption removed, the form it ſelf is lawfull
to be uſed without addition or variation.</p>
            <p>A ſtinted form of prayer is not unlawfull to him
that needeth it,<note place="margin">Object. 9.</note> as not able largely to expreſſe his
own deſires, or lay open his wants particularly:
but to him that is able and needeth it not it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull;
becauſe in ſuch caſe a ſet form of prayer
is an arbitrary help or furtherance forbidden by
the ſecond commandment.</p>
            <p>But then a ſet form of prayer in words deviſed
by others or by a mans ſelf,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> is not unlawfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſtinted or deviſed, not of it ſelf, nor to all,
but by accident onely. Then it is not a deviſed
worſhip, ſtrange incenſe, an idole-prayer, an
image of prayer, forbidden in the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:
for whatſoever is verified of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
as generall, is verified of all underneath it.
Then they muſt not ſay, Humane inventions in
Gods worſhip are forbidden; but, Humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the worſhip of God are lawfull to them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23108:32"/>
that need them, unlawfull to them that need them
not, becauſe arbitrarie. Then the exception of
uſing a ſtinted form ordinarily without alteration
or addition is altogether fruitleſſe: for the form is
unlawfull becauſe arbitrarie. And for the thing it
ſelf, it is an unwritten tradition, becauſe it hath
no ground in ſcripture. For it is a received rule,
That all diſtinctions in Divinity not grounded
upon the word of God, are unwritten traditions,
indeed humane unwarrantable inventions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
But this diſtinction, That a ſtinted form
of prayer is warrantable to him that needeth it,
becauſe of his inability, unwarrantable to him
that needeth it not, is grounded upon no text of
ſcripture, or ſolid conſequence drawn from
thence. All arbitrarie helps and furtherances in
Gods ſervice are not forbidden in the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;
nor any help or furtherance, becauſe
arbitrarie in this ſenſe; that is, no help or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23108:33"/>
any preſcript form of prayer, either for
ſome time or for ever, to all men or ſome onely,
that form to ſuch and at ſuch times had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and that alone lawfull, becauſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
If God had tied men to conceived prayer
without any ſet or ſtinted form deviſed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
or impoſed by others, that alone had been
lawfull, becauſe determined: But ſeeing we are
enjoyned to pray, confeſſe ſinne, entreat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mercy,
and no ſet form determined; therefore any fit
form is warrantable, one as well as another. For
where the law hath put no difference, it is not for
us to diſtinguiſh. Let it be demanded of a man
when he prayeth, why he uſeth that form he then
uſeth, what anſwer can he return but this, That
no form is determined, and ſo any Fitting form
is warrantable? Or if he anſwer otherwiſe in
effect, he ſhall anſwer amiſſe; as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true ground of the lawfulneſſe of that
he doth. No man hath authoritie to deviſe
any ſubſtantiall means of worſhip, which
muſt be referred to the ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no more then he may teach new doctrines
or inſtitute new ſacraments in Gods church upon
his own head. But the order, phraſe, or method,
which is deviſed by man, is no worſhip of God.
And if we put no difference betwixt the poſitive
worſhip of God, which he hath in particular
commanded, and muſt not be deviſed of men, and
the order, phraſe and method in which his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is performed, it is not poſſible to worſhip
God aright without ſinne. But if we ſhall loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:23108:34"/>
more narrowly into the former diſtinction, we
ſhall find it flat contradictorie to it ſelf and to the
commandment. For by <hi>arbitrarie furtherances</hi>
we muſt underſtand, not deviſed furtherances,
which this anſwer granteth to be lawfull, but
furtherances which are not neceſſary to one man
though lawfull to another. And then whereas
the ſecond commandment forbiddeth deviſed
worſhip, which is unlawfull, as contrary to the
eternall rule of righteouſneſſe; by this anſwer
arbitrarie furtherances, not deviſed furtherances,
ſhould be condemned: which is clean contrary to
the ſcope and end of the commandment. For
example, when the commandment ſaith, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image,</hi> &amp;c.
If a man ſhall diſtinguiſh thus, <hi>Deviſed images are
not unlawfull to him that needth, but onely arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
images,</hi> ſc. <hi>to him that needeth them not,</hi> ſhould
he not ſpeak contrary to the commandment? The
caſe is the ſame in this particular: For the things
forbidden in the ſecond commandment are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
nature one with an image, <hi>ſc.</hi> deviſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
which carrieth not the ſtamp or approbation
of God. And when a ſtinted or ſet form of prayer
is impleaded as contrary to that royall precept, do
they not ſpeak contradictories that ſay, A ſtinted
form is lawfull to him that needeth it, but an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
form unlawfull, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſtinted or deviſed
form, to him that needeth it not? For this is as
much as to ſay, deviſed worſhip is lawfull and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
in him that needeth that help; but arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

If the woman be not able, then in ſtead of a lamb a

hath ſo appointed: otherwiſe (I ſhould

bring a pigeon that was not of ability to bring a
lamb: For her extreme neceſſitie had freed her
from the law, but authoritie ſhe had none to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
one rite in the place of another. If we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
theſe inſtances to the matter in hand, they will
not hold: For God never forbad a ſtinted form
of prayer; never gave commandment, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
did offer the ſacrifice of prayer ſhould bring
a conceived prayer; nor by diſpenſation ſpeciall
and peculiar warranted him that wanteth a concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
to bring a book-prayer. And if the caſes be
like, (I ſhould think) the Lord would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
a ſet form for the weak and feeble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
as he hath appointed the oblation of the
poor woman, and not left him to ſeek up and

And if the Lord have determined any ſet

               </gap>e, then the weak Chriſtian muſt
uſe that alone and none other. Let this diſtinction
paſſe for currant, and what commandment is
there which may not be deluded: For, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to theſe poſitions, we may ſay, Images muſt
not be deviſed for worſhip, but in ſome caſe of
neceſſitie: for they may be naturall helps to teach or
ſtirre up affection, as well as a book may be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
help to ſupply ſome defect in prayer: The
miniſter muſt not uſe wine, milk, or roſe-water as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23108:35"/>
the outward ſigne in baptiſme, unleſſe it be in
ſome caſe of neceſſity, as a naturall help to ſupply
the defect of water: The midwife muſt not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
out of the caſe of neceſſity, when the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

of neceſſity, when an ignorant man is choſen to
ſupply his room: A man muſt not defraud or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent
his neighbour; it is true, unleſſe it be in

a book ſhould be a naturall help to ſupply ſome
defect in caſe of neceſſitie, and ceaſe to be naturall
when voluntarily uſed as an help and furtherance
by him that needeth it not.</p>
            <p>The concluſion of all is this; That a ſtinted pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

no forbidden invention of man, either in

            <head>CHAP. IIII. It is as lawfull to pray unto God in a form of
words deviſed by others, as to ſing pſalmes to
the praiſe of God in a ſtinted form of words
preſcribed by others.</head>
            <p>IF it be lawfull to ſing pſalmes to the prayſe of
God in a ſtinted form of words preſcribed by
others and deviſed by man,<note place="margin">3. Arg.</note> then likewiſe to pray
unto God in a ſtinted form deviſed by others. For as
prayer is an ordinance of God and a branch of his
worſhip, ſo is ſinging of pſalmes to the prayſe of
God: As God hath left no ſtinted form of
prayer for his church whereunto he hath tied all
men and all churches, no more hath he preſcribed
any ſtinted form of ſinging as neceſſary for all
times and churches in the new Teſtament: As the
one muſt be done with the heart and ſpirit, ſo the
other: As in the one the words are deviſed by
men and preſcribed by others, ſo in ſinging of
pſalmes: If the one be the invention of man, a
ſtrange prayer, the ſimilitude of a prayer; the
other is an invention of man, a ſtrange pſalme, the
ſimilitude of a pſalme. And if a man be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to reaſon againſt ſinging of pſalmes in a form of
words deviſed by others, he might more plauſibly
argue, That in the infancy of the church, when
God ſaw a ſet form of pſalmes to be neceſſarie, he
inſpired holy men to pen holy and divine pſalmes,
which might be of uſe for that time, when ſuch
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23108:36"/>
worſhip was required: but in the times of the new
Teſtament no ſet form of ſinging is preſcribed of
God; no authoritie is given to the church or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
officers to preſcribe any ſet form which
might be of uſe to all churches; there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
precept for nor precedent of any preſcript
form of ſinging in the ſcripture ſince Chriſts time;
all eſſentiall parts of Gods worſhip may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without it, as appeareth by the examples
of the primitive churches: and ſeeing God never
commanded nor promiſed to accept any ſuch ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forms, it is a manifeſt breach of the ſecond
commandment. Theſe and ſuch like arguments
do make as ſtrongly in every point againſt a ſtinted
form of pſalmes as againſt a preſcript form of
prayer. But I have not read, that the ſinging of
pſalmes in a preſcript form deviſed by others is
unlawfull.</p>
            <p>Singing of pſalmes and praying differ many
wayes:<note place="margin">Object. 1. Robinſ. Juſtiſ. againſt Bern. pag. 467.</note> as, Many pſalmes are for inſtruction one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

alone uttereth the words, the people adding
their <hi>Amen</hi> in the end; but in ſinging, every perſon
in the church pronounceth every word and ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
aloud.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Greenwood, Againſt Giff. pag.</hi> 13. You ſpeak like an ignorant man to ſay that ſinging is prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> The pſalmes are parts of ſcriptures,
wherein God ſpeaketh unto us, teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
us, and we our ſelves, and one another
mutually. Prayers are poured forth in proſe;
pſalmes in verſe. In prayer we beg things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for our ſelves and others; in pſalmes we
praiſe God for mercies received,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is vain to examine or alledge theſe or ſuch
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23108:37"/>
like differences, becauſe they make nothing to
weaken the force of the argument. For be the
differences never ſo many in theſe and other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
in this they agree, that they be parts of
worſhip to be performed according to the will and
commandment of God: and therefore if a ſtinted
form of prayer be unlawfull, becauſe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
or ordained of God; a ſtinted form of
pſalmes, not bearing the Lords ſtamp, muſt come
under the ſame cenſure, unleſſe they can plead ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
diſpenſation for it. And if a preſcript form
of pſalmes not commanded of God be allowable
and may be uſed in Gods ſervice, a ſtinted form
of prayer is unjuſtly cenſured for that reaſon. It
is a received rule,<note place="margin">Quicquid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit tali quà tale, convenit omni tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>A Quatenus ad Omne valet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum.</hi>
If ſtinted prayer be unwarrantable
becauſe it is not appointed of God; a ſtinted form
of ſinging not commanded muſt not be uſed. If a
preſcript form of ſinging not commanded of God
be approveable in his ſight, for that cauſe a ſtinted
form of prayer muſt not be diſliked. One circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that putteth a materiall difference in the
thing or perſon from whence the argument or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of likeneſſe is drawn, is ſufficient to weaken its
force: but twentie particular differences betwixt
the branches of worſhip weaken not an argument
drawn from the agreement of the branches in the
common nature of worſhip: Of which ſort this
is. The Anabaptiſts may put many differences
betwixt circumciſion and baptiſme; and yet the
argument is good againſt them, Infants of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
parents ought to be baptized, becauſe the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23108:37"/>
children of Jews in covenant were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
For let the particular differences be never
ſo many, in this they agree, That they are both
ſacraments of initiation, and ſo belong to them
that be in covenant, <hi>ſc.</hi> the faithfull and their ſeed.
The Papiſts put many differences betwixt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
and the ſacraments of the new Teſtament;
and yet this is a good &amp; ſtrong argument, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
is a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſacraments are ſeals of the covenant of
grace. For however circumciſion and baptiſme
and the Lords ſupper differ in their particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in the common authour, nature and end of
ſacraments they agree. This is a ſound and good
reaſon, that lay-men and midwives ought not to
baptize, Becauſe God hath coupled together the
authoritative preaching of the word and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the ſacraments; and yet it is no hard
matter to aſſigne many particular differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the word and ſacraments. A caviller might
eaſily have found out many particular differences
betwixt the ſin of the angels and the Sodomites,
and thoſe againſt whom the Apoſtle writeth; but
that had not infringed his argument from thoſe
examples. It is a ſuperfluous thing to heap up
differences which are nothing to the point in hand.
And if we compare this anſwer with the reaſons
marſhalled to fight againſt a ſtinted form of prayer,
it doth plainly overthrow and put them to ſlight.
For thus they muſt needs run, Means of Divine
worſhip not ordained of God are unlawfull; to
wit, in ſtinted prayer, but not in forms of praiſing

form of prayer is ſtrange worſhip, <hi>ſc.</hi> when the
miniſter ſpeaketh alone to God, but not when the
congregation pronounceth every word with the
miniſter: for then either a deviſed form is not
ſtrange worſhip, or all ſtrange worſhip is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.
Mens inventions in Gods worſhip are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull:
what all inventions or deviſed forms?
No, but deviſed forms in proſe, not in verſe;
when we pray, not when we praiſe God; when
we ſpeak to God, not when we admoniſh one
another. Becauſe this anſwer cometh often,
I deſire our brethren to conſider, whether any
other conſtruction can poſſibly be made of it then
this, and whether ought can be ſpoken more
groſſe and contradictory to their poſitions. The
diſcourſes that I have ſeen againſt ſtinted forms of
prayer in generall need no other confutation,
but an underſtanding reader to obſerve how in this
anſwer they turn the edge of their own weapons
againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>The penmen of the pſalmes were prophets ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily

by the prophets are paterns and forms of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſongs, but not ſet forms preſcribed to us as
pſalmes to be ſung in thoſe very words and forms.
Though the pſalmes be parts of the canonicall
ſcripture, our brethren muſt eſteem the uſe of them
as a preſcript form to be the deviſe of man; becauſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23108:39"/>
God hath not given them to that end, nor by his
commandment tied us and all churches to them
and none others, in the preciſe form of words.
When in the new Teſtament we are exhorted to

that the pſalmes ſhould be ſung by the whole
multitude that were preſent. And if it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
yet is not a preſcribed form in that reſpect
neceſſary. In preaching and prayer both, before
that people can joyn with the miniſter, a ſtinted
form of words is neceſſary; and this is all can be
ſaid of ſinging. This or that form preſcribed is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23108:40"/>
neceſſarie in neither; a ſtinted form is neceſſary
in both. The people cannot ſing with the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
unleſſe what is to be ſung be repreſented unto
them in a ſet form of words; nor can they joyn
in prayer, or attend to the word preached, unleſſe
the matter of prayer or preaching be conveyed to
their underſtanding in a ſet form of words. Is a
miniſter able to expreſſe the neceſſities of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or the doctrine of ſalvation in a form of words
deviſed and ſtudied by himſelf, and is he not able
by meditation and ſtudy to dictate or compoſe a
pſalme to be ſung by the people as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth?
And if he be able to compoſe a pſalme,
in reſpect of the form of words and method, is
not a ſtinted form of ſinging a deviſed help, an
arbitrary help to him, and ſo forbidden, as it was
ſaid of prayer? Chriſt hath given gifts unto his
miniſters for preaching and prayer; hath he not
for ſinging of pſalmes also? And if it be a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to Chriſt (as ſome affirm) that they ſhould
uſe a form of prayer deviſed by others, is it not
a diſhonour likewiſe that they ſhould uſe a form of
ſinging deviſed by others, as not enabled with
gifts of themſelves to furniſh the neceſſities of the
church? When preſcribed and ſet forms of
pſalmes were neceſſary in the church of the Jews,
did the Lord commit this office to the prieſts, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
or ordinary officers of the church, or to the
prophets extraordinarily inſpired and called of
God to this purpoſe? To whom hath the Lord
committed that charge, and given ordinary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to preſcribe forms of ſinging in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23108:41"/>
churches in the new Teſtament? If thee be ſuch
difference, as is pretended, betwixt the deviſed
forms of praying and ſinging, it is neceſſary that
he that denieth the one to be lawfull and challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
liberty in the other, ſhould ſhew his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
<note place="margin">Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt fitteth his ſervants with gifts for
the whole work of the miniſtery, to pray as well as to
preach by their own gifts: for prayer is an ordinance
of the new Teſtament as well as preaching; and they
are made able thereunto, not by ſhewing the ſufficiency
of other men whoſe prayer they reade; but their ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
is of God enabling them.</hi> Thus our brethren
reaſon againſt read or preſcribed prayer; and doth
not the ſame hold as truly againſt the uſe of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
pſalme? To ſing pſalmes is an ordinance
of the new Teſtament, and the miniſter of God is
enabled to ſing as well as to pray by his own
gifts; otherwiſe he is not enabled for the whole
work of his miniſtery: and if he reade or ſing a
pſalme, whoſe gifts doth he exerciſe therein?
This neceſſitie being preſuppoſed, I would know,
whether that particular form of ſinging, deviſed
by man and preſcribed by others, be an humane
invention or no? If it be the deviſe of man, then
it is forbidden in the ſecond commandment, as
they ſay: If it be not of man, then it muſt be of
God by ſpeciall inſtitution and immediate inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
then the ſelf-ſame form of words iſſuing
from the ſame cauſe or authour ſhould be humane,
if delivered in form of prayer; and Divine, in form
of a pſalme. Whereas this neceſſitie is onely an
adjunct to the thing, and doth not ſo change the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23108:41"/>
nature of it as to make that which is of man by
common gifts to be from God by ſpeciall inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as it muſt in this caſe, according to their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
I would know further, whether this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
or preſcribed form of ſinging be an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
worſhip and ſervice of God or no? If it be,
then ſome worſhip deviſed by men is acceptable
to God in caſe of neceſſitie: which cannot be
admitted: If it be not worſhip, then a deviſed
form of prayer cannot be condemned as a deviſed
worſhip. And therefore if there be any ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
as is pretended, it ſhould rather exempt
from the practice of ſinging then give liberty to a
deviſed form which God hath not warranted nor
approved. For it is a rule in Divinity, That
againſt a generall negative precept no particular
affirmative can be lawfull, unleſſe that particular
be warranted in ſcripture: For the ſcripture ſhould
not be perfect, to furniſh the man of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
to every good work,<note place="margin">In religion there is no truth, but grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſcriptures; no hereticks, but refuted by ſcriptures, <hi>Whitak. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, chap.</hi> 3.</note> if a particular affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative
not warranted in ſpeciall might be lawfull
againſt a generall negative; ſeeing in that caſe a
man can have no ſure ground to reſt on. But
againſt this ſuppoſed generall negative precept,
forbidding all humane inventions in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
all deviſed helps and furtherances, all ſtrange
worſhip, there is no particular warrant allowing it
in ſinging pſalmes. When all deviſed worſhip is
conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, how ſhall the conſcience be aſſured that
this particular deviſed worſhip ſhall be accepted?
No neceſſity excuſeth in the doing, of a thing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
unlawful, but that which exempteth from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23108:42"/>
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment in that caſe. Now whether that
pretended neceſſity of a ſet form ſhould exempt
from the generall negative precept forbidding all
deviſed forms as will-worſhip (as they expound it)
or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the affirmative precept of ſinging of pſalmes,
let them judge who put the exception. Neceſſitie
which hath no law, in ſome particular caſe, preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
ſome free time wherein that preſſing neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
hath no place; &amp; then what neceſſity hath found
out for remedy, that muſt ceaſe, the neceſſity cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:
But that any neceſſity which lieth continually
upon all churches, as doth the ſinging in a preſcript
form, if they ſing at all, ſhould warrant them to do
that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to a general negative precept,
is a tradition in Divinity never heard of before. The
reaſon therefore ſtandeth ſtill in force; If it be
lawfull to praiſe God in a form of words deviſed
by man, it is lawfull alſo to pray to God in a ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
form; and an arbitrary form is altogether as
lawfull as a deviſed form. And if Chriſtians ſhall
not withdraw themſelves from the ſtinted prayers
of the congregation before a materiall difference
be ſhewed in theſe particulars, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Arbitrary and Neceſſary deviſed
forms be proved by ſcripture or ſolid reaſon, the
world ſhall end (I am confident) before they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate.
And thus ſome other objections made
againſt a ſtinted Liturgie are anſwered.</p>
            <p>It is Gods ordinance,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> that the churches ſhould
be edified by their gifts who miniſter unto them,
and that in prayer as well as in preaching: and
Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itteth all his ſervants with gifts for the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23108:42"/>
whole work of the miniſtery: But in reading a
ſtinted Liturgie a miniſter doth not edifie the
church with his own gifts.</p>
            <p>This reaſon concludeth not againſt a publick
ſtinted Liturgie as a breach of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
or a deviſed worſhip,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> nor as unlawfull
in it ſelf, but by accident onely, as it hindreth the
edification of the church by the miniſters own
gifts. But I deſire to know whether it be not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the miniſter at all in the publick execution
of his office or any part thereof to make uſe of
other mens gifts; or that he muſt not make uſe of
other mens onely, and not of his own at all. If
the former; it is not proved by any text of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
If the later; it maketh nothing againſt the
uſe of ſtinted prayer. In every part of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
function, preaching, prayer, bleſſing, ſinging,
adminiſtration of the ſacraments, reading of the
ſcriptures, a miniſter may and ought to make uſe
of the gifts of others. In expoſition of ſcripture
he may make uſe of the divers readings, marginall
notes, interlineary gloſſes, marginall references;
he may make uſe of the gifts of linguiſts, tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
paraphraſts, and commentatours to explain
hard phraſes, find out the coherence and meaning
of the text, &amp;c. In matters of controverſie, of the
labours and gifts of them that have travelled moſt
painfully therein: In application of doctrine he may
make uſe of ſuch as have handled that matter more
ſoundly, fully, pithily then he is able: and in the
act of preaching, of all theſe joyntly or ſeverally,
as he doth utter what he hath gathered out of his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23108:43"/>
notes or memory. Calvine, a man of great
learning, admirable dexteritie of wit, ſingular skill
in the Hebrew tongue, was yet pleaſed in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
upon the pſalmes to make great uſe of
Vatablus annotations. Mercer in his exquiſite
Commentary upon Job was not a little holpen by
the ſermons of Calvine upon the ſame book.
Mollerus is pleaſed for the moſt part to gather his
obſervations upon the pſalmes word for word
profeſſedly out of Calvine.<note place="margin">See Moller. in Pſalm, epiſt. dedicat.</note> How many ſermons
and tractates be extant at this day wherein we may
obſerve thoſe that follow to have done more then
track the ſteps of them that have gone before
them, and this without rebuke? In prayer a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
may uſe the gifts of others, to furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with method, words, matter and arguments;
and utter his meditations, as upon meditation he
hath digeſted them, by ſuch helps: yea, he may
uſe thoſe very expreſſions and forms which others
have uſed before him, when they be more fit and
moving then of himſelf he could reach unto. In
ſinging pſalmes, though the miniſter be able to
turn them into more grave, ſolid, exact metre then
uſuall, and nearer to the originall, yet it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but he may make uſe of other mens gifts infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to his own. In reading the ſcripture in a
preſcribed tranſlation, which is a part of Gods
publick worſhip, whoſe gifts doth the miniſter
make uſe of? what miniſteriall gift is exerciſed or
manifeſted therein? Every child of twelve or
thirteen yeares old, in reſpect of the outward act,
is as well able to reade a chapter as the ſtinted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie.</p>

They anſwer,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> that,<note place="margin">Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 12.</note> Between publick reading
of ſcriptures and publick reading of prayers there
be two differences: Firſt, the publick reading of
the ſcripture is Gods ordinance; but ſtinted prayers
have not warrant from the word. Secondly, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſcriptures in the publick aſſembly ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
conſidered in it ſelf, is not the proper work of
the miniſter.</p>
            <p>But this later is not to the purpoſe:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> For we
ſpeak of reading the ſcriptures as it is done by a
miniſter in the publick aſſembly and in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
worſhip of God; be it when he readeth
his text, being a ſhorter or larger portion of holy
writ. The firſt is a flat contradiction to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it ſelf, and a plain confeſſion that it is of no
worth. For when they ſay, Reading the ſcripture
is Gods ordinance, wherein the miniſter uſeth
anothers gifts and not his own; but the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of new forms by mens deviſe and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not warranted: do they not confeſſe, that
this is no juſt exception againſt ſtinted prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſhould condemn the ordinance of God,
no leſſe then it? and, that ſtinted prayer is not
unlawfull becauſe a miniſter in reading it doth
make uſe of another mans gifts, but becauſe it is
unwarrantable? which is the matter to be proved,
and importeth a confeſſion that it is not proved
by this reaſon but rather overthrown. For if they
reſtrain the propoſition thus, That ſtinted form of
prayer is unlawfull wherein the miniſter maketh
uſe of another mans gifts not of his own; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
conſiſteth all of particulars, beggeth onely, but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23108:44"/>
concludeth nothing. If the propoſition be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
That is not an ordinance of God in the uſe
whereof a miniſter exerciſeth other mens gifts and
not his own; the exception here annexed is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
croſſe thereunto, for the publick reading of
the ſcriptures is Gods ordinance. But ſeeing this
is a matter ſo much inſiſted upon, That a ſtinted
form of Liturgie is not warranted, and ſo unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
let us conſider a little how many wayes a
thing may be warranted, and in what ſenſe the
propoſition holdeth true, <hi>What is not warranted,
that is unlawfull.</hi> A thing is warranted in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God three wayes: Firſt by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and reaſon, according to the generall rules of
ſcripture: and ſo time, place, method, phraſe of
ſpeech, and ſuch like, are warranted, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be determined particularly thereof in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 14.</note> For the ſcripture commandeth that all
things be done in order, but it determineth not
this or that to be matter of order. Thus a ſtinted
Liturgie is warranted. Secondly, a thing is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by neceſſary conſequence, when to ſome
particular dutie required this or that particular is
neceſſary or expedient, though it be not named:
and ſo the tranſlation of the ſcripture is warranted,
becauſe is muſt be read to edification; and edifie
it cannot, unleſſe it be underſtood. Thirdly,
that is warranted which is by ſpeciall inſtitution
commanded as a part or ſubſtantiall means of
worſhip, which ſhould be unlawfull if it was not
particularly inſtituted, as being contrary to the
ſecond commandment. And ſeeing the word is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:23108:44"/>
thus diverſly uſed in different matters, unleſſe it
be wiſely diſtinguiſhed a man ſhall build falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
upon true principles, if truly applied;
and ſooner entangle himſelf then confute his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary:
as it fareth with our brethren in this caſe.
For taking the word <hi>warranted</hi> in the ſtricteſt
ſenſe, when they diſpute againſt a ſet form or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,
as an addition to the word, and means of
worſhipping God by the deviſes and appointment
of men, they conclude erroneouſly: For a ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Liturgie is no ſubſtantiall means of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
or poſitive worſhip, (for theſe two are one)
but onely a matter of order, or form of words and
method, wherein we preſent our requeſts to
God, &amp;c. And from the ſame miſtake they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare
themſelves, while they teach others to argue
upon the ſame grounds and with like force againſt
ſinging of pſalmes and reading of ſet tranſlations;
to wit, That they are not warranted of God, and
that we muſt be carefull, as not to take away
from the word any ordinance of God, ſo not to
adde to the word, as means of worſhipping God,
the deviſes and appointment of men. Out of
which ſnare they can never rid themſelves, unleſſe
they take the word <hi>warranted</hi> in a larger ſenſe, and
diſtinguiſh betwixt the ſubſtantiall and neceſſary
means of worſhip, and that which is allowed by
conſequence onely, or doth pertein to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s a matter of order. For though
ſinging of pſalmes be commanded of God; though
God allow, nay command, that the ſcriptures
ſhould be tranſlated, as that without which they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23108:45"/>
cannot be read to edification: yet the frame of
words in ſinging, and the tranſlation it ſelf is the
work of men, and the words and phraſes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes
of men, not an ordinance of worſhip. This
knot cannot be untyed but it will cut the ſinews of
the former objection.</p>

            <p>What is here ſaid of impoſing prayers deviſed
by others,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> is alledged againſt the uſe of ſtinted
prayers and Liturgie, and ſo muſt be underſtood:
and till the uſe of a preſcript form of prayer or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
be proved unlawfull, it will never be found
derogatorie to the honour, fruit and benefit of
Chriſts aſcenſion. Chriſt aſcending up on high
hath given gifts unto men for the work of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
as well for prayer as for doctrine and
preaching, added alſo, for baptizing, adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lords ſupper, catechizing, bleſſing,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23108:45"/>
confeſſion and profeſſion of faith, and ſinging of
pſalmes: And if a ſtinted form of prayer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to the honour of Chriſts aſcenſion; for
the ſame reaſon a ſtinted form in all or any of
theſe is derogatory likewiſe. Chriſt hath given
gifts unto men for doctrine or preaching: is it
therefore unlawfull for the miniſter of the Goſpel
to make uſe of tranſlations, commentaries, lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſts,
controverſie-writers, &amp;c. to help and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him the better in this work? is this to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
from the fruit and benefit of Chriſts aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Ability to preach is a gift which Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth
upon his ſervants: but (I hope) they will
not ſay he is unmeet to be a miniſter of Chriſt that
doth penne his ſermons, and ordinarily deliver
them in that method and ſtinted phraſe which he
hath premeditated; or that his ſo doing is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to the fruit and benefit of Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
And it will be a difficult thing to give a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
reaſon why a ſtinted prayer and not a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſermon ſhould be ſo challenged. Chriſt hath
given to his miniſters ability to pray in their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but not in ſuch meaſure as they ſhould need
no help; nor ſuch abilities of ſpeech or utterance,
as that every miniſter ſhould be ſo enabled to
pray, in fitting words, according to preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as not to need ſome help, ſtudie and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
yea, to digeſt his meditations into a ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
form of words. And this ſtinted form deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon premeditation, out of memory, is a
preſcript form, in the judgement of our brethren.
But let us grant (what can never be proved) that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23108:46"/>
every miniſter hath the gift of ſpeech and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that he needeth no help or furtherance upon
any ſuddain occaſion, what will follow? If they
be ſo endued, it will be ſaid, there is no warrant
for others to preſcribe, nor for themſelves to
reade over ſuch ſtinted prayers. What not? An
able miniſter hath diſcretion and wiſdome to
know what portion of ſcripture is meet to be read,
and how much: hath the church no warrant then
to appoint what books, chapters or ſections ſhall
ordinarily be read? nor the miniſter warrant to
obſerve that appointment? A learned Grecian or
Hebrician is able to tranſlate a book or chapter in
the Old or New Teſtament as well, peradventure
better, then it is in our ordinary tranſlations: may
not the church then ordain one tranſlation uſually
to be read? Let me intreat our brethren to view
the ſtrength of this reaſon in another of the ſame
form, which I certainly perſwade my ſelf they
will not allow; and it is this; Reading of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the worſhip of God is unlawfull, becauſe
it doth contradict the gifts beſtowed by Chriſt
upon the church for the work of the miniſtery,
and derogateth from the vertue of Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and dignity of his kingdome, and blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Chriſts bounty to, and care of his church,
and may be performed by a child perfectly well.
For it may be ſaid, If Chriſt hath given gifts unto
men for the work of the miniſtery, he hath given
ability alſo to tranſlate the ſcriptures, or elſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
are not neceſſary: And if Chriſt hath given
gifts to his ſervants to tranſlate the ſcriptures, or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23108:46"/>
tranſlations be not neceſſary, then they have no
warrant to reade, nor others authority to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
any ſet tranſlation. It may alſo be added,
That God will be worſhipped with our own, not
with another mans; with that which coſt us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
not with that which coſt us nothing; with
our own gifts, not with other mens. But for one
ignorant of the originals to reade the tranſlations,
is to offer unto God that which coſt him nothing,
to ſerve God with other mens not with his own
gifts. The concluſion our brethren will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge;
but whatſoever they can ſoundly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the premiſſes will with the ſame labour
untie the knot of their own argument.</p>

then poſsibly he can be directed in a ſtinted form,
(which can never be proved by text of ſcripture,
or ſound reaſon drawn from thence) in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a man may, and ſome have argued againſt the
reading of tranſlations; God will be ſerved with
the beſt we have: but there is no one tranſlation
the beſt we have; for a miniſter may be able to
render a chapter, ſentence or verſe more ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly
then the tranſlation hath it: And yet (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
no miniſter will refuſe to uſe a ſound and
good tranſlation, though it be here and there leſſe
ſignificant; nor take liberty in reading to alter it at
pleaſure, leſt liberty herein ſhould teach grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and ungodly people to wrangle againſt the
ſcriptures themſelves. In preaching and diſputing
men may and do note the ſignificancy of the
phraſe, which cannot ſo fully be expreſſed in a
tranſlation; and more fully interpret what is not ſo
plain and full as might be deſired: but in reading
the ſcriptures in the congregation great warineſſe
is to be uſed, leſt boldneſſe to correct occaſion
doubts in the weak, and embolden the ungodly to
carp againſt religion. And if a miniſter may be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the uſe of a ſound &amp; good tranſlation, though
not in every jot or tittle the beſt that may be, this
reaſon hath loſt its ſinews. Univerſall propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
duly limited may be of great uſe, whereas if
extended too farre, they are dangerous in appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
It is true, if we ſpeak of Gods incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
goodneſſe, excellency, glory and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
that more love and ſervice is due to God
then he requireth in his word, or poſſibly can be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23108:47"/>
given by men or Angels: It is true, we are bound
to whatſoever duty the Lord requireth in his law,
for matter, manner and meaſure; to whatſoever he
obligeth us unto upon ſpeciall occaſion, or inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
us unto by the heroicall motions of his Spirit,
which muſt not be reſiſted: It is alſo moſt true,
that the creature cannot merit of the Creatour;
much leſſe can ſinfull man, who faileth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in his beſt duties, and offendeth in many
things, ſupererogate by doing ſome outward act
not required, or forbearing ſomewhat in it ſelf
allowable, when outwardly and inwardly he
cometh ſhort in many things commanded. But in
every externall act, which is neither work of piety,
mercy, nor juſtice, but onely an appertenance
thereunto, or an outward prerogative onely, a
Chriſtian is not bound by the law of God ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
to do that which is beſt. There is a latitude
and extent of the commandments, which God
gave in bounty, wherein he requireth not all that
he might, but what he pleaſeth: and if we keep

ſhould enquire, whether he might uſe the
Lords prayer at all, or uſe it onely and none
other, he could expect no ſatisfactory anſwer
from them that oppoſe a ſtinted form of prayer by
this argument: For firſt they will tell him, He
may uſe a petition, two, or more, or all in the

and,<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> That if we ask all things comprehended in

Chriſts meaning to enjoyn the ſaying over of
theſe words for our prayer to God,<note place="margin">Greenwood, Againſt Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, pag. 19.</note> then ought
we to uſe theſe onely and none other; becauſe it
ſhould be but babbling &amp; preſumption to joyn or
put other prayers in ſtead of that which is ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and ſufficient: for the Lord will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with the beſt we have, &amp;c. Lay theſe things
together, and what reſolution can be gathered to
that queſtion but this, He may uſe it, He may not
uſe it; He may uſe other prayers with it, When
he uſeth it, he may uſe none other, becauſe it is
moſt perfect and ſufficient. For anſwer it might
be added, That in publick prayer the capacity and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23108:49"/>
edification of the people is more to be reſpected of
the miniſter then his own ability of conceit or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance:
The phraſe and diſpoſition of words uſed
in prayer in the aſſembly ſhould rather be grave
and ſimple then ſtrained to the higheſt degree of
fervency that the meſſenger of God is able. It is
alſo to be conſidered, that what is ſimply beſt, is
not beſt in relation to this or that circumſtance or
end: what is beſt in a time free, is not beſt in a
time not free. And if a ſtinted form of Liturgie be
not neceſſary to help the inability of the miniſter,
it may be expedient upon other grave and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conſiderations, concerning the good of Gods
church, both miniſters and people.</p>
            <p>The impoſition of ſet forms,<note place="margin">Object. 7.</note> ſo to be uſed for
matter and manner by our miniſters, hath a varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from, I may ſay, an oppoſition unto the law
of fear and ſervice, <hi>ſc.</hi> That we ſhould love the
Lord with all our ſouls, all our ſtrength, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That which is ſaid of our form to be uſed for
matter and manner, is altogether impertinent, or
turneth the edge of the argument. For either all
publick forms of prayer wherein a miniſter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not uſe of his own but other mens gifts be
unlawfull and derogatorie to the honour, fruit
and benefit of Chriſts aſcenſion; and then it is
impertinent to urge this of our form for matter
and manner: Or ſome forms be lawfull notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
a miniſter maketh not uſe of his own but
other mens gifts; and then this is no juſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt the uſe of our Liturgie. For if any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſtinted form of prayer be lawfull, then ours
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23108:49"/>
is lawfull ſo farre and in what it agreeth with that
lawfull form for matter and manner: And what
reaſon ſoever diſproveth the uſe of ours for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
manner, or what elſe ſoever can be objected,
that diſproveth the uſe of all ſet forms that be of
the ſame nature and uſe for matter or manner.
Thus therefore you may take the Argument, If
ſome ſet or ſtinted form of prayer be lawfull ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
to be uſed without addition or alteration,
though therein the miniſter make uſe not of his
own but others gifts; then our ſtinted form of
prayer is not unlawfull becauſe it is to be uſed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
without addition or alteration, though
therein the miniſter make uſe not of his own but
of others gifts. For whatſoever maketh our form
unlawfull, that maketh all forms agreeing with
ours in that particular unlawfull: But the former
hath been proved already.</p>

Of their learning and zeal it is needleſſe to ſay any
thing. For three of them there is plentifull teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that they preached every day in the week
and yeare, at leaſt once or twice, without fail: <hi>Ye
heard yeſterday, Ye ſhall heare to morrow,</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in their tractates and homilies. Auguſtine
even to the extremity of his ſickneſſe preached
the word of God in his church cheerfully and
boldly, with a ſound mind and judgement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intermiſſion at all. The like diligence is
noted in others who lived before and about thoſe
times: in all which a ſtinted Liturgie was in uſe.
And generally the Fathers in the primitive church
preſſe the knowledge of the ſcriptures, reſidence
upon his charge, diligence in reading, meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
prayer and inſtruction of the people, as duties
requiſite and neceſſary, and by no means to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
or omitted of the miniſter. They alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
the people, not onely to heare the word of
God, but to learn it by heart, to inſtruct and warn
one another, to ſing pſalmes, conferre religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,

heare at church-together, after the ſermon ended.
Such exhortations are common and ordinary in
them who approved ſtinted Liturgies: <hi>Let one of

of the Spirit, which the Lord beſtoweth upon
good and bad: Yea, many times graceleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are herein preferred before the moſt ſincere
and upright: and many an honeſt heart can cry
aloud for mercy who is ſcarce able to utter one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
and perfect ſentence in fit words and order.
Let no man except, that miniſters have better
abilities: For when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the Spirit
is given to help our infirmities, who know not how
to pray as we ought,</hi> he ſpeaketh of all beleevers, as
well others as miniſters, private prayers as well as
publick: And whoſoever is enabled or provoked
to lift up any one ſigh or grone unto God, or to
make apologie for himſelf in the mediation of
Chriſt in any manner, it is by the holy Ghoſt.
Theſe things conſidered, I ſuppoſe all men will
grant; 1. That it is lawfull for a man before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
to meditate on his own particular wants and
the neceſſities of others, and that he may more
fully underſtand and more ſenſibly be affected
with them, to reade good books, which unfold
the particular ſinnes againſt the law of God, the
ſtate of man by nature, and the condition of the
Saints, and of the church, as alſo to think upon
the works of Gods providence, and how he is
pleaſed to deal with his people in all places.
2. The better to ſtirre up confidence and affection,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:23108:52"/>
and to furniſh himſelf with words and matter, it is
not unlawfull nor unprofitable to reade the prayers
of the godly, regiſtred in holy ſcripture, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in other godly books; to obſerve the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their prayer, their ferventneſſe in praying,
and the arguments wherewith they preſſed their
ſuits and contended for audience. 3. After a
man hath collected matter for prayer by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and reading, he may ſtudie to digeſt it into due
order and method, and to expreſſe his requeſts in
fit and decent ſpeech; and the ſame ſo conceived he
may utter as a prayer, according as occaſion ſhall
offer it ſelf. The reaſon may be thus contracted,
If the Spirit of God doth work by means and ſtir
up good deſires, but giveth not abilitie to expreſſe
our deſires in fitting ſignificant words, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it is
lawfull for us to uſe all godly means to ſtirr up
the graces of God in us, and premediate how we
may utter our requeſts in ſuch form and manner
as may beſt ſerve for our quickning and the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of others. And if the uſe of a premeditated
form of words in prayer do not ſtint the Spirit in
a ſinfull manner, a ſet form of prayer cannot be
condemned as injurious to the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God is the onely ſufficient help
which God giveth us to help our infirmities in the
time of prayer,<note place="margin">Object. 1. Copy of a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We confeſſe moſt willingly, that prayer is not
a work of nature, wit or learning, but of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of grace. True deſire or abilitie to pray is not
bred in us by nature, nor procured and gotten by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:23108:53"/>
our ſtudy and induſtry, but proceedeth onely
from the holy Ghoſt, as the authour and efficient:
and this is proved by the places quoted. But abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to pray ſtandeth in the lifting up of the ſoul
unto God, not in the ample expreſſion of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
according to the various occaſions in fit
words, and preſſing them with forcible arguments.
Prayer is the immediate work of the Spirit: But
no text of ſcripture doth in ſuch ſenſe make the
holy Ghoſt the authour of prayer, or helper of
our infirmities, as that it ſhould be unlawfull to
make uſe of outward means to furniſh the ſoul
with matter, ſtirre up the graces of God in the
heart, and blow the coals of the ſpirit: For then
we muſt not reade the ſcriptures, nor other godly
books; we may not meditate, or conferre, the
better to fit us for prayer. Peradventure it will
be ſaid the Spirit of God is our onely helper in the
time of prayer;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Greenwood, Againſt Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, pa.</hi> 3, 4. It is the Spirit of God in the very action of prayer that helpeth our infirmities.</note> ſo that at other times we may uſe
helps to ſtirre up the graces of the Spirit, but not
in the time of prayer. And if this diſtinction be
found in ſcripture, or by ſound reaſon may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of ſcripture, we muſt hearken unto it:
but if it be of our ſelves, whiles we pleade againſt
the deviſes of men, we maintein deviſes. The
Spirit of grace is at all times the ſole mover and
enabler of us to pray: and the uſe of lawfull
helps, and ſuch as ſuite with the nature of prayer,
are at no time unlawfull. As it is fit to meditate
and reade before we pray, ſo in prayer it is lawfull
to kneel, lift up the eyes and hands, uſe the help
of the voyce, and the benefit of a Chriſtian friend,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23108:53"/>
to ſtirre up affection. Therefore for the lawfulneſſe
of book-prayer we may diſpute thus, If it be
lawfull to uſe externall helps in time of prayer the
better to ſtirre up affection, then book-prayer is
not to be condemned for this, that the Spirit of
God is the onely or ſufficient help that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to help our infirmities in the time of prayer:
But it is lawfull to uſe externall helps in time of
prayer.</p>
            <p>The Spirit alone either immediately,<note place="margin">Object. 2. Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 14. Robinſ. pag. 472.</note> or by
means ſanctified and ordained by himſelf, maketh
requeſts for us: yea, it is by the immediate teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and ſuggeſtions of the Spirit that all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
muſt be put up,<note place="margin">Greenwood, Againſt Giff. pag. 2.</note> no other helps are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or can be collected in the preſent action of
prayer.</p>
            <p>I will not ſtand to enquire how theſe things can
agree together;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> what is meant by the immediate
teachings of the Spirit; or how the Spirit maketh
requeſts, either immediately, or by means. The
Spirit alone, and that immediately, is the authour
of prayer; but by means he miniſtreth varietie of
matter, order, and words. But what are we to
underſtand by <hi>means ſanctified and ordained by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</hi>
If means ordained by ſpeciall inſtitution, it
is too ſtrait and hard to conceive what they be.
If means allowed by God, as thoſe whereby we
may furniſh our ſelves with words and matter for
prayer, as reading godly books, conference, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
on the works of God, &amp;c. a ſtinted form
of prayer is a means ſanctified. And here I deſire
it may be noted, in what ſenſe a form of prayer is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23108:54"/>
called <hi>a means or furtherance;</hi> not as a means or
form of worſhip properly ſo called, but as in fit
words and phraſes it preſenteth to our minds or
memories what we ought to beg agreeable to the
word of God: as the frame of words and matter
kept in memory may be called and is reputed a
ſtinted form.</p>
            <p>A ſtinted form of prayer quencheth the Spirit.<note place="margin">Object. 3. Greenwood, pag. 21.</note>
It is a quenching of the Spirit, to reade another
mans prayer upon a book.</p>
            <p>That quencheth the Spirit which is as water to
cool or allay or exſtinguiſh the heat of that holy
fire;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> which cannot be imputed to a ſet form of
prayer, either by authoritie of ſcripture, or ſound
reaſon. Reading godly books is an exerciſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to ſtirre up the graces of Gods Spirit in us:
were it not a wonder, if reading a godly prayer
ſhould produce the contrary effect? As in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
of the word the corruption of mans heart
and the hainouſneſſe of ſinne may more lively and
fully be diſcovered for his humiliation then he is
able of himſelf to ſet it forth; ſo in prayer penned
by a goldy andwell experienced Chriſtian the caſe
of a diſtreſſed ſoul may more pithily and amply
be deciphred and anatomized then he of himſelf
is able to lay it open. And in ſuch caſe to deny
this lawfull help, is to take away a crutch from
the lame, and bread from the hungry. In the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
act of prayer it is lawfull to uſe outward helps,
whereby we may be enabled to pray better; and
ſhall it not be lawfull for a burdened ſoul perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with doubtings, overwhelmed with bitter
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:23108:54"/>
anguiſh, to uſe the help of a book, that he might
the better unfold and lay open his miſery into the
boſome of his loving Father? The ample and
particular laying open of our neceſſities doth eaſe
the heart, and move affections: and when this
may be done better by the help of a book in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then of our ſelves, how can the uſe thereof be
accuſed as the quenching of the Spirit? It is the
Spirit indeed that doth help us in our infirmities;
but we muſt uſe means to ſtirre up the graces of
the Spirit in us. He quencheth not the Spirit who
laboureth to blow the coals of grace, and uſeth
all helps afforded in moſt ample and particular
manner to unburden his heart before the Lord. He
doth not ſubſtitute his Chriſtian friends in the
place of the word and Spirit, who not able to
lift up his own ſoul by reaſon of gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vous ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and preſſure of heart, doth crave his help and
aſſiſtance in prayer: And may not a godly book
ſupply the lack of Chriſtian companion? When
we are dull and out of order, we may joyn with
others in prayer for our relief and quickning: why
then ſhould it be intolerable to make this benefit
of a godly book? A ſet form of prayer may be
committed to memory and uttered from it; doth
that alſo quench the Spirit?<note place="margin">Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 15.</note> 
               <hi>It is not ſafe</hi> (they
ſay) <hi>for a miniſter to limit himſelf alwayes to one
form of prayer though deviſed by himſelf.</hi> But if it be
a quenching of the Spirit, an humane invention
forbidden in the ſecond commandment, if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made by the Spirit, if it be not that true and
ſpirituall worſhip which God requireth, it is not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:23108:55"/>
lawfull ordinarily nor once, for miniſter or private
chriſtian, in publick or private, in caſe of diſtreſſe
or otherwiſe: for the objection is generall, That
all ſtinted forms of prayer do quench the Spirit:
and theſe mitigations of <hi>ſafe, alwayes,</hi> and <hi>for a
miniſter,</hi> are a plain conceſſion there is no force in
the reaſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſtinted forms do quench the Spirit of
prayer,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> in that they deprive the church and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of that libertie of the Spirit of prayer which
God would have them uſe;<note place="margin">Robinſon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bern. pag. 429.</note> ſtinting the miniſter,
yea all the miniſters of the kingdome, to the ſame
meaſure of the Spirit, not onely one with another,
but all of them with him that is dead and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>Nothing is here objected againſt our ſtinted
form which may not with like truth be alledged
againſt the reading of a preſcribed and ſet tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the uſe of the Lords prayer, a ſet form of
bleſſing, ſinging of pſalms, and baptizing in theſe
preciſe words, <hi>I baptize thee,</hi> &amp;c. For in theſe
things it may be ſaid, The miniſter, yea all the
miniſters in the kingdome are ſtinted to the ſame
meaſure of the Spirit, &amp;c. And if in thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
that form of reaſoning be of no weight, in
this it is but an empty ſound. A ſtinted form de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth
not the miniſter or church of that libertie
of the Spirit which God would have them uſe,
ſeeing they may uſe that notwithſtanding, as the
ſeverall occaſions of the church or people ſhall
require. If all miniſters throughout the Chriſtian
world ſhould put up the ſame holy and juſt peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:23108:55"/>
to God, in the ſame phraſe of ſpeech as in
the words of the Lords prayer, they ſhould neither
ſtint the Spirit to one meaſure, nor deprive the
church of the liberty of the Spirit, ſeeing the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Spirit ſtandeth not in words and forms,
but in fervent ſighs and groans; and they have
time and libertie to pray beſides, as God ſhall
enable them, and the preſent occaſions of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
require. And if it muſt needs be that in a
ſtinted form the Spirit is ſtinted to one meaſure,
then all ſtinting of the Spirit is not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Spirit: For the miniſter doth not quench
the Spirit if he ſtint it, in reſpect of time and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
Suppoſe ſundry private Chriſtians in the
aſſembly do excell their paſtour in the gift of
prayer, the wife excell the husband, the child or
ſervant excell the maſter or governour; is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
quenched in them, when it is ſtinted for the time
to their meaſure in prayer? Suppoſe, divers Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
meeting upon occaſion, the weakeſt in gifts
be put to pray for the reſt; is the Spirit in them
quenched becauſe it is ſtinted to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
            <p>The queſtion is not of prayer deviſed by a mans
ſelf,<note place="margin">Object. 5. Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 15.</note> or of limiting the Spirit in the people; but of
prayer deviſed by others and impoſed, and of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
the Spirit of the miniſter: the firſt is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
the ſecond ſinfull.</p>
            <p>The queſtion is of a publick ſtinted form of
prayer or Liturgie,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Whether it quench the Spirit
in the miniſter or the people; and, Whether it
quench the Spirit becauſe it ſtinteth it. Whether
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:23108:56"/>
the form be deviſed by others or by a mans ſelf,
impoſed or voluntarily taken up, that is nothing to
the matter in hand: but, Whether it quench the
Spirit, becauſe for the time it is limited to that
form of words. And if we look into the matter it
ſelf, the Spirit of God may be quenched in a mans
ſelf no leſſe by the rude cuſtomary uſe of a form
deviſed by a mans ſelf then by a form impoſed by
others, and it may be as prejudiciall to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of Gods people. And if we conſult the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where ſhall we find this diſtinction, of limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Spirit by prayer deviſed by a mans ſelf or
deviſed of others; of ſtinting the Spirit in reſpect
of time, occaſion, form of prayer, uttered out of
memory or read upon a book? But the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelf hath been confuted already, together
with the aſſertion, That a ſtinted prayer doth
quench the Spirit.<note place="margin">Idem, ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prà.</note> 
               <hi>It cannot properly be ſaid,</hi> ſaith
one, <hi>that the Spirit is limited by his own ordinance:
but when the Spirit of the miniſter is ſtraitned by
forms preſcribed to him by men without Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and appointment, then the Spirit is limited and
ſtinted indeed.</hi> But this is a bare repetition of what
was ſaid before, without proof or reaſon: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a ſtrange deſcription of limiting the Spirit, is
nothing but a proof of one thing by the ſame. And
here I deſire two things may be noted. Firſt,
though many reaſons in ſhew be brought againſt
the uſe of ſtinted prayer, yet when the matter
cometh to the upſhot, they are barely one, and that
nakedly affirmed; Stinted prayer is unlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in reading book <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>prayer he doth not exerciſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23108:56"/>
his own but another mans gifts. Is this reaſon
good? No; for in reading ſcripture out of a
tranſlation he exerciſeth another mans gifts. But
ſtinted prayer is the deviſe of man. A child of
twelve or thirteen yeares old may reade a ſtinted
prayer as well as the miniſter: The ſame may be
ſaid of reading the Scriptures. But ſtinted prayer
is the deviſe of man. It is unlawfull to ſtint the
Spirit: Yet this is done in praying with others.
But ſtinted prayer is the deviſe of man. So that
all hangeth upon this ſtring, for the confirmation
whereof nothing is alledged. Secondly, they
take that for granted evermore which ſhould be
proved, or prove the ſame by the ſame: as, Stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
prayer doth quench the Spirit. Why ſo?
Becauſe the Spirit is ſtraitned by forms deviſed by
men: which is as much in plain terms as to ſay,
It is ſtinted in our ſenſe becauſe it is ſtinted. And
the like might be noted in other arguments.</p>
            <p>Where is the conſideration of the people had,<note place="margin">Object. 6.</note>
when the forms now are the ſame for matter and
manner that they were almoſt an hundred yeares
ago, and at the firſt dawning of the Goſpel, the
ſame for the Court, Univerſities, and the meaneſt
congregation in the Countrey?</p>
            <p>Might not the ſame be objected againſt the uſe
of a ſet tranſlation,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſinging of pſalmes, the uſe of
the Lords prayer for this fifteen hundred yeares
without alteration? for theſe are the ſame now
that they were many yeares agone, or at leaſt may
be: the ſame for Citie, Countrey, Court, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie,
and the meaneſt villages? There are ſome
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23108:57"/>
common bleſſings which we and others dayly
ſtand in need of, and thoſe it is lawfull to ask dayly
in a ſet form of words. Thus we may pray euery
day for encreaſe of faith, patience, love, meekneſſe,
the forgivneſſe of ſinnes, the continuance of thoſe
outward bleſſings which we enjoy, freedom from
or victory over temptations, &amp;c. Thus there is no
petition in the Lords prayer which doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
in the main, concern every Chriſtian mans
eſtate. And if the matter of our prayers may be the
ſame daily, in the Citie &amp; the Countrey, Court and
Univerſitie, in this and former ages, the ſame
phraſe of ſpeech, method and form externall may
be lawfull, fit and expedient. For it is not the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of the ſame words in prayer every day that
diſpleaſeth the Lord, but the ignorant, raſh, cold,
cuſtomary, ſuperſtitious and irreverent pouring
out of words before him, that is diſtaſtfull to his
Majeſty. Variety of phraſe doth not delight the
Lord: neither will he reject the deſires of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and contrite heart becauſe they are tendred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in one and the ſame phraſe of ſpeech. And if the
matter of prayer be the ſame in places of greateſt
wealth and pooreſt condition, and the ſame form of
bleſſing, baptizing, ſinging of pſalms and putting up
their petitions to God be fit and decent for them
all; it can be no prejudice to a ſtinted Liturgie that it
is the ſame in all places, and throughout all ages, if
the language be the ſame. For this doth argue it to
be the more not the leſſe fit, and that the greater
not the leſſe regard is had to the people. The reaſon
in brief is this; It is lawfull to ask the ſame common
bleſſings of God every day, in all aſſemblies and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23108:57"/>
congregations, both of the City &amp; Country, Court
and Univerſity, met together to call upon God:
therefore the ſame ſtinted form of prayer or Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
may be lawfull in the greateſt city and meaneſt
village, in this and the ages following, whether read
or uttered out of memory: for pronouncing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make an evil matter good; nor reading ſimply
make prayer good and holy to become ſinfull.</p>
            <p>Publick prayers offered up by the miniſter in the
church-aſſemblies muſt be framed according to
the preſent and ſeverall occaſions of the church
and people of God:<note place="margin">Object. 7. Copie of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. pag. 21.</note> which cannot be done when
men are ſtinted to thoſe forms.<note place="margin">Greenwood, Againſt Giff. pag. 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Occaſions are ordinary and common,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> or more
ſpeciall. In a ſtinted form prayers may be offered up
by the miniſter according to the common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
occaſions of the church and people of God
aſſembled, though not according to the ſpeciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
which may happen now and then, or more
particularly concern this or that perſon. For if the
ſame bleſſings are dayly to be craved, he prayeth
according to the preſent occaſions that asketh the
ſame bleſſings of God. If it be ſaid, There be many
occaſions of particular uſe for the congregation
and others, which are not mentioned expreſſely:
that proveth not, That a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not in a ſtinted form
pray according to the ſeverall occaſions; but, that
ſome ſtinted forms do not meet with all and every
particular occaſion: which is eaſily granted. But if a
ſtinted form meet not with every mans occaſions,
or not ſo particularly as it ought, doth it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that in a ſtinted form a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not pray accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the preſent occaſions at all? If this be the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23108:58"/>
concluſion, I fear we ſhall find few conceived pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which muſt not come under the ſame ſentence.
It may argue the imperfection of a ſtinted form,
not the unlawfulneſſe; it maketh ſomewhat againſt
the ſole uſe of a ſet form at all times;<note place="margin">Object. 8. Johnſon, ubi ſuprà, pag. 28.</note> againſt the
ſimple uſe it maketh nothing.</p>
            <p>It is found by lamentable experience, that when
men began to obſerve that cuſtome,<note place="margin">Greenwood, Againſt Giff. Preface to the reader.</note> there was
great quenching of the Spirit, and very few there
were who did know and obſerve the true nature
and the manner of prayer.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How is this confirmed by experience? If ever
the Chriſtian church had no ſtinted form of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
lamentable experience will teſtifie what great
coolings and decayes there was in the church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a ſtinted form was in uſe. If ever the faithfull
did by the Spirit of adoption cry, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi>
they have learned to pray by the Spirit ſince the
uſe of a ſtinted form as well as before. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may be thought of the two firſt ages; for the
ſpace of fourteen hundred yeares the churches
have had their ſtinted Liturgies: The reformed
churches, ſince God was pleaſed to reſtore light
again to the world, have approved a ſtinted Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie:
Was there none or few in all this tract of
time who did know or underſtand the true nature
or manner of prayer? none or few that in ſpirit or
truth did call upon the name of the Lord? The
ſecuritie of all ages hath been lamentable both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and ſince the uſe of a ſtinted form: but, that a
ſtinted form was the cauſe of ſecuritie and dulneſſe,
can never be proved.</p>

That the prieſt might uſe that form without varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

ſtinted form is lawfull but not neceſſary? If God
had commanded a form, it onely had been neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
if God had determined one preciſe form,
that onely and none other had been lawfull: but
ſeeing he hath commanded none, determined none
preciſely, but left us free to uſe thoſe recorded in
ſcripture, or ſome others in the ſelfſame or other
words, a ſtinted form is apparently warranted of
God though not commanded.</p>
            <p>It followeth not,<note place="margin">Object. 3. Johnſon, p. 14. Greenw. pag. 14, 15.</note> that a preſcript form deviſed
by man is lawfull, becauſe a form preſcribed of
God is good. Moſes was a prophet, and had an
immediate commiſſion from God for what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in the houſe of God:<note place="margin">Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 8, 9, 17.</note> which the impoſers
of the Liturgie cannot plead.<note place="margin">Robinſon, Againſt Bern. pag. 473.</note> Chriſts ordinance
can make the writings of the Apoſtles a rule of
faith: can men make another ſcripture? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A form preſcribed and determined by God is
not onely lawfull and good,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but neceſſary and
onely lawfull, as it is preſcribed: which preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:23108:60"/>
no form deviſed or preſcribed by man can
participate. But when God is pleaſed to give a
form for direction onely, and neither to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it preciſely nor to determine it as the onely
allowable for words and ſyllables, in that caſe this
reaſon is good, That ſeeing the forms ſet down
in ſcripture may lawfully be uſed though not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
therefore a ſtinted form is not unlawfull.
And thus we conclude from theſe paſſages of holy
writ, The ſtinted forms of bleſſing, prayer,
thanksgiving, and baptizing ſet down in ſcripture
are lawfull to be uſed, though not preſcribed of
God as neceſſary; therefore a ſtinted form of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not unlawfull. For that form of words which
is neither determined nor commanded of God as
neceſſary, but left at liberty to be uſed or not, that
is not in point of conſcience abſolutely more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then another ſound and grave. If no form of
words be determined or commanded, any form
juſt and good, one as well as another, is free in
conſcience. Gods commandment maketh a thing
neceſſary; his determination maketh it onely and
none other lawfull: but a form not tying to the
words preciſely, but given for direction onely,
doth authorize any other for matter the ſame and
different onely in words or phraſe of ſpeech. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtinted form of prayer or bleſſing, &amp;c. not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
of God or ordained of him, is an humane
deviſe, though the matter be good and the words
be gathered out of the ſcripture; becauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is not from heaven, is of men; what is not of
God by his inſtitution preſcribed or appointed,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:23108:61"/>
that our brethren conclude to be humane: But no
preſcript form of bleſſing, prayer, or praiſe, &amp;c.
is appointed of God and commanded as neceſſary
to be uſed of all or any man at all times, as they
confeſſe and labour to convince: Therefore it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
followeth, That if one godly form of
prayer or bleſſing may conſtantly be uſed, another
for matter the ſame, though different in phraſe
of ſpeech, may be uſed alſo as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:
For none is abſolutely commanded; and all
things required by the word of God in prayer may
be obſerved in the one no leſſe then in the other.
In this whole anſwer therefore, which cometh ſo
often in the ſecond branch, they ſtrengthen our
reaſon as much as can be deſired againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
In the other they look not to the point in
hand nor the force of the reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thoſe forms mentioned 2. Chron. 29. 30. are
in the ſame place expreſſely ſaid to be compoſed
by thoſe that were Prophets and Seers,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> as in other
places, of purpoſe as it were to prevent imitation,
an ordinary riſe to imagery.</p>
            <p>The forms mentioned were given no queſtion
by the inſpiration of the Spirit;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and ſo is the
Lords prayer, the form of baptizing, and other
pſalmes regiſtred in holy ſcripture: But the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of thoſe particular forms to this on that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
was not by an extraordinary motion of the
Spirit, but upon grounds common to others
with them, upon like occaſion, or in caſes analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
And if in that reſpect it be not lawfull to
imitate their practice, I would gladly know by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:23108:61"/>
what warrant we ſing the pſalmes of David or
other holy prophets inſpired of God, or uſe a ſet
tranſlation, &amp;c. Upon what grounds may they
compoſe a catechiſme for the edification of the
people of their particular charge, or gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and alledge ſcriptures in their ſtudied ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
either for inſtruction, exhortation, rebuke
or comfort? If they have not warrant from theſe
and ſuch like practices of the people of God, it
will prove in their conſtruction but the precept or
deviſe of man. The compoſure of thoſe pſalmes
was by the immediate inſpiration of the holy
Ghoſt, wherein no man not immediately inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
may preſume to imitate them: but forms given
by inſpiration are thus farre for our imitation, that
we may uſe the ſame words or other words devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of our ſelves to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
and lay open the conceits and deſires of our
ſoul. Hezekiah did not compoſe that form, but
commanded the Levites to make uſe of it being
already compoſed. But how imitation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſhould be a riſe to imagery I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
To adde unto or detract from the word
of God or his ordinances, is great preſumption:
to imitate the Saints in that particular which they
did by immediate inſpiration, and could not do
without ſuch inſpiration, is intolerable boldneſſe:
But where God hath given a pattern of prayer,
thanksgiving, or adminiſtration of the ſacraments,
to imitate our ſamplar in the ſelfſame words or
other words deviſed by our ſelves or others, is
no riſe to imagery. If this be a riſe to imagery,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:23108:62"/>
every time a Chriſtian maketh uſe of the Lords
prayer in his prayers, or the prayers of holy men
recorded in ſcripture, he ſetteth up an image; he
that deviſeth a ſet form of prayer for one that
needeth, and he that in caſe of neceſſity uſeth
ſuch a deviſed prayer, ſetteth up an image; and
every time they pray, preach, catechize, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the ſacraments, or meditate of holy things
with reference to the ſcripture, they ſet up images.
Theſe conſequences, I am aſſured, they deteſt:
let me entreat them to conſider whether they do
not follow neceſſarily upon their premiſſes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that mean to defend the impoſition of a
ſtinted form of prayer to any purpoſe,<note place="margin">Object. 5.</note> do what
they can to bear us in hand that theſe prayers are
of like nature with thoſe in ſcripture, and ſpeak
of them as if the compoſition and framing of
them were by ſome propheticall or apoſtolicall
Spirit, or at leaſt (which will be all one in effect)
by a Spirit or gift extraordinary.</p>
            <p>What opinion the true church of God hath had
of a ſtinted Liturgie,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> we ſhall ſee in the next argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But that ſhe hath ever or at any time born us
in hand that thoſe prayers were of like nature with
thoſe in the ſcriptures, that is, given by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
inſpiration, or parts of canonicall ſcripture, is
an unjuſt imputation. For they know that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
churches, ſince the light of the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſhine forth unto the world untill this day,
do allow and maintein the uſe of ſtinted prayers,
catechiſmes, confeſſions and profeſſions of faith, a
ſtinted form of ſinging pſalmes, &amp;c. did ever any
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23108:62"/>
of them bear the world in hand that their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
or compoſures are propheticall or from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſpirit? Divers godly and learned mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
have ſoundly and to purpoſe mainteined
the lawfulneſſe of a ſtinted form againſt them of
the Separation in former times; did they ever
write or ſpeak, that the prayers or Liturgie was
framed by an Apoſtolicall ſpirit? I have not ſeen
all men that have written upon this ſubject upon
any occaſion, and therefore cannot ſay that never
any man did ſo ſpeak of them: but ſure I am, if any
man have ſo written, he is neither the onely man,
nor the chief, which hath ſet his hand to maintein
the expediency of a ſtinted Liturgie. If any one
hath ſpoken unadviſedly, the cauſe hath no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
by his defenſe, nor can it receive prejudice by
his weakneſſe. It hath been objected againſt ſome
diſlikers of a ſtinted form, that they conceit their
extemporany prayers to come from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt; and if a man
ſhould rake into every writing, and ſet every
ſpeech upon the tentours, he might ſay as much
for it as can be ſaid in this particular. But at the
beſt this is but to go about the buſh. This is that
which I hold and plead for, That by the word of
truth a ſtinted Liturgie or form of prayer is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and in ſome reſpects expedient.</p>

then mark what he teſtifieth from the famous
Jew Maimonie (in <hi>Miſneh</hi> treatiſe of prayer) That
the church of the Jews had no ſtinted Liturgie,
Annot. on Deut. 6. 13. <hi>Our wiſe men have ſaid</hi>
(ſaith Maim.) <hi>What ſervice is this with the heart?
It is prayer. And there is no number of prayers by the

If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ainſworth be not croſſe to himſelf,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> he
cannot deny the uſe of a ſtinted form amongſt the
Jews in the celebration of the paſſeover; of a ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
form free and voluntary, not neceſſary, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
of God. And that which is here cited out
of Maimonie is no way repugnant thereunto: For
he ſpeaketh not of the paſſeover, or any obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the celebration thereof; but of prayer, and
that private by one alone, and not publick in the
aſſembly or congregation. Now the Jews might
well uſe a ſtinted form in the celebration of the
paſſeover, when yet by the law there was no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſet nor form preſcribed for private prayer.
Theſe two may well agree.</p>
            <p>After long ſearch no copy can be found of any
ſtinted Liturgie in uſe among the Jews till they
ceaſed to be the church of God:<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> which is a poore
and weak proof of the lawfulneſſe of a ſtinted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>It followeth not,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that they never had or uſed a
ſet form becauſe it is not to be found at this day:
For many monuments of antiquity are periſhed.
Again, though forms, which now are extant, were
not entire as now they be untill they ceaſed to be a
church; yet many things conteined in them might
be in uſe before. So it is in the counterfeit Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies
which goe under the name of James, Mark,
Baſil, and Chryſoſtom: they contein many things
which ſhew the whole compoſure to be late in
compariſon, whereas divers things in them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
were of more ancient uſe in the church of
God. And if this do not pleaſe, though there
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23108:64"/>
never was any ſtinted Liturgie or form of prayer to
be uſed in all their ſynagogues and aſſemblies, yet
that is no reaſon to queſtion the truth of that
which the learned have obſerved touching the
ſtinted form uſed in the celebration of the paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
and the probabilities (at leaſt) they bring
to ſhew that our Saviour Chriſt approved the
ſame: which is all that is affirmed in the argument,
and maketh more for the lawfulneſſe of a ſtinted
form of Liturgie, then any thing that hath been
objected, againſt it.</p>
            <p>As for the reformed churches,<note place="margin">

            <p>It is moſt true:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but we muſt conſider wiſely,
and not cenſure unadviſedly. The churches of
God are companies of men called out of this
world, in part onely inlightned, ſubject to errour:
they have erred, they may erre: their ſole teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
cannot be the ground of divine faith and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance:
Nevertheleſſe the conſtant judgement of
the churches of God for many ages in a matter of
this nature, in the times of reformation, when
clouds and darkneſſe are expelled, when the ſunne
is riſen, and great light given to the ſcriptures by
the benefit of languages, tranſlations and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries;
I ſay, the judgement of the churches at
theſe times, and in a matter of this nature, is not
lightly to be regarded. A man ſhould try and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
his grounds and reaſons and miſtruſt himſelf
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:23108:65"/>
rather then ſo many wiſe, learned and godly
ſweetly conſenting in a matter of this nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
his evidence be very good. He had need be
well adviſed before he charge them to maintein a
worſhip not allowed, an idole-prayer for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
worſhip of God, a ſtrange form of prayer,
which was never approved, whereat a Chriſtian
may not ſafely be preſent, againſt which he is
bound to witneſſe. Be it that the churches do
erre herein; yet I hope they be not obſtinate, and
ſuch as will not give conſent to the truth when it
is ſhewed and manifeſted: How cometh it then
to paſſe that none of them hitherto have ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to their opinion and practice? Either their
arguments are not ſufficient to convince, and then
their Separation is unjuſt; or they generally want
eyes to ſee the light (for they will not ſay they
want conſcience to acknowledge what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but ſee) and then in meekneſſe they are to be
born withall, if upon well tried grounds a man be
aſſured, that they all, and not he himſelf, is in the
errour. The teſtimony of the church then is not
infallible; becauſe it may erre, and hath erred,
and ſome members of it at this day do erre in the
particular differences that be amongſt them: but
yet the conſtant teſtimony of the whole church in
the times of light and reformation is of great
weight;<note place="margin">Acts 15. 22, 28.</note> otherwiſe the Apoſtles would never

without it with all the parts of holy and ſpirituall
worſhip.<note place="margin">Robinſon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bern. pag. 474.</note>

It ſufficeth, that it is allowable in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

any ſtinted forms of prayer were in uſe in the

that many aſſemblies had not the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
read in a known tongue at their firſt planting:
it is more then can be ſhewed by precedent or
example, that they were read in any Chriſtian
congregation. Some churches converted by the
preaching of the Goſpel had neither books nor
letters. It may be others received the book of
the Old Teſtament from the apoſtles at their firſt
converſion: but ſuddenly they could not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
into every language; and till they were
tranſlated they could not be read in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23108:66"/>
unto edifying. The books of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
could not be delivered untill they were
written: but they were not written all at once:
and when they were all written, being ſent to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
churches, it muſt be ſome time before they
could be gathered together and tranſlated. And
if nothing be allowable in the church but what was
found in the primitive churches planted by the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
by record of ſcripture, I fear the reading of
the ſcriptures in a known tongue muſt be caſt out
of the congregations. I go not about to equalize
ſtinted Liturgies with ſet tranſlations of the holy
ſcriptures:<note place="margin">Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. in Iſa. 28. 20.</note> but I would intreat ſuch as oppoſe a

Apoſtles have no more appointed the one then the

may be performed without a ſtinted Liturgie, they
may be performed alſo without a ſtinted or ſet
catechiſme: and if a ſet form of prayer muſt be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23108:66"/>
diſallowed, a ſet form of catechiſme, publick or
private, compoſed by the miniſter or deviſed by

excellency and neceſſity of catechizing is known to
them who are exerciſed in the building and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
of the houſe of God: the uſe and profit
of a ſet form therein is both manifeſt by reaſon,
and confirmed by experience, at home and abroad,
in publick and private, to them who have laboured
to lay the foundation of Chriſtian religion, and
train up the people committed to their charge in
ſound wiſdome and underſtanding. And in theſe
things we ſwerve not from our pattern, becauſe
we teach and profeſſe the ſame doctrine, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God with the ſame worſhip and ſubſtantiall
means of worſhip that the primitive churches and

            <p>There is the ſame reaſon of reading the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,

them in the congregation, and of reading a

that ſilence the Apocrypha will ſilence ſtinted
prayers as well and as much.</p>
            <p>When we prove the lawfulneſſe of a ſtinted
form of prayer by the ſtinted forms of pſalmes
and bleſſing mentioned in ſcripture,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> it is thought
anſwer ſufficient to ſay, There is great difference
betwixt bleſſings or pſalmes and prayer: and yet
here it is enough to match things unlike together,
and to ſay of them without all proof, There is the
ſame reaſon of both. But if it have any ſinews,
it will ſilence the ſinging of pſalmes, ſermons, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:23108:67"/>
of faith, and conceived prayer no leſſe
then ſtinted, eſpecially the uſe of notes to help
memory, and forms of catechiſme by whomſoever
and howſoever uſed: For there is the ſame reaſon
of reading and uttering by heart in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if nothing but the canonicall ſcriptures
muſt be read in the congregation, nothing muſt be
uttered by heart or ſtrength of memory but the
ſcriptures alone: But ſermons, profeſſions of faith,
conceived prayer, are not canonicall ſcripture.
The reaſon is one; and whatſoever can be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
truly in the one, will put the other to flight. If
it be ſaid, That it is the prerogative of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be the rule of faith and manners, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nothing is to be read in the congregation as
the ground undoubted and immediate of faith and
manners but the ſcripture alone; this openeth
way for ſtinted prayer as well as for ſermons or
conceived prayer. The ſubſtantiall means of
worſhip both publick and private are determined
of God. It is unlawfull to ſet up an image for
worſhip either publick or private. The ſcripture
muſt be acknowledged the ſole rule of faith and
manners both in publick and private. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
to deviſe ſacramentall ſignes in private as

becauſe the reading of the ſcripture is the onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<hi>medium cultûs,</hi> by the ſame reaſon all forms

is implyed, that ſeeing God hath determined no
certain form, therefore forms deviſed by men
are not neceſſary, but lawfull. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they may be anſwered from their own
grounds; That ſeeing God hath ſanctified and ſet
apart the canonicall ſcriptures, given by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Divine inſpiration, to be the ſole and perfect
rule of faith and manners, therefore the ſcripture
alone muſt be read and acknowledged as the ſole
ground of heavenly inſtruction: But ſeeing he hath
determined no certain form of prayer or ſermons,
profeſſions of faith, or thanksgiving, therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
none at all muſt be made, or forms deviſed
by men are lawfull to be heard in the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet not as immediate and undoubted grounds
of faith, (for that is proper to the ſcripture) but
as inſtructions and exhortations builded upon, or
petitions framed according to the ſcripture, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
occaſion doth require. In ſermons who doth
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:23108:68"/>
not put a difference betwixt the text whereupon
the diſcourſe, inſtructions, exhortations, rebukes
&amp; comforts be grounded &amp; deduced, &amp; the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
rebukes &amp; comforts which are propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in method &amp; phraſe of ſpeech deviſed by men?
The firſt is &amp; ought to be canonicall ſcripture; the
other not ſo. But it would argue great ignorance,
if not perverſeneſſe, if a man ſhould cavill in this
manner againſt the preaching of the word, That
the ſcriptures alone are to be read in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
therefore the miniſter of the Goſpel muſt

requeſts for their own and the churches wants out
of a ſervice-book, wherein they are ſtinted to
words and ſyllables.</p>
            <p>It is a common ſaying,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Similitudes agree not in
all things; and a rule as generall, That to argue
from a bare ſimilitude is the looſeſt kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
which may be applyed to cover or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
any errour or abuſe whatſoever. Therefore
this objection might well have been paſſed over
(as it is omitted by the moſt that have written of
this ſubject, that I have ſeen) but that colours and
ſhadows do often take more with ſome then that
which is ſubſtantiall. If a man would ſet himſelf
to plead for ſuperſtitious abuſes and idolatrous
practices, errours and unwritten traditions, is it
not an eaſie matter by ſome ſimilitude to caſt a fair
gloſſe upon them? And it is a ſtrange thing, that
ſuch as with ſo much earneſtneſſe ſet themſelves
againſt all humane inventions and deviſes in Gods
worſhip, ſhould by their form of reaſoning open
the floud-gates wide for all ſuperſtitious, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
antichriſtian deviſes and impieties, as this
reaſon doth. I need not inſtance: every man that
knoweth what is principally alledged in defenſe of
any popiſh, vain, unprofitable, ſuperſtitious or
idolatrous practice or cuſtome, or will take
pains to look, muſt needs ſee this to be ſo. But to
look upon the objection it ſelf; If a child being to
ask many particulars of his father for himſelf and
others ſhould write them in a paper for the help
of memory or ſome other reaſon, and having
committed them to memory as they are regiſtred
in his paper, ſhould in that form of words digeſted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:23108:69"/>
and written down preſent his requeſts before his
father without addition or alteration; what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
evil or incivility ſhould be committed in this
caſe? why ſhould this be eſteemed a thing ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous?
And if ſimilitudes do pleaſe ſo well, may
we not ſay with more reaſon and upon better
ground, That as a learned oratour being to make
an oration in an honourable preſence about divers
matters of weight and importance, will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtudy and digeſt but penne his ſpeech, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
it word for word as it is contrived and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
ſo the miniſter of the Lord of hoſts in his
publick miniſtration is not onely to conſider what
requeſts he is to make to God in his own and the
peoples behalf, but to digeſt them into fit method,
and to penne or write them down, and to utter
them in the congregation as he hath contrived
them. Let the indifferent judge whether of theſe
two be the moſt reaſonable.</p>

naturall (as wit, memory, utterance) as alſo of
grace (as knowledge, faith, zeal) given to divers
men; beſides that ſome have been more trained and
exerciſed in this holy duty then others: Now they that
are better gifted, either by nature or elſe by grace and

I have obſerved not onely in divers private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

a falſe church. 2. With a falſe miniſtery. 3. In
the behalf of the ſubjects of the kingdome of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.
Theſe are properly theirs, being the
grounds whereupon they make a totall Separation
from all the churches in this land, as no churches
of Chriſt. Theſe I approve not: yet note them,
that you may ſee upon how different grounds the
ſame poſition is mainteined by ſeverall perſons,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:23108:71"/>
and that you may be delivered from the prejudice
which hindreth many from receiving thoſe truthes,
becauſe they fear the reproch of Browniſme. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
there are other grounds which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all that plead for the puritie of Chriſts
ordinance; and which do not neceſſarily inferre
ſuch Separation, but onely ſerve to ſhew the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe
of that practice, and of communicating
therein.</hi> Thus farre the Letter. Wherein, to let
paſſe other things, we may take notice of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Separation from the worſhip of God amongſt
us acknowledged: the one totall, as from a falſe
church, falſe miniſtery, and ſubjects of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Antichriſt; the other partiall, from the
ſtinted Liturgie, and ordinances of worſhip diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
in a ſtinted form. And this latter onely
is approved by this authour, but not the former,
of which we make no queſtion. But whereas he
ſaith, his grounds upon which he buildeth his laſt
Separation are common to all that plead for the
puritie of Chriſts ordinances, therein he is much
miſtaken. For his grounds are one and the very
ſame with the Browniſts, whereby they condemn
all ſtinted Liturgies, acknowledged by no reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
church in the world, nor by particular pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
in any church but themſelves. And if they
take not themſelves to be the onely pleaders for
the purity of Chriſts ordinances, they cannot
ſhew that theſe reaſons have been approved, or
poſitions allowed, by any pleaders for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in any time or age of the church. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
brought to confirm the unlawfulneſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23108:72"/>
in the ordinances of worſhip amongſt
us adminiſtred in a ſtinted Liturgie, are of two
ſorts: Some condemne all ſtinted forms and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies
deviſed by men: others concern our book
of common prayer more particularly, as it is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with ſundry faults and corruptions. The firſt,
as they concern the miniſters who make uſe of a
ſtinted Liturgy, have been examined already:
Now I come to examine them both as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the people; and therefore lay down this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
That in caſe it ſhould be unlawfull in
ſome reſpects for the miniſter of the Goſpel or
governour of the family to reade or pronounce
without book a preſcript form of prayer deviſed
by another, yet no reaſon can be ſhewed why it
ſhould be unwarrantable for the people, child,
ſervant, wife to be preſent at ſuch prayers in the
congregation or family. I ſpeak not of prayer for
the matter erroneous and naught, but ſtinted and
read. For if the matter be faultie, the prayer is
not good becauſe conceived: and if good and
pure, it is not made evil and hurtfull to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
becauſe it is read.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Argum.</note> what letteth why the hearers heart may
not follow a preſcript form of words holy and
good, either in confeſſion of ſinnes, requeſt, or
thanksgiving? What letteth, I ſay, that the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
hearts may not profitably go with the ſame,
both to humble, quicken and comfort? The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
child, ſervant are commanded to examine
and prepare themſelves before they draw nigh
into the preſence of the Lord: But where are they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23108:72"/>
commanded to look whether the miniſter or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
do pray by the Spirit immediately, or out
of his memory; in a ſet form of words conceived
beforehand, or ſuggeſted without premeditation;
in the ſame form of words ordinarily with little or
no variation, unleſſe it be upon ſpeciall occaſion,
or in different order, method and phraſe euery day;
whether he reade his prayer or pronounce it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
And if God have laid no charge upon their
conſcience to inquire into theſe and ſuch like par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
before they joyn in prayer, voluntarily
to withdraw our ſelves from the ordinances of
worſhip in theſe reſpects, what is it but to adde
unto his word? When things agreeable to the
will of God are begged of God every day in the
ſame form of words, as the things begged are the
ſame, it is not either the ſtinted form of words, or
the preſenting of requeſts by reading them upon
a book, that can make the prayer unprofitable,
much leſſe abomination in reſpect of him that
joyneth. If the miniſter in that caſe pray coldly or
without affection, his ſinne cannot hinder the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God from the people. If the governour
be weak in naturall gifts, as memory or utterance;
or ſpirituall, as knowledge, &amp;c, the lawfull uſe of
a ſtinted form in that caſe is not denyed by ſome as
a needfull help to ſupply defect. And if the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to help his weakneſſe, make uſe of a ſtinted
form, whether may the ſervant, child, or wife,
who conceit they need no ſuch furtherance, joyn
with him in prayer or no? If not, I deſire to know
by what authoritie they may withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:23108:73"/>
If they may joyn, then the heart prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
may follow a preſcript form of words deviſed
by others.</p>
            <p>To reade our prayers out of a book,<note place="margin">Object. 1. Johnſon, <hi>ubi ſupra,</hi> pag. 35.</note> is to draw
nigh unto God with the lips when the heart is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
farre from him; becauſe it is not to draw
and poure forth our prayers out of the heart by the
holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>A man may both reade his prayers out of a
book and poure them forth out of his heart,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> as hath
been formerly proved, and is confeſſed by them
that allow a preſcript form in caſe of need: For
they will not ſay, It is lawfull to draw nigh unto
God with the lips when the heart muſt needs be
removed from him. But if this be granted for the
preſent (which is moſt falſe) I demand whether
it be a drawing nigh with the lips onely in reſpect
of him alone that readeth the ſtinted form, or of
all preſent? Not of all preſent: For how can it
be ſaid that their hearts are removed from God
who in ſincerity and truth of heart deſire the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
of what is prayed for, agreeable to the will
of God? Hypocriſie hath loſt its ancient nature,
if it be hypocriſie to draw nigh to the throne of
grace in the name of Chriſt with underſtanding,
confidence and uprightneſſe. If it be a lip-labour
in reſpect of him that readeth it onely, it can be no
ſufficient ground of Separation in others. For in
conceived prayer the miniſter or governour may
pray with the lips and voice when the heart is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
and they that joyn may pray in truth when
the prayer is uttered or pronounced in a preſcribed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:23108:73"/>
form. An hypocrite cannot call upon God in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe
at any time; and yet they will not ſay
it is unlawfull to joyn in prayer with ſuch a man.
Put caſe a particular man did know his miniſter to
be an hypocrite by more certain evidence then
poſſibly he can know read prayer to be lip-labour;
yet he is bound in conſcience not to
ſeparate from the publick prayers or ordinances
of grace adminiſtred by ſuch a man. For Chriſt
hath commanded us to come unto him, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to be preſent with them that aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his name, to heare them that in truth call
upon his name: and though an hypocrite ſhall not
be heard for himſelf, he may be heard for others.
A miniſter he is, not for his own goods, but his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
is effectuall to the heirs of ſalvation:
Formally, as ſome ſpeak, he hath not pardon of
ſinne for the comfort of his own ſoul; but mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially,
inſtrumentally, he hath it for the benefit
of others: that is, hee poſſeſſeth not the promiſe
of pardon for his own comfort, but he bringeth
it for the good of others. A Chriſtian may not
abſent himſelf from the publick prayers of the
congregation and ordinances of grace unleſſe
Chriſt hath given him leave or commandment ſo
to do: but when he may call upon God purely and
ſincerely, he hath not given a Chriſtian leave to
ſeparate or withdraw himſelf becauſe he conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the miniſter to be an hypocrite. But of this
more hereafter. Let us then imagine (if fanſie
can be ſo ſtrong) that the uſe of a ſtinted prayer is
but lip-labour in the miniſter or governour; what
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:23108:74"/>
elſe can follow, but that the ſervice is lawfull, the
lip-labour being corrected? which is done, not by
Separation, but by conjoyning the ſervice and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the heart and inward man with the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of the outward.</p>
            <p>Reading is not prayer:<note place="margin">Object. 2. Johnſon, ubi ſuprà.</note> For in prayer we poure
out deſires and ſupplications from the heart; in
reading we let into the heart the things that are

He that readeth ſpeaketh not to God but to the
people.</p>
            <p>To reade is not to pray: but in reading a man
may pray agreeable to the ordinance,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> with right
affection of ſoul: As to pronounce is not to pray;
becauſe a dumbe man may pray, who cannot ſpeak:
but when a man uttereth his prayer for the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of others, he himſelf may and doth ſpeak unto
God. But if this be preſuppoſed, that a man
cannot both reade a prayer and pray himſelf, what
hindreth that others cannot lift up their hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and joyn in requeſts according to the
preſcript form of words? Is not the matter fit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is preſcribed? cannot the heart deſire or
lift up it ſelf becauſe the requeſts are read? doth
the very act of reading pollute the whole action?
If all things eſſentially required in prayer may be
obſerved of them that joyn in prayer with ſuch as
reade them, then the ſimple act of reading is not
ſufficient cauſe why Chriſtians ſhould withdraw
themſelves: But all things eſſentiall to prayer may
be obſerved of them that joyn in prayer with
ſuch as reade: the matter may be fit, ſound and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

            <p>It is not certain by certainty of Divine

but by humane teſtimony it is ſo probable,
that even ſuch as deny all lawfull uſe of a ſtinted
form do give their aſſent hereunto, as hath been
ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>The Jews did not preſcribe and ſet apart their

to no purpoſe to alledge that that form was not
ſet apart for publick uſe, nor they neceſſarily tied
unto it, when the ſimple uſe of ſuch a ſtinted form
deviſed by others is condemned as unlawfull in
reſpect of miniſter and people, the impoſer and
uſer. Plain dealing is a jewel. Moreover (to
take away the ambiguitie of the word) a ſtinted
form may be ſet apart for publick uſe two wayes:
Either as ſanctified to be the immediate and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible

of worſhip, holy by inſtitution and neceſſary in

and in this no publick Liturgie is or ought to be

            <p>A ſtinted Liturgie is challenged to be an humane

becauſe it is not preſcribed in the word: The like

It is an humane deviſe, a corrupt addition,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:23108:76"/>

Why did our Saviour go up to the feaſt of the
paſſeover according to the cuſtome,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 42, 43.</note> when he was
twelve yeares old, onely to preach unto them,
and reprove their humane inventions, and not to
keep the paſſeover? Did he ordinarily reſort to
the ſynagogues, and was he preſent at the lectures
of the law and prophets, and did not joyn in
prayer?<note place="margin">Luke 2. 21, 27.</note> He himſelf telleth us, it behooved him
to fulfill all righteouſneſſe: and was not this one
branch of that righteouſneſſe he was to fulfill? It
is true, he reſorted thither to preach the Goſpel,
and reprove the corrupt gloſſes of the ſcribes and
Phariſees: but to preach the Goſpel and joyn in
prayer with the people of God in covenant, are
things that may well ſtand together. Our Saviour
reproved the humane inventions of the ſcribes and
Phariſees: but did he ever reprove them ſimply for
their ſtinted Liturgie, or teach the faithfull not to
joyn with the reſt in their ſynagogues in any part
of their ſtinted Liturgie? If he came to the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
merely to take the opportunity of their
meetings, did he celebrate the laſt paſſeover with
his diſciples merely for that end likewiſe? And
if any man will be ſo unadviſed and raſh (to ſay no
more) it will not avail: For unto their cuſtome of
finiſhing the paſſeover with certain pſalmes, there
is not any thing more probable, then that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

That our prayers be preſented to God in this or

ſelves; ſuddenly conceived, or premeditated long
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:23108:77"/>

ſame often reiterated as occaſion requireth. And
if the worſhip it ſelf be vain and unwarrantable, it
muſt be either becauſe the form of prayer is devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by himſelf, and uttered in a ſtinted form; or
deviſed by others and not by himſelf. If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
then no prayer is Gods ordinance which is
not uttered without premeditation ſettled and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
or at leaſt which is not immediately ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
by the Spirit in reſpect of words and phraſe
of ſpeech: If the latter; then deviſed worſhip is
not forbidden in the ſecond commandment, but
worſhip deviſed by another: For that prayer
which ſhould be pure worſhip if deviſed by a mans
ſelf, is unlawfull worſhip when deviſed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
And ſo deviſed worſhip or prayer is not
condemned, but worſhip or prayer deviſed by
another man. And if this be not the deviſe of
man, I know not what is. Can this alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the worſhip in the hearer, or him that
joyneth, that the words in prayer are invented by
another, ſtudied by the governour, or more

One man is of opinion, that a preſcribed form is

            <p>It is harſh to affirm, that ſuch hath been the

if ſuch was the ſtate of the Chriſtian church
from that time, what is become of thoſe great
and pretious promiſes made to the church in the
times of the Meſſias? Did the church begin to
draw and give up her breath both in one day?
Many things were amiſſe in the church, many
corruptions did begin to bud in the apoſtles times,
and after their departure did put forth with greater
vigour: and the ſaints of God, I doubt not, offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many wayes through ignorance and infirmity,
which God in mercy was pleaſed to pardon unto
them: But that the ſtate and condition of the
church was ſuch that a Chriſtian could not hold
communion in prayer and the ſacraments with the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:23108:79"/>
churches of God, is contrary to the many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in ſcripture made to the churches of the New
Teſtament. It is true, the ſcripture doth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn
us of an apoſtaſie from the faith, and the
myſtery of iniquity began to work in the apoſtles
dayes, and after their death things declined more
and more: But that within an age or two after the

corrupted that the godly might not hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

age and poſterity, nor ourſelves, to yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
If it be an holy form of baptiſme, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:23108:80"/>
to baptize into the name of the Father, Sonne
and holy Ghoſt, it doth not become an unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
ordinance, if the church ſhall take order
that the miniſter ſhall baptize in this and none
other form, in theſe and none other words. When
God calleth a man forth to bear witneſſe to
the truth, he muſt not draw back but give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
thereunto: But when Chriſt calleth us to
worſhip him according to his will, we muſt not
abſent our ſelves for the ſinne of others, under
pretenſe of bearing witneſſe to that we are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto. We muſt not violate the ordinances of
the Lord, to partake in his ordinances: But if the
matter of prayer be juſt, holy and good, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſhall violate no ordinance of Chriſt by his
preſence, but by his abſence.</p>
            <p>It is not enough to prove our vocall prayers to
be good becauſe the words be good and expreſſe
good petitions;<note place="margin">Object. 2. Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 23.</note> but it is further required, that it
proceed from ability which the Spirit of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth
on him who uttereth the words, to fit his
requeſt to the preſent occaſion: John 4. 24.
1. Cor. 14. 15, 16. 1. Pet. 4. 7.</p>
            <p>Is it their meaning,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that he that prayeth accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
hath abilitie to fit his words according to
the preſent occaſion, or onely that he diſcerneth
in ſome meaſure the words of prayer to fit the
time and occaſion of the people with whom he
prayeth? If in the firſt ſenſe; the paſſages of the
ſcripture cited will not bear them out. If in the
latter; it is nothing againſt the uſe of ſtinted pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Beſides, when we ſpeak of joyning with
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:23108:80"/>
others, is it neceſſary to the acceptance of prayer,
that he which is the mouth of the reſt to God
ſhould be able by the guidance of the Spirit to utter
requeſt fitting the preſent occaſion, and in fitting
words? Suppoſe he be deſtitute of the Spirit,
or of that meaſure of the Spirit, may not the good
and holy requeſts which he putteth up by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and help of others be accepted in behalf of
them that pray in the Spirit and poure out their
prayers before God in holy affiance? To joyn
with the people of God in prayer and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſacraments is not a matter arbitrary
which may be done or left at pleaſure, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
when God calleth and giveth opportunitie.
And if God hath promiſed to heare ſuch prayers,
and by his bleſſing ſome good may be gotten by
them, a Chriſtian muſt be well adviſed how he
withdraweth himſelf, leaſt whiles he pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
too much in ſome ſcrupulous conceits he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
his ſoul. Prayer is Gods ordinance,
whereunto all Chriſtians are bound to apply
themſelves: a ſtinted Liturgie is allowed of God,
provided it be ſound, holy and pure both for
words and matter: And if any ſinne be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the reading or uſe thereof, a Chriſtian may
perform whatſoever office the Lord requireth at

before and after the ſermon, wiſhing to their

the pardon of ſins, &amp;c. The ſcriptures of the

the Engliſh Liturgie by his authoritie, if ſhe would
yield to him in ſome other things. Indeed this
Liturgie pleaſed them ſo well, that for the firſt
eleven years of Qu. Elizabeth Papiſts came to
the Engliſh churches and ſervice, as the Lord Cook
ſheweth. And when the Popes intelligencers had
ſeen ſervice ſolemnly ſung and ſaid in Canterbury
and London with all their pomp and proceſſion,
they wondred that their maſter would be ſo unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
<note place="margin">Id. pag. 80.</note> as to interdict a Prince or State whoſe ſervice
and ceremonies ſo ſymbolized with his own. The
whole form then of the church-ſervice (a few
groſſe things taken out) is borrowed from
the Papiſts, culled and picked out of that popiſh
dung-hill, the Portuis and vile Maſſe-book. But
that form of prayer by which God is worſhipped
after the manner that idolaters worſhip their
Gods, ſwerveth from a rule of prayer preſcribed
in ſcripture,<note place="margin">Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pag. 23.</note> Deut. 12. 3, 4. &amp; 30. 31, 32. And
this is made the firſt of the exceptions againſt the
common-prayer-book, which were briefly added
to in the Abbridgement, That it appointed a Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
which in the whole matter and form thereof
is too like unto the Maſſe-book.</p>
            <p>The main challenge in this objection (which I
have ſet down more at large,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> becauſe it is much
inſiſted upon) againſt our communion-book is,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23108:85"/>
That it was taken out of the maſſe-book. But in
the manner of propounding there be divers great
miſtakes, to ſay no more. It is a great fault, that
they put no difference betwixt the ſubſtance of
worſhip and the externall form or order of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration.
The ſubſtance of worſhip in that ſtinted
form of prayer, is, That we call upon God in the
mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, according to his will.
Is this the deviſe of Antichriſt becauſe the form of
words was taken out of the maſſe-book? Suppoſe
a miniſter of the Goſpel ſhould borrow ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions

I ſcarce know how a man ſhould more honour An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt

to grant that all the good things that Antichriſt
doth uſurp do of right belong unto him and are
borrowed from him: For they are the rich lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which Chriſt hath bequeathed unto his
church, to whom properly they pertein. The

of the matter or of the form. Not of the
matter: for that which properly belonged to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
the ſoul and groſſe errours, are purged
out. Not of the form: for order and phraſe of
ſpeech is not properly Antichriſtian; of which
more hereafter. The Papiſts cannot ſincerely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

Thus Cardinal Quignonius by the commandment
of Clement the ſeventh ſo changed the Romane
Breviarie that for a great part it was more like the
Engliſh book of prayers than the Romane Brevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:23108:87"/>
And the Engliſh Liturgie gathered according
to the module of the Ancients, the pureſt of them,
is not a collection out of the Maſſe-book, but a
refining of that Liturgie which heretofore had
been ſtained with the Maſſe. And if thoſe things
were unjuſtly added to the Liturgie, they might
be and were juſtly caſt out. If it was wholly taken
out of the Maſſe-book, I ſhould deſire further to
know how the Maſſe-book came to have thoſe
things in which are found in the book of Common
prayers, ſound and holy for matter, and directly
contrary to Antichriſtianiſme. If theſe things
were in the book before, then all things therein
were not of Antichriſt, but he had uſurped them;
and it is lawfull for the true man to lay claim to his
goods whereever he find them. If they were not
in the Maſſe-book, then all things are not taken
out of it, but ſomethings reſtored out of purer
Antiquity, which the man of ſinne had wickedly
expunged.<note place="margin">See Act. &amp; Mon. vol. 3. pag. 1631. Of Dr Taylours teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſervice-book. Mr Decrings teſtimony is well known.</note> The miniſters of Lincoln never
judged the uſe of the Book unlawfull, never
thought it lawfull to ſeparate from the prayers of
the congregation, never refuſed to uſe the book,
though in ſome things they deſired to be excuſed.
The churches of God have been evermore taught
to prize and eſteem theſe main and fundamentall
truths and ordinances of worſhip at an higher rate
then that ſome petty diſlike of this or that in the
externall form, when the matter is ſound and
good, ſhould cauſe Separation. The concluſion
in brief is, That our Service-book is not a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Maſſe, but a reſtitution of the ancient
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:23108:88"/>
Liturgie, wherein ſundry prayers are inſerted,
uſed by the Fathers, agreeable to the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Cauſeleſſe ſeparation from the externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with any true church of Chriſt, is the
ſinne of ſchiſme. But to ſeparate from the prayers
of the congregation ſimply becauſe a ſtinted form
is uſed, is cauſeleſſe ſeparation from the externall
communion of the church. Weigh all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
brought to prove it lawfull, and they will be
found too light. If we look to our guide and
captain, Chriſt doth not goe before us therein.
Dare any man affirm that they be not met together
in the name of Chriſt, or that he is not preſent in
the midſt of them that joyn together in a ſtinted
Liturgie? Is there any duty publick or private
which God requireth of people holding commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
together in ordinances of worſhip which may
not be performed of each to other when a ſtinted
form of prayer is uſed without Separation? But
by that unwarrantable courſe of voluntary ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they make an unlawfull rent in the church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
themſelves of the comfort of Gods ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

Moreover, the book perverteth the right uſe of the
ſcriptures, diſmembreth and miſapplieth them for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of goſpels, epiſtles, leſſons, and collects appointed
for feaſts of mens deviſing, and derived from the
Papiſts; and it reteineth a corrupt tranſlation of the
pſalmes, and bringeth into the church Apocrypha wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:23108:89"/>
and the errours conteined in them.</hi> To them
that look at all humane Liturgies as images forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the ſecond commandment, this objection
is of ſmall force; becauſe the thing it ſelf, and not
the corruption cleaving to the Liturgie, is diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
But leſt this accuſation ſhould breed
ſcruple in the minds of ſome not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſaffected to ſtinted forms of prayer or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,
I will examine not the qualitie of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
whether juſtly or unjuſtly taken, but the
weight of the reaſon, if the particulars ſhould be
granted. For this objection it ſelf doth free the
Liturgie from groſſe errours, either fundamentall
or ſuch as border thereupon, reſpecting faith or
practice, in the prayers themſelves or that which
concerneth the adminiſtration of the ſacraments.
For the corruptions objected, are Miſapplication
of ſome text si of ſcripture, Frequent repetitions
of the ſame things, Diſordered reſponſories, and
Breaking petitions aſunder, &amp;c. and theſe not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
throughout the whole book, but in ſome
paſſages onely; which concern not the main
grounds and chief heads of Chriſtian religion, but
are ſuch faults or ſlips as may peaceably be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
amongſt brethren. Therefore not to inſiſt
upon any particulars mentioned, I lay down this
propoſition, That a Chriſtian may lawfully and
with good conſcience be preſent at ſuch ſervice
and prayers which are read out of a book, though
ſomethings therein are or may be ſuppoſed to be
faultie for form or matter, in things not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
nor bordering thereupon, not pernicious or
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:23108:89"/>
noxious, but ſuch as may be tolerated amongſt
brethren; &amp; theſe not diſperſed through the whole
body of the book, but in ſome paſſages onely. It
is one thing to allow corruption, another to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the ſervice of God where ſomething is
done corruptly. For the Lord chargeth us to
keep our ſelves free from all pollution; but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to ſeparate from abuſes, unleſſe he be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to go before, and as he goeth before us. It is
one thing to approve of abuſes in a Liturgie, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to tolerate what we cannot reform. For a
Liturgie ſhould be framed ſo, not that things may
be conſtrued well, but that they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued
amiſſe. But many things may be ſuffered
which are not ſo well ordained, when it is not in
our power to redreſſe them. The Lord needeth
not mans lie, neither doth he allow us to do evil
that good may come thereof: and therefore I
muſt not ſubſcribe to an errour againſt conſcience,
though never ſo innocent, nor profeſſe approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that which in conſcience I cannot allow,
though never ſo ſmall, to the intent I might enjoy
externall communion with the church of God in
the ordinances of worſhip. But I muſt tolerate
many things for the maintenance of peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and the preſervation of Gods worſhip: For
if there be not mutuall toleration and forbearance,
but each man will rigidly ſtand upon his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and preſſe others to be of his mind and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his practice in all things and every tittle, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
all things muſt fall into confuſion, and the
church be rent almoſt into as many pieces as there
be men.</p>

The propoſition is proved,<note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> firſt, Becauſe they
that alledge the foreſaid faults or corruptions
againſt communicating with us in our publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
or ſtinted prayers, do themſelves put ſmall
ſtrength or none at all in this reaſon. For ſuppoſe
a chapter be ſomewhat unfitly divided, and break
off in the midſt of the matter, or now and then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
verſes which ſhould go together, or a verſe
be ill diſtinguiſhed, or the preacher miſalledge a
text of ſcripture, or ſomething be found amiſſe
in his prayer when he exerciſeth his own gifts,
muſt I of neceſſitie ſeparate from that ordinance
of God, or reject the good for that which is
amiſſe? Hereunto this anſwer is returned;
<hi>When the miniſter exerciſeth his own gift,</hi>

in either, which are but perſonall: and in
ſuch caſes the rule warranteth men to trie all things and
to hold that which is good, 1. Theſſ. 5. 21. But
when the Liturgie is read, an ordinance which is not of
God but of man is introduced into Gods worſhip contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

reject it, and have no communion with it.</hi> Is not
this in plain terms to grant, that the corruptions
alledged can be no cauſe of Separation, but this
onely, Becauſe it is the deviſe of man. The
corruptions alledged are not the cauſe, becauſe
they may be found in tranſlations, the diſtinction
of chapters and verſes, the preaching of the word,
and the prayers of the miniſter, when he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

whatſoever is objected touching abuſes, the whole

And this objecting of abuſes in this queſtion is the

which he hath received of the Lord, Col. 4. 17.
and, as occaſion ſhall require, to proceed further,
to declare their diſlike, in ſuch a manner as is meet,
either by abſenting themſelves from it, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

            <p>Whatſoever worſhip is offered up to God by

The preſence of the people was never
deemed interpretatively a conſent to every thing
that was there done. The prayers which for
matter God diſalloweth we ought to diſallow,
but as God diſalloweth them, and as he calleth us
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:23108:91"/>

becauſe it is not the Liturgie appointed by Chriſt
in the New Teſtament. And many things are here

Prayer is the ordinance of God, and all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are bound in conſcience to apply themſelves
unto it: But the forms of prayer may be divers;
all allowed, becauſe none is neceſſary or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
and therefore though allowed, no man is

And as they are not bound unto any one, ſo

            <p>Though all preſence where ſinne is acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth

when we are in the uſe of Gods ordinance.</p>
            <p>It is one thing to be preſent where that which is
ſinne in it ſelf abſolutely and ſimply is acted,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to be preſent at the doing of ſome neceſſary
duty wherein by accident ſomewhat is amiſſe.
Now to joyn in prayer or participation of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
is to communicate in the neceſſary duties
of piety, not in ſinne; and if ought be done amiſſe,
it is by accident, not by it ſelf. And preſence there,
though ſinne be committed by one or other, is
leſſe dangerous, becauſe it is not free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
but neceſſary and enjoyned. We are not left
at liberty to come or not, as pleaſe our ſelves, but

commanded under pain of ſinne to be there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
and he that calleth will preſerve from danger,

And if preſence was dangerous, yet it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull:
for by watchfulneſſe the danger might be
prevented, and not by ſeparation or withdrawing
our ſelves from the worſhip it ſelf. If there be
danger, I muſt be vigilant and circumſpect, but
I muſt not ſhut the doore againſt Chriſt when he

nothing is here alledged but what might be ſaid

For the corruptions of the Phariſees in

well known to all men, and ſo reproved by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

ſaid of the diſorders in the churches of Corinth,

the Apoſtle abſent and at that time in priſon, by the
information of the brethren, of neceſſitie it muſt
be known to the members of the churches. The

defiled with all known corruption whatſoever, it
is not materiall to the point in hand how thoſe
corruptions differ in their ſpecificall nature. The
queſtion is, Whether all preſence at the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God in ſome reſpect corruptly or diſorderly
adminiſtred, contract guilt in him that is onely
preſent in obedience to Gods commandment, and
hath no calling from God to teſtifie peculiar or
ſpeciall diſlike. It may be of ſome uſe here to
ſhew what corruptions be fundamentall and what
not, what pernicious to be tolerated and what
not, when a man hath a calling to teſtifie againſt
abuſes and when not: But to ſpeak of the ſpecificall
difference betwixt abuſes of the ſame kind or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
is quite wide of the mark. This will eaſily

faithfull and furniſh them for this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
But untill the time of freedome was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,

ſpeak,<note place="margin">Carleton, Conſenſ. Eccl. cathol. de Script. cap. 1.</note> and a time to keep ſilence, but no time to lie;
ſo there is a time for the church to figh and lie
hid, but no time to diſſemble or defile her ſelf.
And as the Iſraelites offended not when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
not out of Egypt before Moſes was ſent
thither of God, ſo neither did the faithfull tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe,
in that they departed not out of Babyloniſh
captivitie before they were called of God, the
time of liberty was proclaimed, and God ſhewed
them whither to flie. To live in captivitie untill
freedome be publiſhed, is a miſery, not a ſinne.
In that condition care muſt be, to keep pure and
undefiled, but not to run away without leave or
licence from God. Whatſoever is to be thought
of this application of the text, herein all ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
interpreters conſent and agree, that after the
church was ſtained with manifold abuſes, the
faithfull did and ought to hold communion with
her in the means of worſhip. But if ſimple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
be approbation of every thing that is judged
to be done amiſſe in the worſhip of God, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
could at no time that can be named, in no age
ſince the death of the apoſtles, hold communion
with the church of God in the ordinances and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:23108:97"/>
means of grace. For it is as lawfull to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the worſhip, prayers or adminiſtration
which is read out of a book in ſome things faulty,
as to be preſent at that ſervice where the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are read out of a tranſlation in many things
faulty and corrupt, in which many things are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
diminiſhed, altered and changed. But in the
primitive churches the faithfull muſt be preſent, if
at all, at the worſhip of God when the ſcriptures
were read out of a faulty tranſlation: For to ſay
nothing of the corruptions of the Seventy Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,

that ancient cuſtome is not plea ſufficient to prove

ſhould voluntarily abſent our ſelves from the
Lords ordinances. In the ſecond primitive
church (as ſome diſtinguiſh) if not the firſt, they
had a ſtinted form of Liturgie, not onely for leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
pſalmes, epiſtles and goſpels, and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of faith, but in prayers, for matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
not much unlike to ours. To the praiſe of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:23108:98"/>
God be it ſpoken, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
for purity and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
may compare with
any Liturgie uſed in the
third and fourth ages of the
church: And if in thoſe
times the faithfull might
lawfully hold communion
in the ordinances of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
we cannot at this day
lawfully withdraw our
ſelves by reaſon of ſuch
faults as be objected. This
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:23108:98"/>
I mention, that we might learn to acknowledge
Gods mercy, walk worthy of what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and ſtrive forward towards perfection by
all lawfull means. Long before the Lord called
his people to come out of Babylon, what faults
ſoever can be objected againſt our Liturgie were
found in theirs. The faithfull therefore may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be preſent at our ſervice, notwithſtanding
the faults objected againſt it. For the Lord did
not onely wink at his peoples weakneſſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
for the time, but approve of their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparation
untill he was pleaſed to call them
forth. Neither can it be imagined, that they
might hold communion in other ordinances but
not in their ſtinted Liturgies: for in thoſe times of
all other parts the ſtinted Liturgies were moſt
pure, God of his endleſſe mercy ſo providing for
his church and the comfort of his people in thoſe
hard and evil times when the doctrine was miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

to withdraw himſelf. But in a congregation
where a ſtinted form is uſed, and that in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
faulty here or there, Chriſt may be and is
preſent in the midſt among them; Chriſtians are
called to come, and may be preſent without guilt
of hypocriſie or approbation of the leaſt evil. To
leave communion when we be obliged by God to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:23108:101"/>
continue in it, is no leſſe then ſchiſme according
to the nature of it. Obliged by God we are to
hold communion with the true churches of Chriſt
in his true worſhip and ſervice ſo farre as it may be
without ſin and wickedneſſe on our parts: So that
though there be ſome errours or ignorances in the
publick adminiſtration, yet if our belief of ſome
errour or approbation of diſorder be not required
to that communion, it is not lawfull to depart
from the ſociety of that church which profeſſeth
the ſaving truth of Chriſt intirely for ſubſtance,
rightly mainteineth the diſpenſation of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſoundly calleth upon God in the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Jeſus Chriſt, and plentifully enjoyeth the
means of grace. When corruption and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
communion be ſo involved that it is ſimply
impoſſible to leave the corruptions unleſſe we
leave the externall communion of the church, a
neceſſity of ſeparation from that externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
then lyeth upon us:<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> But though errours or

it is one thing to bear with faults for a ſeaſon,
when we have power in our hands to reform
them; another, to hold communion with the
church in the worſhip of God where ſuch abuſes
are continued. Such as have power in their hands
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:23108:103"/>
to reform ſhould tolerate abuſes for a time onely,
<hi>ſc.</hi> untill there be opportunity of reformation:
But ſuch as have not power in their hands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
abuſes may and ought to hold communion
with the church of God in the publick worſhip of
God, notwithſtanding ſuch abuſes continued:
for the continuance of ſuch corruptions is not the
ſin of him who hath uſed all good means for their
removall, but cannot obtein it. The Lord never
gave commandment to his people to depart from
and forſake his ordinances becauſe ſuch as ought
did not reform but maintein abuſes in his ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
If they abode ſtill in that corrupt ſociety, and
joyned in the publick worſhip of God, becauſe
they had not authority to redreſſe them; then it
followeth, that communion in Gods ordinances is
not ſin to them who miſlike the corruptions that
are allowed and practiced, pray, deſire, and by
all other good means ſeek reformation, but break
not off ſociety, becauſe the Lord hath given
them no authority ſo to do, goeth not before
them therein: they ſhould walk by their own
light, and not by Gods commandment, nor the
approved examples of the Saints recorded in
ſcripture. For one or a few private Chriſtians to
break off ſociety with the church in prayer or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the ſacraments, becauſe they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
in a ſtinted Liturgie, or the corruptions
pretended therein, is a greater diſorder and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
then any they can alledge in the Liturgie
concerning prayer or adminiſtration of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:

execute her authority in undue manner. That is
neceſſary to them that have received commiſſion
from God which is unlawfull to them that want
authority. In the common-wealth the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of juſtice is neceſſary: but private perſons muſt
not challenge the ſword of the magiſtrate. In a
corporation no one muſt take that upon himſelf
which belongeth to the common councel. Holy
things muſt not be given to prophane perſons: but
every one at his pleaſure muſt not deny holy
things to unholy perſons; but unholy perſons
muſt be debarred from holy things in ſuch order
as God hath preſcribed. It is a thing illegall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
and unreaſonable, that a Chriſtian man

their intereſt in the body and bloud of Chriſt to a

deſerving members of the church, and ſuch as
moſt deſerved ſhould leaſt feel the ſeverity of

Now if the ſame communion for ſubſtance be in

defiled with the preſence of the ungodly at the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
though they that communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

enjoyned by God, not left to our will or pleaſure:
Our communion with the wicked in the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

with Chriſt and his faithfull people, if we
come to the ordinances in affiance, fear, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
of mind, &amp;c. as we ought: And
as for the wicked, they can take no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
if according to our place and office we
exhort, admoniſh, rebuke and tell them plainly of
the danger of their ſin; or if any be hardned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
his bloud ſhall be upon his own head. We
have received commandment from God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,
admoniſh, rebuke, watch over one another
according to our place and calling: but to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
our ſelves becauſe ſuch as ſhould be cut

ordinances and to depart from Chriſt becauſe ſuch
as hate to be reformed take the covenant into their
mouthes, or to uſurp power to cenſure and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
which God hath not put into our hands;
theſe things are neither commanded nor allowed
of God. The wicked uſurp in that they intrude
unto the Lords table: and the faithfull uſurp, if
without authoritie they take upon them to expell
the wicked, or depart themſelves: And if we
ſearch the ſcripture, and move onely as the Lord
is pleaſed to go before us, we ſhall not find that
a few private Chriſtians have authority in this caſe
to do either. And hence appeareth an apparent
difference betwixt externall communion with
wicked men in the exerciſes of religion, and private
familiaritie: For familiarity is merely arbitrary,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:23108:111"/>
not enjoyned but forbidden; affected, not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

fellowſhip with Chriſt and his Saints in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances

cannot expell them, or withdraw our ſelves by
the Lords leave and approbation. Draw this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

not lawfull to have private, needleſſe, arbitrary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity

therefore it is not lawfull to repair to the
ordinances of grace when the Lord calleth, nor
there to have communion with Chriſt and his
faithfull people, becauſe the wicked are permitted
to be preſent, when yet we have neither power to
repell them, nor leave of Chriſt to depart our
ſelves. How looſe this conſequence is who doth
not ſee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A little leaven leaveneth the vvhole lump:</hi>

they be ſowred with their leaven.</p>
            <p>The compariſon of the leaven uſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
is to be underſtood in likeneſſe of nature,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> not
in their equality of effecting:<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 9.</note> For leaven ſowreth
naturally, and cannot but ſowre the meal: the
godly may be hurt by the wicked, but it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.
Therefore every member muſt look
warily to himſelf, and do his endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
other, or that he may be caſt out, if notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and incorrigible, but not withdraw himſelf
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:23108:112"/>
from the ordinances of grace. The doctrine of
the Goſpel is compared to leaven in reſpect of its
efficacy:<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 33.</note> but all that heare it are not ſeaſoned by
it, though it be a good means of ſeaſoning. The
corrupt doctrine of the Phariſees is compared to
old leaven:<note place="margin">Matth, 16. 6, 12.</note> but every one that heard it was not
neceſſarily tainted with it. It is true, if the whole
church ſhall bear with ſcandalous, notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
and do not their endeavour to bring them
to repentance, or to have them caſt out, they are
polluted and ſtained by their remiſſeneſſe &amp; indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
and this is that which the Apoſtle preſſeth
upon the Corinthians, that they ſhould give all
diligence to clear themſelves,<note place="margin">If the church ſee not that to be ſin vvhich I ſee to be a ſin, I having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of according to my place, I have diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my duty, and the ſinne lieth upon the church, if it be a ſin, and not upon me, <hi>Robinſ.

               </note> and prevent the
danger which might come by their negligence.
But if the church be remiſſe or ſlack, the private
men who mourn for what they cannot amend, and
labour conſcionably to diſcharge their duties, may
not ſeparate from the communion or withdraw
themſelves from the Lords table. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
who blameth the Corinthians becauſe they
ſuffered the inceſtuous perſon, doth never blame
the faithfull for communicating with him before
he was cut off, nor intimate unto them, that unleſſe
he did amend they muſt abſent themſelves from
their aſſemblies and holy exerciſes, or depart away
being come together. They that have authority

Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe Chriſt our Lord had been inwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the guilt of a world of ſins in the Jewiſh church, with which church he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in Gods ordinances, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a member thereof, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſ.

may reach the ſacrament to an unworthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant,
and yet be innocent. For he doth not
ſo much give it him, as ſuffer his communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath not power or authority to put him
back: He reacheth him the ſignes, as that which
he cannot withhold, becauſe he is held in by the
moſt prevailing power, without which he cannot
be debarred. In this caſe the miniſter is neither
actour nor conſenter in his admiſſion, becauſe he
doth it not in his own name, but according to the
order eſtabliſhed by God, who will not have any
member of the congregation publickly denied his
intereſt and right to the holy things of God by
the knowledge will and pleaſure of one ſingular
miniſter. If a miniſter know a man to be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
he muſt yet receive him, becauſe he cannot
manifeſt it to the church: And for the ſame reaſon,
if his unworthineſſe be notorious, if it be not ſo
judged by them that have authority, he muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the ſacramentall ſignes unto him, not as
unto one worthy or unworthy, but as unto one as
yet undivided from them.</p>

            <p>If all places and ſtandings be unwarrantable
wherein we may not uſe the ordinary means God
hath left for the amendment of things,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> then all
places are unlawfull, wherein the greateſt part
of the church at leaſt do not conſcionably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their duties, and of them which have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
authority: Then the Levites might not abide
in their ſtandings when the prieſts neglected their

had corrupted their wayes:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> Then the people

the law, worſhip, offices, and manners. To
ſpeak no more of abuſes; if this rule hold, no place

the ignorance, infirmities, diverſities of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that be amongſt the godly, paſſions, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers

the church muſt fall into as many ſchiſmes almoſt

ſtanding as unlawfull, wherein he conceiteth
he is reſtrained of ſome power or hindred of ſome

            <p>No church in the world now hath that abſolute
promiſe of the Lords viſible preſence which the
church then had till the coming of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> It
was ſimply neceſſary,<note place="margin">Robinſ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Bern. pag. 248.</note> that Meſſiah ſhould be born
in the true church, wherein he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
and fulfill the law. The Lord did afford
the Jews, even in their deepeſt apoſtaſie, ſome or
other viſible ſignes of his preſence, and thoſe
extraordinary when ordinary failed; thereby ſtill
declaring himſelf to remember his promiſe.
There was that onely viſible church upon the face
of the earth, tyed to one temple, altar, ſacrifice,
prieſt hood, in one place;<note place="margin">Idem, pag. 250</note> and no man could abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
ſeparate from that church but he muſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the viſible preſence and from all ſolemn
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:23108:114"/>
worſhip of God. Moreover, the Jewiſh church
had not that diſtinct eccleſiaſticall ordinance of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
which we now have; but that the
obſtinate or preſumptuous offender was by bodily
death to be cut off from the Lords people; the
ſame perſons, namely the whole nation, being
both church and common-wealth according to
that ſpeciall diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations rightly applyed do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
overthrow what hath been and is by others
objected againſt communion with us in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> For if it was abſolutely neceſſary
that the Meſſias ſhould be born in the true church,
wherein he might have communion, then a church
corrupted in officers and offices, doctrine, worſhip
and manners, may be a true church, wherewith
the faithfull may hold communion without ſin;
or at leaſt the faithfull may lie hid in ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
ſociety, and hold communion with them in
the exerciſes of religion without ſin. And if the
Jews had not power to caſt out an offender, the
materiall part of that church was not viſible Saints,
whom God was pleaſed to take into covenant, but
the whole body of the Jewiſh nation, ignorant;
impenitent, prophane, obſtinate, even all that
were not cut off by bodily death; the ſacraments
muſt not be diſpenſed according to the promiſe
made to the faithfull and their ſeed, but promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly
to all that came of the loins of Jacob ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fleſh; the faithfull might and ought
to have communion, as one body, with the wicked
and prophane, who remain in unbelief, and both
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:23108:114"/>
revile and perſecute the truth; Then a company
of impenitent ſinners might and did remain the
true church, being to the judgement of men irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable,
then ſuch as are altogether averſe to
the end of their holy calling, may be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
covenant; and though the ſociety be never ſo
much ſowred with the unclean converſation of the
ungodly, yet the faithfull may dip in their meal,
and live in that ſociety without fear of pollution,
diſhonour to God, encouragement to the wicked,
or ſcandal to the brethren. And what then is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the heaps of quotations whereby they
would prove that the members of the church
muſt be <hi>holy, viſible ſaints, a people converted, in
covenant, ſeparated to the Lord,</hi> and <hi>that the church
is onely true whiles it continueth ſuch, and falſe when
it degenerateth from this diſpoſition?</hi> and of their
confident arguing, <hi>That if it were the will of God that
perſons notoriouſly wicked ſhould be admitted into the
church, then ſhould he directly croſse himſelf and his
own ends, and ſhould receive into the viſible cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace ſuch as were out of the viſible ſtate of
grace, and ſhould plant ſuch in his church for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his name as ſerved for none other uſe then to cauſe
his name to be blaſphemed? That all true churches,
from the beginning to the end of the world, are one in
nature and eſſentiall conſtitution, and the firſt the rule
of the reſt: and if it was not lawfull for the godly to
contract with the wicked in the civil covenant of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
how much more in the religious covenant of
the church? That God gave unto Abraham and to his
family the covenant of circumciſion, which the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:23108:115"/>
Apoſtle calleth the ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith. And
to affirm that the Lord would ſeal up with the viſible
ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith any viſible unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and faithleſſe perſon, were a bold challenge of the
moſt High for the prophanation of his own ordinances?</hi>
Theſe and many the like are broken to pieces by
this obſervation, That the whole nation of the
Jews, ſinfull, laden with iniquity, corruptours,
revolters in courſe of life, were Gods ſeparated
people by covenant, and might lay claim unto
and could not be debarred from the viſible ſeals of
the righteouſneſſe of faith, though in themſelves
faithleſſe and unrighteous. And if it was no pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to the Jews, to ſuffer notorious wicked ones
amongſt them, ſo they diſcharged ſuch other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as were enjoyned them by the Lord, becauſe
they had not power to caſt them out; it is no pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
for private and particular Chriſtians, who
have not the power of excommunication in their
hand given unto them by Chriſt, to ſuffer ſuch as
be ignorant and ſcandalous to communicate in
the ordinances of grace with them, if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all other duties which God requireth at their
hands. Moreover, if the Jews had not power to
caſt out a wicked perſon, they had power to cut
off the preſumptuous; and the neglect of the one is
as inexcuſable as of the other: And ſo the whole
controverſie turneth upon this one hinge, Whether
one or two or ſome few private Chriſtians have
power to caſt out and excommunicate whole ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
&amp; churches for ſome remiſſeneſſe or abuſe in
bearing with or admitting ſcandalous offenders in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:23108:115"/>
the ſocieties, ſo long as the doctrine of grace is
purely taught, the ſacraments rightly adminiſtred
for ſubſtance, Chriſt is pleaſed to tolerate and
bear with their manners, continueth the viſible
ſignes of his preſence among them, and is preſent
by ſpeciall grace to bleſſe his ordinances to the
worthy receiver. A few words one would think
might ſuffice in this matter: but ſeeing the ſtrength
of the cauſe lieth therein, in the chapters follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſhall be handled more at large.</p>
            <p>In the church of Corinth there were diviſions,<note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note>

it is moſt untrue, that the toleration of

a manifeſt token that God hath left it. The hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the church from the very firſt plantation

and foul abuſes, diſorders and corruptions have
continued in the churches of God; when yet the
Lord did not utterly take from them all tokens of
his viſible preſence. This is confeſſed of the church
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:23108:117"/>
of the Jews: And if they continued the church
of God when they had broken covenant for their
part, ſo long as the Lord continued the ſignes of
his viſible preſence among them; how dare any
man think or ſay that God hath utterly left or
forſaken that people amongſt whom he dwelleth
plentifully by the means of grace, and unto whom
he imparteth the graces of his Spirit, though for
their ſinnes they deſerve to be caſt off? The
Lord is God and not man, therefore the ſonnes of
Jacob are not confounded. The Jews at firſt
were choſen to be the people of God, not for their
righteouſneſſe, but of the rich grace and mercy of
God: They continue to be his church, not for
their righteouſneſſe, but according to his free and
gracious promiſe: And ſo long as Chriſt doth of
his mere grace and love bear with the manners of
his church, and giveth her not a bill of divorce, it
is not for men to ſay or judge that he hath utterly
left and forſaken her. And ſeeing the faithfull muſt
follow Chriſt, dwell with Chriſt and abide with
him, ſo long as Chriſt doth dwell in the aſſembly
by his preſence and plentifull means of grace it is
not lawfull for them voluntarily to depart and
break off communion.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. Of holding communion with that aſſembly in the
worſhip of God, where we cannot perform all
duties mentioned Matth. 18. 15, 16, 17.</head>
            <p>VVHoſoever neglecteth Chriſts rule in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

church,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> both partaketh in their ſin, and ſinneth
againſt Chriſts command, Matth. 18. If he be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of Chriſts rule and order, yet he ſinneth:
but if he know it, and do it not, then his ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.
Now the rule preſcribed by Chriſt is,
That one brother offended ſhould warn any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the ſame church whereof he is a member, if
he offend him, yea though it be his miniſter: And
if he reform not, he muſt proceed to warn him
more ſolemnly, taking two or three with him,
doing it in the name of Chriſt: If this admonition
take not effect for reformation, he muſt tell the
church: If the church then will not do their duty,
he muſt clear himſelf, proteſting againſt their
neglect therein, Hoſ. 2. 12.</p>
            <p>The brief and plain meaning of this objection
is,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That every Chriſtian is bound to perform all
thoſe offices mentioned to every delinquent bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ſociety or communion; and that it is not
lawfull to abide in ſociety or communion where a
man cannot perform all thoſe duties without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing
or undoing himſelf. And therein is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ſeeing the Jews had no ſuch order for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:23108:118"/>
eſtabliſhed amongſt them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they might hold communion not withſtanding
the corruptions that were found amongſt them.
To trie the ſtrength of this argument, let it be
granted, that our Saviour ſpeaketh not of private
managing of civil affairs and private injuries,
whereby we might recover what we loſt by the
injurie of our brother, (for that is an indulgence or
benefit, no commandment of rule and duty; yea
ſometimes it is a fault not to ſuffer wrong) but of
church-admonitions and cenſures,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 1, 7.</note> and that order
which he hath ſet for the winning or puniſhment
of offenders. But then by <hi>a delinquent brother</hi> we
muſt not underſtand onely one of the ſame particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſociety or fellowſhip, but any one, of what
countrey or condition ſoever, with whom we have
religious fellowſhip:<note place="margin">Theophylact. ad Matth. 18. Chryſoſt. in Matth. Hom. 62.</note> 
               <hi>If thy brother,</hi> If any man

the other, is not the innocent party bound to
hold the courſe here preſcribed with the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

That one brother offended ſhould admoniſh any

acknowledge) but, <hi>If thy brother treſpaſſe againſt

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23108:120"/>
the principall end why our brother offending
is to be admoniſhed, and complained of if he do
not repent,<note place="margin">Bellarm. De verbo Dei, l. 3. cap. 5.</note> is the ſalvation of his ſoul, which hath
place in ſinnes againſt God no leſſe then in offenſes
againſt our ſelves. But herein Chriſtian moderation
requireth, that many ignorances, errors, infirmities,
and weakneſſes of quotidian incurſion, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the godly, be covered in love, and not made
the matter of complaint and cenſure. Some errours
and frailties be of that nature, that if by admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of love I cannot cure them, I muſt cover them
in love, yea though the party, out of a falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
that he is in the truth when he doth erre,
ſhould be obſtinate. It muſt alſo be remembred,
that this duty firſt by one, then by more, and
laſtly by the church upon complaint made, is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
and bindeth onely when occaſion, ſeaſon
and opportunity is offered, or a Chriſtian in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
is called thereunto. An oath is one branch of
Gods worſhip; but he diſhonoureth not God who
never ſweareth, if he be never lawfully called
thereunto: and the like may be ſaid of the duty
of admonition by way of cenſure. It is the office
of a chirurgian to launch and cut when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth:
but it is no impeachment to his skill or
office, if he was never enforced to that ſervice. If
the occaſion of admonition be juſt, a Chriſtian
muſt further wait for the ſeaſon, when it may be
fit to adminiſter it beſt, and in what manner. For
admonition muſt be uſed as phyſick, which is not
like to work kindly unleſſe the patient be in right
temper to receive it. And for complaint to the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23108:120"/>
church, if private admonition firſt by one then by
more prevail not, a Chriſtian is not ordinarily
bound unto it when he cannot perform it or do it
with good ſucceſſe.<note place="margin">Robinſ. Treat. pag. 189.</note> If the Jews had not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ordinance of eccleſiaſticall excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet the Lord took order then as well as now
that no ſinne ſhould be ſuffered unreformed, no
obſtinate ſinner uncut off. And therefore if a man
committed a ſinne, whether of ignorance or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
for which he was not to die without pardon,
he was to be told and admoniſhed of his offenſe,<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 17.</note>
and to manifeſt his repentance:<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 12.</note> But the obſtinate
and preſumptuous were to be cut off.<note place="margin">Numb. 15. 30, 32, 34, 36.</note> So that the

the tranſgreſſour, and if he did not repent, then to
proceed further, according to the Lords ordinance.
But now ſuppoſe the guides temporall or eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall,
to whom the matter muſt be brought, be ſo
corrupt that they would countenance the offender,
puniſh the complainant, eſtabliſh the diſorder ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then redreſſe or amend it, in this caſe what
ſhould the innocent do? muſt he complain to his
undoing, or leave his ſtanding in the church as
unlawfull, becauſe he cannot do the duties which
God calleth for at his hands?<note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 2.</note> The ſhepherds of

that the houſe of Chloe was conſtrained to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

puffed up in the caſe of the inceſtuous man, that
it had been in vain for the better ſort to ſeek his
caſting out if the Apoſtle had not ſharply admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
them of their duty: And their diſorder in
coming to the Lords ſupper was generall, ſo that
the better ſort might bewail but could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
it. In the primitive church there was ſuch
contention oftentimes about the choiſe and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of miniſters, the Paſtours divided from the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:23108:121"/>
people, and the people one from another, to the
committing of many outrages, that if the godly
muſt not hold any place in the church but where
they could perform all offices injoyned in the text
of ſcripture before alledged, they muſt welnigh
go out of the world. In this and ſuch caſes then
what ſhould the faithfull do? Tell the church they
cannot; for that is divided, and it may be the
greateſt part holdeth the worſt cauſe: Depart they
muſt not, for the Lord doth not go before them;
and if they depart without him, they depart from
the Lord himſelf. What remaineth then, but that
with mercifull affection they diſlike, reprove, and
correct as much as in them lieth what they find to
be amiſſe; what they cannot amend, that they
ſhould patiently endure and ſuffer, and in loving
ſort bewail and lament, till God do either correct
and amend it, or make way for their enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they may ſee the Lord to go before
them. But in the mean ſpace it will be ſaid they
do not their duty in telling the church: Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Lord requireth not that particular duty at
that time, becauſe they have no opportunity or
means to do it. The rule preſcribed concerneth
viſible and particular churches, as a ſolemn ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Chriſt, for the humbling and ſaving of
an obſtinate ſinner: but a Chriſtian may be a true
member of a viſible church when he is hindred
and cannot do the thing that is there preſcribed.
For our Saviour ſpeaketh of a brother that doth
juſtly, truly, and according to equity reprehend,
admoniſh, or complain; and of them who being
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:23108:122"/>
ſet in office do rightly and lawfully perform the
office whereunto they are appointed of God; of
the church who doeth what becometh her, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
herſelf within the bounds preſcribed of God,
and rightly executeth what is committed to her
truſt. But in the true church of God, which
Chriſt is pleaſed to grace with the viſible tokens
of his preſence, all things may fall out clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
that ſuch as be in office do not truly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

do ſo or ſo, or ſhall not do this or that, ſhall be
cut off from his people. All which, whether they
conclude the uſe of excommunication amongſt the
Jews, let the learned judge. But howſoever, this
is moſt certain; Many things were required which
the wicked altogether neglected, the godly could
not redreſſe, nor complain of to them that ſhould;
or if they did, no regard was had thereunto, no
reformation followed: and yet the godly left not
their ſtandings, as unlawfull; nor the ſociety, as
left and forſaken of God becauſe they had broken
covenant with him; nor the ordinances of God,
as if externall communion with the wicked as one
body had polluted and defiled them. Put caſe a
brother offended make a complaint to the church
of ſome private injury or wrong received by one
of the ſame or another ſocity, and the church to
whom the complaint is brought deal remiſſely,
either through ignorance, partiality, careleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or the like; muſt the innocent party ſtand to
the deciſion of the church, although they do not
ſee right exactly reſtored, and the delinquent
brought to repentance? or muſt he proteſt againſt
their neglect, and depart from the ſociety as not
to be communicated with, becauſe they tolerate a
wicked and ungodly perſon among them? If the
firſt, then ſimply to be preſent at the worſhip of
God where wicked men are tolerated is not to
partake in their ſin: If the latter, then the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
may be judge in his own cauſe, and not onely
hold him an heathen whom the church eſteemeth
holy and honeſt, but hold the church it ſelf hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:23108:123"/>
then, becauſe they account him not ſo blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
whom he accuſeth: then which what is
more contrary to the rule of our Saviour? And ſo
if true examination be made, they that leave our
ſocieties becauſe they cannot obſerve the rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by Chriſt, do of all others moſt neglect
it in their ſeparation; becauſe they challenge that
authority which Chriſt never gave them, and
wait not upon him to go before them.</p>
            <p>If iniquity be committed in the church,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> and

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:23108:123"/>
toleration or maintenance of one ſinner againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
and conviction do neceſſarily diſchurch a
ſociety, how then did the church of the Jews
continue the true church of God, wherein ſinne
was generally, impudently, impenitently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that by ſuch as ſhould have cenſured it in
others; where the offenders were countenanced,
and the reprovers perſecuted, impriſoned, put to
death? If no church in the world now hath that
abſolute promiſe of the Lords viſible preſence
which that church then had till the coming of
Chriſt, if the Meſſiah muſt be born in the true
church, and the Lord did ever afford the Jews
ſome or other viſible ſignes of his preſence in the
greateſt apoſtaſie; this is nothing to the purpoſe.
For if the maintenance of one wicked ungodly
wretch wipeth a church out of the Lords church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll,
then the Jews, who did both countenance
offenders, and commit wickedneſſe themſelves
and that with greedineſſe, had blotted themſelves
out of that book. And if the Jews continued the
church of God notwithſtanding their great impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and obdurateneſſe, becauſe the Lord continued
the viſible tokens of his preſence among them,
then if a church or ſome in the church ſhall tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
or countenance iniquity in others, or practice
it themſelves, ſo long as God ſhall be pleaſed to
bear with their manners, and vouchſafe unto them
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:23108:124"/>
the ſignes of his gracious preſence and holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
it is to be reputed the true church of God,
wherewith the faithfull may hold communion in
the branches of worſhip. If therefore the authour
had well pondered his own words, or conſulted
the rule of our Saviour, this labour might well
have been ſpared. But more fully to open the
weakneſſe of this objection; Errours; as in doctrine
ſo in practice, are of two ſorts: ſome fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
or bordering thereupon, which concern the
very heart and life of religion, and cannot ſtand
with faith and holineſſe; others not fundamentall,
which ſtrike not directly at the ſoul of religion,
though they hinder the working ſomewhat, or
ſtain the work. In matters fundamentall, as the
profeſſion of faith muſt be intire in all points of
ſimple belief, ſo muſt the doctrine of the church
in all things concerning practice: but errours of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
alloy, wherein godly men diſſent pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
one from another, both concerning faith and
practice, may be found and mainteined in the true
church. Again, ſin and iniquity is mainteined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by teaching, or by doing in our own perſons,
and tolerating in others whom we ſhould reform
but do not. If the church by doctrine maintein
fundamentall evils, as the worſhipping of angels,
murder, adultery, &amp;c. ſhe is to be eſteemed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall:
But if the life be corrupt, not from corrupt
doctrine, but contrary to the doctrine received,
the church is not to be accounted falſe, becauſe
wicked ones, which ſhould be caſt out, are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in her boſome. It is true, the ſervice which
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:23108:124"/>
wicked men tender unto God is abomination, as
were the ſacrifices which the Jews brought when
their hands were full of bloud; but the worſhip
which the faithfull offer unto God in that corrupt
ſociety is pleaſing and acceptable unto his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty:
The prayer of the wicked is abomination to
the Lord, but the prayer of a wicked miniſter in
reſpect of his office, as the prayer of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
is effectuall and accepted for the faithfull
who ſeek unto God with lips unfeigned.</p>

               <hi>The prophet commandeth us,</hi>

            <p>The meaning of the prophet is,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whether in Judah or Iſrael, ſhould contend
with the ten tribes,<note place="margin">We are ſure they called the people out of the church of Iſrael when it was idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them to come at their aſſemblies, Hoſ. 2. 2. 314. and 4. 15, 17.

fallen from the conjugall covenant which God
had contracted with them, and had deſerved to
be put away with a bill of divorce, becauſe they
had tranſgreſſed their matrimoniall troth, and
forſaking the true God had ſought them other
Gods, whom they did love and worſhip. And in
like caſe, no queſtion but the faithfull may pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
and ſharply rebuke the abominable idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of a falſe-claiming church, ſuch as Iſrael was
at that time. But if this be applyed to the true
church, in reſpect of every abuſe or remiſſeneſſe,
we ſhall pervert the words of the prophet, and
run our ſelves upon the rocks. True it is, all abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:23108:125"/>
may and ought to be reproved in the time and
place, according to the nature and quality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
but for every offenſe we cannot ſay truly in the
name of God, The church is not the ſpouſe of
Chriſt, nor Chriſt her husband: Every abuſe in
worſhip is not the adultery of the ten tribes. If
this had been the meaning of the prophet, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
had gone moſt contrary to their own rules
of all others: for they ſharply rebuked the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſinnes of Judah, as they received commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Lord; other ſinnes they touched but
ſparingly, if at all: but they never proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her as no church of God; they never char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the faithfull to depart from all communion
with her, leſt they be partakers of her ſinnes.
Here the Lord goeth before the faithfull in their
contention with their ſuppoſed mother, they muſt
ſay what the Lord putteth into their mouthes, and
behave themſelves toward her as the Lord is
pleaſed to give them precedent by the tokens of
his preſence. But they that take liberty to break
off communion with their true mother and ſpouſe
of Chriſt becauſe of ſome abuſes, ſport and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes,
they ſpeak of themſelves, when they
charge her to be an adultereſſe and not the ſpouſe
of Chriſt, to maintein an idolatrous antichriſtian,
deviſed worſhip; and they run of themſelves
without commiſſion or authority, when they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
withdraw themſelves from the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of grace and communion with Chriſt in the
ſame. Therefore, to conclude this point, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and unworthy members can be no cauſe why
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:23108:125"/>
thoſe that are whole ſhould forſake the body or
neglect the offices perteining to the body, though
they be hindred in their working, ſo no open

faithfull ſhould forſake the church or communion
with Chriſt, or neglect the duties which in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
concern themſelves, though they cannot
do all things that pertein to them with the whole
body, as being overborn or reſtrained by others

communicated government, which is the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
guiding of the church, is that diſcipline
which generally all eccleſiaſticall writers ſpeak of,
yet is not that all nor the principall of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And though Chriſt uſeth it many times as
a chariot for his holy word to ride upon, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
rebellious ſpirits,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 21.</note> yet it is neither the chief
nor the moſt ordinary means:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 4.</note> but the ſimple

and judgeth the very thoughts and conceits of the
heart. And this he doth by his word, when it is
not aſſiſted by the diſcipline ſtrictly taken: for the
word may ſtand without the diſcipline; ſo cannot
the diſcipline without the word. But this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
power of the keyes or government, with
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:23108:126"/>
the execution thereof, is not given to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity

            <p>For no power agreeth to the multitude of the

For although the light of nature teach
that God is to be worſhipped, yet in ſubſtantiall
things reaſon teacheth not how this worſhip of
God is to be adminiſtred, nor the houſe of God
to be governed, but in all this we muſt depend
upon the mind and pleaſure of Chriſt, the King
of his church, and Saviour of his body. The
Apoſtles had none other authority but what was
given them from Chriſt, and the church is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
all her authority from the ſame fountain from
which the Apoſtles received theirs.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 11, 12.</note> But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
power of the keyes with the execution
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:23108:127"/>
thereof Chriſt hath not given immediately to the
whole multitude, but to ſome perſons and officers
deſigned and appointed thereunto. Peruſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall

churches were planted and eſtabliſhed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

               <hi>not of man, neither by man, but by
Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father,</hi> that is true of all
the Apoſtles, who were ſent of Chriſt, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſent him, and are called <hi>Apoſtles of Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> not onely becauſe they were to preach
Chriſt, but becauſe they received their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from him. Not in after-times: for then they
muſt ſhew where Chriſt committed the power of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:23108:127"/>
government firſt to the Apoſtles, and afterwards
to the community of the faithfull; for which they
can bring no record out of holy ſcripture. The
miniſters and guides of the church are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Jeſus Chriſt, from whom immediately they
derive their power and authority, by whom they
are ſet over their charge, in whoſe name they muſt
execute their office, unto whom they muſt give
an account,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> and whoſe miniſters they are. <hi>Take
heed to your ſelves, and to the whole flock, over which
the holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers:</hi> the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh unto the Presbyters of Epheſus, and ſaith
they were appointed overſeers of the holy Ghoſt,
that they might govern the church of God. They
were choſen and ordained of men,<note place="margin">Ameſ. tom. 1. Bellarm. ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. cap. 3. cap. 8. §. 14. Th. Aquin. 1. diſt. 12. qu. 1. a. 3. &amp; Contra Gentes, l. 3. cap. 70.</note> and ſo by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediety

gifts, office and authority was immediately of
God. In conferring thoſe offices God uſeth the
miniſtery of men; but the office or authority it ſelf
is not from men but from God alone. God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in regard of authority doth ever apply all power
eccleſiaſticall unto every particular perſon: his
ſole authority doth all in it, though ſometimes, as
in ordinary callings, the miniſtery of others doth
concurre.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 8, 11.</note> When <hi>Chriſt aſcended up on high, he
gave gifts unto men, ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

The Paſtourſhip is the gift of Chriſt no leſſe then
the Apoſtleſhip; and that the more, becauſe it is
perpetuall in the church. Every Paſtour is not
immediately called, but the office and order of
Paſtours is immediately from Chriſt and not from
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:23108:128"/>
the church. The perſon is not immediate, but
the calling or vocation, and ſo the order and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and all the juriſdiction. But if the calling,
order and authority be immediately from Chriſt,
then it is not derived from the community of the
faithfull as the immediate receptacle. Chriſt hath
given ſome to be Apoſtles, and ſome to be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours;
not all to be Apoſtles, nor all to be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours:

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:23108:129"/>
peculiar to do the things which belong to ſervants
in office by peculiar right. Power eccleſiaſticall
both of Order and Juriſdiction (as it is uſually
called) is ſignified by the power of the keyes, or
the power of binding or looſing: But the power
of the keyes is immediately given to the miniſters
and guides of the church from God, and not from
the church or community of the faithfull. For
the keyes contein not onely order, but power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
and all eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, which the
guides of the church received immediately from
Chriſt. As Peter received the keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven, ſo the reſt of the Apoſtles: and
as the Apoſtles, ſo all their ſucceſſours received
them from Chriſt. The Apoſtles had extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
power, and might in ſome caſes exerciſe it
ſingularly and perſonally without concurrence of
others; and their commiſſion was of larger extent
then the charge of ordinary Paſtours or church-governours:
but the ſpirituall power to bind and
looſe, remit and retein ſinnes, open and ſhut the
kingdome of heaven, is communicated to all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
from the hand and by the mandate of the
ſame Lord and Maſter. One miniſteriall power
may be in degree of dignity above another:
for the power of one may be about more noble
acts then the power of another; or in the ſame
kind, the power of one may be more extended,
and the power of another more contracted. Thus
the Deacons had for the object of their power and
care not ſo excellent a thing as that of Paſtours,
Evangeliſts and Apoſtles: thus the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23108:129"/>
Paſtours was not ſo univerſall as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles:
even as in the orders of ſervants domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
ſome are imployed about leſſer, ſome about
greater and more honourable ſubjects: But all
power of the ſervants muſt be derived from the

whole power of the Lords miniſters is derived im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

the Cardinals do not chuſe the Pope by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

conveyeth authority to her miniſters.</p>
            <p>The church cannot virtually or formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
what ſhe never had,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but miniſterially ſhe may,
<hi>ſc.</hi> as miniſtring to him who hath power and virtue
of deriving it. Nothing can give that which it
had not formally or virtually, unleſſe it give it as
an inſtrument to one who hath it; but ſo it may
give what it never had, nor is capable of. A man
not having a penie of his own, may give an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds, if the King make him his almoner:
A ſteward may give all offices in his maſters houſe,
as miniſterially executing his maſters pleaſure.
Thus the church deriveth, as taking the perſon
whom Chriſt deſcribeth, and out of power will
have placed in this or that office in the church. The
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:23108:130"/>
perſons of the miniſters are not immediately ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by Chriſt to that function, as were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles:
but their gifts, calling and authority is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from him. In reſpect of their graces
and office there interveneth to midſt betwixt
Chriſt and them: but the appointment or deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them to this or that place is from the
church. The office is not given of men but of
God onely, although in conferring and ſpeciall
applying that power and exerciſe he uſe men as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
or miniſters. The church is in ſetting
out or ordaining this or that man, as the colledge
is in chuſing, when ſhe taketh the man whom the
ſtatute of her Founder doth manifeſtly deſigne:
And therefore though the church have power to
elect their miniſter, it followeth not that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the keyes is immediately in the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
or ſociety of the faithfull. For electours
have not evermore authority over him whom they
elect; but authority and power onely to apply that
power to him whom they chuſe. The power of
the Imperiall dignity is not in the electours of the
Emperours; nor the power of that office and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
whereunto a miniſter is elected, in the
church who chuſeth him to that office.<note place="margin">Chamier. tom. 2. lib. 11. cap. 19. §. 11.</note> If we
conſider what men give or give not, univerſally
it muſt be denyed that any men can make mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
becauſe they do not give the office, gifts or
authority, which is from Chriſt alone. And
therefore as they receive their office and graces
from God, ſo they execute their office in the
name of Chriſt, and not of the church: whereas
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:23108:130"/>
if the church did virtually and out of power make
an officer, he ſhould execute his office in her
name, as we ſee with thoſe whom the king ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in the common-wealth. But the church
dealeth in the election of miniſters in a ſteward-like
manner, miniſtring to the ſole Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the houſe; and receiveth them into the
houſe, not in her own, but in the Lords name, and
to do their office not in her name but in the name
of their Lord and Maſter, who onely out of power
did conferre that office upon them. Whence it
followeth, that ordinary power of the keyes with
the execution thereof is not given to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of the faithfull or the whole multitude, much
leſſe to two or three knit together in covenant.</p>
            <p>The keyes of the kingdome of heaven were
promiſed and given to Peter as to a faithfull man,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note>
and ſo to all the faithfull,<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 17.</note> or to the communitie of
the faithfull. By <hi>the keyes</hi> is meant the Goſpel of
Chriſt, opening a way by him and his merits as
the doore into the kingdome: and we muſt take
heed of this deep deluſion of Antichriſt,<note place="margin">Robinſ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bern. pag. 149, 150.</note> in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that this power of binding or looſing ſinnes
is held to any office or order in the church.
Whereupon it followeth neceſſarily, that one
faithfull man,<note place="margin">Idem, pag. 150.</note> yea or woman either, may as truly
and effectually looſe or bind both in heaven and
earth as all the miniſters in the world.</p>
            <p>Either this is not to the purpoſe,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> or the power
of the keyes, and ſo all communicated power ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
with the execution thereof, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to every faithfull man and woman as truly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:23108:131"/>
as to the Apoſtles. That private Chriſtians, yea
women and children, may exhort, rebuke, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<hi>ex officio charitat is generali,</hi> out of the generall
office of charity, we confeſſe; that by ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
people have been brought to the faith,
we alſo believe: But that power to preach <hi>per
modum legationis,</hi> by way of embaſſage, or power
of the keyes hath been committed to them, we
never find: rather, this power was proper to the
miniſters <hi>ex Divino inſtituto ſpeciali,</hi> by ſpeciall
Divine inſtitution, and eſtabliſhed upon ſpeciall
promiſe. Unto Peter making confeſſion was the
promiſe of the keyes made, but not to him as a
confeſſour, but to him and the reſt as they ſhould
be Apoſtles ſent forth with authoritie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to preach the Goſpel, plant churches,
bind and looſe, &amp;c. Otherwiſe not onely the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie
of the faithfull, but every faithfull man
or woman, might excerciſe thoſe acts of feeding,
binding and looſing, and ruling, implyed in the
power of the keyes. In phraſe of ſpeech <hi>to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the keyes unto a man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 22. 23, 24.</note> is to make him an officer,
ſteward, or diſpenſer in the houſe under his lord
and maſter, to give him authority to open and
ſhut, bind and looſe. When our Saviour ſaid to
his Diſciples, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ye remit, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you;
Go, teach all nations; Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on
earth ſhall be bound in heaven:</hi> doth he not appoint
them to chief offices in his houſe? and what doth
he give them more then the keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
A legate or meſſenger is not ſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:23108:131"/>
authority, power and juriſdiction; nor the
keyes of the houſe committed to his truſt and
care who is not in office. <hi>The keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
import not onely authority and juriſdiction,
but power of exerciſing: and for that reaſon ſome
have thought Peter to be a ſociall type of the
whole church, becauſe the church doth exerciſe
the keyes. But the community of the faithfull
are not officers in the houſe, to exerciſe the power
of the keyes, to open and to ſhut. And if Peter
received the keyes from Chriſt as a faithfull man,
then the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours received
their order and juriſdiction, their authority and
power of exerciſing from the faithfull and not
from Chriſt immediately. Thus Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
diſpute againſt the Papiſts, If Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their authority and power of exerciſing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from Chriſt by mandate, miſſion and
commiſſion, then they derive it not from the
Pope. And by the ſame reaſon, if the power of
the keyes be the immediate gift of God to the
Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours, then they derive
not their power and authority from the people or
faithfull in covenant. There is a key of ſupreme
Authority, proper to God alone; a key of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
given to Chriſt, and proper to him; a
key of Miniſtery, given to the Apoſtles and
their ſucceſſours; and (if any be pleaſed ſo to call
it) a key of Charity, given to all the faithfull,
who are able to exhort, rebuke, comfort, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct.
For every Chriſtian may admoniſh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
comfort, exhort, and ſo convert a ſinner
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:23108:132"/>
from the errour of his way, and cover a multitude
of ſinnes:<note place="margin">The office of teaching is laid upon ſome few cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.

an office or duty which by right of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
every one oweth unto his neighbour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſpeciall calling or authority. Whereas
the matter we ſpeak of is the ſpirituall power
which Chriſt hath given for the preſervation and
government of his church, the exerciſe whereof
conſiſteth in acts of order, office, miniſtery, or
function, whereunto they are in ſpeciall deſigned
and called. And ſo if the matter of the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
rebuke or admonition be one for ſubſtance,
the order, function, authority, commiſſion, power
of exerciſing, and calling to exerciſe is not the
ſame. And therefore the power of the keyes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to Peter, which doth note power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of function, was not promiſed nor given
to the communitie of the faithfull, much leſſe to
every faithfull man or woman.</p>
            <p>The power of the keyes given to the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note>
was given to the church, <hi>intuitu ejuſdem tanquam

            <p>It is true,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the Apoſtles were given to the church
<hi>intuitu ejuſdem tanquam finis,</hi> and the power they
received was for the good of the whole: but
this is not enough that power may be ſaid to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
immediately by the church as the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of it, and from it derived unto others, but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:23108:132"/>
this power muſt be in the community as the firſt

As the power of ſeeing is not onely given <hi>intuitu

it agreeth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 22. &amp; 4. 1.</note> but is <hi>in homine</hi> as the firſt ſubject

and other governours were given of Chriſt for the
church, as for the end; and all their authority
was given unto them for the church, as for the
whole: but the authority it ſelf was immediately
derived from Chriſt, and is not in the church as
the immediate ſubject thereof. The authority
of the Apoſtles and other guides was for the
church, given for the good of the whole ſociety,
and ſo may be called the authority of the church:
but the authority is not immediately in the church
as the ſubject, nor derived from the church, but
from Chriſt the King of the church. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of governours is given of Chriſt, for a gift
to the church, but not for a gift abſolute, that it
may reſide in the power of the whole church to
whom it is given, but for a conditionall gift, that
it may be communicated to the governours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

power of Chriſt whereby to judge them, 1. Cor.

or eſtate in the church:<note place="margin">Idem, pag. 217.</note> but the order of Saints

            <p>Chriſt maketh every believer a king,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> prieſt,
and prophet, to teach, exhort, reprove, comfort,
offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices of prayer and praiſe,
and to guide and govern in the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
But this belongeth not to the ſpirituall, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall
power and authority which Chriſt hath
given for the conſervation and government of his
church. For every Chriſtian man and woman is
made a king, prieſt and prophet unto God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all offices required in that relation: but the
ſpirituall power of government with the execution
thereof is not committed to every believer in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
nor to any one. The officers of Chriſt
do neither feed and teach as prophets, nor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
as kings, nor offer ſacrifices as prieſts. The
word it ſelf teaching and feeding is one thing,
which floweth from Chriſt as Prophet: the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the word, whence alſo floweth
the act of governing, is from Chriſt as King. It
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:23108:133"/>
is from internall communion with Chriſt, that
the ſound, ſincere, faithfull, and they onely are
made ſpirituall kings and prieſts unto God: but it
is from Chriſt as King, governing externally, as
be beareth the ſimilitude of a politicall head, that
his ſervants do feed, rule and cenſure in his name.
They onely are made true kings and prieſts unto
God who have received from Chriſt the life of
grace: but they have received authority from
Chriſt to do ſervice in his church who have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
life of grace nor are made kings or prieſts
unto God. The Kingdome, Prieſthood, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of Chriſt doth make no man politically
either prieſt, or king, or prophet: for then all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
ſhould exerciſe the office of politicall
prieſts, kings and prophets in the church; which
is oppoſite to the nature of Chriſts kingdome.
Chriſt according to his Perſon is neither externall
King nor Paſtour; but doth govern his church
externally by paſtours and miniſters, yet not as by
kings or prieſts politicall, but as ſervants onely.
Paſtours and teachers are but officers in the
church, and in no kingly authority by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſts kingly office, neither are they as
civill governours, though the Lords ſervants, yet
the peoples lords and maſters. But it is one thing
to be a ſpirituall king or prieſt unto God, another
to be a paſtour or teacher in Gods church: for
that is common to all Chriſtians, this peculiar
unto them that have received authority of function
from Chriſt. The Saints therefore as ſpirituall
kings have not received power from Chriſt by
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:23108:134"/>
function or authority to cenſure their brethren, or
externally to rule or govern; but this belongeth
to them who are deſigned of Chriſt the King unto
this office. Every Chriſtian woman may exhort
or reprove without any deſignement of the church:
is every woman made a prophet externally in the
church? Is power to adminiſter the ſacraments,
and authoritatively to cenſure offenders, <hi>(ſe. auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
muneris</hi> not <hi>officii generalis</hi> or <hi>charitatis)</hi>
committed to every member of the ſociety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every believer may exhort and admoniſh,
not onely his brother of the ſame or another ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
but even them that are without? By <hi>the
keyes of the kingdome,</hi> power and juriſdiction is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and not the bare duty of inſtruction or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.
The power of the keyes is given
by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Matth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28. 19.</note> as the King of his church,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 11.</note> as is evident
by the generall inſtitution of eccleſiaſticall politie,
and the particular narration of politie inſtituted:
but that every Chriſtian was ſent forth with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and commiſſion we never read. And if
this reaſon be of any force, every believer man
or woman is of equall authority to the Apoſtles in
matters of eccleſiaſticall government, becauſe
the order of ſaints is the order of kings, and that is
the higheſt: which is directly corſſe to the holy
ſcripture and the order appointed by Chriſt the
King and Head of his church.</p>
            <p>They that have received Chriſt,<note place="margin">Object. 5.</note> have received
the power of Chriſt, and his whole power: for

            <p>This objection is not to be underſtood of the

but of the communicated power of Chriſt which
he hath given to his church or certain officers in

every believer or company of believers muſt not

which Chriſt doth communicate to his miniſters

his church, or to the church with the guides and
officers for the edification of the body. All
power of the naturall body muſt be together,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19, 20.</note> but
it is not ſo in the ſpirituall. And if it was, the

            <p>To let paſſe,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that this title of <hi>Spouſe</hi> or <hi>Queen</hi>
may be applyed to one believer as well as two or
three; and that the guides and officers are known
by thoſe titles and relations as well as believers
not in office. Conſidering this power is not a
Lordly power, but a power of doing ſervice to
the church for Chriſt his ſake, and his kingdome:
therefore it is fit it ſhould be committed to ſome
perſons, and not to the whole community, which
is the Queen of Chriſt. For Chriſt the King of
his church hath not committed power to his
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:23108:135"/>
Church or Queen to ſerve her ſelf properly; but to
have perſons, who in this relation ſhould ſtand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from her, who are in his name to do
her ſervice. The power of prieſthood was not
firſt in the church of Iſrael, and ſo derived to the
prieſts; but immediately from Chriſt ſeated in
Aaron and his ſons. The community of the
faithfull have neither the power of government,
nor the uſe of that power. Not the power: for
it is immediately from Chriſt ſeated in ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
or principall members as Chriſt himſelf the
King of his church ſhall authorize, and not in the
body conſidered apart from the officers. Nor
the uſe of that power; becauſe that cannot be
enjoyed without officers. And if it may ſtand
with the honour of the church to want the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
or diſpenſation of that power or authority, it
derogateth nothing from the prerogative of the
faithfull to want the power it ſelf. For it is as
much for the welfare and good of the church, that
Chriſt out of reſpect to his Spouſe hath given her
commandment, as his ſteward, to elect and chooſe
officers according to his appointment who ſhould
receive power and authority from him for ſuch
and ſuch offices and ſervices in the church, as that
he ſhould ſeat the power it ſelf in a few or many
believers, to be derived from them unto others
according to pleaſure. For though their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and power be from Chriſt and not from the
church, yet the ſervice and authority is for the
church in the name of Chriſt: and in that ſenſe
they are ſubject to the church.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 5.</note> In the church
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:23108:136"/>
the officers are the miniſters of Chriſt, to execute
and adminiſter the judgements and cenſures of
God againſt the obſtinate, but for the church.
They are for the people, but not miniſters of the
people, as if they drew their authority from
them, and were to execute their judgements. But
though the community hath not power given unto
them, yet ſuch eſtate is put upon them by Chriſt
the King and Husband of his church, that all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is to be executed in ſuch manner as ſtandeth
with reſpect to their excellency.</p>
            <p>If ſpirituall and eccleſiaſticall power be in the
church or community of the faithfull,<note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> the church
doth not onely call but make officers out of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and power received into herſelf, and then
ſhould the church have a true lordlike power in
regard of her miniſters. For as he that will derive
authority to the church maketh himſelf Lord of
the church, ſo if the church derive authority to
the miniſters of Chriſt ſhe maketh herſelf Lady or
Miſtreſſe over them in the exerciſe of that lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
authority. For, as all men know, it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the Lord and Maſter to impart authority.
Did the church give power to the Paſtours and
Teachers, ſhe might make the ſacrament and
preaching, which one doth in order, no ſacrament,
no preaching: for it is the order inſtituted of God
that giveth being and efficacy to theſe ordinances:
and if the power of ruling, feeding, and diſpenſing
the holy things of God do reſide in the faithfull,
the word and ſacrament in reſpect of diſpenſation
and efficacy ſhall depend upon the order and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:23108:136"/>
of the ſociety. If the power of the keyes
be derived from the community of the faithfull,
then are all officers immediately and formally ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to the church, and muſt do every thing
in the name of the church, rule, feed, bind,
looſe, remit and retein ſinnes, preach, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the ſacraments; then they muſt perform
their office according to the direction of the
church, more or leſſe, ſeldome or frequent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
or diligent: for from whom are they to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
direction how to carry themſelves in their
office but from him or them from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their office, whoſe work they are to do, and
from whom they muſt expect reward. If their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and power be of God immediately, they muſt
do the duties of their place according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement,
and unto him they muſt give account:
But if their power and function be from the
church, the church muſt give account to God,
and the officers unto the church, whom ſhe doth
take to be her helpers. If it be ſaid that God will
have the church to chuſe officers to execute the
power committed unto her, the anſwer is, Either
God will have her elect officers of his deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to do his work, according to that power he
ſhall give them, and by his direction; and then
they are Gods ſervants and not the churches, and
receive their charge and function immediately
from God, and not from the people: or he leaveth
it to the arbitrement of the church to chuſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to pleaſure ſuch as muſt receive charge
and authority from her; and then they muſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:23108:137"/>
their office in her name, ſo as ſhall ſeem good
unto the church, and neither longer nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
For if the miniſters of the church be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to God and Chriſt by the intervention of the
faithfull onely, that they preach or adminiſter
the ſacraments, rule or feed, they have it from
the people and not from God. And if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
immediately upon the faithfull, to wit, two
or three gathered together in covenant, they muſt
derive and draw from them what in order they are
to preach unto men in the name of the Lord:
For from him muſt the embaſſadour learn his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
from whom he receiveth his commiſſion.
Moreover, if the power of the keyes be given firſt
and immediately unto the community of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
what reaſon can be given why in defect of
officers the church might not rule, govern, feed,
bind, looſe, preach, and adminiſter the ſacraments;
or if any fail in any office, why ſhe might not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that want by her power? For the power of
the keyes doth contein both authority and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe;
power being given to this end, that it might
be exerciſed as it is vouchſafed. But the church,
when ſhe is deſtitute of officers, cannot execute
thoſe acts of rule, nor by her power ſupply the
want of any office: onely ſhe hath a miniſtery of
calling one whom Chriſt hath deſcribed, that
from Chriſt he may have power of office given
him in the vacant place.</p>
            <p>In the church of Chriſt the officers are called
<hi>ſervants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> and in that relation the church may be

            <p>If the officers of Chriſt be both of and for the

may not onely in ſome reſpects be called their

received from him and according to his
direction,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 4.</note> whoſe miniſters properly they are,
who is the Prince of Paſtours. The object about
which the eccleſiaſticall miniſtery is exerciſed is
the church, and their function is for the good of
the church: but the principall cauſe and Lord of
the miniſters upon whom they depend is Chriſt
and not the church. When our Saviour ſaith,
<hi>The Sonne of man is Lord of the Sabbath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 8.</note> he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of himſelf alone,<note place="margin">Mark 2. 27, 28.</note> rather then of man in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
For to be the Lord of the Sabbath, that is,
to have the Sabbath in his power, ſo as he might

the Law-giver.<note place="margin">Chemn. Harm. cap. 48. Piſc. in Matth. 12. 8. Schol. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, Annot. in Marc. 2. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

All the power of hearing, ſeeing, &amp;c. are in the
whole man, which doth produce them effectually,
though formally and inſtrumentally they are in
the eare and eye: and the reaſon is, becauſe theſe
powers are naturall; and whatever is naturall,
doth firſt agree to the community or <hi>totum,</hi> and
afterward to a particular perſon or part: But all
that is in theſe bodies cannot hold in Chriſts my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
body. In a naturall body the power is firſt
in the community; in a particular perſon, from it:
but all eccleſiaſticall power is firſt in our King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any in the church from him. In naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
the power of ſeeing is firſt immediately in the
man; and for the man, in the eye: In the myſticall
body the faith of the believer is not firſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
in all, then in the believer, but firſt of all
and immediately in the perſonall believer, for
whoſe good it ſerveth more properly then for the
whole; every man being to live by his own faith.
One man is capable of grace, which cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to the whole community immediately. The
power of Apoſtleſhip or of ordinary miniſtery was
not firſt in the church and ſo derived to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and miniſters, but immediately from
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:23108:138"/>
Chriſt ſeated in the Apoſtles and ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
and Teachers. For ſeeing power eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
was firſt in Chriſt, as in a prince, not ſubject
to the church, or dependent upon her, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it perteineth to him as prince to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
concerning his embaſſadours and ſubſtitutes,
whoſe power is derived from him, not from the
church, who of her own nature is not a miſtreſſe
in ſpirituall things, but the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt,
redeemed by him. Chriſt is the firſt authour of
this ſpirituall power, upon whoſe will and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all things depend: as for the church, ſhe can
give no ſpirituall power, to few or many, one or
more, as pleaſe herſelf, for what time ſhe will,

politicall, furniſhed with the power of Chriſt

duties and ordinances of worſhip, a competent

other perſons in the world, and might perform
all the officers of a church at that time required of
them: But two or three are no ſufficient number

Therefore for our direction in this caſe it
is good to look at their pattern who firſt planted
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:23108:140"/>
the churches of God, according to the wiſdome
of God, and by the direction of his Spirit. And
to begin with the Apoſtles, becauſe we ſpeak of

we may well think, within that circuit was very
great. But if we take a view of particular church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
the matter will be more plain.<note place="margin">Acts 8. 1. &amp; 15. 4.</note> The Chriſtian
church at Jeruſalem was one diſtinct ſociety,
which did congregate upon occaſion,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 42, 44, 46. &amp; 5. 12. &amp; 6. 1. &amp; 15. 22. &amp; 21. 22.</note> and held
communion in the ordinances of worſhip: But it
grew and encreaſed; firſt to three thouſand, then
to five thouſand; afterward multitudes of men

were there <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> and not as fixed members
of this church: <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as came up by occaſion
of the Paſſeover or Pentecoſt or other like feaſt,
and were onely there for the preſent. It may be
the Apoſtles tolerated them, though more then
could fitly meet together ordinarily in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
becauſe they foreſaw ſuch times to
enſue, wherein many of them ſhould tranſlate

may be alſo, God let it grow more rank and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
then ordinary churches, becauſe it was <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia

be the reaſon of this great number, this is certain,
the multitude was great: for after it was grown to
five thouſand, and multitudes of men and women

were added,<note place="margin">Acts 6. 1.</note> it encreaſed daily: <hi>The number of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

               <note place="margin">Acts 6. 7.</note>

ſcripture witneſſeth.<note place="margin">Acts 6. 2. &amp; 8. 1. &amp; 15. 2, 4.</note> And when all the Apoſtles,

continuing in the miniſtery of the word and

probable, that the whole city of Samaria in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

ſpake. As the whole city from the leaſt unto the

both Jews and Graecians, thoſe that had uſed cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

of all men,<note place="margin">Acts 19. 19.</note> (which could not be done without

opened unto the Apoſtle at Epheſus.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 9.</note> And that
the multitude of believers was great in all proper,
ſettled, politicall ſocieties, appeareth in this, that
the Apoſtles appointed divers overſeers,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 1.</note> elders and
deacons to teach and govern the people and take

done,<note place="margin">Til. 1. 5.</note> nor could the church have born the charge
thereof,<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 14.</note> if the number had not been large. Two
or three making Peters confeſſion cannot be the
church in this paſſage of ſcripture: for the party
complained of is one member, and the complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
another; and he is to take with him one or
two, if he be not heard, before he bring the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
unto the church: and how then ſhall any two
or three ſeparated from the world and conſenting
together in an holy covenant be <hi>the church</hi> in this
place. If any two or three conſenting in an holy
covenant ſerve to make up this community or
church, what hindreth but it may conſiſt of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children onely? and ſo the ſpirituall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of teaching, exhorting, binding &amp; looſing,
remitting &amp; reteining ſins, ſhall originally &amp; <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè</hi>
agree unto a community of believing women
whereof every member is regularly uncapable.
For the Apoſtle teacheth plainly,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 34.</note> that a woman
may not ſpeak in the congregation.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 14.</note> And though
he ſpeak particularly of propheſying and teaching,
yet layeth he down a more generall rule,<note place="margin">Robinſ. of the lawfulneſſe &amp;c. pag. 76, 77.</note> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all ſuch ſpeaking as in which authority is uſed,
that is, uſurped over the man, which is done
ſpecially in judgement. And if a woman may
not ſo much as move a queſtion in the church for
inſtruction, how much leſſe may ſhe give a voice
or rather a reproof for cenſure? And if women
be debarred by their ſex as from ordinary prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying,
<note place="margin">Robinſ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bern. pag. 206.</note> ſo from any other dealing wherein they take
authority over the man, how can two or three
believing women be the church, with power mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:23108:142"/>
publickly to bind and looſe, remit and
retein ſinnes? And if two or three gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
have the ſame right and power with two or
three hundred, or two or three thouſand, let the
ſociety without officers be never ſo great, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the church that is here meant. For thoſe
Divines which hold power and authority of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and looſing to be delivered by Chriſt to the
whole church, that is, to every particular church
collectively, becauſe it perteineth to them to deny
Chriſtian communion to ſuch wicked perſons as
adde contumacy to their diſobedience, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the puniſhment again upon repentance, they
generally with one conſent maintein, that the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and judiciall exerciſing of this power per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
to that company and aſſembly of officers
or governours in every church which the Apoſtle
calleth <hi>a presbytery.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 14.</note> But our Saviour in that text
of Scripture ſpeaketh of the execution and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of the power of binding and looſing, which
was never committed to the community of the
faithfull without officers. If the joynt conſent of
orthodox Divines move not, let it be conſidered,
that the exerciſe of eccleſiaſticall cenſures exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and authoritative was never committed to the
community of the faithfull without officers, never
exerciſed by the faithfull in any age of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
church. Let ſuch as plead for this power
bring forth either commiſſion for it or precedent
of it, if they be able. The externall and authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power of binding and looſing, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
power in the church, doth comprehend under
it all matters ſubordinate and of the ſame nature,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:23108:143"/>
power to preach the word autoritatively, and to
admit unto or put from the ſacraments: but the
exerciſe of this inferiour power was never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to a Chriſtian ſociety or church without
officers. And if we will not make one text of
ſcripture contrary to another, we cannot think
the exerciſe of that power is here given to the
community of the faithfull, few or many, without
officers, which in all other places is given to the
governours, never to the faithfull without guides.
By <hi>the church</hi> the whole multitude of believers,
whether with officers or without, cannot be
underſtood. For that power agreeth not to the
whole body <hi>in actu primo</hi> or <hi>in eſſe</hi> (as they ſpeak)
whereof many particular members regularly are
not capable; as the faculty of ſpeaking or ſeeing
ſhould not firſt belong to man as the <hi>principium
Quod,</hi> if the whole in all parts were not capable
of that power. But the power of binding or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
cannot regularly agree to many particular
members of that community <hi>ſc.</hi> women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
And if women and children though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
be here excluded, the word <hi>church,</hi> muſt
not be taken in the largeſt and moſt ordinary ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in the new Teſtament: for ſo it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
all believers, diſciples, faithfull linked in
ſociety. If the authority of binding or looſing
pertein to the whole church <hi>in actu primo ſive in
eſſe,</hi> and to the Presbytery alone <hi>in actu ſecundo
ſive in operari,</hi> as the act of ſpeaking perteineth to
a man as the <hi>principium Quod,</hi> but to the tongue
alone as the <hi>principium Quo,</hi> yet the church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:23108:143"/>
be taken for the whole community: for our
Saviour ſpeaketh of the actuall execution of this
power, (and not of the power it ſelf) which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belongeth to the governours. And if the
church be the Chriſtian Presbytery as it exerciſeth
diſcipline, and not the multitude of the faithfull,
then is this text in vain alledged to proove all
power Eccleſiaſticall to be originally and by way
of execution in the community of the faithfull:
then the power of hearing, examining, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and cenſuring doth primarily belong unto the
Presbytery and not unto the faithfull in common.
God is the God of order and not of confuſion:
But if the hearing and determining of all cauſes
which may fall out in a ſociety conſiſting of three
or four, ſix or eight, ten or twenty thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(for ſo many may be in one ſociety) muſt be
referred to the whole community (and that upon
the Lords day to be joyned with the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the word,<note place="margin">Robinſ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bern. pag. 230.</note> ſacraments, almes, and the reſt;
yea, in theſe caſes to go before the other parts of
worſhip, leſt the holy things of God be polluted
by notorious obſtinate offenders) diſorder and
confuſion cannot be avoyded. When ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
be decided? How ſhall the community
have ſufficient intelligence of the ſtate and quality
of matters? Either buſineſſes muſt be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
raſhly, or infinitely protracted, before they
can be heard of every man, and they agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In ſo great a multitude it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
how things ſhould be done ſeaſonably, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately,
in order, without partiality and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:23108:144"/>
where every one may walk according to his

another, but as pleaſeth himſelf. And if ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

every member of and to the whole community of
the faithfull, then is every member in ſome ſort a
ruler and governour. And if we ſearch into the

underſtand ſome and the chief of the church, a

a multitude with relation to religion, the
church-governours ſet over the flock by Chriſt,
aſſembled to heare and determine matters that
may fall out amongſt the faithfull, is not unfitly
nor obſcurely called the <hi>church.</hi> And thoſe
things are rightly ſaid to be brought to the church
which are brought to them that guide the church
by the authority and appointment of Chriſt. As
the body is ſaid to ſee, when the eyes alone ſee;
ſo the church is ſaid to heare that which they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do heare who are the eares of the church. Not
that the guides are ſubſtitutes of the multitude in
that reſpect; for the eye is not the deputy of the
hand or foot: but that the power which they
have received, they have received it from Chriſt
for the whole body, and muſt execute it to the
good and profit of the whole. They are the
ſtewards, deputies, miniſters of Chriſt, but for the
whole body and every member thereof. From
all this it is apparent, that the word <hi>church</hi> in this
text of ſcripture cannot be taken as it is commonly
in other paſſages of the new Teſtament. For in
other texts it noteth the multitude of believers,
without diſtinction of ſex, age, or condition: but
here women and children are excluded, as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
uncapable of that power here ſpoken of. In
other places <hi>the church</hi> ſignifyeth a multitude of
believers,<note place="margin">Acts 11. 26. &amp; 14. 23.</note> ſaints, faithfull, or diſciples, as they
are diſtinguiſhed from their officers and guides,<note place="margin">Robinſ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bern. pag. 126, 127.</note>
which are ſet as ſtewards in the Lords family and

And if all theſe things be laid together,
it will appear, the words uſed by the Syriack and

interpretation. And if we compare one text of

of in this paſſage of Matthew hath power to heare
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:23108:146"/>

by publick authority, which agreeth to no
ſpirituall ſociety which hath not received power
miniſteriall from Chriſt to preach the Goſpel, and

publick authority; it cannot be that the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the faithfull in any particular ſociety ſhould
be underſtood by <hi>the church,</hi> ſeeing Chriſt the
Lord of the church hath not communicated power
to them to do ſuch things themſelves, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
it over to the governours to have ſuch things
done in their name, but hath immediately given
power to his officers and miniſters to do ſuch acts
or ſervice in his name for the good and benefit of
the ſociety, and as it may ſtand with reſpect to the
honour, and eſtate which Chriſt hath put upon
the ſociety, as his flock and people.</p>
            <p>Two ſcriptures are ſo plain,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> clear, evident, and
perſpicuous for excommunication,<note place="margin">Robinſ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bern. pag. 170.</note> the former
Matth. 18. 15, 16, 17. for the order and degrees
of proceeding, the other 1. Cor. 5. 4. for the
perſons intereſſed in the buſineſſe, as that to bring
in other ſcriptures for the expounding of them, is
in truth as needleſſe and loſt a labour as to light the
ſunne and moon a candle. They among whom
the fornication was, out of the midſt of whom he
was to be put, and which were puffed up when
they had rather cauſe of ſorrowing, to them the
Apoſtle writeth, them he reproveth, they were
to be gathered together for the excommunicating,
purging out and judging of the offender, verſ. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5. And therefore the duty here enjoyned
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:23108:146"/>
as well concerneth the brethren as the officers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we will ſay the fornicatour was onely among
and in the midſt of the officers, and to be put from
among them, and left among the people ſtill, and
that the officers onely were puffed up when they
ſhould have ſorrowed, and not the brethren with
them. It concerned the people as well as the
prieſts, in the type and ſhadow, to put away leaven
out of their houſes, and to keep the paſſeover with
unleavened bread; and ſo in the truth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to purge and put out this leaven Paul ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of, namely the inceſtuous perſon, verſ. 6, 7.
The Apoſtle admoniſheth them that they were not
to be commingled with fornicatours, nor to eat
with them, verſ. 9, 10, 11. and this duty as well
concerned the people as the officers. They with
whom Paul dealeth are commanded to put the
wicked man from among themſelves, verſ. 13. So
that the ſame perſons from among whom he is to
be put are to put him away, which are both offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and people. They whom the Apoſtle by his
letter made ſory for their failing in the caſting out
of the inceſtuous man, and that with ſorrow to
repentance, manifeſted with great indignation
and zeal, they were to reprove and cenſure him,
and ſo did for his reformation and their own clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
which, that it was not the caſe of the officers
alone, but of the brethren with them, appeareth
in theſe ſcriptures, 1. Cor. 5. 1, 2. with 2. Cor.
2. 5, 6. &amp; 7. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Paul writeth not
onely to the officers, but to the brethren as well
as to them, to forgive or looſe, to comfort or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their love toward the ſame perſon upon his
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:23108:147"/>
repentance, 2. Cor. 2. 7, 8. therein plainly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing,
that the brethren as well as the officers had
bound, rebuked, and manifeſted their indignation
againſt the ſinne and the perſon for it. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
inferred is, That the rule preſcribed by
Chriſt, Matth. 18. and the practice of the ſame
rule by Paul, 1. Cor. 5. do ſeverally and joyntly
couple and combine together the elders and the
people in the cenſuring of an offender;<note place="margin">Robinſ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Bern. pag. 242, 243.</note> the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
going before, the brethren following in their
order, and the women laſtly by ſilent conſent:
wherein the ſcriptures diſtinguiſh them from the
men, 1. Cor. 14. 34. 1. Tim. 2. 12.</p>
            <p>But this concluſion fighteth with it ſelf,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to the point in hand, followeth not from
the premiſſes, if underſtood according to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
meaning. It is croſſe to it ſelf: for if wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
may not authoritatively excommunicate,
then every one two or three amongſt whom the
fornicatour was, whom the Apoſtle reproved
becauſe he was not caſt out, whom he admoniſheth
not to be commingled with fornicatours, whom he
made ſory for their failing, and to whom he writeth
to looſe &amp; forgive him, &amp;c. had not equall power
with the officers to caſt him out, or to forgive him.
For all theſe things were written to the church of
Corinth, to the women as well as the men, unles we
ſhall ſay the inceſtuous perſon muſt be left among
them, or they might company with fornicatours,
&amp;c. In ſcripture they are diſtinguiſhed from men, it
is ſaid, &amp; therefore in ſome caſes that which is ſaid
to the whole congregation doth not equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:23108:147"/>
every one in the congregation, but in their
order.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> And if women be not comprehended in
thoſe exhortations and rebukes as equall to the
brethren, we cannot ſay the brethren are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
as equal to the officers. But each thing muſt
be expounded according to the nature of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and conference of other ſcriptures. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
the whole ſociety may be blamed when
every particular member is not in fault: as here
we may well think, ſome in Corinth mourned,
and endeavoured to have the inceſtuous perſon
removed (who elſe ſhould inform the Apoſtle,
now far abſent, of this abuſe and their groſſe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?)
but could not prevail: and yet the Apoſtle
rebuketh the whole ſociety. And the ſame may
be obſerved in the Prophets; they rebuke the
common ſinnes of many as if all had corrupted
their wayes. Again, the Apoſtle might rebuke
the whole ſociety, that he was not caſt out, when
yet the authority to caſt him out perteined to ſome
onely. Some he might rebuke, becauſe they
were puffed up and did not ſorrow, nor admoniſh
governours to do their office: others, becauſe they
did not caſt him out, or rebuke him earneſtly to
bring him to repentance. Both the brethren and
the officers might be remiſſe, the one to ſtirre up
by grief and juſt indignation, the others to do the
duties of their place;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 9. <gap reason="foreign">

incurre rebuke. So he might admoniſh them all
not to be commingled with fornicatours, but every
one according to his place: not the brethren, by
private familiarity and converſing; not the guides,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:23108:148"/>
by their remiſſeneſſe, ſuffering him to abide in the
ſociety whom they ought to expell and caſt out.
He might decree and command, that when they
were aſſembled together in the name of Chriſt,
they ſhould deliver him to Satan, ſome by their
authority derived from Chriſt, whereunto the
reſt muſt give free and willing conſent. It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
unto them all to endeavour his caſting forth,
but to every man in his order: to the officers, to
caſt him forth by their authority; to the faithfull,
by admonition, ſorrow, free conſent, and juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
if upon rebuke he did not teſtifie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
It concerned the people as well as the
preiſts to put away leaven out of their houſes, and
ſo every man was to put leaven out of his own
houſe, and every Chriſtian man and woman is to
purge ſinne out of their hearts, and do their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to reform others: But if this be applied
to the purging and caſting forth of the inceſtuous
man, then it muſt be remembred, that ſimilitudes
hold not in every thing: For otherwiſe every
prticular man and woman in Corinth, being a
member of that ſociety, had authority of himſelf
actually to thruſt out the inceſtuous perſon, which
is directly contrary to the Apoſtles admonition.
For when they were aſſembled together in the
name of Chriſt, the Apoſtle willeth them to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up to Satan him that had done that wicked
deed. He deſigneth none other authour of this
ſentence but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe name,
that is, by whoſe authority and commandment
received from him, he would have it to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:23108:148"/>
For nothing can be done proſperouſly in
the church unleſſe all things we undertake be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
according to the preſcript of the chief and
ſupreme Lawgiver. But God never gave authority
to every particular believer, two or three, to thruſt
every notorious offender out of the congregation,
as he charged every maſter of a family to put away
leaven out of his houſe. By <hi>the power of Chriſt</hi> is
underſtood the incommunicable power or virtue
of Chriſt, whereby he worketh powerfully by his
Spirit in the miniſtery of the word, and confirmeth
the ſentence of the church rightly pronounced, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his promiſe;<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19, 20.</note> That virtue or efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
power by which he is with his church to the
end of the world,<note place="margin">Luke 24. 49.</note> and promiſeth to be in the midſt
of two or three that ſhould be ſo gathered together
in his name.<note place="margin">Acts 1. 5, 8.</note> And Paul encourageth the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
to miniſter the diſcipline of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the inceſtuous man, arming them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by the mighty preſence of Chriſt, by which
it ſhould be made effectuall. Or if by <hi>the power
of Chriſt</hi> we underſtand both that which is proper
to Chriſt and that which is communicated to his
officers for the good and benefit of the church
(which is leſſe probable) yet there is no ſyllable,
that this power is given immediately to the whole
community, and from them derived to the officers;
much leſſe, that it is given originally and <hi>executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vè</hi>
both to a ſmall company of believers without
officers. For the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of the
power but of the execution of that power which
God hath given, and that by a church completely
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:23108:149"/>
furniſhed with officers for that purpoſe. The
principall cauſe of that caſting forth was the
power, that is, the commandment and authority,
of Chriſt, who is the authour of eccleſiaſticall
power; the near cauſe, the commandment of the
Apoſtle, <hi>Let him be delivered to Satan;</hi> the next
cauſe, the authority of the governours to whom
Chriſt hath committed the care of his flock. But
as the authority of Chriſt doth not take away the
judgement of the Apoſtle, nor the judgement of
the Apoſtle the authority of the governours, no
more doth the authority of the governours the due
regard and reſpect which muſt be had of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the execution of that dreadfull ſentence. To
this purpoſe is the diſtinction of a twofold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
or power of the keyes uſed by
Divines: The firſt <hi>concionalis, per modum doctrinae,</hi>
which is the firſt part of the power of the keyes;
and ſo the paſtour alone may excommunicate the
impenitent according to the commandment of
Chriſt: The ſecond <hi>judicialis, per modum ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
which is not in the power of every paſtour,
but of the church, <hi>ſc.</hi> of the rulers or officers in

many; thereby underſtanding, not the whole ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
but the chief or governours to whom the
care of eccleſiaſticall diſcipline was committed.
And if the congregation was freely and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to conſent to his excommunication, the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of many was ſufficient for his rebuke, by whom
it was performed, to whom belonged the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of binding and looſing miniſterially. It is
true the word <hi>many</hi> is now and then put for <hi>all,</hi>
when the ſubject matter requireth it be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
but there is no reaſon ſo to take it in this
paſſage: and if all had received authority immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to rebuke by way of cenſure and miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
we can give no reaſon why the Apoſtle
ſhould not rather have ſaid, <hi>of all,</hi> then, <hi>of many.</hi>
The queſtion then is not, whether all due regard
ſhould be had of the congregation or church in a
matter of ſuch weight and importance before the
governours proceed to the ſentence of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication;
but whether the power of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication

people, and from them derived to the miniſters:

            <p>Two or three met together in the name of

as neceſſary as the power to receive in members,

            <p>Every ſociety conſiſting of two or three belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
met together to pray is not that church
which hath power to excommunicate:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for then in
many Chriſtian congregations, and in divers fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
there ſhould be many churches inveſted with
this authority. No one example can be alledged
out of ſcripture or eccleſiaſticall ſtory of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
church, in which the multitude of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
no guides or officers moderating the action,
did lawfully excommunicate or judge (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſpeaketh) any member of the ſociety. No
promiſe can be ſhewed in holy writ wherein any
ſuch authority is bequeathed to two or three pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
believers, diſciples or brethren. The ſentence
of excommunication is to be concluded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by men met together in the name of
Chriſt, that is, by the commandment and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Chriſt, and with the power of Chriſt: but
it will never be proved, that Chriſt hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
two or three Chriſtian people, without offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
or guides, to meet in his name, and by his
power to denounce that grave and fearfull ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
The church, to whom this power per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth,
is an aſſembly gathered in the name and by
the power of Chriſt for ſuch a purpoſe, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
to them onely who have received power
from Chriſt to do that ſervice, and not to every
ſociety, nor to every one in any complete ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of believers. And thus the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
muſt be expounded, if they have ſuch refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:23108:150"/>
to the precedent matter. But they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
a reaſon drawn from the leſſe to the greater,
thus; If Chriſt be preſent with two or three ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together in his name to ask things agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his will, he will much more confirm in
heaven whatſoever his officers and ſervants aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in his name ſhall determine and conclude, and
what ſentence they ſhall denounce upon mature
deliberation according to his will. If we ſpeak of
complete churches, ſuch as the Apoſtles planted,
it hath power of excommunication, which is one
part of the power of the keyes: but the execution
of that power is not eſſentiall to the church, either
conſtitutively, or conſecutively: It is neither the
matter nor form of the church, nor that which
doth neceſſarily flow from them as an inſeparable
property. The moderate uſe of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is neceſſary to the well-being of a church: but
there may be a true church where there is no diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of excommunication, and where that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is not put in practice. He may be a good phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
who never uſed ſection; a good chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
who hath no ſaw; and the body ſound which
never ſuffered the cutting off of a member. The
concluſion is, That all ſpirituall power is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
derived from Chriſt, to be exerciſed by
his direction and appointment for the good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the whole church. The power of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word authoritatively, and adminiſtration of
the ſacraments, perteineth to the Paſtours and
Teachers onely; which power they have received
from Chriſt, &amp; muſt exerciſe for the edification of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:23108:151"/>
the flock. The power of excommunication <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter
&amp; exſecutivè</hi> is proper to the company or
aſſembly of guides and rulers in the church, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from Chriſt, to be exerciſed as Chriſt ſhall go

and King: Theſe things are not in the firſt,
but in the ſecond commandment, although they
be inward actions of the mind and inward
worſhip.</p>
            <p>This is a private conceit,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> affirmed without
ground or reaſon to ſupport it, croſſe to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jacob himſelf. Contrary to the
commandment? for the firſt commandment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth
us to take the true Jehovah to be our God,
as in covenant he hath bound himſelf unto his Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:
But God is not our God in covenant but in
and through a Mediatour: And therefore the firſt
commandment bindeth us to take the true God in
and through a Mediatour, that is, Jeſus Chriſt, to
be our God.<note place="margin">Expoſit. the 1. rule.</note> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jacob holdeth the tables of the
law to be the Lords teſtimony and convenant,
wherein all duties whatſoever,<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 18. &amp; 32. 15, 16.</note> even the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 9, 10, 11, 15.</note> as faith, hope, and repentance, are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But in the covenant of grace, in what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
the Lord hath bound us to know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
hope or call upon him, in the ſame he hath
obliged us to know him in Chriſt, to believe in
him through Chriſt, and to call upon him in and
through a Mediatour. For God in Chriſt, or God
and Chriſt, is the object of Chriſtian religion: and
ſince the fall of Adam there is no throne erected
unto which man can come, no way prepared, no
liberty granted for man to come, no good ſucceſſe
to be expected, but in the name of a Mediatour. It
is impoſſible to conceive, how Chriſtians ſhould
believe that God is, or that he is a rewarder of
them that ſeek him diligently, but according to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:23108:152"/>
his covenant of mercy; how they ſhould believe
in his free grace and mercy for the remiſſion of
ſinnes, but in and through Jeſus Chriſt our onely
Saviour. The ſelfſame precept which bindeth
Chriſtians to take the true God to be their God,
King, Father, Judge and Saviour, bindeth them
alſo to take Jeſus Chriſt to be their ſole Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
Redeemer, Saviour, King and Prieſt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
Not to believe in or worſhip Jeſus Chriſt,
is a breach of the firſt commandment: ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Turciſme is againſt the firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To believe in or pray unto Angels or
Saints departed as mediatours, is a breach of the
firſt commandment. All honour and ſervice what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
inward or outward, which is due unto
God by virtue of the firſt commandment, it muſt
be done unto God in and through Jeſus Chriſt:
and not to give that honour unto Jeſus Chriſt, or
to give it unto any other, is a breach of the firſt
commandment. It is true, that inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worſhip both, when they are both of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or kind, are required in the firſt precept: as,
if I muſt pray unto God in the mediation of Jeſus
Chriſt, or pray unto Jeſus Chriſt mine onely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
I may kneel or proſtrate my ſelf, or bow
my body in the exerciſe of religion; and theſe
actions muſt be referred to the ſame command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It is alſo true, that the ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
reacheth to the heart, and requireth that we
rightly conceive of, allow, approve and affect the
ordinances of inſtituted worſhip appointed of God
as well as exerciſe and maintein it: but ſeeing the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:23108:152"/>
worſhip it ſelf commanded is inſtituted, it is alſo
outward. Beſides, there be ſome things of mere
nſtitution which pertein to the third and fourth
commandments: as the inſtitution and obſervation
of the ſeventh day from the creation, in time of
the Law; and of the firſt day in the week, in time
of the Goſpel.<note place="margin">Expoſit. the 1. rule.</note> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jacob himſelf ſaith, <hi>The fourth
commandment (in the word, Sabbath) ſetteth down
one particular, even the ordinary ſeventh day of reſt,
but underſtandeth all holy dayes inſtituted of God, that
they are likewiſe to be ſanctified.</hi> By his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
then all inſtituted doctrines and ordinances
are not referred to the ſecond commandment.</p>
            <p>The juſt and true generall matter of the ſecond
commandment is,<note place="margin">Expoſit. the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. part, tit. The expoſit. of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> a free and voluntary inſtitution
(or matter inſtituted) onely or ſpecially in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of Gods worſhip, wherein it hath no way
any neceſſary uſe of it ſelf. This is the generall
matter or full extent of the ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even in the mind and purpoſe of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the authour of it: And it is likewiſe the juſt
and full definition of Gods inſtituted worſhip in
generall, that is, whether true or falſe.</p>
            <p>This is obſcure and doubtfull.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> If the meaning
be, that all inſtituted or poſitive worſhip of God
which carrieth the Lords ſtamp and approbation
muſt be referred to this commandment, and that
all worſhip deviſed by men, for nature, uſe and
end one with the worſhip inſtituted of God, is a
breach of the ſecond commandment, it will be
granted freely, and might have been delivered
plainly. But if the meaning be, that all free and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:23108:153"/>
voluntary inſtitutions whatſoever muſt be referred
to the ſecond commandment, if of God, as juſt
and allowable, if of men, as ſinfull, it hath no
ground of truth or probability. For many free
inſtitutions cannot be referred to the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:
and concerning the inſtituted worſhip
of God, God hath left many things undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
wherein the church may take order and give
direction without ſinne, unto what commandment
ſoever in generall the things may be referred. The
Lord forbidding to bow down unto or ſerve an
image, doth therein forbid all approbation, liking
or reverence, though never ſo ſmall, ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
any inſtitutions and inventions of men, ſet
up in the room of or matched with the Lords
own inſtituted worſhip: But an invention for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and uſe one with the true worſhip of God,
and an inſtitution in the exerciſe of religion are not
one and the ſame.</p>
            <p>There ought to be very clear and plain proof in
Gods word to warrant every viſible church,<note place="margin">Expoſit. the third part, tit. The expoſit. of the ſecond commandment.</note> if the
members thereof deſire to have comfort to their
own ſouls; becauſe this is even the firſt and
weightieſt matter in religion that can concern us,
<hi>viz.</hi> to be aſſured that we are in a true viſible and
miniſteriall church of Chriſt: For out of a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
church ordinarily there is no ſalvation; and
by a true viſible church (and not otherwiſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily)
we come to learn the way of life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
above all things it is neceſſary that every
Chriſtian do rightly diſcern of the divers kinds of
outward ordinances in this behalf, chiefly of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:23108:153"/>
churches; and withall to underſtand which
kind or form thereof is the true viſible church of
Chriſt, or kingdome of heaven upon earth, which
is the onely way, and in it the onely truth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
leading to eternall life hereafter. For the true
viſible church of Chriſt is but onely one (queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe)
in nature, form and conſtitution.</p>
            <p>There are expreſſe and pregnant texts of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which ſhew what is the true viſible church of
God,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> whereunto Chriſtians may and ought to
joyn themſelves in holy fellowſhip in the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of worſhip: As, where the covenant of God
is there is the people of God and the viſible
church:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 12.</note> For communication and receiving the
tables of the covenant is a certain ſigne of a people
in covenant.<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 4.</note> For what is it to be the flock, ſheep,
or people of God, but to be in covenant with
God, to be the church of God. The word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
diſciples to Chriſt: and the word given to a
people is Gods covenanting with them; and the
peoples receiving this word and profeſſing their
faith unto God,<note place="margin">Lev. 2. 13.</note> is their taking God to be their
God.<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 11.</note> Thoſe aſſemblies which have Chriſt for
their Head,<note place="margin">Deut. 33. 3. &amp; 26. 17.</note> and the ſame alſo for their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are the true viſible churches of Chriſt. It is
ſimply neceſſary, that the aſſemblies be laid upon
Chriſt the foundation by faith: which being done,
the remaining of what is forbidden, or the want
of what is commanded, cannot put the aſſembly
from the title and right of a church. For Chriſt
is the foundation and head-corner-ſtone of the
church. The form is coming unto Chriſt, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:23108:154"/>
being builded upon him by faith; the matter is the
people united and knit unto Chriſt, and ſo one
unto another. Now where the matter and form
of a church is there is a church. Every ſociety or
aſſembly profeſſing the int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re and true faith of
Chriſt, and worſhipping God with an holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
joyning together in prayer and thankſgiving,
enjoying the right uſe of the ſacraments, and
keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace, is the true church of Chriſt. The Goſpel
may be preached to Infidels; ſome ſupernaturall
truths may be profeſſed by hereticks; the uſe of
the ſacraments may be in adulterate churches: but
the intire profeſſion of all fundamentall articles of
faith to be believed, and main precepts and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
laws for practice to be acknowledged, the
dwelling of the truth amongſt men, and the right
uſe of the ſacraments, which is ever joyned with
true doctrine, and to be eſteemed by it, is proper
to them that be in covenant with God. The laws
and ſtatutes which God gave to Iſrael was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and ornament of that nation, a teſtimony
that the Lord had ſeparated them from all other

members are ſolemnly admitted into the body

of matrimoniall love, which God vouchſafeth
unto his church:<note place="margin">Jer. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>And I will give you Paſtours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

heare do not receive the love of the truth, yet
where God giveth his word it is a ſigne that ſome
in thoſe places belong to the kingdome of heaven.
The Apoſtles firſt gathered churches, and then
ordained elders in every citie: So that it is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:23108:155"/>
proper to the church to be fed and guided by true
ſpirituall Paſtours, who do both teach and bleſſe

unfeignedly, which is ever accompanied
with holineſſe of converſation, if God give time

no ſalvation to men of age and diſcretion. It is a

the ſacraments; becauſe otherwiſe we cannot
know how to joyn our ſelves in holy communion
with the people of God in the ordinances of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
which is a neceſſary duty if God give oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:23108:155"/>
But to know the externall order or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of a particular, miniſteriall, politicall
church, is not a matter of weight or importance,
to be matched with either of the former. And if
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jacob comprehend all theſe things under the
name of <hi>the church,</hi> his ſpeech is falſe, deceitfull,
and confuſed, becauſe he diſtinguiſheth not things
that be of different kinds. If the latter, it is moſt
inconſiderately ſpoken and weakly proved. For
out of the catholick inviſible church or ſociety
there is no ſalvation; but out of a particular, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
miniſteriall church ſalvation is to be had. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
ſociety with the members of Chriſt, and
communion with Chriſt himſelf which is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is neceſſary; externall not ſo. Chriſt is
the Saviour of his body, and ſaved he cannot be
by Chriſt that is not a live-member of his body.
Noahs ark builded by Gods appointment for the

was a type of that church out of which there
is no ſalvation, in which there is moſt certain
ſalvation; and the waters by which ſuch as
entred into the ark were ſaved, a type of
baptiſme. But of what baptiſme? Externall?
No: Externall baptiſme and the ark of Noah
were types of the ſame rank, both types and
ſignes of that internall baptiſme which is wrought
by the holy Ghoſt, by which we are incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the body of Chriſt, and become more
undoubtedly ſafe from the everlaſting fire then
ſuch as entred Noahs ark were from the deluge of
water. If the ark which Noah built did ſave all
ſuch from the deluge as entred into it, how much
more ſhall that holy and catholick church which
Chriſt hath built and ſanctified by his moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bloud, give eternall life to all ſuch as in this
world become live-members of it? Such mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
they are made, not by becoming me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the
viſible church, but by internall grace or ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There is not the ſame reaſon of externall and
internall communion with the church. The inward
is and was ever neceſſary, the externall neceſſary
when it may be enjoyed. Some may be of the
church in reſpect of the profeſſion, participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ordinances and other inferiour privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
who are not of the inviſible church, that
is, do not communicate in the moſt perfect work,
force and effect of ſaving grace. And ſome that
be not full members of the true, orthodox and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:23108:156"/>
church, may notwithſtanding be found and
live, members of the myſticall body of Jeſus
Chriſt. For all that truly believe are in the ſtate
of ſalvation; and all that be in the ſtate of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be members of that church out of which no
ſalvation is to be hoped for or can be obteined,
which doth comprehend all the faithfull and them
that ſhall be ſaved. They are in act and in deed
both in and of that church, and not in deſire and
wiſh onely; becauſe they are actually in the ſtate
of ſalvation, the heirs apparent to everlaſting
bleſſedneſſe, actuall partakers of the benefits of
Chriſts death which accompany ſalvation. They
are given unto Chriſt, ſet into him as branches
into a vine: and they that be ſuch, be in deed
and act, not in deſire alone, members of Chriſts
body. All that were not in the ark periſhed in the
waters: No member doth live but that which is
actually joyned to the head, and draweth life from
it. Baptiſme is the ſeal of our ſolemn admiſſion
into the church: but it is not the gate of our ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into Chriſt, but the ſeal of that admiſſion we
have received by grace &amp; are partakers of by a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
faith. True believers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are in the ſtate of grace;
actuall members of the militant church, but of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
particular, miniſterial church or congregation
they may be members in deſire onely. For it
may ſo fall out many times, that he who is joyned
to Chriſt by a true and lively faith hath not means
and opportunity to unite himſelf unto a viſible and
miniſteriall church. The <hi>Catechum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of full, effectuall and ſaving participation of
Chriſts benefits, actuall members of the church
inviſible, when in reſpect of ſolemn outward and
ſacramentall admiſſion they were not members of
any viſible congregation. If a Chriſtian be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
excommunicated, he ſtill reteineth all thoſe
things which the beſt parts of the church have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or outward: and though he be cut off from
the meetings and aſſemblies of particular
churches, ſo that he may not bodily be preſent
when the people meet together, yet ſtill he hath
the communion which onely is eſſentiall, and
maketh a man to be of the church, in that he hath
all thoſe things which the beſt that remain not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
have, as faith, hope, love and profeſſion of
the whole truth of God: He is the friend of God,
an heir apparent of the new Jeruſalem, a living
member of the myſticall body of Chriſt: And if he
be not cut off from Chriſt, from hope of ſalvation,
and fellowſhip of the ſaints triumphant, neither can
he be caſt out from the fellowſhip of the church
militant: for the church militant and triumphant is
one. The performance of holy duties is an action of
them that be already of the church, and doth not
make a man of the church: yea, the performance of
theſe duties is a thing of that nature, that by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and unjuſt courſes, holden by wicked men,
we may be hindred from it without any fault of

out of the viſible church is a thing ſo plain and
confeſſed that it needeth no proof. In times of
grievous and hot perſecution, under which the
church hath laboured, the faithfull have been
compelled to meet in woods, dens, and caves,
ſome in one place, ſome in another, as opportunity
was offered; their ſocieties have been broken,
and ſet congregations diſperſed and ſcattered;
when yet they continued the true church wherein
ſalvation was to be had, and enjoyed the ordinary
means of ſalvation. And if we ſpeak of a viſible
miniſteriall church, as it is here meant by you,
the faithfull who profeſſed the truth of the Goſpel
intirely, and did communicate in the ordinances
of worſhip for the ſpace of this fourteen hundred
yeares and upward had not means, or at leaſt did
not unite themſelves into a viſible miniſteriall
church of Chriſt: And if out of this your church
ordinarily there be no ſalvation, no means leading
to everlaſting life, the Chriſtian world for theſe
many hundred yeares hath wanted ordinary means
to bring them to life and ſalvation, and been in
that ſtate in which no ſalvation ordinarily can be
expected. If we deteſt the conſequence as dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
not ſtanding with the promiſes made to the
church of the Gentiles and the tender mercies of
God vouchſafed to his people, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

            <p>In the new Teſtament <hi>the church</hi> doth ſignifie a

ſociety of the faithfull, which is diſtinguiſhed from
their aſſembly or meeting together for the worſhip
of God.<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 23.</note> For we ſhall reade, <hi>the church of God</hi> or

of place where they do aſſemble. It is not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the unitie of an eccleſiaſticall ſociety, that
the members ſhould ordinarily aſſemble in divers
places for the worſhipping of God, ſo long as they
be united by the ſame laws, have communion in
the ſame ordinances, and be linked under the ſame
ſpirituall guides and officers. When a church did
comprehend a citie with its ſuburbs and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
circumjacent, I mean the believers who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that faith within that circuit, it might well
be that the number did ſo increaſe through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
bleſſing of God which did accompany
the preaching of the word in thoſe primitive times
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:23108:158"/>
and firſt planting of that heavenly kingdome, that
they could not well meet ordinarily in one place,
and yet might and did continue one ſociety. For
when a number is gathered in ſmall villages, or
ſome added to the number already gathered, it is
not meet they ſhould be neglected becauſe ſmall,
nor yet divided from the body becauſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
not competent to make an intire and perfect
body of it ſelf. The increaſe of churches doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
an increaſe of miniſters, and if they grow
to bigneſſe more then ordinary, an increaſe of
places for their aſſembling, when the eſſence of
the viſible church is not changed, nor one multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
or divided into many. And it is more
available for the good of the church, and further
removed from all ambition, if the ſociety ſhall
aſſemble in divers places as parts and members
of one body, then to conſtitute a diſtinct free ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
conſiſting of ſome few believers, not fit to
make up an intire body, contrary to the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
examples of the apoſtles. In times of hot
and grievous perſecutions the churches of God
could not aſſemble in any great numbers in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
places, but have been compelled to meet in
dens, and caves, and woods, one and the ſame
ſociety in divers places, yet ſo as the ſociety was
not broken, though their meeting together in one
place was interrupted. To meet together there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in one place is not ſo eſſentiall to the church,
but it may continue one in laws, ordinances, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and communion, though in reſpect of
multitude, diſtance of places, and many other
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:23108:159"/>
occurrences they be conſtrained to aſſemble and
hold their meeting ſeverally. And that it was
thus in the churches planted by the apoſtles, it is
moſt probable. May we not well think that the
Chriſtian church at Jeruſalem, for whom Chriſt
had prayed particularly, to which ſome attribute
the firſt miraculous converſion by Peters preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and amongſt whom, being now aſcended into
glory,<note place="margin">Acts 11. 19, 20. &amp; 15. 2, 4, 6, 22, 23. &amp; 16. 4. &amp; 21. 18.</note> he did more abundantly diſplay his power,
and more conſpicuouſly ſwallow up the ſcandal of
his Croſſe; which had the labour of all or many
of the apoſtles for a time in it, whoſe care and
induſtry we may gueſſe at by their ordination of
Deacons, that they might not be diſtracted;
whereunto much people did reſort dayly,
who though explicitely they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt, yet had they in them the
faith of the Meſſias, and ſo were nearer to
the kingdome of God then the common hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;
which was to ſend out light to all other
churches, and be a common nurſery to the world:
May we not well think that this church did quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
riſe to ſuch bigneſſe that they could not well
aſſemble in one congregation, as we call them?
And the ſame may be ſaid of other churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned. For at that time the regions were
white even unto the harveſt; the time was come
when that heavenly kingdome was to be planted
amongſt all nations: and at the beginning God
did reveal his arm more extraordinarily; and
things which have their ſet period of growing do
in their beginnings come on the faſteſt. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:23108:159"/>
the apoſtles were extraordinarlly furniſhed
for the work, and had a great and wide doore ſet
open unto them of God, ſeeing they were diligent
and induſtrious in their work, and God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
mightily to accompany their endeavours, is it
not more then conjecturall, that within ſhort time
the number of believers in thoſe great and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
cities, with their ſuburbs and circumjacent
villages, did exceed the capacity of one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?
The officers alſo which the Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for the uſe of thoſe churches, were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
more then one ordinary congregation could
bear, or were neceſſary for the ſervice thereof,
unleſſe it were exceeding great, and could not
long continue together with edification, but of
neceſſity muſt aſſemble in ſeverall places. It was
not the apoſtles practice to ordain paſtours in
thoſe places where as yet no ſheep were to be ſeen
or very few: and it had been inconvenient to tie
the faithfull to one congregation, when by reaſon
of multitude they could not meet in one place to
their edification. What then remaineth, but that
they might aſſemble in divers places, and yet hold
communion in laws, ordinances, government
and officers? When presbyters were firſt aſſigned
to their particular cures, it is not certain.<note place="margin">Hiſt. Eccl. l. 2. cap. 15, 16.</note> Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius

two and forty Acolyths, two and fifty

a thouſand and five hundred widows,
poore and ſick: And from hence he doth ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Novatus his pertinacy, that none of the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
clergy nor yet of the people very great and
innumerable could turn him or recall him. This
was one viſible miniſteriall church, wherein all
the members had union and communion together
for the mutuall edifying and reſtoring one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but it was too great and abundant ordinarily
to aſſemble in one place. So that the church
might remain one when the multitude was too
great to meet in one place ordinarily, and when
particular Presbyters were aſſigned to particular
cures: For that was not a diviſion of the ſociety
into ſocieties diſtinct, but an aſſignement of ſome
particular officer to the overſight of one part or
branch of the ſociety, for the more fit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:23108:161"/>
government of the whole, as it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
and they ſo attended that branch of the
ſociety or church, that their care and overſight
reached to the whole. And out of doubt this
form or kind of a viſible and miniſteriall church is
much nearer to the patterns and precedents ſet by
the apoſtles in the firſt plantation of Chriſtian
churches then that two three or few believers,
uniting themſelves in covenant, ſhould be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the onely viſible and miniſteriall church, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
from whom the officers ſhould, as their
ſervants, derive their authority. This kind or
form of a viſible church is ſo farre from being the
onely lawfull and allowed form of a church in
ſcripture, as if we ſpeak of a church complete in
reſpect of the inward ſubſtance and externall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
furniſhed for all duties and offices required of
the church, it is not ſo much as warranted in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
To the conſtitution of a viſible diſtinct
ſociety or church there is required, Firſt, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
profeſſion of one and the ſame faith and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
intire in all fundamentall articles of faith
to be believed as neceſſary to ſalvation, and main
precepts and morall laws for practice to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.
A lively operative faith maketh a
man a true member of the church inviſible; and
the profeſſion of faith and holyneſſe, a member
of the church viſible. Profeſſion of Divine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
revealed in Chriſt, whom onely the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
and ſocieties of Chriſtians acknowledge to
be the Sonne of God and Saviour of the world,
doth diſtinguiſh Chriſtians from Jews. The
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:23108:161"/>
intire profeſſion of faith, according to the rule
left by Chriſt and his firſt diſciples and ſcholars
the holy apoſtles, doth ſeparate the multitude of
night-believing Chriſtians, which is the ſound
part of the Chriſtian church, from all ſeduced he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall
combinations. Secondly, there is required
an union and communion in the true worſhip of
God, and ordinances belonging thereunto, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God himſelf, <hi>ſc.</hi> prayer, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the ſacraments, and diſpenſation of
the word. But the time may fall out, that
the preaching of the word may be omitted, and
reading or meditation may poſſeſſe the place
thereof, nay, mere deſire conjoyned with manifold
ſighs. So the adminiſtration of the ſacraments
may be left off, as it was in the church of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
for the ſpace of fourty yeares in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.
But though the being of a church is
not abſolutely deſtroyed by the want or omiſſion
of theſe exerciſes for a time, yet they are actions
neceſſary to the well-being of a church, and ſuch
as flow from the very nature of a church if they be
not hindred. Thirdly, there muſt be ſubjection
to lawfull guides, officers, or paſtours appointed,
authorized and ſanctified to lead and direct the
flock in the happy wayes of eternall life. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of believers were gathered before elders
were ordained amongſt them, and the church
may continue when guides are wanting (as in caſe
they be taken away by death, perſecution, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment)
but it is not complete or perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, neither can it hold communion in many
ordinances of worſhip, nor execute many offices
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:23108:162"/>
which belong to the church conſiſting of all its
parts. Fourthly, to the making up of an intire,
viſible, diſtinct ſociety, orders, laws and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
is required for the perventing of abuſes and
ſcandals, the preſervation of the holy things of
God from contempt, the recovery of them that
fall, and ſuppreſſion of prophaneneſſe. Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
is needfull in every ſociety, without which
it cannot long continue but all things will run into
confuſion. It is neceſſary the members of the
church ſhould live Chriſtianly, otherwiſe the
profeſſion of faith and adminiſtration of the holy
things of God muſt needs be polluted. Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
put for the cenſures, hath no practice but in
an united body or church, which muſt needs have
a being before it can exerciſe its power: But the
excerciſe of that power in a body complete is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
not ſimply to the being but to the well-being
of the whole. As a city, ſo the church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without thoſe things which belong to the
neceſſary being thereof: but it may be without
thoſe that belong unto her ſafety alone, though
not ſo well. Fifthly, the members of a viſible
church muſt hold fellowſhip in faith and love, not
onely one with another, but with all other viſible
churches, and all others intirely profeſſing the
faith of Chriſt and walking in holyneſſe, ſo farre
as they hold communion with Jeſus Chriſt. For
all viſible churches, though diſtinct ſocieties; be
ſiſters, one in profeſſion, fundamentall laws and
ordinances, and ſhould be one in hearty love and
affection: And no particular church can be called
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:23108:162"/>
or be the true church of Chriſt but as it holdeth
union with the catholick. From the relation
whereby Chriſt is referred to his members, theſe
things flow, <hi>ſc.</hi> That Chriſt doth expound to
them his word for the food of eternall life, and
doth hang ſeals to his word whereby he doth
confirm and ratifie it. From the relation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the members of Chriſt are referred to him
their Head, theſe things flow, That whoſoever
would be accounted for true members of Jeſus
Chriſt they muſt acknowledge and receive that
food and thoſe ſeals appointed by Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If the faithfull muſt aſſemble to heare the
word of God, call upon his name, and receive
the ſacraments, then there muſt be ſome to preach
the word, adminiſter the ſacraments, and bleſſe
in the name of the Lord, and that by authority
from God. If they muſt receive the word, and
avouch themſelves to be the people of God,
then they muſt walk before him in holyneſſe, and
maintein the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace. If the temple of God muſt be kept
from pollution, and the holy things of God from
contempt, then there muſt be authority commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
from Chriſt to cenſure ſuch as offend, to
repell the notorious, to comfort the afflicted,
and receive the penitent. If all promiſcuouſly
may not meddle with the diſpenſation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things of God to that purpoſe, then there
muſt be order for their election and admiſſion into
that office, and for the execution thereof being
admitted thereunto. Where all theſe things are
to be found purely, the church is excellent for
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:23108:163"/>
degree, pure and famous: Where any of theſe
are wanting or impure, the church is ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
or impure, though it may be pure in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of others. Whereſoever we ſee the word
of God truly taught and profeſſed in points fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
and the ſacraments for ſubſtance
rightly adminiſtred, there is the true church of
Chriſt, though the health and ſoundneſſe of it
may be crazed by many errours in doctrine, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in the worſhip of God, and evils in the
life and manners of men. Profeſſion of the true
faith alone in matters fundamentall, and holy
prayer, with exhortation to obedience, is a mark
of the true church, though the ſacraments upon
occaſion be not there adminiſtred ſo that they be
not neglected upon any contempt or erroneous
conceit of their not being neceſſary. Where
moſt of theſe notes are wanting or impure, the
church is of leſſe account, in dignity, excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and credit coming ſhort of others, according
to the degrees of impurity in the marks, the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of ſome marks, and the nature of the
marks themſelves in which the impurity is: As
impurity in doctrine or adminiſtration of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
is worſe then diſorder in matter of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
onely. Therefore to the full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
conſtitution of a viſible church many things
are required, and that of divers kinds in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and of divers degrees of neceſſity, all
which cannot be referred to the ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but many, and they moſt neceſſary, to
the firſt; ſome to the third; ſome to all: And
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:23108:163"/>
though in things eſſentiall and unchangeable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the being of the church, and matters
poſitive determined by God, nothing muſt be
done beſides the rule; yet in things not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
concerning externall order, and the better
exerciſe of that authority which Chriſt hath
committed to his ſervants, ſome things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the wiſdome of the church, according
to the generall rules of ſcripture. And if the
church, holding the true faith, as it hath formerly
been ſaid, ſhall exceed or fall ſhort in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
for ſuch ſuperfluity or defect ſhe is not
to be rejected as no true viſible church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Every church-miniſtery made and deviſed by
the policy of men,<note place="margin">Expoſit. of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> and not inſtituted of God, is
againſt the ſecond commandment, &amp;c. And all
offices and miniſteries in the church which are
found in the ſcripture as inſtituted by God, are in
the affirmative part of this ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The church-miniſtery,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> in reſpect of the main
and ſubſtantiall duties belonging thereunto, doth
pertein to the ſecond commandment in part, not
wholly or onely: but in reſpect of things circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
annexed to the miniſtery, it belongeth
not to the ſecond commandment. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
ſcripture, that is a new or deviſed miniſtery
which for ſubſtance of the office is not of God,
be the outward calling never ſo orderly or legall;
and that miniſtery is not new or deviſed which for
the ſubſtance of the office is of God, though the
entrance was diſordered in the perſon admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:23108:164"/>
many things be amiſſe, and in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
many defects or ſuperfluities. If a miniſter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
choſen and ordained ſhall preach falſe and
corrupt doctrine in points fundamentall, or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
falſe ſacraments, his miniſtery is new, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
falſe, notwithſtanding his lawfull entrance.
If a miniſter enter unlawfully, either by the tumult
of the people, partiality of the overſeers, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of patrones, if he preach Chriſt crucified
ſoundly, and rightly adminiſter the ſacraments,
his miniſtery is true and of God, though his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
be of men. If a miniſter preach ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in the main, though mixed with ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and adminiſter the holy ſacraments, though
with ſome ſuperſtitious rites, his miniſtery is not
to be eſteemed new or deviſed for theſe weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
If ſome things humane be mixed with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
a ſound Chriſtian muſt ſeparate the one from
the other, and not caſt away what is of God, as a
nullity, fruitleſſe, unprofitable, defiled, becauſe
ſomewhat of men is annexed unto them. In the
body we can diſtinguiſh betwixt the ſubſtance and
the ſickneſſe which cleaveth unto it; betwixt the
ſubſtance of a part and member, and ſome bunch
or ſwelling, which is a deformity, but deſtroyeth
not the nature of that part or member. Which of
the prophets doth not cry out againſt the pride,
oppreſſion, covetouſneſſe, tyranny of the prieſts
in the time of the law? Their offices were bought
and ſold; they themſelves deſpiſed knowledge,
oppoſed the prophets of the Lord, ſtrengthened
the hands of the wicked, and were enemies to all
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:23108:164"/>
piety, and yet their miniſtery was not falſe and
deviſed for the main ſubſtance of it.<note place="margin">Cann. Neceſſ. of Ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rre. cap. 1. § 3.</note> It is objected
by the rigideſt Separatiſts, with great confidence,
<hi>That to communicate in a falſe miniſtery, is certainly
a breach of the ſecond commandment. For what do
they elſe but ſet up an idole, yea and bow down unto
it, which ſerve God in and by a deviſed miniſtery?</hi>
But if firſt they would conſider what a falſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
miniſtery is, and then what it is to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
in the worſhip of God with them, they
would ſoon forſake this fort, wherein they truſt.
For the miniſtery may be true and of God, when
the election is diſordered, and the perſon unmeet,
and the execution maimed. If this be not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there was neither church nor ſacrament nor
miniſtery in the world for many hundred yeares:
yea, if every ſuperfluity or defect make a nullity of
the miniſtery, they that think themſelves the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miniſters will be found none at all; becauſe
they derive their authority from the community
of the faithfull, it may be two or three onely uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in covenant, which hath none authority to
communicate it, as hath been proved before. For
ſo we may reaſon as they do, That is no miniſtery
which is derived from them and executed in their
name who have none authority to give it. What
is it to communicate in a falſe miniſtery? Is it to
communicate in the worſhip of God with them
whoſe calling is not in every reſpect appointed
and approved of God? I might entreat them to
look to their own ſtanding before they accuſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and juſtifie their own calling before they
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:23108:165"/>
ſeek to draw others from the communion of the
church upon ſuch pretenſes. But if that be their
meaning, the propoſition is weak, it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtand alone nor be underſet with any props.
For when the prophets propheſied lies;<note place="margin">Mic. 3. 11, 12.</note> and the
prieſts bare rule by their means,<note place="margin">Jer. 5. 31.</note> was their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
true or falſe?<note place="margin">Iſa. 56. 10.</note> When the prieſts were dumb
dogs that could not bark,<note place="margin">Ezek. 44. 7, 8.</note> and greedy dogs that
could never have enough, was their miniſtery
true or falſe?<note place="margin">John 2. 16.</note> When the prieſts bought and ſold
doves in the temple, or took upon them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
doves and ſuch like things for them that were
to offer, was their miniſtery true or falſe?
When the ſcribes and Phariſees corrupted the
law by falſe gloſſes, taught for doctrine mens
precepts, made the commandment of God of
none effect by their traditions, and ſet themſelves
againſt Jeſus Chriſt, was their miniſtery true or
falſe? If true; then an ignorant, idole, prophane,
idle miniſtery, which deſpiſeth knowledge, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
godlineſſe, prophaneth the holy things of
God, corrupteth the law, polluteth his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
ſtrengtheneth the hands of the wicked, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the blind out of the way, may be a true and
lawfull miniſtery. If falſe; then to communicate
in a falſe miniſtery is not a breach of the ſecond
commandment: For the true prophets forbad not
the people to heare the prieſts, nor our Saviour
his followers to communicate with the ſcribes
and Phariſees in the worſhip of God. He charged
them to beware of their leaven, to let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
becauſe they were the blind leaders of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:23108:165"/>
blind: but he never laid his commandment upon
the faithfull, not to communicate with them in
the worſhip of God. And therefore to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with miniſters no better then Phariſees in
the true worſhip of God, is neither a vain wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
nor an abetting of the party in his ſin, nor
to rebell againſt the Lord, nor to commit ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
whoredome: but on the contrary, it is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God aright, to reverence his ordinances, to
relie upon his grace, to hearken unto his voice, and
ſubmit unto his good pleaſure. If their miniſtery
was true in ſome reſpects and falſe in others, then
the miniſtery is not abſolutely falſe which in ſome
reſpect is not pure as it ought and is to be deſired;
then alſo it is no ſin to communicate in a falſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
in ſome reſpect, ſo farre, to wit, as it hath
truth in it, and doth carry the ſtamp of God.
The prieſts, ſcribes and Phariſees, were of the
tribe of Levi, which was ſet apart for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
<note place="margin">John 10. 5.</note> yet might they be ſtrangers, thieves, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
murderers, which the ſheep of Chriſt will
not heare, that is, follow or be led by them. For
the miniſters whom our Saviour chargeth as
thieves and murderers, were of continuall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Levi and Aaron eſpecially: and it is
to be underſtood of them who teach falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and not of them who enter without a
lawfull outward calling. And to enter by Chriſt
the doore, teaching him alone to be the onely
Saviour and Mediatour, is the note of a good
ſhepherd. To heare them, is not ſimply to
communicate with them in the ordinances of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:23108:166"/>
God, which the godly and faithfull among the
Jews might not refuſe to do with the Scribes and
Phariſees, who were thieves and robbers; but
to receive their doctrine, and embrace their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
which was evermore unlawfull. The
thieves and murderers in the church of the Jews
ſprung up with them, and continued amongſt
them, and neither departed themſelves nor were
caſt out by others that had authority.<note place="margin">Acts 20. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</note> In the

reſpect of outward order were lawfully choſen
or called, and yet falſe prophets, diſcovered by
their doctrine not by their calling, and ſome of
them continuing in the church, the faithfull are
warned to beware of their errours that they be
not infected by them, but not forbidden to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
at the ordinances of worſhip becauſe they are
preſent. And if we look into the Scriptures of
the old and new Teſtament, we ſhall never find

pleaſed to trie and examine the matter unpartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſhall find their quotations of ſcripture to be
many, impertinent, forced, wreſted, miſerably

or pretended grounds from others whoſe

look down upon his church, make up the
breaches which ſinne hath made, remove the
ſtumbling-blocks and occaſions of offenſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſuch as are gone aſtray, cauſe his truth to

them that fear his name to walk in love, and by
an holy unblamable converſation in all things
to approve the ſoundneſſe of their faith and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

comfort of their ſouls, the edification
of others, and the glory of his
