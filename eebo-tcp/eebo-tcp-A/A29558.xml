            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WEe are now upon the point of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as much as in us lyes) the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sentence unto death or life, on a great Minister of <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Peere</hi> of this Kingdome, <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A name of hatred in the present ages by his practices, and fit to be made a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to future ages by his punishment. I have had the honour to be employed by the House, in this great busines; from the first houre that it was taken into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96309:6"/>
it was a matter of great trust, and I will say with confidence, that I have served the House in it with industry (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ability) with most exact faithfulnesse and secrecie.</p>
            <p>And as I have hitherto discharged my duty to this House, and to my Country in the progresse of this great cause, so I trust I shall do now in the last period of it, to God, and to a good conscience.</p>
            <p>I doe with the peace of that unto my selfe, and the blessings of Almighty God to me and my posterity, according as my judgment on the life of this man shall be consonant with my heart, and the best of my understanding in all integritie. I know well <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> That by some things I have said of late, whilst this Bill was in agitation, I have raised some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices upon me in the cause.</p>
            <p>Yea, some (I thank them for their plain dealing) have been so free as to tell mee, That I suffered much, by the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse I have shewn in this Bill of <hi>Attainder</hi> of the E. of <hi>Strafford,</hi> against whom I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96309:6"/>
had been formerly so <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een, so active.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> I beg of you and the rest, but a suspension of judgments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mee, till I have opened my heart unto you freely and cleerly in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>Truly Sir, I am still the same in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and affections unto the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as that I confidently believe him the most dangerous Minister, the most insupportable to free subjects that can be caractered.</p>
            <p>I believe his practizes in themselves as high, as Tyrannicall, as any subject ever ventred on; and the malignity of them hugely aggravated by those rare abilities of his, where of God hath given him the use, and the Devill the application; in a word, I believe him still that grand <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi> to the Common-wealth, who must not expect to be pardon'd it in this world, till he be dispatched to the other: and yet let mee tell you <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> My hand must not be to that dispatch; I protest, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96309:7"/>
my conscience stands informed, I had rather it were off.</p>
            <p>Let mee unfold unto you the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (Master Speaker) I will not dwell much upon justifying unto you my see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming variance at this time, from what I appeared formerly, by putting you in minde of the difference betweene <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> how misbecomming that fervour would be in a <hi>Iudge,</hi> which perhaps was commendable as a <hi>Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; Iudges</hi> we are now, and must put on another personage.</p>
            <p>It is honest and noble to be earnest in order to the discovery of <hi>Truth;</hi> but when <hi>that</hi> hath bin brought as farre as it can to light, our judgment thereupon ought to be calme and cautious.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Prosecution,</hi> upon probable grounds, we are accountable onely for our <hi>Industry,</hi> or <hi>Remisnesse;</hi> but in <hi>Iudgment</hi> wee are deeply responsible to <hi>God Almighty,</hi> for its rectitude, or obliquity: In <hi>Cases of Life,</hi> the <hi>Iudge is Gods steward</hi> of the parties bloud,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96309:7"/>
and must give a strict account for every drop.</p>
            <p>But as I told you <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> I will not insist long upon this ground of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in me now, from what I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
            <p>The truth on't is <hi>sir,</hi> The same ground whereupon I with the rest of the five, to whom you first committed the <hi>considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Lord of Strafford,</hi> brought down our opinion, <hi>That it was fit hee should bee accused of Treason;</hi> upon the same ground, I was engaged with earnestnesse in his <hi>prosecution,</hi> and had the same ground re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in that force of beliefe with me (which till very lately it did) I should not have bin tender in his <hi>Condemnation</hi>: but truly <hi>sir,</hi> to deale plainly with you, That ground of our accusation, that spur to our <hi>prosecution,</hi> and that which should be the <hi>Basis</hi> of my judgment of the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as unto <hi>Treason,</hi> is to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding quite vanished away.</p>
            <p>This it was <hi>Master Speaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96309:8"/>His advising the King to employ the <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> to reduce <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I was assured would be proved before I gave my consent to his accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I was still confirmed in the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, during the prosecution, and fortified in it most of all since Sir <hi>Henry Vains</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory examinations by the assurances which that worthy member M. <hi>Pimme</hi> gave me, That his testimony would be made convincing by some notes of what passed at the <hi>juncto</hi> concurrent with it, which I ever understanding to be of some other Counsellour, you see now prove but a copy of the same <hi>Secretaries</hi> notes discovered and produced in the manner you have heard, and those such disioynted fragments of the venemous part of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, no <hi>results,</hi> no <hi>conclusions</hi> of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi> which are the onely things that Secretaries of <hi>State</hi> should register; there being no use at all of the other, but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse and to bring men into danger.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> This is not that which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the <hi>Evidence</hi> with me, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96309:8"/>
the <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor yet all the rest of the <hi>juncto</hi> upon their oaths remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber any thing of it.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Sir</hi> which I shall tell you, is that which works with me (under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) to an utter overthrow of his <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> as unto that of the <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> before whilst I was a <hi>Prosecutor,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tye of <hi>secrecie,</hi> I might not discover any weaknesse of the cause, which now as a <hi>Iudge</hi> I must.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Secretary</hi> was examined thrice upon oath at the preparatory Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittee.</p>
            <p>The first time, hee was questioned to all the <hi>Interrogatories;</hi> and to that part of the seventh which concerns the <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he saith positively in these words, I cannot charge him with that, but for the rest, he desires time to recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which was granted him.</p>
            <p>Some days after (the precise time I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say) he was examined a second time, and then deposés these words concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings being absolved from rules
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96309:9"/>
of <hi>Government</hi> and so forth, very cleerly; but being prest to that part concerning the <hi>Irish Armie</hi> again, can say nothing to that.</p>
            <p>Here we thought wee had done with him, till divers weeks after, my Lord of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and all others of the <hi>Iuncto,</hi> denying to have heard any thing concerning those words of reducing <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the <hi>Irish Armie,</hi> It was thought fit to examine the <hi>Secretarie</hi> once more; and then he deposed these words to have bin said by the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> to his Majesty, <hi>You have an Armie in</hi> Ireland, <hi>which you may employ here to reduce</hi> (or some words to that sence) <hi>this Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> these are the <hi>circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> which (I confesse with my conscience) thrust quite out of doores that grand Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our <hi>charge,</hi> concerning his despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate advice to the <hi>King, of employing the Irish Army here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let not this I beseech you be driven to an aspersion upon <hi>Master Secretarie,</hi> as if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96309:9"/>
hee should have sworne otherwise then he knew, or believed; hee is too worthy to doe that; onely let thus much be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it, that he who twice upon oath, with time of recollection, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any thing of such a businesse, might well a third time misremember somewhat; and in this businesse, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of one Letter, <hi>here</hi> for <hi>there,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> for <hi>this,</hi> quite alters the case, the latter also being more probable, since it is confessed of all hands, that the debate then was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a war with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and you may remember, that at the Bar hee once said, to employ there; and thus <hi>Master Speaker</hi> I have faithfully given you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, what it is that hath blunted the edge of the hatchet or bill with mee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Lord of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was that whereupon I accused him with a free heart, prosecuted him with earnestnesse, and had it to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding bin proved, should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him with innocence: Wherein
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96309:10"/>
now I professe I cannot satisfie my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to doe it.</p>
            <p>I professe I can have no Notion of my Lords intent to subvert the Laws treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably by force, and this designe of force not appearing, all his other wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices cannot amount so high with me.</p>
            <p>I can find a more easie and more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall spring, from whence to derive all his other crimes, then from an intent to bring in tyranny (and to make his own posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aswell as us slaves) as from <hi>Revenge,</hi> from <hi>Pride,</hi> from <hi>Avarice,</hi> from <hi>Passion,</hi> and <hi>insolence</hi> of Nature.</p>
            <p>But had <hi>this</hi> of the <hi>Irish Army</hi> bin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it would have diffused a complexion of <hi>Treason</hi> over all; it would have beene a Weith indeed to binde all those other scattered and lesser branches, as it were into a faggot of <hi>Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96309:10"/>I doe not say but the rest may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him a man as worthy to die, and worthier perhaps then many a <hi>Traitour;</hi> I doe not say, but they may justly direct us to <hi>enact</hi> that the <hi>like</hi> shall be <hi>Treason</hi> for the future: but God keep me from giving judgment of death on <hi>any man,</hi> and of ruine to his innocent <hi>posteritie</hi> upon a <hi>Law</hi> made <hi>à posteriore.</hi>

            <p>Let the mark be set on the door where the <hi>Plague</hi> is, and then let him that will enter die.</p>
            <p>I know <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> there is in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament a double power of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> by <hi>Bill,</hi> a <hi>judiciall</hi> power, and a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative;</hi> the measure of the one is what's <hi>Legally just,</hi> of the other what's <hi>Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> and <hi>Politickly</hi> fit for the good and preservation of the whole.</p>
            <p>But these two (under favour) are not to be confounded in judgment, we must
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96309:11"/>
not proceed upon want of <hi>Legalitie</hi> with matter of <hi>conveniencie,</hi> nor the defailance of <hi>Prudentiall</hi> fitnesse, with a pretence of <hi>Legall justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To condemne my <hi>Lord of Strafford</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially as for <hi>Treason,</hi> my <hi>Conscience</hi> is not assured that the matter will beare it. And to do it by the <hi>Legislative</hi> power, my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> consultively cannot agree to that, since I am perswaded, neither the <hi>Lords</hi> nor the <hi>King</hi> will passe the <hi>Bill;</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our passing it will be a cause of great divisions and combustions in the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore my humble advice is, That laying aside this <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Attainder,</hi> we may think of another (saving onely Life) such as may secure the <hi>State</hi> from my <hi>Lord of Strafford,</hi> without indangering <hi>it</hi> as much by division concerning his <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> as he hath endangered it by his practizes.</p>

            <p>The danger being so great, the case so doubtfull, that I see the best Lawyers in <hi>Diametrall opposition</hi> concerning  it Let everyman wipe his heart, as hee does his eyes when he would judge of a <unclear>nice</unclear> and subtle object, the Eye if it be pretainted with any colour is <unclear>vitiated</unclear> in its discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:96309:12"/>Let every man purge his heart cleere of all passions, I know this great and wise body politike can have none; but I speake to <hi>Individuals,</hi> from the weaknesse which I find in my selfe: Away with all <hi>personall animosities;</hi> Away with all <hi>flatteries</hi> to the <hi>people</hi> in being the sharper against <hi>him,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is odious to <hi>them;</hi> away with all <hi>feares,</hi> lest by the sparing his blood <hi>they</hi> may be incenst; away with all such <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,</hi> as that it is not fit for a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that one accused by it of <hi>Treason,</hi> should scape with life.</p>

            <p>Of all these <hi>corruptives of judgement, Master Speaker,</hi> I doe before God discharge my selfe to the utmost of my power: and with a cleer conscience wash my hands of this mans blood, by this solemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, <hi>That my vote goes not to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Earle of</hi> Straffords <hi>life.</hi>
