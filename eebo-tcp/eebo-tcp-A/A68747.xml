         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

men to part with money, as to pull
out their eies and caſt them away, or
to cut of their handes and giue them

throw them awaie: Neuertheleſſe, I
cannot but wonder that men are ſo

warrant them not to looſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.</note> hee that hath the
ſubſtance of this world, and ſeeth his

God bee in him? This is a queſtion
which can hardly bee anſwered of a
great number: no it will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
of a number, nor regarded
of a number. And yet the Euangeliſt
hereby laieth open vnto all perſons,
that hee which hath wealth, ſeeing
his brother in want, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
him, he loſeth the loue of God;
which loue is ſo great as is the loue
of a naturall mother vnto her owne

child: nay more then that, it is a loue
ſo firmelie ſetled, that it is vnpoſſible
to be remooued.</p>
                  <p>There are many rich perſons,<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> that
thinke skorne to releeue the pore, of
whoſe hard dealing we haue a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the ſixteenth of Luke. The
rich man in his life time woulde not
releue <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but deſpiſed him; yea
he forgot God, and thought there
was no God (but his gold) that cold
in iuſtice puniſhe him for deſpiſing
the poore. <hi>Lazarus</hi> died for vvant,
and ſo did <hi>Diues</hi> for all his wealth;
who ſoone after, (being in hell) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<hi>Lazarus</hi> in heauen, triumphing
in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, while hee vvas
tormented in hell fire. This fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
skaldeth, skortcheth, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth;
of which, when the riche
man felt the ſmart, (though all too
late) he ſorrowed and repented, and
would faine haue ſent word thereof
vnto his friends: but he could haue
no meſſenger for al his lordly liuings


<pb facs="tcp:18090:4"/>
nor no releaſement of his torments,
for all his bagges of golde. Nowe to
whome would he haue ſent worde?
Forſooth to a number of his friends,
that indeed think ther is no God nor
deuill: no heauen nor hell, nor no
torments in hel fire after this life. But
I would aduiſe thoſe of that opinion
to doe as <hi>Thomas Didimus</hi> did by
Chriſts wounds, that ere hee would
beleeue, put in his hands &amp; felt. And
therefore to all ſuch I ſay, as will not
beleeue it, let them goe thither and
feele; then doubtleſſe they will find
it ſo, and ſay it is ſo. This example of
<hi>Diues</hi> may admoniſh ſuch hard hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
perſons to be mollified with the
teares of the poore: that they maie,
when <hi>Diues</hi> hath dined, let <hi>Lazarus</hi>
haue the crums.</p>
                  <p>We read in Mathewe,<note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> that vvhen
Chriſt commeth to iudgement, hee
will ſay to them on the left hand, go
from me ye curſed into helfire which
was prepared from the beginning:


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18090:4"/>
by which appeareth, that hell fire is
not onelie hot, but it is euerlaſting
hot, and neuer hath ende: Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hell-fire, &amp; the eternal torments
thereof, admoniſh you to bee merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the poore. To this alſo may
bee added, what hee will ſay to the
righteous, goe you into euerlaſting
ioyes whiche neuer ſhall haue
end: When I came among you as a

was naked you clothed me, &amp; when
I was hungrie, you fed and refreſhed

ſuch charitable actes of compaſſion:
yet not as the papiſt doth to account

to doe it in faith and true zeale
of a chriſtian life, for euerie tree that

not enough for vs onelie to bear fair

                  <p>Chriſt ſaith, it is a deed more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

of all things is ſhewed in their

                     <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Toby</hi> did. All people haue not
one bellie, for as one chimnie may
be hot, ſo another may be cold: One
pot moyſt with lickor, when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be drie; one purſe emptie,
when another is full. And one poore
mans belly full when an others is
emptie. That is a good common-wealth,
that looketh to euerie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the common-wealth: And
thoſe men worthie of riches, that
looketh daily to the feeding of their
poore neighbours. Let therfore the
teares of the poore admoniſh you to
charitie, that when <hi>Diues</hi> hathe
dined, <hi>Lazarus</hi> may haue the crums.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs proceed and conſider
what we muſt giue, and to whome
we muſt giue, in the text we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to giue though it be but a cup of
cold water, or a peece of bread: this
containeth matter both for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
and the giuer: Bread will ſerue
beggers, and they muſt be no choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers:
yet bread will not ſerue ſome


<pb facs="tcp:18090:8"/>
beggers that boldly on Gads hill,
Shooters hill, and ſuche places take
mens horſes by the heads, and bids
them deliuer their purſes, for theſe
fellowes are of the opinion of the
Anabaptiſts, that euerie mans goods
muſt be common to them, or elſe
they will force them to part it: but
theſe are ſawſie beggers, and ought
to haue almes at Tiburne: as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort of beggars, and other poore
perſons, they muſt be content to
take vp their croſſe, endeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
paciently to ſuffer their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
greeuances: and remember
that mans nature may bee ſatisfied
with a little.</p>
                  <p>As touching how much wee ſhall
giue, we are taught that if wee haue
much, we ſhould giue accordingly:
If we haue but little, giue what wee
can ſpare: S. Luke councelleth vs if
we haue two Coates, wee muſt giue
one to him that hath not: &amp; of meate
likewiſe: but as touching this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18090:8"/>
litle need to be ſpoken, when our
owne couetous heartes are readie
enough to frame excuſes.</p>
                  <p>Some will make a queſtion of
their almes and ſaie they know not
what the partie is that demaundeth
reliefe or beggeth almes of them: O
ſaith ſome I ſuſpect he is an idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
diſhoneſt, or perhaps an vnthrift
and therefore refuſeth to giue anie
reliefe at all. To this I anſwere they
are needleſſe doubtes, for we ought
to releeue them if wee knowe them
not for ſuch perſons: And let theyr
bad deedes fall on their own necks,
for if they periſh for want, we are in
danger of Gods wrath for them: but
to giue vnto ſuche as wee knowe of
lewd behauiour, thereby to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
them in their wickedneſſe, were
verie offenſiue: we are not ſtill tyed
to one place for giuing our charitie,
but it ſtretcheth far, for we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
not onely to releeue our
owne countrimen, but alſo ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18090:9"/>
and ſuch as dwell in forraigne
nations.</p>
                  <p>Againe, heere the giuer may learn
to giue freely, for the thing he giueth
is but bread or water: Bread is the
fruite of the earth, and for the earth
giues it vs, we may the better giue it
againe. But bread in this place ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
all thing neceſſarie: for the fare
and cheere in olde time was contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnder the title of bread, and all
maner of drinke vnder the title of
water: but in this as in all other
thinges the ſimplicitie of the olde
world is quite gone out, and newe
and corrupt thinges are lately crept
in. In the old time <hi>Iacob</hi> deſired hee
might haue bread in his iourney, but
now the caſe is altered, for wee muſt
haue ſundrie diſhes of contrarie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes,
framed for the taſte of the
mouth and pleaſantneſſe of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
which is vſed with great ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie,
and farre more coſt then
needeth: better now to fill the belly


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18090:9"/>
then the eye, although to content
the common multitude: the eye is
the onely thing which muſt be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Yet when you are in the midſt
of all your iollitie and coſtly fare, let
the teares of the poore admoniſhe
you to releeue them, that when
<hi>Diues</hi> hath dined, <hi>Lazarus</hi> may haue
the crummes.</p>
                  <p>The teares of men, women and
children are greeuous and pitifull:
and teares giue cauſe of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
eſpecially the teares of ſuch
as therewith are conſtrained to beg
for their reliefe: But if the teares of
the rich for the loſſe of their goods,
or the teares of parents for the death
of their children, or the tears of kind
natured perſons for the loſſe of fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
or other wronges ſuſtained, ought
generallie to be regarded and pitied;
Then much more ſhould the teares
of thoſe breede great compaſſion in

effects: (A thing aboue al extreams)
to a hungry bodie.</p>
                  <p>Euerie bitter thing is ſweete, and
euerie fowle thing ſeem cleane, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
made the apoſtles glad to eat the
eares of corne. <hi>Dauid</hi> glad to eat the
ſhewe bread. <hi>Lazarus</hi> deſirous to eat
crummes, and <hi>Elias</hi> content with
meale: In the deſtruction of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
it made the mother eate hir
owne childe, and in the waylinges
of <hi>Ieremie</hi> people eate their own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure:
It made people crie to <hi>Pharao</hi>
for bread: it made an aſſes head, and
the dung of Pigions to bee eaten in
<hi>Samaria,</hi> and others to ſwound and
lie dead in the ſtreets. The affliction
of hunger cauſed little teares, and
brought all theſe thinges to paſſe.


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18090:10"/>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith that <hi>God numbred all hys

worthy to be preſerued: But if euer
teares were worthie to be numbred;
the teares that are ſhedde for famine
howſoeuer men neglect to regard

                  <p>Teares are the laſt thing that man

where teares moue not, nothing wil

the lamentable teares, whiche the

are now adaies ſo full of doubts tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
a couetous deſire to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
that they cannot abide to
part with anie thing to the pore, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
he will not forget the worke and
loue which you haue ſhewed in his
name to the poore and diſtreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Some wil ſay for their excuſe, that
they are ouercharged by giuing to a
number of perſons: and therefore,
they cannot giue to ſo manie beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars:
for by ſo doing, he might ſone
become a beggar himſelfe. <hi>Dauid</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth
this obiection very well, and
ſaith thus; I neuer ſaw the iuſt man
forſaken, nor his ſeed beg his bread:
wherby he meant, that in all the time
that hee had liued, or that any man
liuing the yeares of <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſhal skarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſee, that vpon an vpright heart in


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18090:11"/>

beggerie.</p>
                  <p>The anſwere to this ordinarie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
or excuſe of worldlings; I ſay
in the defence &amp; behalfe of the pore.
There are a number that will denie a
poore bodie of a pennie, and pleade
pouertie to them, though they ſeeme
to ſtand in neuer ſo great extreames,
when in a far worier ſort they wil not
ſtick imediatlie to ſpend ten or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſhillinges. The riche worldling
makes no conſcience to haue ten or
twentie diſhes of meate at his table,
when in troth, the one halfe might
ſufficientlie ſatisfie nature: the reſt
run to the reliefe of the pore, and yet
in the end he might depart better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed
with one diſh, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he is vvith twentie. Some will not
ſticke to haue tvventy coats, tvventie
houſes, tvventie farmes, yea tvventy
Lordſhippes, and yet goe by a poore
perſon, vvhome they ſee in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
and neuer releeue them vvith


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18090:12"/>
one penny, but ſay God helpe you, I
haue not for you. There is Lawyers
vvill not ſticke to vndo tvventy pore
men, and Marchants that make it no
conſcience to eat out tvventie other
that haue the hundreths out at vſery,
their cheſts cramd full of crownes, &amp;
their cofers full of golden Gods, or
gliſtring Angels, that wil go by twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
poore, miſerable, hungrie, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and diſtreſſed perſons, and yet
not beſtow one peny on them: And
though they doe moſt ſhamefullie
aske it: yet can they moſt ſhameleſly
denie it, and refuſe to performe it.</p>
                  <p>The people of this world can very
eaſily find a ſtaffe to beat a dog, they
are neuer without excuſes, but readie
to finde delaies, and verie pregnant
to deuiſe nevv ſhifts to keepe in their
almes. Novv will I ſhew you reaſons
vvhy we ſhould giue. God ſaith, who
ſo giueth to the poore, lendeth vnto
the Lord, and ſhall be ſure to finde it
againe, and receiue for the ſame an


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18090:12"/>
hundreth folde. And againe, bleſſed
is he that conſidererh of the pore &amp;
needie: the Lord ſhall deliuer him in
the day of trouble. Heereby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that vve ſhall receiue our almes
againe, except vvee doubt whether
Gods vvorde be true or no. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
whereof, the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
ſaith: the teſtimonies of God are
true and righteous. And God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi>
ſaying: The word is gone out of
my mouth, and it ſhal not returne, the
promiſe which God made to <hi>Sara,</hi>
vvas found true: his promiſe made
to the children of Aegypt was found
true: his promiſe to <hi>Ioſua,</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertrhowing
of his enemies, was
found true. God promiſed <hi>Dauid</hi> his
kingdome, to <hi>Salomon</hi> hee promiſed
wiſedome, to <hi>Pharao</hi> deſtruction by
water, to <hi>Saule,</hi> the loſſe of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and to <hi>Salomon,</hi> the deuiding
of his kingdome: all which, and farre
more prooued true. Then let vs not


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18090:13"/>
doubt in Gods promiſes, for from
time to time they haue beene found
true and iuſt. Let vs conſider that we
muſt die and leaue our goods, vvee
know not to whome: then while we
are here, let vsdeſtribute thereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the pore, that we may receiue our
rewarde in the kingdome of heauen.
God ſaith by S. <hi>Luke:</hi> O foole, this
night will I fetch away thy ſoule, and
then, that which thou haſt got, vvho
ſhall poſſeſſe it? Heere is a queſtion
worth the noting, and meet for riche
men to conſider: eſpeciallie ſuch as
hoord vp wealth, &amp; haue no regarde
to the reliefe of the poore. Doe they
thinke, that the wealth which they
haue gathered together, will come to
good after their deceaſe: No, it will
melt and conſume away like butter
in the Sunne: The reaſon is, becauſe
they wold not do as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the diſtributing part
of that to the poore which was lent
them by the Lord.</p>

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:18090:13"/>
The children of God in the ſixt of
the Apocalips crie out: how long O
Lord, thou that art holy and true: do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou not iudge and reuenge our
bloud vpon thoſe that dwell on the
earth; whereby appeareth that God
exerciſeth good men, &amp; thoſe whom
hee loueth in the troubles of this

is their time but ſhort, although their

that doe truſt in God muſt bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
to releue one another for atime,
ſince after a ſhort time, we ſhal dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les

ſhort is mans life while we are in this

to a bubble, to winde, to graſſe,
to a ſhadow, to a ſmoake, and euerie

of a Tabernackle, and <hi>Iob</hi>
to an Eagles wing, or a Weauers ſhit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
ſo that our life is but ſhort, and

after a few daies, though you thinke
them manie: whatſoeuer you merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie

charge the rich with waſt, for vvhich
they ſhall ſurelie anſwere. Art thou
not (ſaith he) a robber in keeping an
other mans ſubſtance, and to reckon
it as thine owne. It is the breade of
the hungry which thou doeſt detain;
the coat dew to the naked, thou loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt

ſhould releeue the pore, lies cancke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

teacheth the liberalitie due vnto the
poore: ſo it blameth the careles rich,
that account all to be their owne, and
will part with nothing, keeping to
themſelues more then is ſufficient.
But to ſuch ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that at

                  <p>The right rich man that duelie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth

but by conſidering the poore
and needie: Whereof <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſayth


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18090:15"/>
thus: the rich are prooued by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie
of others: ſo that ſtill the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

but a neceſſitie: not at

and needie ſhalbe conſidered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.</p>
                  <p>Where is the large liberallity be
come, that in time paſt was rooted in
our forefathers, they were content
to be liberall, though they applied it
to euill purpoſes, the ſucceſſours of
thoſe which in time paſt gaue liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to maintain Abots, Friers, Monks,
Nunnes, Maſſes, Durges, Trentals,
and all idolatrie: ſeeing the abuſes
thereof, may now beſtow it to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vſe: namely, to foſter and feed the
pore members of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The worlde is as great as it hath
beene, the people now are more rich
then they haue beene, and more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
then they haue beene: yea,
they haue more knowledge then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18090:15"/>
they haue had to become liberall
and ſeeme therein moſt wilfull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
                  <p>The extorcioner can ſpare nought
vnto the poore, for ioyning houſe to

haue the poore mans curſe for it: the
Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, the extortioner
dooth no good to the poore, but dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſeeketh to roote them foorth of

vs forgette the patched of the

                  <p>Oh howe liberall vvere peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in times paſt to mainetaine ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition:
and nowe hovve harde
hearted are they growen to keepe
the poore from famine, will ye make
a skorne of the poore and needie:
The poore novve periſheeh by the
Riche menne, and noe manne
conſidereth it: This is not the
right duetie of faithfull Chriſtians:


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18090:16"/>
this ought not to be the fruits of our
profeſſion, nor this is not the mercy
which we learne by the word.</p>
                  <p>Therefore towardes the reliefe of
the pore I ſay, giue, and giue gladly:
for the bread that is giuen with a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hart, is called ſtony bread, though
neceſſarie to bee taken by the poore,
to ſlake hounger: yea, it is but ſower
bread: ſuch a giuer in mine opinion,
is next kinſeman vnto Sathan: for he
gaue Chriſt ſtoans in ſtead of bread:
but this man giueth chriſtians ſtonie
bread. The VViſeman ſaith, lay vppe
thy almes in the hands of the poore,
and know that in the end, what thou
keepeſt thou ſhalt loſe, but that thou
giueſt to the poore, ſhalbee as a purſe
about thy necke. For as this life wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
olde, and our daies paſse away, ſo
ſhal this vaine pelfe paſſe away from
vs, neither ſhall riches helpe in the
day of vengeance, but the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
abideth, which fretteth like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
Then what ſhall it profite to get


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18090:16"/>
all the worlde, and when the worlde
forſaketh vs, that ſhalbe moſt againſt
vs, that beſt we loued while we were
in the world. Let euerie man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
perſwade himſelfe, that his ſoul
is better then thoſe ſubtill riches: the
poſſeſſion wherof is variable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine:
for they paſſe from vs much
more ſwiftlye then they came to vs.
And albeit we haue the vſe of them,
euen till the laſt day, yet at length we
muſt leaue them to others. Then ere
you die, lay them forth for the profit
of your poore bretheren: learne to
forſake the couerous world, before it
forſake you, and learne counſaile of
our Sauior Chriſt, who aduiſeth you
to make friends of the wicked Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſee daily,<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> that euerie one is
good to the poore, (as we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſay) but they will giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nought
but wordes: then I ſay, great boaſt &amp;
ſmal roaſt makes vnſauerie mouthes:
yet if words will doe anie good, the


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18090:17"/>
poore ſhall not want them. For it
doth coſt nothing to ſay alaſſe good
ſoule, God helpe thee, God comfort
thee, I would I were able to helpe
thee: and ſuch commonlie will ſaie
ſo, that haue ſtore of wealth lying by
them. Such ſtill wiſh wel vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
in wiſhing themſelues able:
but of ſuch wiſhing, and for ſuch wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers,
I ſaye as a beggar ſaide to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
who made like anſwere, that if
ſuch wiſhes were worth but one half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penie
to the poore: I doubt, they

the deuill and all, and why? Becauſe
you would faine hatch the Cokatriſe

to liberalitie by ſundrie naturall
examples, the cloudes if they be full,
doe yeelde foorth their raine, much
raine is a burden to cloudes, &amp; much
riches are burthens to men. It is ſayd
of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the 13. of Gene is,
that he was burdened with gold: yet
<hi>Abraham</hi> was a good man, but it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
his head to be buſie vvith the
cares of golde. Againe, to eat much,
to drinke muche, and reſt much, is a
burthen to the ſoule, though it bee
pleaſant to the bodie. And in the 12.
of Luke it apeareth, that aboundance
of riches, maketh one to eate muche,
drinke much, and reſt much: then
were it not for the couetous mindes
of thoſe that haue much, they might
impart to the poore one part of that
which they duily ſpend in ſuperflity.
If this bee not amended, I let you to


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18090:18"/>
vnderſtand that the poore muſt crie,
and their voyce ſhall bee heard, their
diſtreſſe conſidered, &amp; our vengance
ſhalbe wrought I tell you troth, euen
in Ieſus Chriſt that the poore hath
cried vnto the Lorde, and hee hath
heard them. With ſpeed therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
your eares: if not to man, yet to
Chriſt, who continually commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs to giue and beſtow vpon the
poore and needie. Giue and it ſhall
be giuen you ſaith he by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and
ſetteth before our eies the example
of the poore widowes mites, as alſo
the example of a couetous rich man,
who demanding how hee might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
eternall life, was anſwered thus
by him, go ſell all thou haſt, and giue
to the poore, not that it is neceſſarie
for euerie man ſo to do, or that a man
cannot be ſaued without hee doe ſo:
but thereby teaching him perticuler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to lothe the worlde, and generallie
ſeeke meanes for the daily cheriſhing
and the refreſhing of the poore. Doe


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18090:18"/>
not continually feede your equals
for that is offenſiue: but when your
may ſpare to ſpend and banquet your
ſelues, then call the poore and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and refreſh your poore diſtreſſed
neighbors and brethren. And when
<hi>Diues</hi> hath dined, let <hi>Lazarus</hi> haue
the crummes. And ſtil remember the
ſaying of S. <hi>Matthew:</hi> Bleſſed are the
mercifull, for they ſhal obtain mercy.</p>
                  <p>To conclude (beloued in the
Lord) let me entreate you rich men
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider it is your dutie, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the poore and their continuall

you for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>If the proud would leaue their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie
in apparell, their exceſſe in
imbrodery, their vanitie in cuttes,
gardes and pownees, their exceſſe in
ſpangling their fantaſticall feathers
and needleſſe brauerie, the greater
part woulde ſuffice towardes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe

in belly cheere, then might the
poore be fed with that which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
either lothſomely vomites
forth, or worketh as an inſtrument to
ſhorten his owne life. Let the whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger
leaue off his dalliance, and
his inordinate expences for maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his wickedneſſe; and it ſhall
be good for his bodie, and better for
his ſoule, yea his purſe ſhall bee the

heauier, and he thereby better able
to relieue the poore.</p>
                  <p>Let euerie artificer and trades-man
liue orderly, auoyding ſuperfluous
expences, not ſpending his money
vainely at dice, tables, cardes, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

as becommeth ciuill chriſtians in the
feare of God: they may haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the maintainance of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
and their famelie, and yet the
poore may be by them ſufficiently
releeued.</p>
                  <p>Let vs conſider that we who haue
our beginning from God, ought ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to bend all our actions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes

wee helpe him, and doing all chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

                  <p>Let vs generally learn, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne

he ſaith; I am not aſhamed of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell

finde iuſt occaſion to thinke that the

do, but that they may knowe thoſe

haue the ouerſight of them in the

but alſo loue them for their good
workes ſake. Thus hauing finiſhed
the former circumſtances as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſly
as I promiſed: I proceed
to the next wordes, the whiche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in them, the ſecond part of a
chriſtian miniſters dutie, which is to
miniſter the ſacramentes rightly,
whereof one is ſet downe in his due
order by the inſtitutor Chriſt hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
when he ſaith, baptiſing them
in the name of the father, and the
ſonne, and the holy ghoſt. Nowe
becauſe the worde Baptiſme hathe
diuers ſignifications in the ſcripture:
I will heere ſet downe, as manie of
them as my memorie can recorde.
Firſt the worde Baptiſme according
to the true meaning of the Greeke
text: <hi>Baptiſma</hi> doth not ſignifie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
addicting, but ſuche a dipping in


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18090:29"/>
the water as doth cleanſe the partie
dipped, and for that the <hi>Primitiue</hi>
Churche did vſe to put the partie
baptiſed quite vnder the water. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Paule</hi> writing both to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi>
and <hi>Colloſsians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4.</note> vſeth theſe
wordes:<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2. 12.</note> wee are buried then with
him in baptiſme into hys death: that
like as Chriſt was raiſed vp from the
dead, by the glorie of the father:
So we alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe
of life: in the whiche wordes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſheweth what reſemblance
their baptiſme hath with Chriſt hys
death and reſurrection. Secondlie,
baptiſme is vſed for a bare waſhing,
in whiche ſenſe our Sauiour ſpake,
when hee ſaide to the <hi>Phariſies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Marke 7. 8.</note> you
lay apart the commaundementes of
God and obſerue the traditions of
men, as the waſhing of pottes and
cuppes and manie ſuche thinges yee
doe, and in the ſame ſenſe wee read
in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> when
the authour ſaith that the olde Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18090:29"/>
conſiſted of manie waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
and ceremoniall rightes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the daie of reformation came.
Thirdly, by baptiſme wee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
affliction, as our Sauiour
Chriſt did, in ſaying to <hi>Iames</hi> and
<hi>Iohn</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Sebedeus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Marke 9. 38.</note> can you
be baptiſed with that baptiſme wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I muſt bee baptiſed, and to
hys Diſciples, I muſt bee baptiſed
with a baptiſme: but howe am I
payned vntill I bee ended.<note place="margin">Luke 12, 50</note> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
baptiſme is a liberall diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the graces of GOD as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in theſe wordes. <hi>Iohn</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
with water,<note place="margin">Actes 1. 5.</note> but you ſhall be
baptiſed with the holy Ghoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
theſe fewe dayes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the worde baptiſme is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for doctrine onely, as in that
place wherein the holie Ghoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
occaſion to ſpeake of <hi>Apollo</hi> a
<hi>Iewe</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſayth that hee
was mightie in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Actes 18. 42</note> and
did knowe but the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi>


                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:18090:30"/>
only. And laſt of al Baptiſme is taken
for a reuerent order of miniſtring
that Sacrament in the Churche, and
the whole ſanctification of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
baptiſed as in the wordes of this
preſent part of Scripture, baptiſing
them. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeake of the Sacrament
it ſelfe. It hath beene vſuall with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God from time to time
to confirme hys couenauntes with
ſeales ſet to the ſame: for example
wee ſee, that there is a Rainbowe in
the cloudes; the reaſon whereof is,
that GOD hauing in his iuſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
the olde worlde for ſinne:
(onely <hi>Noah</hi> and his famelie being
excepted) the ſame GOD in hys
mercie made a couenant with <hi>Noah,</hi>
that hee would neuer deſtroy it ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
for confirmation thereof: hee
ſet the Raynbow in the Clowdes as
a ſeale to that couenant betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and <hi>Noah;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Geneſ. 9. 13. 14.</note> So was circumciſion
giuen to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a ſeale of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18090:30"/>
in that promiſe, that in
his ſeede,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 10. 11.</note> all the nations of the earth
ſhould be bleſſed: So that as manie
as were circumciſed, were within
the compaſſe of that couenaunt, in
ſtead whereof, wee haue baptiſme,
the whiche whoſoeuer ſhall refuſe:
wee accompt him, as cut off from
Gods Church.<note place="margin">Marke 10.</note> Chriſt Ieſus gaue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſicle
grace, by viſible laying hys
handes vppon children and other
ſicke people:<note place="margin">Iohn 20. 22.</note> So hee gaue the gift
of his holy ſpirite vnto his Diſciples:
when hauing breathed vppon them,
he ſayd: receiue you the holy ghoſt.
The Sscramentes were ordayned
in the church of God for 3. vſes: firſt
that we ſhould acknowledge al thoſe
to be our fellows ſeruants, whom we
ſee to haue put on the ſame liuerie
with our ſelues, and in this ſenſe ſaid
the Apoſtle <hi>Paule:</hi> all thoſe that are
baptized into Chriſte,<note place="margin">Galat. 27. 3.</note> haue put on
Chriſt. Secondly, the Sacramentes
do put a manifeſt difference betwixt


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18090:31"/>
the true church and the falſe,<note place="margin">Actes 2. 39.</note> as <hi>Peter</hi>
hath taught vs, in ſaying repent, and
be baptized euerie one of you in the
name of Ieſus Chriſt, for to vſe the
promiſe made vnto your children, &amp;
all that are yet farre off, euen ſo many
as God ſhall call: and our Sauiour
ſaith, to ſuch belongeth the kingdom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
God: that is, to ſuch as lead an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
life.<note place="margin">Mark 10. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third vſe of the Sacraments,
is to ſeale vp in the hearts of the elect
all thoſe promiſes which GOD hath
made vnto them in Ieſus Chriſt his
Son, and their Sauiour: in the which
ſenſe <hi>Paule</hi> ſpake, when hee ſaid, that
<hi>Abraham</hi> receiued the ſign of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,<note place="margin">Rom, 4. 11.</note>
as a ſeale of that righteouſnes
which he had by faith, and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſame ſenſe our Sauiour ſaith, hee
that beleeueth and is baptized ſhall
be ſaued.<note place="margin">Marke 16. 16.</note> But it is to bee conſidered,
that the Inſtitutor ſetteth downe the
form of adminiſtring the ſacraments,
when he ſaith, baptizing them in the


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18090:31"/>
name of the father, of the ſonne, and
of the holie Ghoſt. Hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to baptize in the name of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and of the ſon, becauſe the holie
Ghoſt proceedeth from the father &amp;
the ſonne, and in the name of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghoſt: for except a man be borne
of water and the ſpirite,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 5.</note> he cannot ſee
the kingdom of God. When our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>or
offered to waſh <hi>Peters</hi> feet, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
it to be a nedles work,<note place="margin">Iohn 13. &amp;c.</note> for thou
ſhalt neuer waſh my feet ſaid he: but
when Chriſt aunſwered, that ſuch as
are not waſhed by him, haue no part
with him: that is, neither part of his
ſpirite, nor of his kingdom. <hi>Peter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
himſelfe better, would not
haue his feet onlie, but alſo his hands
aud head waſhed: howbeit it is not
neceſſarie to waſhe any more then is
vncleane: as <hi>Peters</hi> feet defiled vvith
dirt and mire, ſo our ſoules ſpotted
with ſins, muſt be cleanſed by Chriſt
his bloud onely. And after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it is neceſſarie, that euerie one of


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18090:32"/>
vs ſhould be waſhed: wherof the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
putting of water vpon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
baptized, is a liuelie figure. <hi>Iohn
Baptiſt</hi> was ſanctified in his mothers
wombe, as the Angell had foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">Luke 1. 15.</note>
But when our Sauiour Chriſt
came to him to be baptized,<note place="margin">Math. 3. 13</note> 
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> put
him backe, and ſaid: I haue neede to
bee baptized of thee, and commeſt
thou to me?<note place="margin">Pſalme 51. 5</note> That kingly prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
was a man after gods own heart,
yet he ſaith of himſelfe: I was borne
in iniquitie, and in ſin hath my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceiued mee. <hi>Iob</hi> was called
by God himſelfe a iuſt and vpright
man,<note place="margin">Iob 1. 8. &amp;c.</note> fearing God, and eſchewing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill:
whoſe peere was not found vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the face of the earth: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this, he ſaith of himſelfe:
who can bring a cleane thing out of
filthines?<note place="margin">Iob. 14 4.</note> the which queſtion is all
one with <hi>Paules</hi> affirmation, who ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
ſuch as the roote is, ſuch are the
braunches,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 16.</note> as if hee had ſaid with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
the father of vs all was vndefiled


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18090:32"/>
then are wee his ſons cleane alſo. But
if he were once dead in ſinne, beeing
our roote, then howe could wee his
imps haue life of our ſelues. All this
was ſpoken of originall ſinne; as for
actuall ſins, namely, thoſe ſins which
we continuallie commit, they are as
palpable as the darknes of Aegipt, the
which as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, was ſo groſſe,
that it might be felt:<note place="margin">Exo. 10. 21 22.</note> in ſo much, that
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, when God looked down
from heauen vppon the children of
men,<note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 2. 3.</note> (that is) when hee conſidered
mans conuerſation: they were all ſo
farre gone out of the way, that there
was none that did good, in ſo much
that the prophet repeateth it with an
<hi>Emphaſis,</hi> and ſaith, no not one. And
the man of God <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaith: when
God beheld the boldnes of the olde
world in ſinning,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5. 6.</note> it repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him that
he had made man: that is, he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that man whome he had made to
liue well, ſhould liue ſo ill. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
ſinne of Sodome brought fire


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18090:33"/>
and brimſtone from heauen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
them in the ſame.<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> feeling
the burthen of his ſinnes, began to
ſincke vnder them:<note place="margin">Pſalm 38. 4.</note> for (ſaith he) my
ſins are gone ouer my head, and are
like a ſore burthen, too heauy for me
to beare. <hi>Paule</hi> hauing by the vertue
of the law,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> learned his ſinnes, (for he
had not knowen ſin, except the lawe
had ſaid, thou ſhalt not ſinne) fell to
lamenting of them thus. O wretched
man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me
from this bodie of death: where it is
to be noted, that he calleth his bodie
a bodie of death, in reſpect of ſinne,
which giueth power to death ouer
our bodies.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 56.</note> And to conclude, of ſuch
force is ſinne in vs, that if the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of God had not ſo praeordained,
that the vnbeleeuing husband is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by the beleeuing wife, and the
vnbeleeuing wife, by the beleeuing
husband,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 14.</note> our children ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

                  <p>Againe, beeing waſhed or bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18090:33"/>
in the name of the father, ſonne,
and holie Ghoſt: wee are aduertiſed,
that wee muſt giue godlie, chriſtian,
and holy names vnto our children in
in token of their ſacred profeſſion,
for holie is he that hath called vs, and
that we may be the more forward ſo
to doe. It will be worth our labour to
conſider of a few examples, tending
to the ſame purpoſe,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 62. 63.</note> as of <hi>Zachary</hi> the
father of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who being
dum when that his ſon was born, his
friends made ſignes vnto him, howe
he would haue him called, and aske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for writing tables, writte, ſaying
his name is <hi>Iohn:</hi> the which vvorde
<hi>Iohn</hi> is as much as (to ſay) Grace: and
thus was <hi>Zacharie</hi> commaunded by
the Angell to name him.<note place="margin">Luke 1. 13.</note> The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
accordeth plentifull examples of
thoſe that haue giuen names to their
children, affoordeth to ſuche occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as haue been offered in the time
of their trauell: As when <hi>Raell</hi> went
with her husband <hi>Iacob</hi> toward <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thell</hi>


                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:18090:34"/>
to builde an aultar vnto God:
She trauailed in child-birth, and in

ſhee called his name <hi>Benony:</hi>
that is, the ſonne of her ſorrowe; but
his father <hi>Iacob</hi> called him <hi>Benony;</hi>
that is the ſonne of his right hand. So
<hi>Leah</hi> hauing born to <hi>Iacob</hi> foure ſons
ſhe ſaid, now will I prayſe God, &amp;c.
And that ſhee might the better beare

that if he once began with him;<note place="margin">1. Sam. 3. 11. 12. 13. 14. &amp;c.</note>
he would make an end with him: ſo
that as the Prophet ſaith: children

from whom euerie good and perfect
gift doth proceede: yet in reſpect of

that they ſhall finde no ſuch croſſe or

                  <p>It is true that the verie godlieſt
men and women, haue rather deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
ſonnes then daughters at the
handes of God, but they did it for
good and godly purpoſes: As when
<hi>Abraham</hi> deſired a ſonne to the end
that <hi>Eliezer</hi> the ſteward of his houſe
being a ſtranger,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 15, 2.</note> Namely a man of

partly ioying that ſo ſage a woman as

but moſt plainly appeareth his
great deſire of godly gouernment in
that heartie praier which hee vttered
vnto almightie God, (when he ſaid)

and a wiſe hart,<note place="margin">3. king. 3.</note> to iudge
thy people, that I may diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

it is plaine, that although hee was a

of <hi>Moſes,</hi> came out of the land of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
to ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> being at the mount
of God, which was mount Sinai, and
beheld how the people flocked vnto
<hi>Moſes</hi> their magiſtrate for iudgement
&amp; iuſtice, by due conſideration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<hi>Iethro</hi> found theſe three in conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences:
Firſt, that <hi>Moſes</hi> wearied
himſelfe with ſitting in iudgement
from the morning vntill night. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that he was too tedious vnto
the people which attended vppon
him in all that time. And thirdly, that
notwithſtanding his carefulneſſe in
iudgement, and their earneſt expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of iuſtice, hee was not able to
diſpatche ſo manye matters as vvas
brought before him: but with a light
hearing, and a little regarding of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
mens cauſes. Wherefore, <hi>Iethro</hi>


                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:18090:39"/>
beeing a man verie deſirous that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
might proceede, that no mans
matter ſhould ſleightlie be ſlipt ouer,
counſaileth <hi>Moſes</hi> to make more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
in Iſrael, and to the end that
this might be perfourmed the better,
<hi>Iethro</hi> dooth point at the diſpoſition
of thoſe men which ſhould bear rule,
for (ſaith he) thou ſhalt chooſe out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
all the people, men of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
dealing trulie, fearing God, and
hating couetouſnes, and them ſhalt
thou make gouernours ouer the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>By this you may perceiue, how <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro</hi>
in counſailing, and <hi>Moſes</hi> in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing,
did both aime at iuſtice and
true iudgement. For it is not a meane
matter, or light labour, for men of
yeeres to ſit from morning to night
in iudgement: no, their yeares, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
&amp; conſequentlie their bodies
imbeſilitie cannot eaſilie endure it,
beſides the care of common cauſes
heard at home, and that which is the


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18090:39"/>
biggeſt burden of all, the continuall
good of the Common-weale, which
they meditate carefullie, when vvee
ſleepe ſecurely is not to be forgotten,
but herin are many Magiſtrats great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be blamed, in that they cauſe the
people to attend vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vntil night, with expenſes great
and continuall, whileſt they find no
end of poore mens matters, becauſe

                  <p>Are their mindes ſet vpon righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
which deale thus? No, no:
they are the ſame that the Prophete
ſpake of,<note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 12.</note> when he ſaid, the vngodlie
ſeeketh occaſion againſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and knaſheth vpon him with his
teeth, for the crafty counſeller taketh
occaſion to hinder his Cliants iuſt
cauſe, that he might ſtill feede vppon
the poore mans purſe: the Lawyer,
who careth not to deale vnfaithfully
is like the chriſtall glaſſe, which flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringly
ſheweth vnto euerie man a


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18090:40"/>
faire face, how iuill fauoured ſo euer
he be. So can he perſwade the ſimple
ſwain, that his cauſe wil bear a ſtrong
action, bee it neuer ſo weake. Oh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what God ſaid vnto Iſraell,
you ſhall not do what ſeemeth good
in your owne eies,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note> but what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you: Then know, that you do
not that which he hath commanded
becauſe you deale not with mercie
and truth, for if euer the time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.</note>
and occaſion was offered to
mooue that queſtion to Magiſtrates,
which <hi>Dauid</hi> did in his daies: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,<note place="margin">Pſal. 82. 2.</note>
how long they will proceede to
giue vniuſt iudgement, and to accept
the perſon of the vngodlie. Nowe is
the time and occaſion preſent, for I
doe not doubt, but it is too true, that
the Prophet hath ſpoken; who ſaith,
that the vngodlie are more ſet by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the righteous;<note place="margin">Abac. 1.</note> and this is the cauſe
that wrong iudgement dooth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
How can iuſtice ſit, when there
is no ſeat appointed for her, you may


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18090:40"/>
be ſure ſhe vvill not haue to do with
the ſtoole of wickednes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.</note> where miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
ſtandeth in ſtead of iuſtice. It
was a woorthie commendation that
<hi>Dauid</hi> vttered in the praiſe of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 122. 3.</note>
when hee ſaid; there is the ſeate
for iudgment, the which appointing
of that ſeat for iudgement, was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that they loued iuſtice: and
firſt the place vvherein it vvas ſet, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth
vs heereof, for it was ſet in the
gate, vvher through men might haue
paſſage to and from the iudgement
ſeat. Secondly, the maner of framing
that ſeat in the gate: namely, that the
Iudges of force muſt ſit with their
faces towards the riſing of the ſunne,
in token that their iudgement ſhuld
bee as pure from corruption, as the
ſun vvas cleare in his chiefeſt bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Oh happie houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
vvhoſe ſeat vvas ſet ſo conueniently,
vvhoſe cauſes vvere heard ſo careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and matters iudged ſo iuſtlie. The
Iſraelites thought themſelues well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid,


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18090:41"/>
vvhen they had the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Debora</hi> that vertuous VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note place="margin">Iudg. 5. 8.</note>
for all vvas laied a bed, vntill ſhe
came vppe a mother in Iſraell; and as
ſhee was a good gouerneſſe in her
time, ſo ſhee loued thoſe that
were like vnto her ſelfe: for ſaieth
ſhee, my heart is ſet vpon the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Iſraell. <hi>Dauid</hi> was a good
King vvhile he liued,<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.</note> as it did appeare
by the teſtimonie of God himſelfe,
who ſaid of him, I haue found <hi>Dauid</hi>
my ſeruant, with my holie oyle haue
I annointed him. Secondly, by his
appealing to God for iudgement in
this caſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 26. 1.</note> when he ſaith, be thou my
iudge O Lord, for I haue walked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, by that good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
which hee gaue vpon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedde
vnto <hi>Salomon</hi> his Sonne, who
was to ſucceed him in that kingdom,<note place="margin">3. king. 2. 3.</note>
for (ſaith he) thou ſhalt proſper and
come to great honor, if thou keepeſt
the commandements which GOD


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18090:41"/>
commanded <hi>Moſes,</hi> when <hi>Phillip</hi> the
King of Macedonia, did caſt of the
earneſt ſute of a poore widowe, with
this ſlender anſwere; go thy way, for
I haue no leaſure to heare thee now.
She replied thus, and why haſt thou
leaſure to be a King: as if ſhee ſhould
haue ſaid, God hath giuen thee time
to raigne, and power to gouern, that
thou mighteſt applie them both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that end wherefore they are giuen
thee:<note place="margin">Prou. 20.</note> for mercie and truth preſerueth
a King, and with louing kindnes his
ſeat is vpholden. When <hi>Salomon</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to God for an vnderſtanding hart
that he might do iuſtice among gods
people: it is ſaid, that his praier plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God paſſing well, becauſe <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
asked wiſedoome rather then
wealth,<note place="margin">3. King. 3.</note> and knowledge rather then
honor: for thereby he gaue euidence
that his heart was ſet vpon righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
for out of the aboundaunce of
the heart the mouth ſpeaketh. It is a
moſt excellent praier which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18090:42"/>
maketh, when he ſaith; giue thy
iudgement vnto the King,<note place="margin">Pſal. 72. 1.</note> O Lorde,
and thy righteouſnes vnto the kings
ſonne, &amp;c. then ſhall hee iudge the
people according vnto right, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the poore, wherein the Prophet
praied for himſelfe, while he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the kingdome of Iſraell, and for
his ſucceſſors in the ſame, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
vnto that promiſe ſpoken of in
the 132. Pſalme:<note place="margin">Verſe 9.</note> the Lord hath made
a faithfull oath vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and hee
will not ſhrincke from it, ſaying: of
the fruit of thy bodie ſhall I ſet vpon
thy ſeat: if thy children keepe may te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
which I ſhall learne them.
And the Prophet proceedeth to ſay,
then ſhall he iudge the people accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto right, and defend the pore,
by the word (then) hee inſinuateth,
that when God giueth grace to the
Magiſtrate; then hee cannot chooſe
but do right, and defend thoſe which
doe ſuſtaine wrong. But when the
Prophet ſaith, (and defend the pore)


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18090:42"/>
Some man would thinke that he had
ſaide enough before, and therefore
might haue cut of this ſpeach, but it
is to be remembred, that as ſick men
nedeth not the Phiſition, or the way
fairing man his weapon at one time
onelie, but as often as the patient is
ſicke, ſo often hee muſt haue the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
counſaile, and as often as the
traueiler is aſſaulted, ſo often hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his weapon. In like ſort the pore
man oppreſſed often, doth as often
neede the defence of the Magiſtrate:
And therefore, hath the Magiſtrate
the ſword is alwaies caried before him,
&amp; this ſword is alwaies caried before
rather the behind the Magiſtrat, that
he might rather reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber iuſtice, then
caſt the care thereof behind his back,
the laſt, but not the leaſt thing to bee
marked of the Magiſtrate is; that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
is ſet foorth with a paire of bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launces
in the one hand, whiche ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth
him to waie thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
iuſtlie which are brought before


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18090:43"/>
him: And within the other hand a
two edged ſword,<note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 15</note> to the intent that
iuſtice might returne to iudgement,
(that is) that thinges iuſtlye iudged,
might bee rightly rewarded on both
ſides:<note place="margin">3. king. 3.</note> whereof King <hi>Salomon</hi> hath
giuen a good preſident. Firſt, in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out the true mother of the ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
childe, which is a point of
iudgement. Secondlie, in reſtoring
the liuing childe to his owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whiche was a point of iuſtice.
And theſe partes of a Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
duetie are ſo neceſſarilie
lincked togeather, that ſo often as
one of them is wanting, the lavv re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
a maime at the hand of the
Magiſtrate.<note place="margin">Iohn 19.</note> As when <hi>Pilate</hi> iudged
Chriſt guiltleſſe,<note place="margin">Act. 24</note> but yet put him to
death: and when <hi>Paules</hi> cauſe was
heard and approoued, yet hee was
left in priſon: Therefore, it is good
counſaile, and worthie to bee hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
vnto, which <hi>Dauid</hi> gaue vnto
all Kings and Magiſtrates, that they


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18090:43"/>
bee learned and wiſe: for if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
be not wiſe,<note place="margin">Pſal 2. 10.</note> (words) may ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the matter away. As when <hi>Daniel</hi>
when he was accuſed of diſpiſing the
decree of <hi>Nabucadnezer</hi> the King of
Babilon,<note place="margin">Bel and Dragon.</note> 
                     <hi>Ieremie</hi> to bee an enemie to

                     <hi>Elias</hi>
to bee a troubler of the ſtate,<note place="margin">3. king. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Paule</hi> to

                     <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boath</hi>
to haue blaſphemed God and
king <hi>Ahab:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. king. 21.</note> and as at the importunate
crye of the Iewes, Chriſt was put to
death,<note place="margin">Luke 23.</note> and <hi>Barrabas</hi> the murtherer ſet
at libertie. The ſpeciall wiſedome of
God,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note> matched <hi>Moſes</hi> the Magiſtrat,
with <hi>Aron</hi> the miniſter, thereby gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vs to vnderſtand, that when the
word &amp; the ſword go together, there
can be none other but good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
As for example, ſo long as the
good prieſt <hi>Iehoiba,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4. king. 12.</note> &amp; the godly king
<hi>Ioas</hi> liued together, God was worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and his people guided according
vnto his word: for the man of God
counſailed vertuouſly, and the King


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18090:44"/>
practiſed carefully: whereunto that
ſaying of <hi>Solon</hi> doth verie well agree,
who being asked when the common
wealth did beſt floriſh: he anſwered,
when the people obey the magiſtrat,
and the magiſtrate obeyeth the law:
for lawes are better vnmade then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kept;
no doubt there want not ſuch,
as wilſay with thoſe head ſtrong peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Dauids</hi> daies:<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 3.</note> let vs break their
bonds in ſunder, and caſt away their
coardes from vs, and our lawes haue
bene a long time like to ſpiders webs,
ſo that the great buzzing bees break
through, &amp; the little feeble flies hang
faſt in them.</p>
                  <p>But admitte that you replye and
ſaye, they are made ſtronger, then
in the daies of our forefathers, yet are
they like vnto walled Citties in the
time of warre, at the which time, bee
your walkes neuer ſo ſtrong, they are
beaten downe: if they want men and
munition, ſo if your lawes wiſelie
made, doe want Patrones to defend


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18090:44"/>
them, they will ſoone be little worth,
therefore it was not the worſt vvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that <hi>Iethro</hi> gaue to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 18.</note> that he
ſhould make ſuch magiſtrats as were
men of courage: For as <hi>Criſippus</hi> ſayd
ſomtimes, ſo it is true at all times, that
if a magiſtrate ruleth amiſſe, hee ſhall
procure the diſpleaſure of God, (if
well) hee ſhall be hated of men, and

things: 1. that himſelfe is but a man.
2. that he gouerneth men like to him

taught, when he ſpake thus in the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon
of GOD: I ſaid you are Gods,
but you ſhal die like men, and fall like
one of the Princes: and yet ſhall they
not be ſo excuſed, but muſt alſo giue
accomptes of their gouernment, as
did that Steward: mentioned by S.
<hi>Luke.</hi> It is good therefore, not onely
for thoſe men that haue the election
of Magiſtrats, to make ſuch choiſe of
officers as <hi>Iethro</hi> inioyneth <hi>Moſes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 82. 6.</note>
and as God himſelfe commaunded
Iſrael, when hee ſaid, you ſhall make
him king, whome the Lord our God
ſhall chuſe: but alſo verie meete for
thoſe magiſtrates being ſo elected,
to haue a care, that as they are in place


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18090:45"/>
aboue other men: ſo in good life
they go before the people: for this
was it, that the Iſraelites deſired God
to graunt vnto <hi>Ioſua</hi> beeing newly

if thou doeſt euill, then feare, for hee
beareth not the ſworde for naught,
but is the miniſter of GOD to take

where it is to be remembred, that the

                  <p>Therefore this is the beſt thought
in euerie action for a man to thinke,
What Chriſt would doe, which was
made not onely redemption and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation

example to guide vs. Therefore hee
ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30.</note>

manie ſeeme to weare this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

they were the men which were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

but they ſhall enter into Heauen?
Yet Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I know you not,</hi> there

depart from mee: So hee put them
off, becauſe they had not put him
on: For though they had ſeene his
perſon, and hearde of his vertues,
yet they had not faith to applie his
mercies, his merites, his death, and
his righteouſneſſe vnto them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which no man can put on Chriſt
nor weare him. Faith is the hande
which putteth him on. Faith taketh
firſt his righteouſnes, &amp; couereth her
vnrighteouſnes, then ſhee taketh his
obedience, &amp; couereth her diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
then ſhe taketh his patience, &amp;

her diffidence: then ſhee taketh
his humilitie, &amp; couereth her pride:
then ſhee taketh his loue, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
her rancour. And ſo taketh one
roabe after another, aud tricketh her
ſelfe vntill ſhee haue put on Ieſus
Chriſt: that is, vntill ſhee appeare in
the ſight of God, like Ieſus Chriſte,
cloathed with his merits and graces:
that God hath no power to be angry
with her, becauſe ſhee commeth ſo
like his Son. This is to put on Ieſus
Chriſt, as you ſhall ſee more liuelie,
vvhen you haue taken a vievv of the

whom the world, the fleſh, &amp;

renued till we reſemble Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
This is the Apoſtles meaning,
to put on Chriſt, as it is vnfolded in
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12.<note place="margin">Col 3. 12.</note> Where he bringes forth all
the robes of Chriſt, &amp; ſortes them, &amp;
ſaith, put on mercie, put on meeknes,
put on humility,<note place="margin">verſe 20.</note> put on patience, put
on loue, all which before hee called
(the newe man) ſo that to put on
Chriſt, is to put on the new man with
all his vertues, vntil wee be renued to
the Image of Chriſt, which is like a
new man amongſt men. They which
labor to be righteous, and yet beleue
that Chriſts righteouſneſſe ſhall ſaue
them, haue put on Chriſt as <hi>Paule</hi>
would haue them. We are not taught
to put on Angels, nor ſaintes, nor the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
our ſins with their righteouſnes,
as the Papiſts do, but we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to put on Chriſt, and couer our

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18090:60"/>
hath one garment. Euerie clout will
couer our ſores, but the fineſt ſilke
will not couer our ſinnes. Therefore
when we ſeeme braue to others, wee
ſeeme foule to God, becauſe his eie
is vpon our ſinnes, which lie naked,
when all the reſt is couered, vntil we
put on Chriſt, &amp; then wee heare that
voice, <hi>Thy ſinnes are couered.</hi> And then
wee haue that bleſſing:<note place="margin">Math. 9. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed is the
man, whoſe ſinne is couered.</hi> So wee are
cloathed and bleſſed togither.<note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 1.</note> Yet
this garment is out of requeſt, too
rough for ſome, too graue for others,
too baſe for others. And therefore
in ſteade of putting on Chriſt, they
put him off, in ſtead of welcomming
him,<note place="margin">Luke. 1. 37.</note> they diſcharge him, like the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that they may keepe their

Theſe are like the fooliſh ſouldiours
which ſhould haue made chriſt their

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18090:60"/>
ſpoiled them. So do the papiſts deale
with this garment, they ſay it is not
fit for them, &amp; therefore they breake
it and mangle it, and peece it with
rags of their owne inuentions: they
ſay it is too light, &amp; notable to beare
off the ſtormes of death, and heate of
hell, and therefore choſe rather to
make themſelues garmentes of their
merites, and their Maſſes, and their
penance, and their pardons, and their
pilgrimages:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 7. and 31.</note> like <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eue,</hi> which

muſt bee our Garment,
or els wee ſhall bee aſhamed when
our righteouſneſſe doth not reache
to couer our nakedneſſe, but ſtill
ſome part will peepe bare vntill hee
caſt his righteouſneſſe vppon it, and


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18090:61"/>
then all is couered.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 40.</note> As Dauid nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no other armor againſt the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
then a Sling: ſo we neede no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
garment againſt ſin then Chriſt.
There wanteth nothing but this, to
put it on.</p>
                  <p>Nowe let vs ſee howe to put this
Garment on. Many fumble about it,
like children which had need of one
to put on their clothes. Some put on
Chriſt as a cloake, whiche hangeth
vpon their ſhoulders, and couereth
them when they go abroad to bee
ſeene of men: they can caſt on the
cloake of holineſſe, and ſeeme for a
while as holy as the beſt, but ſo ſoon
as they come home, the cloke goeth
of, and the man is as he was, whoſe
vizard was better then his face. Thus
Hypocrites put on chriſt, as manie
retaine vnto noble men, not to doe
them anie ſeruice, but to haue their
countenaunce. Many put on chriſt
like a hat, which goeth off to euerie
one whiche meetes them: ſo euerie


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18090:62"/>
temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which meets them, makes
them forget what they heard, what
they promiſed, what they reſolued,
and change their waie, as though
they had not repented at all. So the
common people like your ſelues put
on Chriſt, they are zealous, ſo long
as they are in the Church, and beare
their breſtes, and caſt vp their eyes,
like the Publican, when they heare a
ſentence whiche mooues them,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 11.</note> as
though they woulde doe no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that ſaying while they liue.
But the next buſineſſe putteth all out
of mind, till they come to the church
again. Some put on chriſt as a gloue,
which couereth but the hand, ſo they
put on the face of Chriſt, or the tong
of Chriſt, but their hands worke, and
their feete walke, as they did before:
So manie profeſſors of Religion put
on Chriſt, whiche call but for diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
&amp; reformation, that they might
get a name of zeale and ſinceritie, to
couer ſome fault, which they would


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18090:62"/>
not be ſuſpected of. Thus euerie man
woulde couer himſelfe with Chriſt,
but they haue not the skill, or they
haue not the will to put him on.
What will you doe then? Though
the garment be neuer ſo good, yet
it is not good to them that doe not
weare it. For what profite haue we of
the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which we do not weare?
they neither keepe vs from heate
nor colde. Therefore Paule doth
not bring you a garment to laie by
you for the mothes, but hee biddes
you put it on. Heere is the cunning
nowe in putting it on. If Paule had
taught vs this, then you would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vnto him. Well, you ſhall heare
what Paule ſaith to the putting of it
on. Firſt (ſaith Paule) you muſt <hi>caſt
away the workes of darkeneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>and then
put on the armour of light.</hi> Firſt you
muſt put off, and then put on: As the
Eagles feathers will not lie with anie
other feathers, but conſume them,
which lie with them: So the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18090:63"/>
Garment will not weare with
filthy garmentes, but ſcornes like the
Arke, that Dagon ſhould ſtand by it.
If any man may not weare womens
apparell for lightneſſe,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5. 8</note> may he weare
the deuils apparell, and cloth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with pride,<note place="margin">Deut. 22. 5.</note> with couetouſneſſe,
with enuy, with hypocriſie, with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe,
and when hee is like the
deuil ſit at Gods table?<note place="margin">Math. 2. 21.</note> No man (ſaith
chriſt, patcheth a newe peece to an
old Garment, and wilt thou patch an
old peece to a new Garment: God
forbad the people to weare linſey
wolſey,<note place="margin">Leui. 19. 19.</note> becauſe it was a ſigne of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie,
but this is inconſtancie it
ſelfe. He doth not put on chriſt, but
putteth off chriſt,<note place="margin">Iob. 19. 23.</note> and putteth on
Beliall,<note place="margin">Reu. 3. 15.</note> whiche faſhions himſelfe to
God, and the world too. As Chriſts
coate was without ſeame, ſo they
muſt be without ſtaine that weare it.
For when a man putteth on faire
clothes, hee maketh himſelfe fayre
too, and auoideth euery foule thing,


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18090:63"/>
leaſt it ſhoulde foule his clothes: So
muſt he which putteth on Chriſt: for
the fineſt garment is ſooneſt ſtained.
Therefore when thou haſt put on
this Garment, thou muſt waſhe thy
ſelfe, and picke thy way, and chooſe
thy workes, and handle nothing
that is foule for marring thy clothes,
that is, thou muſt not thinke as
thou diddeſt, nor ſpeake as thou
diddeſt, nor liue as thou diddeſt,
but remember that thou haſt chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thy Maiſter, and ſerue him with
whom thou art bound.<note place="margin">Iude 9.</note> For if God
and the diuell could not agree vpon
<hi>Moſes</hi> body, for one to haue one
part, and the other another part, but
God would haue all: Much leſſe wil
God agree that the deuill ſhoulde

not yeelde him part of the bodie.
Thus haue you heard what you muſt
put off: now heare how Chriſt muſt
be put on.<note place="margin">Reue. 10. 9.</note> As the Angel taught Iohn
to read the booke when he bad hym


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18090:64"/>
eate it: ſo we muſt put on Chriſt, as if
we did eate him, not as the papiſts do
in their Maſſe, but as the meate is
turned into the ſubſtance of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and goeth through euerie part of
man: So Chriſt and his word ſhould
goe from part to part, from eare to
heart, from hart to mouth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouth
to hand, till we be of one nature with
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they be the verie ſubſtance
of our thoughtes and ſpeeches, and
actions, as the meate is of our bodie.
This is, to eat Chriſt and his worde,
or els we do not eate them, but chew
them, and when our taſte is ſatisfied,
ſpue them out againe.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 30.</note> Thus we muſt
put on Chriſt, for the word ſignifieth
ſo to put him on, as if thou wouldeſt
put him in, that he may be one with
thee, and thou with him, as it were in
a bodie together. As he hath put on
all our infirmities, ſo we muſt put on
all his graces, not halfe on, but al on,
and claſpe him to vs, and girde hym
about vs; and weare him euen as we


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18090:64"/>
weare our skinne, which is alway a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
vs. Then there ſhall be no need
of wyers, nor curls, nor perriwigges,
the husbandes ſhall not be forced to
racke their rents, nor inhaunce their
fines, nor ſell their landes, to decke
their wiues.<note place="margin">2. King. 2.</note> But as the poore mantle
of <hi>Eliah</hi> ſeemed better to <hi>Eliſha</hi> then
all the robes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſo the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
garment ſhall ſeeme better then
all the flantes of vanitie, and put eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
faſhion out of faſhion, whiche is
not modeſt and comely like it ſelf. If
you will know farther how to put on
Chriſt, you ſhall ſee hovve your text

Lord, Ieſus, Chriſt. The Apoſtle
ſeemeth to ſpell out the way vnto vs,
hovv vve ſhould weare this garment.
Firſt, vvee muſt put him on as Lord,
then vvee muſt put him on as Ieſus:
Laſtly, we muſt put him on as chriſt.
Thou muſt put him on as Lord, that
is, thy ruler to commaund thee, and
thy Tutor to gouerne thee, thy mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18090:65"/>

<hi>VVhether is it meete to obey God
or you?</hi> Thou muſt put him on as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,<note place="margin">Ioſua hath the like name but not from God, nor to that end.</note>
that is, thy ſauiour, in whome
thou truſteſt, thy protector on whom
thou depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſt, thy redeemer in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thou beleeueſt. Thou muſt not looke
for thy ſaluation from Angell, nor
Saint, nor any thing beſide him. For
the name of Ieſus ſignifieth a Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 69.</note>
and is giuen to none but him,
and he is not onely called the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,<note place="margin">Iud. 3. 9.</note>
but the ſaluation, in the ſong of
Simeon, to ſhew that he is the onely
Sauiour, for there bee manie Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
but there can be but one ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
as there may be many tortures,
&amp; yet but one death. Therfore when
he is called the ſaluation, it implieth
that there is no Sauiour beſide hym.
Thou muſt put him on as Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 3. 33.</note>
that is,<note place="margin">Act. 3. 22.</note> a king to rule, a Prophet to

none but him. You put on
Chriſt firſt, when you are baptiſed.
then you were ſealed and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his ſeruice, ſo ſoone as you
came into the worlde, you vowed
to renounce the worlde and followe
God: how many haue put on chriſt

whiche haue broken the firſt

You put on Chriſt againe,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3.</note> when you

when you caſt off the olde man,
whiche is corrupt with the luſtes of
