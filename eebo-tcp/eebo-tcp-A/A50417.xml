            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>Now I beseech you Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that yee all speake the same thing, and that there be no Divisions
among you: but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the same mind,
and in the same judgement.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough Truth, from what mouth soever it bee
spoken, or in what shape or dresse soever it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
be but one and the same; and where it
is rightly understood, carries this uniting,
peacefull quality with it, that it makes all its
followers of one consent, and mind too; yet
I know not from what mist, or impotence, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in our nature, with whom errors and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
do for the most part prevaile more then Arguments or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations;
and with whom our owne mis-conceipts (conveyed
into us from such whom we think too holy to deceive us, or too
learned to deceive themselves) do for the most part sticke so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and take such root and impression in us, that it is not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of truth it selfe to remove them: This one, uniting, peacefull
Bond of minds, this Ray of our Soules, according to the severall
Teachers of it, and according to the severall formes and shapes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they have cast it, hath alwaies been looked on as so many
severall Truths; And to the discredit, and disadvantage of it, hath
in all Ages been as severally entertained and followed. Thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Heathen Plilosophers, we finde the number of Sects, to
be much greater then the number of Sciences. Every new famous
Teacher, who professed severlty in his looks, and austerity in his man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners,
had the power to draw a cloud of Disciples after him, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59335:3"/>
a new Truth with a new School. And thus in the very Church
of God it selfe, the Gospell no sooner began to be preached to the
world, but it began to have its Sects and Schismes, and sidings too.
The Apostles taught but one Faith, one Baptisme, one Christ, one
plaine, open way of salvation to men; yet they were mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by some, as if they had preached many: Or as if the numbers
of their severall Doctrines, had equalled the number of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
persons, and they had (every one where he went) scattered a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Gospell.</p>
            <p>To speake yet more plainely to you, and neerer home to the
History of this Text; The <hi>Corinthians</hi> (to whom this Epistle was
written) as if from every new Teacher that came thither, they had
learned a new Religion, began at length to have as many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among them as they had heard Teachers. You might have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
divers Churches in the same City, and have divided
their Beleefs and Creeds by their Families and streets. Where, by
a fallacy and deceit of the eare, judging of the things taught, by
their affection to the Teacher, and not judging of the Teacher by
the things which he taught, every one chose to himselfe the name
of his Minister to make a Side and faction by. One (as you read at
the 12. Verse, of this Chapter) said, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> another, <hi>I am of
Apollos,</hi> a third, <hi>I am of Cephas,</hi> a fourth, <hi>I am of Christ:</hi> As if
Christ had either been divided, or else were to stand with the rest
as the name of a distinct Religion; Or at least, as if the Gospell
(which at first sprung from him) like streams broken off from their
spring-head, were no longer to retaine the name of the Fountain
from whence it rose, but were to weare the stile of the severall
pipes and channells, by which it was conveyed abroad into the
world.</p>
            <p>This diversity of names, and sides, grew at first from their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of opinions, and minds. When the unlearned wresting the
Scripture which they had heard preached to an Apostles sense,
would presume to impose that sense, which was indeed, not an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
on others. And those others, equally as unlearned, thought
it as reasonable, so they could entitle it to another Apostle, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their interpretation of Scripture on the first.</p>
            <p>This diversity of minds, proceeded at length to diversity of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and speech. Congregation spoke censoriously of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59335:3"/>
as if none had been in the right, but they onely who most
vehemently could charge others with being in the wrong. Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> was urged, and quoted against Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> against
both, and <hi>Christ</hi> against all three. Whose Sermons, like those
changeable figures which melancholly men frame to themselves in
the clouds, were made to weare the shape and form, which every
mans zeale and fancy suggested to him.</p>
            <p>Hence, in time, from difference and disagreement in mindes
and speech, they grew to difference and disagreement in society and
conversation too. Difference of opinion bred separation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies;
and that which was at first but a neighbourly dispute, by
degrees tooke flame, and grew to be mortall hatred, division and
schisme. Men of the next doore were no longer neighbours to
one another. All the bonds of Charity became utterly broken. All
Christian entercourse, and familiarity and commerce ceast between
them. He was thought to be false, and to betray his side, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to shew himselfe affable or civill to one of another party.</p>
            <p>In short, the breach became so wide, that he was thought to be
the onely religious man who could most enlarge the rent, and could
bring most fuell to the present combustion which was thus unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
kindled among them. To compose these differences therefore,
(differences not unlike those of our miserable, distracted times) and
to make the Knot and Reconciliation as fast and strong, as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
and rent was large and wide, S. <hi>Paul</hi> here in this Text,
prescribes a severall Cure, for every particular and severall breach.
First, to remove the discord which rose among them, by calling
themselves by severall names, and to banish the ill consequences of
all such factious compellations, which for the most part are bitter
Invectives, and sharp arrowes of detraction hurld at one another,
he perswades them to unity of language and speech, and exhorts
them to call themselves all by the same name, in these words, <hi>Now
I beseech you Brethren, that ye al speak the same thing.</hi> Next, to remove
their want of meetings, and Communion together in the same
place of Gods Worship, he perswades them to unity of Assemblies,
and Congregation, in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you, Brethren, that
there be no divisions,</hi> That is, (as I shall in the progress of this Sermon,
make it clear to you from the Original) that there be no separations,
that is, (as our English word doth wel express it) that there be no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59335:4"/>
private sequestred meetings, no such things as Conventicles among
you. Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to remove the root, and spring of all these uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
strifes, and divisions, and separations, he perswades them to
unity of opinions and minds, in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you,
Brethren, that you be perfectly joyned together in the same mind, and in
the same judgement.</hi> Lastly, that he might with the greater successe
do this, and (like a skilfull reconciler) might win upon all sides,
he for a while layes aside the Authority of his Apostleship; and
mingling Request and Conjuration, with Exhortation and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he acts the part of an Apostle, in the forme of a Petitioner,
in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you Brethren, by the Name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Upon these parts, the Apostles mild in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation,
and addresse of himselfe, and the severall Degrees of
unity and concord, in speech, in Assemblies, and in Opinions, to
which he here exhorts the Corinthians, I will build my future dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
In the ordering of which, I will begin with the Apostles
submissive insinuation, or addresse of himselfe, in these words,
<hi>Now I beseech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the clearer and more usefull handling of this part of the
Text, First,<note place="margin">S Pauls qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> it will be necessary that I speake somthing to you of
Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> person, the Preacher here in the Text, and of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to the Ministery; which well considered, will conduce very
much to the removall of a certaine dangerous error received of late
into the minds of too many unlearned, vulgar men among us: Which
is, That Universities, and Bookes, and Studies, and Learning are so
farre from being necessary preparations to make a Preacher of the
Gospell, that any Lay-man, though perhaps brought up to a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall
Trade, of a vocation of Husbandry, or attendance upon Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
if he finde by himselfe that he is called by the Spirit of God,
may put himselfe into Orders, and take the Ministery upon him.
And thus enabled from above, without the forme of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or those other slow, tedious, lazy helps, of sitting twenty years
in a Colledge to understand the Bible, may in the few minutes of a
powerfull Inspiration spring up an Apostle, and go forth a Preacher
of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>To this perswasion they have been invited by two sorts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in the Scripture; one in the Old Testament, the other in
the New. In the Old Testament, Doe you not read, say they, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59335:4"/>
God called <hi>Elisha</hi> from the Plough to be a Prophet? And doth not
<hi>Amos</hi> tell you in the 7. Chapter of his Prophesie, at the 14. Verse,
that he was a Herdman, and a gatherer of Sycamore fruit? Then
for examples in the New Testament, pray what were the Apostles?
were they great Schollars? or did Christ send to <hi>Athens</hi> for them?
were they not Fishermen, men altogether unletter'd, men called
from mending nets to preach the Gospell? If this were so, That
God according to his good pleasure, without any consideration of
study, or height of parts, chose simple, unlearned, unstudied men,
to be Prophets and Apostles, and Teachers, then why should any
thinke he hath so confined, or entailed his free Spirit, or vocation
of men, upon great parts, and studies, that he may not, if he please
call the like unstudied, simple men from the Plough or Fisher-boat,
or Stall, or Shop-board, to be Ministers of his Gospel, and Teachers
of his people now?</p>
            <p>My Brethren, you see I have not prevaricated, or diminished
ought of the strength of the Argument which is urged in favour of
Lay-mens preaching. In answer to which, laying aside all partiality
to my selfe, and prejudice against them, I shall with the same spirit
of meekness and Candour, with which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here in this
Text bespoke his Corinthians, beseech you, who heare me this day,
to observe, and weigh, and consider well this which I shall say for
a Reply?</p>
            <p>First, Far, far be it from me so to flatter the place of my Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or so to biass my beleef, by any false ovevarluing of humane
Industry, or great parts that I should pinion, as it were, or put li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to the power of the Almighty; Or should be so irreligiously
bold, as to gain-say that piece of his Gospell which compares his
holy Spirit to the <hi>Wind,</hi> which <hi>bloweth where it listeth.</hi> If they who
thus pretend to a private Inspiration doe meane, that whatever
God did in the times heretofore, he is able to doe now, I shall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grant it; And here in the presence of you all, confesse my selfe
to be of their opinion. Nor shall I make any doubt or scruple at
all, to say, that, if we looke upon what God is able to doe, by the
fame power by which he was able to raise up Children to <hi>Abraham</hi>
out of stones, or (to speake yet more neerly to the Argument in
hand) by the same power that hee was able to make a Herd-man
a Prophet, or a Fisher-man an Apostle, he is able, in our times also,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59335:5"/>
if he please, to make the meanest Tradesman one of the greatest
Luminaries of his Church. Since to an Omnipotent Agent, whose
gifts are meerly Arbitrary, and depend wholly upon the pleasure
of his owne will, the greatest endowments of men, and the least,
are alike easie. But though he be able to doe this, and in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times of the Scripture have imparted his Gifts without respect
of Persons, yet whether he now will, or whether in our times hee
doth still thus extraordinarily raise up Teachers to himselfe, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
to be doubted. For here with all the Christian gentleness
and reason, which may possibly conduce to the clearing of this
doubt, were I to argue this Controversie with one of those men
who invade our function, and from gathering of Sycamore fruit
step up into the Pulpit, I would onely aske him this question; What
Commission he hath thus to usurp upon our Office; Or who signed
him his patent; Since the Apostle tells us in the fifth Chapter of the
Epistle to the Hebrewes, at the fourth Verse, (A place well worth
your marking, my Brethren) That <hi>no man taketh this honour of a
Priest to himselfe, But he who is called of God, as was Aaron?</hi> I know
his common answer will bee, that God hath called him to this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
by the secret Instinct, and Motion of his Holy Spirit. But, then,
he must not take it ill, if I yet farther aske him, by what signes, or
markes, or testimonies, or tokens, he can either ma<gap reason="illegible: overwritten" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e it reasonably
appeare to himselfe, or others, that God hath dealt with him as he
dealt with some of the Prophets, or Apostles; called him from his
Trade by such a motion of his Spirit? <hi>Elisha</hi> we know, made I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
swim, and knew mens Closet-discourses in a farre Countrey,
which was a sure and certaine signe that God had called him to be
a Prophet. The Apostles also we know, wrought many of Christs
miracles, which was a most infallible signe that God had chosen
them to be Apostles. If any of these men, who derive their warrant
from the same sacred spring, can make Iron swim, or like <hi>Elisha,</hi>
remaining here in their owne Israel, can tell us what the King of
Syria saies in his Bed-chamber; Or if like Saint <hi>Peter</hi> they can cure
fevers and diseases by their bare shadowes passing over them; Or
if, like the rest of the Apostles, having never before knowne
Letters, they can of a sudden speake all Languages, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
is at an end; It would bee a very great sinne against
the Spirit of God to deny, that hee is in them of a Truth.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59335:5"/>
But if all the proofe and signe they can give us that they have him,
be onely a strong perswasion of themselves; Nay, if by an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Illumination they could assure themselves, that they have him,
yet as many as have not the like infallible Illumination to assure
them so too, will not be guilty of an unpardonable offence, if
they suspect they have him not. For here, I must once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
my former Question, and aske by what effects, or signes of
the Spirit, men shall know them to be called? By what? will some
man say, why? Doe you not heare them preach, expound Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
unfold Prophecies, interpret Parables, nay plucke the veile
and cloud from the Booke of Mysteries it selfe, the very <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
Can any of you great Schollers, with all your study of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
Fathers, Councells, Schoole-men, Historians, Oratours,
Poets, either hold your Congregations longer, or send them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
more edified? And will you yet ask Questions? Or doubt of the
certainty of their vocation? I must not dissemble with you, if I
could meet with an unlearned Handicraft-man, who without study,
can doe this to the same height, and measure of Truth, as those
unjustly-cryed downe, learned, and well-studied men doe, I
should begin to alter my opinion; And should reckon him as
hee deserves, in the number of the inspired. But alas, my
Brethren, as I am not come hither to disparage the guifts of
the Holy Ghost, in what person soever I finde them, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
that Scripture rightly expounded, is not one, and the
same, from the mouth of a Priest, or an inspired Lay-man; so
this I must freely say to you, That as many of those strange
Teachers as I have heard, have expounded Scripture indeed, and
have ventured upon some of the hardest places of the Prophets.
But, then, if all my studies of the Bible, assisted with all those
holy, uncorrupted learned helps, which might enable mee to
understand it aright, have not deceived me, their expositions,
and Sermons, how passionately delivered, or how long soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
are evident proofes to mee that they have not the Spirit.
If they had, they would never, certainely, expound Scripture
so directly contrary to his meaning; Or make the writings of
the Prophets or Apostles, weare only that present shape, not which
the holy Ghost hath imprinted and stampt upon them, but which
tends to the division of a Kingdom, and the confusion of a Church;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59335:6"/>
Nor would they, as they do, what ever the Text be, presse that sense
from it, not which is genuine, and naturall, but which tends most
to the destruction of a party, or the fomentation of a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
Civill Warre. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in the fift Chapter of
the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> at the 22, and 23. Verses, that <hi>the
fruits,</hi> or effects <hi>of the Spirit, are love, peace, long-suffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
meeknesse, temperance.</hi> He useth to speake to men in the voice,
and figure of a Dove: But to entitle him to all those forbidden
workes of the flesh, of variance, hatred, sedition, heresies, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
murthers, and the like, there reckoned up in the precedent
Verses of that Chapter, is to make him speake with the voice of
a Raven.</p>
            <p>In short, my Brethren, the Holy Ghost is not the Author of such
Doctrines as breake Gods Commandements in the Pulpit. Nor is
it a long Prayer, or a zealous two-houres reviling of the foot-steps
of the Lords Anointed, their lawfull Soveraigne, which can make
their Sermons to be any other then so much Libell, or holy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation;
Or which can make their Intrepretations of the Word
of God, how moderate soever in other cases, if they be not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the scope, and minde, and intention of the Holy Ghost,
to be any more then so many zealous mistakes, and so many ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
births, and creatures of their own deluded fancies.</p>
            <p>Next, in pursuit of this seasonable Argument, give me leave,
I pray, with all the plainenesse I can, (for I well know where I am,
and to what Auditorie I speake) to make it yet farther evident to
you, that if I should grant what these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as S. <hi>Basil</hi>
calls them, these Saints of a daies growth, challenge to themselves,
who thinke that all that is required to make a Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, onely to be willing, and to start up a Preacher.
If, I say, it should be granted them, that they have the inward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Spirit, yet God is so much the God of order, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they will enter themselves into his service, by undergoing those
Rites of Consecration and Imposition of Hands, which God hath
prescribed in his Church, to stand for ever as the outward formes
and signes of their vocation too, every act of the Ministerie which
they performe, is but a sacrifice like theirs who offered strange fire
before the Lord, and miserably perisht by their owne forbidden
Censors. Or if you will have me expresse the danger of it by a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59335:6"/>
judgement as terrible. Thus to put their hand to the Arke, thus to
support it, if 'twere ready to fall, is such an unwarranted piece
of officiousnesse, as will (certainely) unrepented, at some time or
other, draw the punishment of <hi>Vzzrah</hi> upon them, provoke the
abused Almighty to breake forth in a flame of fire upon them,
and consume them for their unnecessarie diligence. For here, all
the Scripture examples which imbolden them to this worke, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
upon them, as so many instances and proofes of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment
on our office. For here let me once more ask them, How
was <hi>Elisha</hi> called to be a Prophet? meerly by the secret, unknown
whisper and instinct of the holy Ghost? Truly, if he had, yet this
would not make much for them; because God never tyed himself
precisely to those outward formes in the choice of a Prophet,
which he then did, and still doth in the choice of his Priests. Yet
the calling of this Prophet was not without its visible signe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Goe,</hi>
saies God to <hi>Elias,</hi> in the 19. Chap. of the first booke of <hi>Kings,</hi>
at the 16. Verse, <hi>Anoint</hi> Elisha <hi>the Son of</hi> Shaphat <hi>to be Prophet in
thy roome.</hi> And whether the like Ceremony of powring oyle on
his head, were not also performed by some elder Prophet upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>
as the younger, as 'tis not affirmed, so 'tis not denyed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but left probable. In the Consecration of the Priests of those
times, the case is much more evident: Read at your leisure the 29.
Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> there you shall finde, that before God would
receive them into that sacred function, first, divers Sacrifices were
to bee offered for them; then they were to be brought to the door
of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and there to bee washt;
then the Priests Garments, the Coat, the Ephod, the Brest-plate,
and Mitre, were to be put upon them. Lastly, followed the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
oyle, which was powred upon their heads: And this was
the Consecration of the Priests of those times.</p>
            <p>The Ceremonies of Consecration in the New Testament, were
different, I confesse, from those of the Old; but yet equivalent,
and answerable to them in their kinde. These were, a publike mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Church together, a presentation there made of the
person to bee made a Priest; solemne prayers and supplications
put up to God, to make him usefull to his Church: and for a
seale of all the rest, the Imposition of the Bishops hands, assisted
by his Presbyters. Now, my Brethren, apply this to the strange
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59335:7"/>
Priests of our times, who with unwasht feet thrust themselves into
the Tabernacle; not a sacrifice, not so much as a handfull of meale,
or grain of Incense, or drop of oyl spent towards their Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
No solemne assembly, no presentation of themselves made to
God, no imposition of hands, not so much as a short Prayer, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction,
or God speed you, used towards their setting forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lords Vineyard, and you will find that these are the theeves
and robbers (pardon the hardness of the language, I cannot make
the Scripture speake mildlier then it doth) which our Saviour
Christ speaks of in the 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Chapter of S. <hi>John</hi> at the first Verse, <hi>Men
who enter not in by the doore into the sheep-fold, but climbe up some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way.</hi> In briefe, men, whose Sermons and Doctrines correspond
to their consecrations. By stealth they enter into the Ministery, and
by stealth they exercise it. And whereas the mark and Character of
all the true Ministers of the Gospel is to stand, <hi>having their feet shod
with the preparation of the Gospel of peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 5, 15.</note> these men wander, and
goe about, having their feet shod with the preparation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of strife. Men, who never think themselves sufficiently Apostles,
till all the world doe call them the sons of thunder too. Men
who speake fire, and throw lightning among the people; and
thinke they have then onely done the worke, and businesse of an
Apostle, when they have cast the Congregation which they leave
behind them into a cumbustion and flame. I shall trouble your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
but with one Objection, which may possibly be made against
what I have hitherto said; that is this: Here, some one of
these moderne, selfe-inspiring Teachers may say, Sir, you tell us
of Ceremonies and Consecrations, and I know not what, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of hands; but either you have forgot your selfe, or wisely
dissembled the vocation of the Apostles. Were not they without
your formality of laying on of hands, without all this adoe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
orders, and the holy Ghost by fingers, immediately called
by Christ? What imposition of hands went to change S. <hi>Peter</hi> from
a Fisher-man into an Apostle? or what Bishops Ceremonies past to
make S. <hi>Paul</hi> (in whose person you have all this while preacht
against us) of a persecutor of the Church to become a Doctor of
the Gentiles? Doth not your own <hi>Tertullian</hi> say, <hi>Nonne &amp; Laici
Sacerdotes sumus,</hi> That any Lay-man, if he please, may be a Priest?</p>
            <p>To this I reply; first, As for the Apostles, 'tis true, indeed, we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59335:7"/>
doe not read that they were consecrated to their Ministerie by such
Rites and Imposition of hands, as were afterwards received and
practised in the Church. Yet something answerable to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of hands went to their Consecration, before they were
invested with full Authority to preach the Gospell to the world.
For besides their first vocation by Christ to be his Disciples, from
whom they learnt that Gospell which they afterwards preacht,
what saies the Scripture? <hi>Tarry yee at Jerusalem,</hi> sayes Christ to
them,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 49.</note> after his Resurrection, <hi>till I send the promise of my Father upon
you, and yee be indued with power from above.</hi> And, pray, what was
that promise, and what was this power? Certainly, that which you
read of in the second Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt
by Christ, the Holy Ghost descended on them. And how did
hee descend? in a still, soft, secret, invisible perswasion of the
Fancy? Or in the silent whisper of an unperceived Illumination?
No such matter, <hi>Quod Episcopus aliis, Spiritus sanctus Apostolis,</hi> saies
a learned man. The holy Ghost here supplyed the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
descended upon them in an audible rushing wind, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
his election of them to the eare; And sate upon their heads
in the shape of cloven Tongues of fire; which signified his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them to the eye. <hi>Hi ritus, haec impositio;</hi> These were his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
this his Imposition of hands, sayes that Author. So that
all the difference betweene the Admission of the Apostles to the
Ministery, and others, was onely this: In other Consecrations
the Bishop onely granted the power to preach, but bestowed not
the Guifts; Here the Holy Ghost bestowed both. He first by visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
outward signes, testified to the world whom hee had chosen,
and to whom they were to hearken; And then furnisht them with
Tongues, and Languages, and knowledge, and parts, fit to be the
Guides and great Instructers of the world. Let these men make
it appeare to me, that the Holy Ghost hath thus descended upon
them, thus furnisht them with parts, and I will most willingly resign
my place to them in the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>Next, as for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 'tis cleare by the story of his Conversion,
that he received not his Commission to preach from that which
Christ spoke to him immediately from Heaven. But what saies the
place?<note place="margin">Acts 9. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> After he was fallen to the Earth blinde, <hi>Arise,</hi> saies Christ
to him, <hi>and goe into the City, and there it shall be told thee what thou
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59335:8"/>
must doe.</hi> When hee came into the City, a certaine Disciple named
<hi>Ananias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9. 17.</note> pre-instructed by Christ in a vision, was sent to him, who
putting his hands on him, saies the Text, said to him, <hi>Brother Saul,
the Lord (even Jesus that appeared to thee in the way) hath sent me,
that thou mightst receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</hi>
Till his Imposition of hands, the holy Ghost was not bestowed
upon him. And when he was bestowed upon him, yet he had not
his full Commission; he was but yet a Disciple consecrated by a
Disciple. To make him an out-right Apostle, a higher, second, and
more solemne consecration past upon him, which you may read
in the 13. Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where, sayes the Holy Ghost to the
Prophets, and Teachers of the Church of Antioch, <hi>Separate me</hi>
Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the worke whereunto I have called them,</hi> Ver. 2.
And how were they separated I pray? The third Verse tells you,
<hi>When the Prophets and Teachers</hi> (there mentioned) <hi>had fasted, and
prayed, and laid their hands on them,</hi> saies the Text, <hi>they sent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
till then they wanted power. To which passage of this voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or calling to the Ministery, give me leave to adde this for his
parts. That in a humane way of acquired Learning, hee was the
greatest Scholler of his time, bred up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a
great Doctor of Law, spoke more Tongues, attained by his owne
Industry, then all the other Apostles, which had almost all Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
instilled into them by infusion. In short, he was verst, and read,
and studied, not onely in the Scripture, but in the highest parts of
secular learning; In the writings of <hi>Menander, Epimenides,</hi> and
<hi>Aratus,</hi> Heathen Poets. Which is sure signe to us, that studies,
and learning, and parts acquired in Universities, are no hindrances,
or impediments, if not helps to the Ministery. Lastly, as for that
saying of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that Lay-men may be Priests, hee tells you,
in the following words, in what case this is to be understood. <hi>Vbi
Ecclesiastici ordinis non est consessus;</hi> Where the condition of the
time and place is such, that Ecclesiasticall orders cannot be had;
If a Christian Lay-man should come into a Pagan Island, or into a
Countrey of Heathen people, where there is no true Minister, here
<hi>Tinguis, &amp; offers, &amp; sacerdos es,</hi> everie man is a Priest, and may
baptize, and adminster the Sacrament, and preach as much of the
Gospell as hee knowes. But where this necessity is not, to snatch
the Sermon out of the mouth, or the Sacrament out of the hands
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59335:8"/>
or the child out of the armes of the true Minister, is certainly to
to be in the number of those uncalled Teachers, of whom God
complaines in the 23. Chapter of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> at the 21. Verse, where
he saies, <hi>I have not sent these Prophets, yet they ran; I have not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to them, yet they prophecied.</hi> And farther then this I will not
pursue the first thing I proposed to you; which was by occasion of
Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> calling to be an Apostle, to remove an errour of late
taken into the minds of some, that crafts-men may exercise the place
and function of a Priest.</p>
            <p>The next thing I shall observe to you,<note place="margin">The arti<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> insinuation himselfe.</note> is, the holy art and insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here useth to win upon the minds of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
<hi>Corinthians.</hi> Though he professe, in the beginning of the
next Chapter, that he came not to them with that part of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
about him, which consists in the excellency of speech, or the
entising words of mans wisdome, (lest if he had done so, he might
perhaps, have gained much glory to himselfe, but then his Master
must have been in danger to lose his, and so the Gospell have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from his Eloquence; and his Epistles might, perhaps, have
past for a good piece of Rhetorick, but not for good Sermons)
yet he every where carried this other, equally prevailing part of
a good Oratour with him, that by complying with the affections
of those to whom he wrote, he first transformed himselfe into their
shapes, and became all things to all men, that he might the better
transforme them into his, and make all men become like himselfe.
Thus to the Jewes he became as a Jew; and put himselfe a while
with them under the Law, that by insensible degrees hee might take
their yoke from them, and might beget their liking, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Gospell. And thus to the Gentiles, who were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Law, he became as a Gentile, without the Law too, that
he might unite them to the Jewes. If I may speake of him, by
his owne description of himselfe, (and certainly, in that descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of himselfe, he was inspired to speake truth as well as in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
writings) as he was not chosen, like the rest of the Apostles,
out of Fisher-men, or men unlearned, nor call'd to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
from mending Nets; But as there was a concurrence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
acquired, and infused abilities in him, which rendred him
though not one of the twelve, yet of equall guifts and endowments
to them all. Lastly, as his taske and patent to preach the Gospell
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59335:9"/>
was much larger then the rest, as much larger, as the rest of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
was larger then the Nation of the Jewes; So in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his taske, he never failed to expresse all this. Like the
beast, of which <hi>Pliny</hi> speakes, which puts on the likenesse of
every thing next it, and showes like a flower before a flower,
like a streame before a streame, and like a flame before a flame;
so 'twas a piece of this Apostles (Art shall I say? or) holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
to be <hi>all things to all men.</hi> Strong with the strong, and weak
with the weake. To part with his Liberty to the scrupulous, and
to use it with the indifferent. To eat all things wtth those that
did eat all things, and with those that did not, to keep himselfe to
herbes. Will you heare him in all these particulars expresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?
Turne to the ninth Chapt. of this Epistle, and to the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Verse, where setting downe the end, and aime, which hee
proposed to all his holy Arts, he saies, <hi>Though I be free from all
men,</hi> that is, no way obliged to doe as I doe, but for my Masters ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<hi>yet have I made my selfe a servant to all, that I might win the
more.</hi> Now if humility, and the casting of himselfe below himselfe;
if to beseech, and entreat, and petition there, where he had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
authority and commission to enjoyne and command, be to wear
the forme of a servant; and if all discreet behaviours, complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and applications, take their measure, and use, and praise, from
the good end to which they are directed, and the good successe
which they are likely to procure, in all his Epistles I finde not this
Apostle more expediently making use of his Art in the forme of a
suppliant, then in this Text. For consider these <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to
whom he here applies himselfe, divided, and broken into Factions;
and these Factions severally deriving themselves, some from him,
others from <hi>Cephas,</hi> others from <hi>Apollos,</hi> (Names in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as holy, and great as his) and to have dealt imperiously with
them, or to have used his Apostolicall power, and to have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to agreement, had not been to make peace, but to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and inflame that party which called themselves his side. It had
been too, to call up opposition, and disdaine in the others, who
were not of that side. Who citing <hi>Apollos,</hi> or Saint <hi>Peter</hi> against
him, and thinking it to be some confession of their error and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to yeeld first, or to go over to them who said they were of
<hi>Paul,</hi> it being as reasonable that they should come over to them,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59335:9"/>
who said they were of <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> might have askt the same
question which the striving Israelite askt <hi>Moses, Who made thee a
Judge over us?</hi> And might have seconded this question with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and have askt him, how one interested, and ingaged, nay the
head (as they conceived) of a Faction, could be presumed to be an
impartiall reconciler? The better therefore, to establish a peace
and concord among them, S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Chap. proceeds by three
conducible waies of Reconciliation. At the 13. Ver. hee cleares
himselfe from all interest and ingagement to a side; and equally
blaming those who said they were of <hi>Paul,</hi> as those who said they
were of <hi>Cephas,</hi> or <hi>Apollos;</hi> he askes them how it came to passe,
that they dealt with the Gospell of Christ, which was entire and
seamlesse, like his Coat, as the Souldiers did with his other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
divided it by a kinde of blind Lottery among them, and
every one take his share? <hi>Is Christ divided?</hi> Saies he. <hi>Was</hi> Paul <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
for you?</hi> Or <hi>were ye baptized in the name of</hi> Paul? If you were
not, why doe you raise a Sect, and Faction from him? VVhy doe
you call your selves by way of marke and distinction, <hi>Paulists?</hi>
And so turn the name of your Preacher and Apostle, into the name
of a Schisme and side?</p>
            <p>Next, as he well knew that the readyest way to reconcile all
sides, was to manifest himselfe to be of none; so he well knew too,
that he that would knit, and re-unite disagreeing mindes, was not
to deale roughly, or magisterially with them, (for that were to
lose both; and to turne the enmity and hatred which they held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
themselves, upon the Reconciler, who strived to make
them friends) but was to quench such discords with soft language,
and to cure such rents and wounds of the Church by pouring oyle
into them. Though, therfore, being armed with the authority of
Christ himselfe, he might, with justice enough, have made Decrees
and Ordinances to bind them to agreement, yet he rather chooseth
to reconcile them to one another with their owne consents. In a
mild, and humble addresse of himselfe; therefore, not entitling
himselfe more to one side then anonher, he equally beseecheth
them all, that he might the more regardfully be listned to by all.
And he beseecheth them for things which little concerned himselfe,
but for their owne good. He petitions them that they would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and spends intreaties that they would vouchsafe to goe to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59335:10"/>
heaven. He requests them that they would not be worse Christians,
that is, Schismatiques and Seperatists, then they were Heathens,
that is, unanimous Idolaters.</p>
            <p>Lastly, he begs of them that they would once more be a Church
and City; that is, a place of communion, and society, and Christian
conversation. And that hee might the more prevailingly obtaine
this of them, he addresseth himselfe to them in a stile and compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the greatest and gentlest perswasion to peace that can bee
used, and calls them <hi>Brethren.</hi> A word, which to remove all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of better or worse, or of inferiour or superiour, (the usuail
grounds of discord) not only signifies an equality between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecher
and the beseeched, and the besecched among themsevles;
(For <hi>Esse Fratres est relatio inter aequales,</hi> sayes the Lawyer as well
as the Logician; to be brethren, carries a reference of equality to
one another) but it implies all the naturall and religious grounds
for which men ought to maintaine League and Agreement, and
Peace with one another. For in calling them <hi>Brethren,</hi> he called
them men of the same sociable kinde, equally descended from the
same common Originall and stock, and equally wearing in their
nature one and the same common Image of God. And therefore,
for this they were not to disagree, or quarrell with one another:
Since likenesse of kinde maintains agreement between savage beasts
and Tygers. <hi>Leonum feritas inter se non dimicat, serpentum morsus
non petunt serpentes;</hi> Who ever heard of a Lyon devovred by a Lyon?
Or who ever heard of a Serpent stung by a Serpent? much lesse
should men then, bite and devour, and prey upon one another.</p>
            <p>Againe, in calling them Brethren, besides the naturall affinity
that was between them as men, he put them in minde of their
spirituall alliance, as they were Christians too. That is, men alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to one another by one common Faith, one common Hope, one
common Redemption, and therefore to meet in one common bond
of Peace and Charity too. <hi>Rixari, &amp; se invicem convitiis lacessere
Infidelium est;</hi> 'Tis for Infidells, and men not converted to the
Faith, to provoke, or brawle, or quarrell with one another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, lest all this sweetnesse of addresse and language should
not prevaile, he joynes Conjuration to Petition, but vailes it in the
stile and forme of a Petition too, and beseecheth them to unity by
the name of his, and their Lord Jesus Christ. A name, by which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59335:10"/>
as he had before dispossest Devills, cured sicknesses, and restored
the dead to life againe, so he repuests that he may dispossesse opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
cure divisions, and restore agreement by it too. It being that
name into which they were all baptized, and to which they had all
past their promises, and vowes. Lastly, a name by which they were
all to be saved; and by which they, by whose names (to the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
and disparagement of this) they called themselves, were, with
them, equally to be called, that is, Christians.</p>
            <p>Here then, 'twere much to be wisht, that the Preachers of our
times would deale with their disagreeing flocks, as this Apostle
dealt with his: That is, that they would imploy their holy, and
religious arts and endeavours, by sweetnesse of language, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie
of behaviour to all parties, to reconcile them. For
since it may be truly said of Preachers, what was once said of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
that the people are the waters, and they the windes that
move them; to be thus the windes to them, as to speak, and move,
and blow them into waves and billowes, which shall roll, and strike,
and dash, and breake themselves against each other; Or to be thus
the windes to them, as to rob them of their calme, and to trouble
the peacefull course, and streame of things well setled, and to raise
a storme and tempest there, where they should compose and allay
one, is not to act the part of an Apostle, or of a Preacher of the
Gospell, but of an <hi>Erynnis,</hi> or Fury, who ascending from hell with
a firebrand in her hand, and snakes on her head, scatters warres, and
strifes, and hatreds, and murthers, and treasons, and betrayings
of one another as she passeth. Every haire of her head hurld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people becomes a sedition, and serpent; and every sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of her Torch sets Villages, and Towns, and Cities and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and Empires in a Combustion.</p>
            <p>Alas, my brethren, how many such furies, rather then Preachers,
have for some yeares walkt among us? Men who speaking to the
people in a whirle-winde, and breathing nothing but pitcht-fields,
and sieges, and slaughters of their Brethren, doe professe no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to be a Sermon, which rends not the Rockes and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
before it: forgetting that God rather dwells in still, soft
voices. 'Tis true indeed, the Holy Ghost once assumed the shape
of cloven Tongues of fire: But that was not from thence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
Incendiaries of the Church; Teachers whose Doctrine should
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59335:11"/>
be cloven too; and which should tend onely to divide their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</p>
            <p>If I should aske you, from whence have sprung our present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions?
Or, who are they who keep the wounds of our divided
Kingdome bleeding? Are they not certaine tempestuous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
active men, who make it their work and businesse to rob
men of the greatest temporal blessing of the Scripture, and to preach
every man out of the shade of his owne Vine, and out of the fruit
of his owne Fig-tree, and out of the water of his owne Cisterne?
Are they not men who will stone you for your Vineyard, and then
urge Scripture for it? And will take away your field, your posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
your daily bread from you, and then repay you with a piece
of <hi>Esay</hi> or <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> or one of the Prophets, anc call this melting,
and reformation? Are they not men who doe onely professe to
have the art not to heale, or close, or reconcile, but to inflame, and
kindle sides? Men who blow a Trumpet in the Pulpit, and there
breath nothing but thunder, and ruine, and desolation, and
destruction, Whose followers call themselves <hi>Brethren,</hi> indeed,
and boast much of their charity; But they call only such as are of
their owne confederacy, Brethren: and make no other use of the
word which was at first imposed by Christ, to bee the stile and
marke of agreement and peace, then to bee the word and mark
to know a faction by, and make no other use of their charity, which
should extend it selfe to all men, even to their very enemies, but
onely to keep themselves together in a separation and conspiracy.</p>
            <p>Lastly, these are the men, who when they should strive to
quench the present flame with their teares, do conjure as earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the name of Christ to discord and confusion, as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
here in this Text doth to order and agreement. Men who call it
prophecy, and edification, and building up of the people, when
they breake and divide them into Sects and Factions. As zealously
exhorting them to speake divers things, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> here exhorts
them to speake all the same. Which is the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
and the first step towards the reconciliation, and peace,
here petitioned for, which is unity and agreement in compellations
and names in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you Brethren, that yee all
speak the same thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the dispersion of men, after the building of the Tower
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59335:11"/>
of <hi>Babell,</hi> over the face of the whole earth, were a panishment
or a blessing to mankinde, I shall not in this Auditory examine or
dispute. Only thus much we learne from the History of that place,
that the occasion of that dispersion and separation of men from
one another, sprung first from the confusion which God threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and that confusion sprung from their diversity of
speech. For as speech was at first bestowed upon us by God,
that wee might hold league and society, and friendship with
one another: so you may read in the 11. Chapter of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
that as long as all the world was of one language, and of
one speech, they lived unanimously together like men of
one family and house. One heart, one soule seemed to move in
them all. But when they once ceast to be <hi>unius labii homines,</hi>
men of the same lip and speech, when as many languages were
throwne among them, as they afterwards possest Countries, then
society, and co-habitation, and brotherhood ceast among them too.
<hi>They were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth,</hi> saies the
Scripture. They who were before children of the same common An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours,
and derived themselves from the same common parentage
and stock, as if they had been borne in the adverse Hemispheres of
the world, or had taken their beginning from as many severall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
as they afterwards found Islands, of one great Family and
Kindred, became so many divided Nations.</p>
            <p>As this diversity of Tongues at first broke the world into the
severall crumbles and portions of men, who from that time to
this have divided it among them; so there is not any one thing
which hath so fatally divided Kingdomes, and States, and Churches
against themselves, somtimes to an utter extirpation, many times
to an eternall breach, and Irreconciliation, as diversity of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
I doe not meane when men speake divers tongues of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
dialects, and significations, (as when they at the building of
<hi>Babell</hi> spoke some of them Hebrew perhaps, some of them Greek)
but my meaning is, that nothing more directly tends to the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a State, or Church, then for severall companies of men to
distinguish, and divide and separate themselves from one another
by certaine words and names of marke and difference, especially if
they be words of disgrace, and scandall, and reproach, mutually
imposed, and stuck upon each other; Or words of faction, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59335:12"/>
combination, assumed and taken by themselves. Then, if hatred of
person, or difference of Religion doe accompany such words of
distinction, that for the most part befalls them, which befell the
men of the old world, they breake society and Communion, and
crumble asunder; and of one people become so many divided Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Churches to each other. This is an Engine which the
Devill and wicked Polititians have in all ages of the world made
use of, to disturb the peace, and trouble the happinesse of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Common-wealths. Making holy, vertuous words and
names, many times the partition wall of separation; And the
device, and incitement, not onely to divide Kingdomes but Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
and private Families against themselves. As long as the
Jewes called themselves by one and the same common name of
their Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> Israelites, they made but one State, one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
among them. But when once ten Tribes ingrossed that
name to themselves, and the other two for distinction sake called
themselves by the name of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> the most united, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest,
neerliest allied people in the world, a people of one blood, as
well as one language, fell asunder, and divided themselves, like <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
and <hi>Esau,</hi> into two hostile, irreconcileable, never more to bee
united Kingdomes. And this was the case of these disagreeing
Corinthians, to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> directed this Text. As long as they
called themselves by one, and the same common name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
they made but one City, one Church, one place of Concord.
But when they once began to distinguish themselves by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Teachers, when some said, <hi>We are of Paul,</hi> others, <hi>we are of
Cephas:</hi> As third sort, <hi>we are of Apollos;</hi> And onely a fourth sort,
more Orthodox then the rest, <hi>we are of Christ;</hi> Then, then indeed,
as if Christ had been devided, or had beene the Author of severall
Religions, preacht among them by severall Apostles, they became
broken, and rent, and torne asunder, into severall Churches and
Congregations. Where their usuall custome was, not onely to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Sermon against Sermon, and Gospell against Gospell, and
Teacher against Teacher, but everie one in the defence of their
owne Teacher, and his Gospell, thought it part of their Religion
to extoll, and quote, and urge the purity and infallibility of the
one, to the depression, and disgrace, and contempt of the other:
Till at length it came to passe, (as I told you before) that that which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59335:12"/>
begun in Religion, proceeded to bad manners, and ill behaviour.
Markes and words of distinction, and difference, grew to bitter
invectives, and mutuall reproaches of one another. They who
were the followers of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, called those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>Apollos,</hi> by way of marke and infamy, <hi>Apolonists.</hi> And they
who were the followers of <hi>Apollos,</hi> by way of retaliation, and
brand, called the followers of Saint <hi>Paul, Paulists,</hi> though Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> preach both the same Doctrine. Hard censures flew
between them in as hard language; who ever was not of a party,
nor enrolled of a side, was thought to be without the pale of the
Church. The gates of heaven were shut against him, and nothing
but reprobation, and the lot of the damned, and hell fire were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be his portion.</p>
            <p>Here then, my Brethren, lot me make my appeale to eyery one
of you, who heare me this day, hath not this been our verie case?
I must with sorrow of heart confesse to you, that as often as I
have for some yeares, made to my selfe a contemplative survey of
this unhappie Kingdome, I have been able to discover no cause
so pernicious for the many alienations of mind, or the many sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of Congregation from Congregation, heightned at length
into the tragedy of an over-spreading Civill War, as certain vain,
ridiculous, empty words, and names of distinction among us; which
have sprung from some mens stricter or looser carriage of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their profession of the same Religion. They of the more
free, and open carriage and behaviour, who call a severe regularity
and strictnesse of life, precisenesse, and an abridgement of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
liberty, have called those of a more reserved, and lockt up, and
demure conversation, Puritans, and Round-heads, and I know not
what other names of contumely, and reproach. And they of the
more strict behaviour, have equally as faulty, called those of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freer,
and lesse composed conversation, Libertines, and Papists; the
usuall words of infamy made to signifie a Cavalier. These two words
my Brethren, have almost destroyed a flourishing Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.</p>
            <p>To this, I cannot but adde one most pernicious cause of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
divisions more, which people have derived to themselves from
making themselves followers too much of severall Teachers; and
affecting too much to bee called after their names: whilest one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59335:13"/>
saies, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> another, <hi>I am of Cephas,</hi> a third, <hi>I am of Apollos,</hi>
only a few neutrall men, <hi>We are of Christ.</hi> Nay, if we needs must
goe severall waies, I could wish wee had such sacred names as
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Apollos</hi> to divide us. I know not whether
it will be seasonable for me to speake it in this Assembly: But we
for some late yeares have chosen to our selves names more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne,
and fallible to divide ourselves by; whilest some have said,
<hi>We are of Calvin,</hi> others, <hi>We are of Arminius,</hi> others, <hi>VVe are of
Socinus.</hi> These, to the blemish, and reproach of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have been made names of strife and faction, Yet they have
been great and learned names; though some of them, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
have been lyable to humane Errours. But if you consider the
many rents and separations into which the ordinary sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have for some years divided themselves, either you will find
no names at all for them, or names so unlearned, so obscure, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
mechanick, and unconsiderable, that it will be your won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how such vulgar, rude, untaught Teachers should draw Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
after them. It would pose me very much to tell you by any
Monument of learning, or piety, which he hath left behind him to
be knowne by, who was the Father, or first bringer up of the Sect
of the Brownists; or who was the first Author of the Sect of the
Anabaptists. I know there were Anabaptists in divers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
times; and I know too, that the Parent of that Sect then,
though he were an Hereticke, yet hee was a Scholler. But as for
the Auther of the Sect of the Anabaptists of our times, I cannot
well say what he was. One who hath written the History of their
wilde proceedings at <hi>Munster,</hi> (where they begun with the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Church of Jesus Christ, and proceeded at length to
three wives a piece) saies, hee was a Dutch Botcher; one who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paird
old Germents under a stall at <hi>Leyden</hi> in the Low-Countries;
Another sayes, he was a Garmane Cobler; A third, that hee was
a Westphalia Needle-maker; But another controlls that, and saies
he was a Westphalia Baker. But whatever hee were, have not we
in our times seens Patriarches and Prophets, as vulgar and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick,
as unlearned and base as he? Men who have invaded the
Pulpit. I will not say, from mending old breeches, or cobling old
shooes, (pardon the homelinesse of the expression I beseech you,
it is but the Historians Latine translated into my English) but from
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59335:13"/>
Trades so meane, so dis-ingenuous, so illiberall, that I should
defile your eares, and the Pulpit to describe them: And yet, have
not these moderne shades of <hi>Muntzer, John of Leyden, Rotman,
Knippenburge, Knipperdolling, Melchior Hoffman,</hi> the great
Enthusiasts, and disturbers of <hi>Germany,</hi> to the Astonishment of all
Judging men, drawn Disciples after them, I wish I could only say,
as meane, and base, and vulgar as themselves? Certainly, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
consider the parallel well betweene the inspired Troublers
of our Kingdome, and those, who by their wild Doctrines did set
<hi>Westphalia, Saxony, Munster,</hi> and all the noblest parts of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Empire in a flame, and you will finde, that in this sad Eclipse
of Monarchy among us, there wants onely a <hi>Sarcinator,</hi> or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
to assume to himselfe the Crowne, and to be called by a
<hi>Sanedrim</hi> or privy Councell of the like Trades, <hi>Rex Justitiae, &amp; novae
Jerusalem Imperator,</hi> King of Righteousnesse, and Emperour of
the new Jerusalem, to make our case the very same with theirs.</p>
            <p>Againe, in this diversitie of Guides and pastors, (Pastors scarce
fit to be Overseers of unreasonable Flocks) do we not also hear as
great a diversity of language spoken? The Lay-Preacher accuseth
the University-man with want of the Spirit; and we of the Uai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
doe backe again account such Lay-men mad. Nay among us
Schollars, they who pretend to <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine, doe banish all
those out of the state of salvation, who deny absolute Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Or hold not, that from all eternity without any respect of
their workes or actions, whether they be good or bad, God hath
past this sad irreversible sentence and decree, That some shall neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
be saved, others shall as necessarily be damned. They who
thinke this a piece of Stoicisme, or a Doctrine brought into the
world to drive People to despaire, doe equally banish those from
the state of salvation, who thus uncharitably banish others. But
what speake I to you of this Congregation of such high, schollarly
dissentious? or discourse to you of disputes and controversies, not
in the power of Scripture, Synods, or Generall Councells to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide?
That which hath more troubled the peace of our distracted
Kingdome, hath been a strife of words about things as small as
Cummin, or Annise And about that part of the Kingdome of
heaven, which lies not wrapt up in an insearchable <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or an
eternall sentence of Gods concealed Will, but in a grain of mustard-seed:
A little, sleight indifferent Ceremony, or piece of Church-Discipline.
One hath called it an Idolatry to make an obeysance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59335:14"/>
in the Church; another hath call'd it a piece of Gods outward
worship to doe so. One hath stiled the Crosse in Baptisme a signe
of Superstition; another hath stiled it the marke, and badge, and
embleme of his Christianity and profession. One calls all Pictures
in Church windowes, Idols; another looks on them as so much
holy story, brought into Imagery and Colours. The very garments
we weare have not escaped contradiction. One calls the Surplice
a Romish vesture; another calls it a white robe of Innocence, and
Decencie. Nay our very Prayers and Devotions have not been free
from quarrels. Whilst some have called the Lords Prayer, A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
forme, enjoyned by Christ to be said as it is; others most irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently
have called it a Taylors Measure, fit onley to cut out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Petitions by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>In this miserable diversity of sides, then, where Countrymen, and
men of the same speech, doe so ordinarily speak divers languages,
What why is there left to beget a peace and union among us?</p>
            <p>Truly, my brethren, I know none so fit as that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
here prescribes in this Text; a way, which if it were well practised,
or if men would either have more charity, or lesse gall in them,
would in time beget an union and agreement between all
Churches; that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that we all speake the
same thing.</hi> That is, first, that wee lay aside all those odious,
hatefull names and words of reproach, which serve onely to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
and engender strifes, and to beget a dislike of one mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with another; that the honest, strict, regular, heedfull,
conscientious man, be no longer called a Puritane, nor his wife a
holy Sister; Nor the free, sociable, affable, open, harmlesly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssrupulous
man, be any longer called a Papist, or Atheist, or by
way of reproach, a Cavallier. I speak not now of the adulterous,
swearing, riotous, lying, drinking, covetous man; these are such,
that one of the wayes to reforme them, is to call them by their
right names.</p>
            <p>Next, that we no longer, as our interest, or affections, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
or education, or customes sway us, pin our beleefe or faith
upon any one Particular Guide or Teacher, so irremoveably, as
without comparison or examination to reject and desplse al others.
I am of opinion we should quickly make one Church againe, if
those new-borne names and words of <hi>Independent</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> did
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59335:14"/>
not divide us. And I am also Perswaded, that our severall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines
and Doctrines have not kept the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at a greater
distance with us, then the style and compellation of <hi>Protestant</hi> and
<hi>Papist</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that we Schollars, in those high mysterious poynts which
have equall argument and proofe on both sides, and which both
sides (for ought I know) may hold yet meet in heaven, doe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiously
or peremptorily betake our selves to neither; But either lay
them aside, as things of meere contemplation, not of practise or
use; or else speak of them to the people, onely in that generall
sense wherein all sides agree, and as that generall sense is laid downe
to us in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that in matters of Ceremony and forme, things either
altogether indifferent, or at most, neither enjoyned, nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the Scripture, that our carriage and words be alwayes as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:
That we call not that scandalous which is decent; or
that decent which is scandalous: That we presse not things as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
which are meerly ornamentall; nor impose ornaments as
things of necessity. That where no well-establisht Law is broken by
it, both in Actions and Language, where ever we come, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
our selves to the harmelesse (though to us unusuall) custome
of the place: Herein imitating that sure example of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> by being
<hi>strong with the strong,</hi> and <hi>weak with the weak,</hi> as neere as we can, to
<hi>become all things to all men.</hi> In things meerly Ceremoniall, to part
with our Christian liberty, and peaceably to yeeld to those, who,
being otherwise perswaded, will contentiously refuse to part with
theirs. And where our salvation, or the salvation of our neighbour
is not concerned, charitably to comply, and sort with their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
neither crossing them by our practice, though perhaps the
better, nor perplexing them with our disputes, though perhaps the
more rationall: But if it be possible, as much as lies in us, not only
to have peace with all men in words and speech, but in society, and
conversation, and Church-Assemblies too: Which is the next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Unity here petitioned for, that is, an unity of meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the same house of God, set downe in these words, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you Brethren, that there be no divisions among you.</hi>
            </p>

               </gap>: A word which
signifies not every kinde of rent, or division, or disagreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men; but such a division onely as is accompanied with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
unreasonable deniall of society and communion together in
the same Church. A division which carries with it an obstinate sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
upon unnecessary grounds. Which unnecessary separation
upon weake, slight grounds, is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here in this
Text, by way of difference and distinction from lighter Rents, calls
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Schismes. A sin, my Brethren, of which if I should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to you at large, and should shew you the hainousness of it,
by its dangerous effects; I might tell you that it is not only a sin
against the sociable nature of men, who are borne for Communion
and Commerce, and the mutuall help of one another; but it is a
sin directly against that unity and peace, which Christ, as his last Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
bequeath'd to his Church. A sin, which (besides the unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
opinion which accompanies it, which is, that they who are
separated from, must therefore be separated from, because they
are wicked, deplorably wicked men, men reprobated, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lost in the wayes of Errour, and with whom all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is destructive to our Salvation) doth not alwaies confine it
selfe within the retired, sequestred limits of a bare separation.
But that which at first began from a scruple, hath many times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to a Tragedy and massacre. They who at first causelesly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
themselves from their Brethren, because they were wicked,
have many times, as their strength and numbers have encouraged
them, and as the time hath favoured their Reformation (as they
have called it) proceeded from the rectifying of mens Errors, to
the lessening of their fortunes. And they only have at length been
called the wicked, who have been rich, and have had estates to lose.</p>
            <p>That onely which I shall further say to you of it, is this: Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is a sin which hath alwaies veyl'd it selfe in the disguise of
sanctity. Thus <hi>Montanus,</hi> and his followers broke off Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the whole Christian Church then in the world, because,
forsooth, 'twas revealed to them by divine illumination, that the
Holy Ghost was no where to be found but in their Conventicle.
An Heresie, which beginning in Schisme proceeded at length to
this monstrous conceit among them, That only the house of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59335:15"/>
was the true, Church, and that <hi>Montanus</hi> himselfe was the
Holy Ghost. Thus also the <hi>Donatists</hi> (an over-scrupulous Sect of
men) divided themselves from the then Catholique Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was not pure enough for such sanctified Communicants; nor
complied with the inspired doctrines of the Father of that Sect.
And this, it seems, was the fault of these <hi>Corinthians</hi> here in this
Text; who having intitled themselves to severall Teachers, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by degrees to divide themselves into severall Churches and
Congregations: every one of which challenging to themselves the
true and right Religion, and charging the others with the name of
the false, thought at length that no way was left to keep themselves
pure and unspotted, but by breaking off all Religious, nay Civill
Commerce and Communion with each other. Hence, for feare of
infection, it was held a crime for any but the Righteous, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
or converse with any but the Righteous; or for any to meet
together at a spirituall Exercise, but such who first agreed in the
same purity of Opinions.</p>
            <p>Here, then, if I may once more take the liberty to parallel one
people with another; is not this our very case? Hath it not been the
practice of many, many yeares, for those who call themselves the
godly, the righteous, the children of the most High, to breake off
society and communion, nay almost neighbourly civility, with those
whom they call the wicked? As there were among the Jewes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
uncleane places, and things, and persons, which whosoever
toucht were for that time uncleane too; so, hath not the like opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
past among us, that there have been certaine unholy, un sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
places, and persons, which make those who touch, or approach
neer them unholy too? Have not some Pulpits been thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified,
because, forsooth, the Preacher hath been ungifted? And
wherein, I pray, hath his ungiftedness appeared? Because hee
hath not expressed himself in that light, fluent, running, passionate,
zealous stile, which should make him for that time seem religiously
distracted, or beside himselfe? Or because his Prayer or Sermon
hath been premeditated, and hath not flowne from him in such
an <hi>Ex tempore</hi> loose careere of devout emptinesses and nothings,
as serve onely to entertaine the people, as Bubbles doe children,
with a thin, unsolid, brittle, painted blast of wind and ayre? Or
because, perhaps, the sands of his Glasse have not fleeted for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59335:16"/>
two tedious houres together with nothing but the bold insolent
defamation and reviling of his Prince?</p>
            <p>Againe, have there not been some who have thought our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
unholy, because the Common-Prayer Booke hath been read
there? And have renounced the Congregation, where part of the
Service hath been tuned through an Organ? Hath not a dumb Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
in the window driven some from the Church? And in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of the Oratories, have not some in the heat and zeale of
their Separation, turned their Parlours, Chambers, and Dining-roomes
into Temples, and Houses of Prayer? Nay, hath not Christ
been worshipt in places yet more vile and mean? In places, which
have reduced him the second time to a Stable? If I should aske the
people of both Sexes, who are thus given to separation, and with
whom a Repetition in a Chamber edifies more then a learned Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the Church, upon what religious grounds, or motives either
taken from the Word of God, (which is so much in their mouthes)
or from reason, (which is so little in their practice) they thus affect
to single and divide themselves from others: I believe it would
pose them very much to give a satisfying Answer. Is it because the
persons from whom they thus separate themselves, are irreligious,
wicked men? Men who are Christians onely in forme, and whose
conversation carries nothing but evill example and pollution with
it? If I should grant this to be true, and should allow them to be
out-right what they call themselves, The Elect, and Godly, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones
of the earth; and other men to be outright what they call
them, The Reprobate, the wicked, the ungodly and prophane, yet
is not this warrant enough to divide or separate themselves from
them. Nor are they competent Judges of this, but God only, who
by the mouth of his Son, hath told us in the Parable, that the wheat
and corne is not to be separated from the chaffe and tarres when we
list, but that both are to grow together till the great harvest of the
world. Till then 'tis a piece of the building of it, that there bee a
commixture of good and bad.</p>
            <p>Besides, let me put this Christian <hi>Dilemma</hi> to them: either the
persons from whom they divide themselves are holy or unholy: If
they be holy, they are not to separate themselves from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are like themselves; If they be unholy, they are in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to converse with them, that they may reforme and make them
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59335:16"/>
better. Did not our Saviour Christ (and certainely his example is
too great to be refused) usually converse with Publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
Did he forsake the Table, because a Pharisee made the Feast?
Or did he refuse a perfume, because a harlot powred it on his head?
Or did he refuse to goe up into the Temple, because buyers and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
were there, men who had turned it into a den of Theeves? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
my Brethren, we may, like Christ, keep company with Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,
and Hypocrites, and Publicans and Sinners, and yet retaine
our innocence. 'Tis a weake excuse to say, I will never consort my
selfe with a swearer, lest I learne to blaspheme: Or, I will utterly
renounce all familiarity and acquaintance with such and such an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer,
or with such and such a Drunkard, lest I learne to commit
Fornication from the one, or Intemperance from the other. In all
such conversations, we are to imitate the Sun, who shines into the
foulest puddles, and yet returnes from thence with a pure untainted
Ray. If mens vices then, and corruptions, bee not a sufficient cause
to warrant a separation, what else can be? Is it the place of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or Church, or the things done there, which hath made them
shun our ordinary Congregations? Yes, say some, we have held it
very unlawfull (as we conceive) to assemble in such a place, where
we have seen Altars, and Windowes worshipped, superstitious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
worne, and have heard the more superstitious Common-Prayer
Booke read, that great bolster to slothfull Ministers, and
twin-brother to the Mass, and Liturgie of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were this Charge true, (a very heavy one, I confess) had there
been any among us so unreasonably stupid, as to spend their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on a pane of glass, or pay worship to the dumb sensless crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Painter, or adore the Communion-Table, the wooden
issue of the Axe and Carpenter, (as I think there were none) had
there (I say) been very Idolaters among us, yet unlesse they would
have compelled them to be Idolaters too, I (after all the imparciall
Objections which my weake understanding can frame) can see no
reason why they should not communicate with them in other
things wherein they were no Idolaters. I am sure, if <hi>S. Paul</hi> had
not kept company with Idolaters, we to this day (for ought I know)
had remained Infidels.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, deceive not your selves with a fallacy, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
child is able to discover. If such superstitions had been publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59335:17"/>
practised among us, it is not necessary that every one that is a
spectator to anothers mans, sin, should presently be an offender. Nor
are all offences so like the Pestilence, that he that comes within the
breath and ayre of them, must needs depart infected. Thou seest
one, out of a blind zeale, pay reverence to a picture, he hath the
more to answer for. But why dost thou, out of zeale altogether
as blind, thinke thy selfe so interested in his errour, as to thinke
thy self a partaker of his fault, unless thou excommunicate thy selfe
from his coversation.</p>
            <p>Againe, tell me thou, who callest Separation security; what seest
thou in a Surplice, or hearest in the Common-Prayer Booke, which
should make thee forbeare the Congregation where these are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?
Is it the web, or matter, or colour, or fashion of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or is it the frame or forme, or indevotion of the Book which
offends thee? Or art thou troubled because they have both beene
borrowed from the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> That indeed is the great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of exception; which under the stile of Popery, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
turned Religion it selfe out of the Church. But, then, it is so
weake, so accidentall, so vulgar an Argument, an Argument so fit
for none to urge but silly women, with whom the first impression
of things alwaies takes strongliest, that I must say in replie to it,
That by the same reason, that thou poore, tender-conscienc'd man,
(who art not yet past milke, or the food of infants in the Church)
makest such an innocent, decent vesture as Surplices, unlawfull,
because Papists weare them, thou mayest make eating and drinking
unlawfull, because Papists dine and sup. The subject is not high or
noble enough to deserve a more serious confutation. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which I shall say by way of Repetition, is onely this: If to
weare or do, whatever Papists weare or doe be unlawfull, as it will
presently concerne us all to throw off our garments and turne <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damites,</hi>
so it will very neerely concern us too, to lay aside our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and betake our selves to fasting, as the ready way to famine.
Then to reject the Common-Prayer Book, because some of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in it resemble the Prayers in the Romish Liturgie, is as unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
as if thou shouldst make piety and devotion in generall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
because Papists say their Prayers. And so, in opposition to
whatever they do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shouldst think thou art to turne Athiest, because
most in that Church do confess there is a God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59335:17"/>
The time wil not give me leave to say much in the defence of that
excellent Book; Or, if I should, tis in any thing, I presume, which
can fall from my imperfect mouth, which wil be able to recover the
use of it back again into this Church. Yet thus much, out of the
just sense, and apprehension which I have of the wisedome, as well
as piety, and devotion of it, I shall adventure to say. That I cannot
think, that ever any Christian Church, since the time that that name
first came into the world, had a publique forme of Gods Worship,
more Primitively pure, more Religiously grave, and more agreeable
in all points to the Scripture, then that is.</p>
            <p>To which I shall only add this one praise of it more, that there is
not any Ancient, Classically condemned Heresie, to be found in the
Records of Councells, Church-Histories, or the Confutations of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which is not by some clause or other in that most Orthodox
Book excluded.</p>
            <p>Here, then, if there be any in this Assembly of that il-perswaded
mind, that he would not at this present make one of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if the Common-prayers were read, let me once more ask him,
what that great Antipathie between him, and that admirable Book
is, which should make them quarrel one another out of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Is it because it prescribes a Ring in marriage, or a Cross in Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me?
over-scrupulous man! who would'st rather choose to make a
rent and schisme, and division in the Church, then be spectatour to
th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs so harmless, and indifferent. But thy weak Conscience is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Weak, indeed, when a piece of marriage-Gold, or a little water
sprinkled in the signe, and figure of a cross, the Type, and Emblem
of thy Christianity, shall drive thee from the Church. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to you freely, if such things, as the veneration of images, or ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of Altars, or sacrifices for the dead, or the worshiping of
the Hoste, or the Mass-book, with all the unsignificant <hi>Ave Maryes,</hi>
and superstitious prayers, which use to trauell round the Circle of a
numerous set of Beads, had been establisht among us by publique Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
And had been enforced upon the practice, and Consciences of
men, and no Liberty of person, or freedome of estates allow'd them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they would conform to the present Golden Calf of superstition set
up before them, a separation had not only been allowable, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59335:18"/>
We would have offended God very much to be partakers of such
dross. And our best Answer would have been the Answer of the
Three Children,<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 16.</note> when the King would have had them fall down to
the huge image, and <hi>Colossus</hi> which he had set up, <hi>O King, we are
not carefull to observe thee in this matter.</hi> But where no such
things were enjoyned, where every one was left to the full use and
exercise of his Christian liberty, where nothing was blameable among
us, but the ridiculous, over-acted postures and gestures of some few
busie, fantasticall men, whose Popery lay in makeing discreet men
laugh, to see them so artificially devout, and so affectedly ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to divide, and separate, or to give us over for a lost Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Psalmes of <hi>David,</hi> after his own Musicall way, used to be
sung to an Organ; As innocently, certainly, as if they had been tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
through his own loud Cymball, or had more softly been sung, and
vowell'd to his Harpe: Or to renounce our solemne Assemblies, for
such sleight, indifferent things, as a piece of holy story in a glass win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
or because the Minister wears white, or because marryed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
come together by a Ring, or because the Lords Prayer is more
then once repeated, is not only Schisme, and I may safely say, Schisme
upon scandall taken, not giuen, but tis directly contrary to S <hi>Pauls</hi>
advice, here in this Text; who is so far from tolerating any such need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
divisions, and separations of presences and bodies, that he will
not allow in the same Church and Congregation the least dissent
or division of minds; But makes it the least part of his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his disagreeing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they would not only meet
together in the same place of Gods Worship, but that they would
be <hi>perfectly joyned together in the same mind, and in the
same judg-ment,</hi> which is the last part of the Text. To which
I shall only adde some brief Application of some things in
this Sermon to you my hearers, and so commend you to God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>'Twas well said of one of the Philosophers, (which saying of his
hath since almost grown into a Prouerb of truth) <hi>Nihil est in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectu,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Unity of minds</note>
               <hi>quod non fuit priùs in sensu;</hi> That there is nothing in the
understanding, or mind within, which was not first in the sense with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
Tis as great, and measured a Truth, that there is nothing
in our speech, or words, or actions without, which was not first in
our mind, or wil, or affections within. For what our Saviour Christ
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59335:18"/>
said, that <hi>Out of the heart proceed evill thought's, murthers, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 17.</note>
               <hi>thefts, false witness, blasphemies,</hi> and the like; to every
one of which sins without, belongs some secret, invisible spring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
As, I say, to every Adultery without, belongs some hidden lust
within; and the uncleannesse of the body is but the soul issue, and
off-spring of the soul; And as to every murther without, belongs
some secret envy, or hatred, or thirst of revenge within; and the
rancour of the heart only clothes it self in the violence and bloud-shed
of the hand: so we may say of our Divisions, and Disagreements
too. All those odious words, and names of mutuall infamy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
all those perverse crossings, and thwartings, and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of speech; all this duell, and skirmish, and quarrelsomeness of
language; Lastly, all this shunning and lothing of one anothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
all this separation, and denyall of communion, which we so
ordinarily see exercised, and practiced without, are but so many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
behaviours, which take their originall and birth from as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
grudges, and prejudices, and jealousies, and mis-apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
within. Never man yet dissented from another in speech, but
he first dissented from him in opinion: And never man yet separated
from another in communion, but he first separated from him in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and will. To remove, therefore, the root and spring of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements,
as well as the current and stream; and to beget a peace,
and concord, and reconciliation without, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> like a skilfull
Artist, who reserves the hardest part for the last, proceeds from mens
words and actions, to their opinions and thoughts: and like those
who fet Watches, and Clocks, where the Hand upon the Dyall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
cannot move regularly, unless the weights and springs which
guide it, move orderly within; the better to make us go all alike, and
strike the same time, he endeavors to setle and compose those inward
wheels, by which our words and behaviors without, are to be ruled
and governed.</p>
            <p>The thing then for which he here so earnestly Petitions, is Unity,
and Agreement, and Consent of minds. Which, in plain terms, is to
exhort us, that as we are all men of one and the same reasonable kind,
formed and created like one another in the shape and figure of our
body, so that we would approve our selves to be men
of one and the same reasonable kinde, in the Musique and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59335:19"/>
Harmony of our souls too. Which would then come to pass, if every
one of us would by the impartiall search, and examination of his own
mind, dislodg those mists and clouds of errour, which blind him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
himself, and benight him towards others. Or, if he cannot do
this by the strength and diligence of his own naturall Forces, that he
would have recourse to those who are most able to pluck this beam
out of his eye; and whose work and business it is so to apply their
Cures, as by proposing that one, constant, immutable, eternall, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Truth to his mind, in which tis possible for all minds well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
to concenter and agree, by degrees to reduce him from his
blindness and errour, and to make him not only speak, but conceive,
and think the same things with him that taught him.</p>
            <p>It was wel said of him, who compared our minds to Looking-glasses,
or Mirrours; For certainly if we could but keep them open, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded,
they carry this property of Mirrours with them, not only
to return the images, and shapes, and truths of things, which pass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them as they are; but all minds in a clearer, or less clear degree,
have a capacity to receive into them the truth of the same things
alike. As a thousand Glasses, if they be true, successively lookt in,
wil shew us the same faces: But then, as Glasses, if they be false,
wil cast false resemblances; or if they be discoloured, wil transform all
things which flow into them into their own die: So tis with us. I
know not how it comes to pass, or whether I may ascribe the fault to
Education, or Custome, or to our parents, or to our Affections, too
much knit, and wedded to the Religion, or Doctrin, or Opinion,
or Teacher, which most complyes with our Fancies; but there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ill-cut, false-reporting minds, which look upon men, and things,
in another size and figure then they are. Other minds there are stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and died (as it were) with certain weak prejudices, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
opinions; through which, as through so many deceiving colours,
they discern no truths which wear not that hue. As he that looks
through a green Glass, takes all things for green; and he that looks
through a blew Glass, takes all things for azure. And this was the
very case of these <hi>Corinthians</hi> here in the Text. They first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
themselves over-partially to severall Teachers; and
from their severall Teachers, took in severall apprehensions,
as they pleased to like or affect him above others, whose Disciples
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59335:19"/>
they called themselves. Some, though they did not well understand
what they held, resolved (without any examination what they were)
to be only of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> opinions: Others resolved to hold only
what had been taught them by <hi>Apollos:</hi> Others resolved to hold
only what had been preacht by S. <hi>Peter.</hi> All which three taught and
preacht one and the same Gospell; yet that Gospel was not alike en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by all hearers.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10.</note> Whilst some disliked it in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> because
(as himself complains) he was of an humble presence, and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
utterance. Others dislike it, perhaps, in the mouth of <hi>Apollos,</hi>
because it came Rhetorically from him, and he was guilty of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying
crime, forsooth, of being eloquent in the Pulpit. Others
perhaps entertain'd it coldly from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> because he had not been
bred up in the School of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> nor tasted of the finer Arts and
educations of <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, one and the same saving Truth, for want of a little right
judgment in the Hearers to compare it, comming from several mouths,
past into divers opinions first; and then these opinions broke forth
into divers factions. And is not this, my Bretheren, our very case?
Do but consider the present distempers of our poor, divided King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and, pray, what hath been the true root and spring of so
much variance, and hatred, and heart-burning among us? What hath
crumbled us asunder, and turn'd one of the purest, and most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Churches of the world, into a heap of Heresies and confusion?
Hath it not been the very word of God it self? In which all minds, I
confess, should agree, and which should be the rule to compose all
our strifes; and before whose decisions the greatest Scholars Disputes,
and the meanest mans Doubts, should fall down, and mutually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
and kiss each other. How comes it then to pass, that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was ordained by God to be the oyl to cure our wounds,
should prove only the oyl to feed, and nourish our combustious?
Whence is it, that the Scripture, that Sword of the Spirit, should
prove to us only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a two-edged sword, and that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
use should be made of it by us, but only to be the weapon of
our Conflicts, by committing the edges, and making them enter
duell, and combat with each other? Truly, my bretheren, all the
reason that I can give you for this, is, That some (perhaps wel mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people, but not of understandings either strong, or learned enough
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59335:20"/>
to reach the true sense and meaning of some places) have stept beyond
their measure; and have presumed to interpret more then they have
well understood. Others, of a more modest, but credulous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
have thought that only to be the right meaning of the
Word of God, which they have heard from the mouth of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
which they most affect. Others, of a more dangerous policy,
finding that the Scripture rightly expounded would extreamly make
against the plot of their dark proceedings, and that the holy Ghost
cannot be bribed to finde Texts to make covetousness, sedition, or
the slaughter of their Brethren, or Rebellion against their Prince,
lawfull; have, with some formall helps of piety, and zeal, put to
their expositions, made the Scripture speak only those plausible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes,
which most complied with their ends, and the peoples Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Hence, the better to arrive to their Estates, by the distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their minds, they have dealt with them as cunning Anglers
do with silly fishes, troubled the stream, and blinded them, and
then made them their prey. The way to do this was to affront,
and disgrace, clamour down all the primitive Truths for some
Generations taught among them; and to recall from their sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,
and dust, all the old, intricate, long since buried Opinions,
which were the madnesse of their own times, and the Civill
Warre of ours. With which opinions they have dealt, as the
Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> dealt with her Familiar, raised them up to the
people clothed in a long mantle, and speaking to them in the shape
and voyce of a Prophet. Hence come those severall acceptions,
and interpretations among you, even in your ordinary discourses,
of one and the same plaine, but sinisterly understood places of
Scripture. One, following the practice of all the purest ages of
the Church, thinkes the Sacrament of Baptisme is to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to Infants. Others, (who would certainly be a strange sight
to the Congregation, if they should appear the second time at
the Font) of late are taught to thinke that none are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
but such as are old enough to be their owne Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and can enter into Covenant with God, and promise
for themselves. Some, because it hath beene called a binding of
the spirit, to fetter their devotions in a set forme of Prayer, have
banisht that Prayer, which Christ prescribed to his Apostles, out of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59335:20"/>
their Closets, as well as Temples. Others, of as rectified a piety,
think no Prayer so likely to finde acceptance with God, as that which
was conceived, and put into forme by his Sonne. I should tire your
patience too much to give you an exact Catalogue of all the rotten
opinions which at this present swarm among us. One who hath
computed the Heresies, which have sprung up in this Kingdome
within these five years, sayes, they have doubled the number of
those which were in Saint <hi>Austins</hi> time; and then they were very
neer fourscore. One is a <hi>Chiliast,</hi> and holds the personall Reigne
of Christ upon Earth. Another is a <hi>Corporealist,</hi> and holds the death
of the Soul with the Body. Nay, as 'tis said in <hi>Africke,</hi> a Lyon
will couple with a Tyger, from whence will spring a Libbard; so
certain strange, unheard-of, double-sex't Heresies are sprung up
among us: not able to understand what he would hold himselfe.
You shall have an <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Sabellian</hi> lodged together in the same
person. Nay, (which is yet worse) whatever <hi>Celsus</hi> spoke in scorn,
and <hi>Origen</hi> in vindication of our Redeemer, Christ and his Mother,
hath of late trodden the Stage again, and appeared to disturbe the
World. One (I tremble to speak it) hath called the Virgin <hi>Maryes</hi>
chastity into question; And others have spoken of the Saviour of
the World so suspiciously as if he had been a thing, of a stoln, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
Birth. In short, there want only some of those <hi>Munster</hi>
men among us, of whom <hi>Sleydan</hi> writes, where one calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<hi>God the Father,</hi> another <hi>God the Sonne,</hi> A third Paraclete, or
<hi>God the holy Ghost,</hi> to make our Babel and confusion of wilde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
at the height. In this miserable distraction, then, where He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
and Errour, hath almost eaten up the true Religion; And where
all the light at the Gospel, which shines among us, is but like that
imperfect light at the Creation, which shined before the Sunne was
placed in the firmament; A light creeping forth of a dark Chaos and
blind masse, and strifefull heape of jarring Elements: In this thick
fogge of strange Doctrines, I say, which hath condenst it selfe into
a cloud, which hath almost overspread this whole Kingdome, from
which Truth seemes to have taken slight, and made way for <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
to stile it selfe once more <hi>the Mother of devotion,</hi> what way
is there left to reconcile our minds, or to beget one right knowledge,
and understanding of the wayes of God among us? Truly,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59335:21"/>
I know none but that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here prescribes in the Text;
which is, that we endeavour as near as we can, to be <hi>of one mind,
and of one judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how shall this be brought to pass, unless all judgments were
alike clear, and unbiassed? Or, unless, laying apart all partiality, and
affection to their own side, and all prejudice, and hatred against those
from whom they differ, men would submit themselves to him, who
is best able to instruct them; Or who can bring with him the most
saving Truths into the Pulpit? Besides, (may some one say) if people
should bring minds prepared to entertain the Truth, where is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor
so infallible, or so opinionated of the strength of his own gifts
and knowledg, that another pretending to the same Truth, may not
challenge to himself the like infallibility? who shall be the Judg of
Controversies? or who shall present Truth to us with such known
marks and notes about it, that as soon as tis presented, every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
(of what mean capacities soever) shall presently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and entertain it? Wil you, Sir, who have all this while thus
bemoaningly pitied our divisions? We are bound to thank you for
your charity to us; and should be desirous enough to imbrace a truth
of your description. But you are a Scholar, whose parts and abilities
lye in the humane modell, and building of your own secular studies.
We are therefore bid to doubt very much, whether you have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and are told by some who profess themselves inspired, that all
your Readings, and Studyings, and tyrings of your self over a difficult
piece of Scripture, at midnight perhaps, when all others sleep, by a
lone, solitary, dumb candle, are but so many labours in vain, Since
tis impossible for any to understand the Scripture aright, but such on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
who have it revealed to them by the same holy Spirit that wrote
it.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, what shall I say to you? Modesty, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
I have of my own imperfections, wil not allow me to say pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily,
that I have the Spirit of God. Or if I could distinguish
his secret influences and assistances from the operations of my own
soul, or could certainly say I have him, (which S, <hi>Paul</hi> himself durst
not say definitively) yet 'twould not become me so to confine him to
my frail, narrow parts, as to deny him to all others more learned
then my self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59335:21"/>
For the setling therefore, and composing of your divided
minds, I will not take upon me to be the Judge of Controversies,
but you your selves shall be. Onely the better to enable you to
performe this charitable office to your selves, and for your better
direction how not to be out in your judgement, as a sure clue to
guide you through the perplext windings of that labyrinth into
which some of you are falne, so falne, that they seem to me quite
lost in a wood of mistakes, where every path is a guide, and every
guide is an error, give me leave to commend to you that seasonable
advice of Saint <hi>John,</hi> which he delivers in the fourth Chapter of
his first Epistle, at the first verse, where (as if he had prophecyed
of our times) he sayes, <hi>Beloved, beleeve not every spirit, but try the
spirits whether they be of God: because many false Prophets are gone out
into the world.</hi> In which words; you have two of the best Rules
assigned you to go by, that can possibly be prescribed for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of minds.</p>
            <p>First, be not too credulous; Doe not presently beleeve every
man that sayes he hath the Spirit; nor suffer your selves to be tost
and carried about with every wind of doctrine: For that is not
the way to be all of one, but of as many severall minds as the art or
cunning of severall Teachers shall please to work upon you. I am
perswaded this easinesse of belief, this credulity, or (as the Apostle
calls it) this admiration, this overvaluing of some mens persons,
hath been one of the great parents of our present dissentions:
whilst some weak, but yet well-minded people, building their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
meerly upon the outward appearances of men, have mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the zeal and strict life of their Preacher for his sufficiency. And
taking their Logicke from the precisenesse of his behaviour, have
framed these charitable, but false conclusions to themselves: He
is a man of a composed countenance, of a reserved speech, of a
grave carriage, and of a devout elocution, therefore surely he is a
holy man. And because he is a holy man, therefore whatever hee
saies, shall be to us Oracle; as coming from the mouth of one, so
much in the favour of God, that it is impossible he should deceive
us, or speak that which is not right.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, I have no designe or purpose to bring Holinesse
into contempt; nor can I bee so injurious to piety or a good life,
where ever I find it, as to expose it to the scorne of the licentious,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59335:22"/>
by not giving it its due. I am so farre also from lending encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the lives of vitious Teachers, (Teachers who are the shame
of their Mother, and the scandall of their Flock) that I could wish
that every Congregation in England were furnished with such an
exemplary Minister, that his life as well as preaching, might be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the people. Nay, give me leave, I beseech you, to extend
my charity yet one degree farther. I am so farre from disliking ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
either in Preacher or people, that I wish we all made but
one united Kingdome of Priests. Or, if you will have me expresse
my selfe in the words of one of the holiest and meekest men of
the earth,<note place="margin">Numb. 11. 29.</note> I could wish that <hi>all the Lords People were Prophets.</hi> But,
then, you must give me leave to say too, That holinesse and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and austerity of life, are no infallible signes that the Preacher
may not erre. Nor hath God so annext the understanding of his
Word to the unstudied, unlearned piety, or sober carriage of the
Expounder, that he that is most zealous shall still bee most in the
right.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 7.</note> As long as that saying of S. <hi>Paul</hi> remaines upon record, That
we hold this <hi>treasure,</hi> this knowledge of Gods Will,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in earthen vessells;</hi> As long as the Preacher, how holy soever
he be, is so much one of the people, as to dwell in a fraile, weake
Tabernacle of clay; Lastly, as long as men are men, they will bee
liable to mens infirmities. And as the learned scandalous Preacher
may be sometimes in the right; so it is possible that the ignorant,
zealous, holy Preacher may be often in the wrong. How to know
this, and how to distinguish them, therefore, you are to make use
of the next Rule prescribed to you by Saint <hi>John;</hi> that is, when
you heare an Exposition, or a Sermon, or a new Doctrine preached
to you, not rashly, without distinction or choice to consent to it,
till you have past the impartiall sentence of a cleare judgement on
it; compared and weighed Sermon with Sermon, and Preacher
with Preacher; called every Doctrine, every Proofe, every confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Assertion to the touch-stone, and measured it by some plaine
evident place of Scripture; and examined whether the Holy Ghost,
or his owne vaine, popular ambition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have for that time inspired
the speaker; or whether his Sermon have had some dissembled, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
end, or Gods glory for its marke. And this Saint <hi>John</hi> calls,
<hi>trying of the spirits;</hi> which is then done, when (as I said before) you
reduce what you heare spoken by the Preacher to the infallible Rule
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59335:22"/>
of Truth, the Word of God; and make that, well cons<gap reason="illegible: fold" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>ed, the
scales to weigh his Doctrine in. Does hee preach charity, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
strife from his Pulpit? Does he not flatter Vice, though he
find it clothed in Purple, nor speak neglectfully of Vertue, though
he finde it clothed in rags? Does he strive to plant the feare and
love of God in his Auditory, the forgivenesse of their enemies,
and pity towards the poore? Dares he arraigne a publique sinne,
though never so fortunate? or speak in defence of afflicted Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
though over-borne by oppression? Dares he maintaine his
Christian courage in Tyrannicall, doubtfull times? And dares he call
prosperous Sedition, but a more successefull mischiefe? Lastly, does
he preach such Christian Truths for which some holy men have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to which he himselfe would not be affraid to fall a sacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This, this man is to be hearkned to; this man is fit to bee obeyed.
And this man speaking the same things which God himselfe doth
in the Scripture, (whatever his gifts of pleasing, or not pleasing sick,
fastidious, delicate fancies be) is thus at least to be thought of, That
though he speake not by the Spirit, (as a thing entailed upon him)
yet, for that time, the Spirit speaks by him, which ought to be all
one to you. On the contrary, does the Preachers Sanctity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
consist meerly in the devout composure of his looks and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage?
Does he strive to preach downe Learning, or does he call
Study a humane folly? Does he choose his Text out of the Bible,
and make the Sermon out of his Fancy? Does he reprove Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but preach up discord? Is he passionate against Superstition,
but milde and calme towards Sacriledge? Does hee inveigh and
raile at Popery, and at the same time imitate the worst of Papists,
Jesuits, urge Texts for the Rebellion of Subjects against their
Prince, and quote Scripture for the deposing, and But chery of
Kings? Does hee startle at a dumb picture in a Church-window,
and at the same time preach all good order and right Discipline
out of the Church? Does an Oath provoke his zeale, yet does he
count lying in the godly no sin? Lastly, does hee preach separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon weake untemper'd grounds? Or does labour to divide
the minds, which hee should strive to reconcile? Let him bring
what demurenesse or composure of countenance he please into the
Pulpit; Let him, if he please, joyne sanctity of deportment to
earnestnesse of zeale; Let him never so devoutly bewaile the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59335:23"/>
of his Country, which he hath helpt to make miserable;
Or let him weepe never so passionately over the Congregation,
which he hath broken into factions; In short, how seemingly
holy, how <gap reason="illegible: fold" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, how unprophane soever his behaviour bee;
though the Scripture doe so continually over-flow in his mouth,
that hee will neither eat, nor drinke, nor speake, nor scarce sleep
but in that phrase, yet as long as he thus forgets his Charity, thus
Preaches strife, thus Division, I shall so farre mistrust whether he
have the Spirit, that I shall not doubt to reckon him in the number
of those <hi>false Prophets</hi> which S. <hi>John</hi> sayes <hi>are gone out into the
world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conclusion then of this Sermon shall be this. Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I have with all the sincerity and plainnesse which might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
your soules, preacht Truth, and Concord, and mutuall
Charity to you. I have also for some yeeres, not been so sleepy
an Observer, but that I have perceived some of you (who have
thought your selves more Religious then the rest) to be guilty of
the (I might say Crime, but I will rather say of the) mis-guided
Zeale of these <hi>Corinthians</hi> here in my Text. There have been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Divisions, and I know not what separations among you. I
have farther observed, that certaine false, causlesse prejudices and
aspersions have been raised upon our University, which to the
grief of this famous Nursery of Gods Church at home, and the
reproach of it abroad, are still kept waking against us by some of
you, as if Conscience and Religion, as well as Learning and Gifts;
had so far forsaken us, that all the Schools of the Prophets cannot
afford you a set of able, vertuous men, fit to be the Lecturers to
this soule-famisht Parish. How we should deserve to be thus mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by you, or why you should under-value those able Teachers
which you have already, or refuse to take your supply from so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Colledges which here stand present and ready to afford you
choyce: or why you should supplicate to the great Councell of this
Kingdome, in pitty to your soules, to send you Godly Teachers,
(which, perhaps, is but a well-meaning Petition from you, but
certainly 'tis a great scandall, and Libell against us) I know not.
But whatever the mysterious cause be, I am confident, that unlesse
they will sleep over their infamy and reproach, it will alwayes be
in the power of our despised University-Divines, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59335:23"/>
even to those whom you intend to petition, That this is
but a zealous errour in you: And that they are as able to edifie you,
certainly, as he, whose occupation it was to repaire the old
shooes of the Prophets. I should shame some of you too much,
who were the Disciples of that Apostle, if I should discribe him
to you by a larger character.</p>
            <p>Instead therefore of a farther vindication of the reproach
throwne upon us, that which I shall say of more neere concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to you, is this: If I have in the progresse of this Sermon,
ript open any wounds among you, it hath not been with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to enlarge, or make them bleed, but to powre wine and
Oyle into them, and to heale, and close them up.</p>
            <p>Next, If I have cleared any of your sights, or inabled you at
length to discerne, that the reason why the mote in your brothers
eye seemed so big, was, because an over-scrupulous zeale had
placed a beame in your owne; and that in contributing to the
ruine of one of the purest Religions in the world, the reason why
you have swallowed so many monstrous Camels, hath been, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
at first you made scruple, and strained at gnats, I have what
I intended: Which was to let you see, that to divide and separate
your selves from the communion of our Church, if it had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a mole or two, is as unreasonable, as if you should quarrell
the Moon out of her Orb, or think her unworthy of the skies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she wears a spot or two writ on a glorious ball of light.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if I have said any thing in the reproof of discord, or the
praise of charity, which may re-unite your minds, and make you
all men of the same heart and beliefe, as well as of the same Citie
and Corporation, I shall thinke I have done the work and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a just Divider of the World of God towards you, and of a
faithfull Servant and Steward towards my heavenly Master. Whose
blessing of peace be upon you all, together with the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost. To which
glorious Trinity, be ascribed all Honor, Praise, Dominion and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for ever. AMEN.</p>
