            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Meditating Mind is the beginner of all Goodness.

If they shall bethink themselves.</hi> He minds them of considering to bring them to returning.

He is doing the most and best business when he is imployed with his God about his own and other mens Soules.</p>
            <p>It was the great Design of the Reverend and holy Author Mr. <hi>Tho.

A few Pages of Manuscript are inserted which he left behind him for that purpose, if it came to be re-printed.</p>

a Star to shine longer in the Terrestrial World; God made use of him to turn many unto Righteousnesse, and now he is gone to Shine in the Kingdome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Parents had them when they dyed, or men in torment had any equal to them. But the Holy Ghost saith that he helpeth the infirmities of his people with sighs and groanes that cannot be expressed.

               <p>BEcause the first Verse is part of the description of the blessed man, and an Introductory also to the following words, I shall speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them. The words of the first verse are far more emphatical then they are rendred in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Translarion: For indeed our English Dialect will not bear to be translated exactly according to the Hebrew; but as near as it can be take it thus: <hi>O blessed is the man,</hi> or <hi>he man,</hi> (i. e. whoever he be rich or poor, noble or ignoble) <hi>that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornfu: But his will is in the Law of the Lord,</hi> or of <hi>Jehovah, and in

his Law he doth meditate in the day and by the night.</hi> Give me leave to gather up the Pearles that lye in the way to the Text.</p>
               <p>Let me a little consider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and excellency of the righteous mans blessedness.</p>
               <p>He is blessed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is <hi>blessedness,</hi> made up o' blessedness, blessed in his body blessed in his soul, blessed in health, blessed in sickness, blessed in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry state and condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is <hi>blessedness,</hi> blessed in the highest degree: For the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number is sometimes put for the Superlative, or else blessedness sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth all manner of blessednesses, temporal, spiritual, and eternal; if riches be a blessing, he shall have them; if poverty be a blessing, he shall have that; for sometimes pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a blessing, sometimes riches: whatsoever is a blessing he shall have</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Saint is not only bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, blessed even to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42514:10"/>
It is brought in here with an interjection, or note of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>O! blessedness is the man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Saints admire the Saints blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and it is no small matter will make the Saints admire. The glory and happiness of the world, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, which the men of the world admire at, and they despise the happiness of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="6">6. See the goodness of God, he gives the Saints happiness beyond their understanding. f God should send the Saints a book as large as Heaven, and bid us write down what we would have, we should be losers by the bargain, for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and blessedness of Saints put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Saints to a stand, and makes them silent, for admiration is, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentium intellectus.</hi> When the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding perceiveth that there is more in the object then it is able to comprehend, it leaves off making notions of the subject, it then falleth to admiring of it.

visibile,</hi> invisible, by reason of his excellency and abundance of light God may be praised well by many words but better by few, and best of all by none, but by silence, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and extasies of love and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable desire after everlasting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of him, So I say of the blessedness of Saints, surely as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in his best estate was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity, <hi>Psal. 39.</hi> So the Saint the man, whosoever he be, is in his lowest condition altogether blessed: I shall pass by the gradation of the words, as walk, stand, sit, counsel, way, seat, wicked, sinner, scornful, though one may observe by the way, one groweth wicked by degrees, but I forbear: yet this I shall observe from the coherence of these words with the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That negative divinity damneth thousands (is is <hi>Luthers</hi> expression) though we must first cease to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; before we can do good, yet it is not enough so cease to do evil but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42514:11"/>
we must also do good, for as sins of commission poyson the soul, so sins of omission starve the soul. From that his will is in the law of Jehovah, we may observe, that we should have no will of our own, the Law of God should be our will, if you would know the will of a Saint, you may find it in Gods Law, Saints will is the transcript of the Law written by the finger of God, <hi>Jer. 31. 33. I will put my Law in their inward parts</hi> saith God, <hi>and write in their hearts,</hi> if any would know what a Saint will do in such or such a case, you need not go to ask him, but see what God commandeth, he willeth nothing but what God commandeth, and whatsoever God commandeth is his will.</p>
               <p>Further, we may observe, that it is not enough to do holy duties, but we must love holy duties, for the blessed man doth not only keep to the utmost of his power, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42514:12"/>
Law, but <hi>delights</hi> in the Law, the Commandments are not grievous but delightful to him. A wicked man though he may pray, yet he loveth it not, a Saint would not for all the world that God should say to him, you shall think so oft of me in a day; it would be a great trouble to a Saint that God should forbid, as it is to a wicked man that God commandeth him to think often. But passing by these I shall choose this observation as the foundation of the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>viz.</hi> that to meditate upon the word of God, is the essential character and indispensible duty and constant practice of every one that is a true blessed man; and that this meditation on Scripture may be the easier understood and practised, I shall proceed as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the nature, kinds, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, of solemn, divine meditation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SOmething seemeth necessary to be premised concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Meditation, what it is, and how it differeth from other acts of the understanding that seem like it, and how one kind of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation differeth from another, else this treatise will be defective with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p>First, For the nature or defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Meditation we may say, that it is a serious solemn think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and considering of the things of God, to the end we might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how much they concern us, and that our hearts thereby may be raised to some holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and resolutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42514:13"/>
Secondly, Solemn Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation differeth from occasional meditation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that occasional meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are shorter, like ejaculatory prayers which though they are as parenthesis in our worldly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet they signifie more then all the rest of the business we are employed in, but meditation is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of longer duration then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary solemn prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such occasional meditations are things that we have in <hi>transitu,</hi> or by the by; and this that I speak of is a solem set duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The subject from which occasional meditations arise are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently things artificial, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or natural, indeed any thing that we see or hear but the subject of solemn meditation, are only things spiritual.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Solemn Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation differeth from study.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42514:13"/>
1. In respect of the subject, wicked men: Study and Godly men meditate, and it may be the former, study more then the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Nay it is the very distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sign between Saints and others. <hi>that they meditate in the Law of God day and night, Psal.</hi> 1. 2. And I believe it is a thing far more rare for a meditating Christian to be an hypocrite, then for a Christan that spendeth much in prayer, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be publick.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In respect of the Subject of study; so solemn meditation differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from it, for</p>
               <p n="1">1. Study is of all manner of things whether natural, civil, or artificial, or mathematical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But meditation is only of matters that concern our eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The matters that are most knotty and difficult, and generally such as afford little spiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, as Criticisms, Crenolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42514:14"/>
and controversies: but the matter of meditation is of things plain, and of great spiritual advantage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The end of Study is knowledge, but the end of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is holiness. If one seeth a learned man we may conclude that he hath been a great student; and if we see a godly man, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that that man hath medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Solemn meditation differeth from contemplation in these several particulars, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. Contemplation is more like the beatificial vision which the Angels have of God in Heaven. Mediation is like the kindling of fire and contemplation more like a fire when fully kindled; the one is like the Spouse seeking of Christ and the other is like the Spouse enjoying of Christ</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42514:14"/>
2. Contemplation is one effect and end of meditation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditation is like the Bees flying to several flowers, or like one, smelling to Flowers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and contemplation is like the smelling of them alltogether in a nosegay, or like the water that is distilled from them all. The Spouse in her description of Christ is like to meditation, her conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he is altogether lovely is like to contemplation.</p>
               <p>Now there are four kinds of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meditation according to the four several subjects of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some solemn Meditations are upon Sermons that we hear, which is a very useful and necessary practise for Christians, and it is better to hear one Sermon only and meditate on that, then to hear two Sermons and meditate on neither: neither is it necessary nor possible to set down a method for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42514:15"/>
meditating on Sermons, since th method of Sermons is so various, <hi>I</hi> shall only say thus much in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that the end of such meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neither only, nor chiefly that we may the better fix the heads and substance of the Sermon in our heads, not that we may the better understand, and be fuller instructed of the truth of the point we heard preached upon, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to work those truths, advices &amp; motives upon our affections, that are proposed to us in the Sermon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second kind of solemn meditation, is, when upon some providential occasion, or upon some spiritual distemper, or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or almost any thing of that nature, we retire our selves and powre out our soules in prayers and soliloquies, which may not but in a very large sense be called prayers, being mixt of such various and differing parts, sometimes speaking to God and telling him how we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42514:15"/>
stand affected to him, and his ordinances, sometimes speaking to our own soul, chiding encouraging or instructing of it, sometimes spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to our selves what we resolve to do, what we intend to say unto God; all which you may find in the 42. <hi>Psalm,</hi> and many more of that nature both in that and many other <hi>Psalms</hi> which may not properly be called prayers, but solemn occasional meditations, and the occasions of those meditations are often set down in the begining of the <hi>Psalm,</hi> and they differ from those occasional meditations (of which I spoke in the begining of this Chaper) only in their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and solemnity just as solemn prayers differ from jaculatory pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to set down any method for these is not convenient, because they observe no method, and differ very little in any thing else from that kind of meditation for which directions are set down in this Treatise.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42514:16"/>
3. The next kind of meditation is upon some practical truths of Religion: many directions for which and instances of the same are set down in this Treatise.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth and last kind of solemn meditation is that which is upon Scripture, which shall be the subject of the fourteenth, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and sixteenth Chapters of this Treatise.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>That solemn Meditation is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat this is a duty is evident,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the practice of Gods People, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. That this was a solemn Meditation is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he went out into the field to perform it, and had no other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness there but this; 'Tis not said
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42514:16"/>
when he was in the field he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, as if it were occasiona but to shew that it was a set duty, 'tis said that <hi>he went out to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis commanded <hi>Josh.</hi> 1. 8 and this duty of meditation is set down as a chief means to be sanctified of God for the keeping of the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is as a Characteristical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a wicked man and a Saint.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To consider, in Scripture, and to meditate, are Synonima's, and the necessity of it appears in this, because that the cause of sin is the want of consideration and not want of knowledge, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 3. and 'tis not much for us to hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, nay, though we be never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so attentive, it will not serve the turn, <hi>Psal.</hi> 41. 12. It is more then to know, for who is there almost in the world that knows not that he must dye, but few are there that consider it? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 29.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42514:17"/>
5. The necessity of Meditation appeares in this, that no man is converted without Meditation, for every one that is converted the method is this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He heares the truths of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is convinced of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He considers and meditates upon them, and sees how much they concern him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He is affected with them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Being thus affected it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth holy resolutions of better obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>But it will be objected, alass, I am not book learned, how shall <hi>I</hi> perform this duty of Meditation? This is rather for Ministers, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <hi>I</hi> may say of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as 'tis said of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, he that is a rational man, and doth but improve his reason, though he hath neither tongues nor art to help him, may understand &amp; grow to an extraordinary excellency in those Arts; So he that hath grace,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42514:17"/>
if he doe but exercise and improve it, though he hath not learning, will excell the learnedest man in the world that hath not grace in the duty of Meditation 'tis not learning but devotion that enables a man to this duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Can a man be a blessed man without Learning? then he may meditate without it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> But 'tis a very hard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That shews it to be an excellent duty, for the harder any duty is, the more excellent; the hardness consists in this, that 'tis contrary to our corruptions and the more contrary any thing is to that which is bad, 'tis so much the better.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Can you expect any duty should be easie at first? Is there any thing so of temporal things which are of any excellency, as Writing, playing on a Lute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42514:18"/>
3. Because 'tis so powerful to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie corruptions; sweet things nourish, and bitter things purge: therefore if you will only perform those duties that are delightful, they will nourish not purge out corruption.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Get but your hearts inflamed with the love of God, then this duty will not only be easie and delightful, but it will be a duty that you cannot tell almost how to avoid; for it is as hard not to think of what one loves as to think of what one hates; bid the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man not think of his money, or bid him think of the things of God, and he will find an equal difficulty in both. Indeed the love of God and desire of heavenly things are got by meditation, but when once our hearts are enflamed by Meditation then our Mediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are enflamed by love: As an Oven is first heated by fewel, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42514:18"/>
then it sets the fewel on fire, and as with the fewel you must put in fire and blow it, but afterwards it kindleth of it self, so the difficulty of Meditation is at first: When there is but as it were a spark of love in the heart, it will cost him some pains by meditation to blow it up to a flame, but afterwards the heart will be so heated with these flames of love, that it will so inflame all the thoughts, that it will make us not only easily but necessarily to meditate on the things of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The people of God generally have found a great deal of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in praying without a form at first. Many godly Ministers used a set Form of Prayer before their Sermons not many years since and when they and priva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Christians came to pray at first without a Form, they found a strangeness and an unreadiness thereunto; So it is in Meditation, Christians being
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42514:19"/>
not used to it, it will seem a strange and difficult work unto them, but I may say of it, as is said of the yoke Christ, <hi>Gravè cum tollis, suave cum tuleris,</hi> thou wilt find it very delightful, or at least very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But if it be such a necessary duty, how comes it to pass that it hath been so generally neglected by the people of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It hath been practised by the people of God both in Scripture as is proved, (and it is evident that the Psalmes of <hi>David</hi> are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing but Meditations, though not in this Method) and by many in our dayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It being a private Closet-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the omission nor performance of it could be taken notice of, and so the omission of it could not be reproved, nor performance obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Directions and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for Meditation have been
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42514:19"/>
generally very abstruse and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>

FOR the place, that must be private, remote from compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and noise; <hi>Isaac went into the fields,</hi> our Saviour into a Garden, and <hi>David</hi> wisheth us to <hi>enter into our chamber, and be still,</hi> Psal. 4. 4. and our Saviour bids us <hi>enter into our Closet, and shut the door,</hi> the place must be such as must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from noise and company, or any thing which might distract us in the duty; and such a place that we may not be interrupted or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to break off, before the duty be ended, it must be also private and remote from the observation of others, so that we may neither be he heard nor seen, because there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42514:20"/>
are divers gestures and expressions, which are not convenient for any one but God and ones own soul to be privy to: Which of those places you find to be most advantagious to you in the matters of Meditation you may choose.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the time when; <hi>The best is in the morning.</hi> 1. <hi>Because</hi> it is the first-fruits of the day, and the first-fruits being holy, all the rest are fanctified. 2. Because our thoughts being then not soyled with worldly business, will not be so subject to be distracted. 3. Because the body it self is more serene then after Meals, and this Duty needs an empty stomack, not only because the head will be more clear and fit for Meditation, but also because many passages of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation require so much intention of the mind and fervency of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that they do hinder Digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 4. Because that it being in the morning will have an influence
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42514:20"/>
upon the whole day, but this is not an Universal Rule; for we read that <hi>Isaac</hi> went forth in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Meditate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 36. and in case the subject of your Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be a Sermon, then it may be the best time is, immediately after the hearing of it before your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions cool, or your memory fail you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the how long, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the parts of Meditation are so many, <hi>viz.</hi> Preparation, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, Affections, Resolutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and none of them are to be past slightly over, for Affections are not so quickly raised, nor are we to cease blowing the fire as soon as ever it beginneth to flame, until it be well kindled, half an hour may be thought to be the least for beginners, and an hour for those that are versed in this Duty; <hi>But there are two Rules in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular especially to be observed.</hi> 1. That as we ought not to leave
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42514:21"/>
off our prayers before that temper and frame of heart is wrought, which is suitable to the matter of our prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> we should not leave off the confession of sin till our hearts are made sensible of and humble for our sins, nor should we leave off our praises until our hearts are filled with holy admirings and adorings of God, and inflamed with his love; So the end of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation being affections and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, we should not leave off until those are wrought. 2. As in private Prayer, so long as we finde our hearts enlarged by the pourings of the Spirit of Supplication upon us, we are not to leave off unless by our continuance in that duty we must omit another duty to which we were more particularly obliged at that time; So in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as long as we find the heart affected we are to continue it: But this Caution must be given, that in such enlargements we must not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42514:21"/>
continue them longer general<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y then while they come freely and without much straing and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for that hony that comes free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it self from the Comb is pure, but that which is forced by heat and pressure is not so well relished, but this Caution is for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary enlargements, for if the heart be dead, we must use all means to awaken it; But as fire must be blown till it be well kindled, but afterwards blowing hinders the boyling of any thing that is set over it; So when once our hearts are inflamed and enlarged with holy affections in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 'tis but a hindrance of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to return to the Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those Points that raised them.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. BY no means let it be Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, <hi>for that will turn Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation into Study.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor nice Speculations, <hi>for they be sapless, without nourishment:</hi> Besides being so light they float in the brain, having no weight to sink them down into the heart, and indeed were they there, they have nothing in them to affect the heart withall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the Subject of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the plainest, powerfullest, and usefullest Truths of God, as Death, Hell, Heaven, Judgement, Mercies of God, our own sins, the Love and Sufferings of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the Subject of your Meditation be that, that is most

suitable to your Spiritual wants; as in time of desertion, meditate most of the love and mercies of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rules for meditation it self, they are of three sorts.</hi> 1. Preparatory. 2. For the body of the Duty. 3. For the Conclusion.</p>
               <p>Two things by way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, besides the choice of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the first is, <hi>be convinced of, and to be affected with the presence of God:</hi> The second is, <hi>Prayer for assistance from God.</hi> 2. For the body Meditation it self, It consists of three parts: The first I call Consideration, which is nothing but the convincing our hearts of several Truths that do belong to that Subject whereof we Meditate: As if the Subject of our Meditation be Death, the Considerations may go thus, Alas O my Soul, how, and when, and where we shall die we know not, generally men
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42514:23"/>
die sooner then they expect, and certain it is, whensoever that hour comes, we must bid adieu to honors, pleasures, riches, friends, and at last our own bodies, &amp;c. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part is affections, whether it be love of God or Christ, or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, despising of the world, admiring of God or any other spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual affection: The third part are Resolutions to do this or that, or leave this or that; Now this is the most proper and genuine way of Meditation appears by this. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not artificial and such as requires Learning, as those Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are which wish us to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the efficient, final, formal, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cause of death, the adjuncts concomitants, &amp;c. which though they may somewhat help the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet such hard words and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial methods fright the ignorant: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. This is the very method of those Meditations by which every one that is brought home to God
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42514:23"/>
is converted; For the first thing in conversion is our being convinced of some Truths, which conviction raiseth affections, for if the truths of God end in conviction, and go no no further, nay, if they end in affections only, and never come to resolutions of shunning evil and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, conversion can never be perfected, as for example, One is convinced that he is a miserable undone wretch by reason of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Actual abomination, Upon this conviction fear and sorrow are raised yet if these do not work in us a firm resolution of leaving those sins, we are yet in our sins and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted. 3. There are several things for the concluding of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as shall appear.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FOR being convinced of and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the presence of God, it may thus be wrought.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are to consider that God is present every where, as truly, really, and essentially, as he is in Heaven; For God did not create Heaven to continue still but to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest his presence, for <hi>the Heaven of Heavens are not able to contain him,</hi> for God is neither included by, nor excluded from any place, and though <hi>Jacob</hi> saith, <hi>Surely the Lord was in this place, and I knew it not,</hi> Gen. 28. 16. yet we must not imagine that <hi>Jacob</hi> was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that Truth, but did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually consider it; but <hi>David</hi> in the 139 <hi>Psalm</hi> is clear in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42514:24"/>
and clearing up the omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God. 2. We must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God doth more peculiarly observe his people, while they are performing of heavenly duties, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, while they are speaking unto him, or he speaking unto them, he doth then more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe the motion and frame of their hearts, as when we are in any company we do more especially look upon and observe those to whom we speak, or who speak to us; yet this is to be understood not as if God did observe us more at one time then another, in respect of Gods knowledge it self; but thus, that God is much more offended with us, if our carriage and frame of heart be more irreverent, and unholy in the time of prayer and Meditation, then at such times as we are in the works of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular calling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may consider with our selves that Christ doth actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42514:25"/>
us, especially in these duties of holiness, for it is not the distance of place that doth hinder Christs knowledge and exact observing of us. Little did <hi>Nathanael</hi> then think that Christ saw him under the Fig-tree; <hi>Nathonael</hi> did not see Christ, nor was he corporally present then, yet Christ beheld <hi>Nathanael</hi> when he prayed; so Christ beheld <hi>Stephen</hi> before the heavens were opened, and the opening of the heavens was not that that thereby Christ might be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the better to behold <hi>Stephen,</hi> but that <hi>Stephen</hi> might thereby be the better enabled to see that Christ looked on him; without all controversie God knows and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves with what reverence, faith, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we pray, for else our prayers would be in vain, and our faith also vain, for how could he give us according to our faith if he knew not how much our faith were? If the inward frame of our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42514:25"/>
hearts were not observed by him, then an hypocrite that hath better expressions should get more by his prayers, then a true <hi>Nathanael</hi> that hath a better heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppose that thou hadst lived in Christs time, or suppose that Christ were now in <hi>England,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with what joy, reverence, and confidence thou wouldest go to him for the pardon of thy sins, or for any other mercy thou stood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in need of; Thou maist go so to him now, his distance from thee in respect of corporal presence doth not make him less able to know thy wants, or hear thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor his being now glorified makes him less willing to grant them then if it were bodily present in the room with thee in the form of a servant, as he was once at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> the glory of Christ doth not hinder his love and goodness, for Christ is the express Image of his Father, and Gods Attributes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42514:26"/>
do not not hinder one another; The Majesty of God doth not set bounds unto his goodness, and make that finite, nor doth his goodness make his Majesty less glorious, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness makes his Majesty more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and his Majesty makes his goodness more wonderful; So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the exaltation of Christ cause him to abate any thing of his goodness unto his people, but if any way his Love be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, it is by being made more then it was, and when Christ was upon earth, you must have come to him by Faith, or you could obtain no mercy from him, and by faith though he be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you may obtain any mercy now: You may consider any one or two or more of these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, until your heart be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of and affected with the presence of God, that you may thereby be the better fitted for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42514:26"/>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Concerning the Preparatory Prayer that is to be used before Meditation:</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE next Preparatory consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is Prayer, and it is to be performed in these words, or to like purpose: Lord, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in this Duty of Meditation is not to be an hour sequestred from Worldly Employments, for that were to be idle an Hour, and to encrease my Sinnes not my Graces, but my Business at this time is to be so convinced and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with those spiritual Truths revealed in thy Word, that I may fully resolve by thy strenghth and power to reform my Life, because I can neither understand the things that belong to my peace, nor
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42514:27"/>
understanding them, be convinced of the certainty and truth of them; Nay Lord, though my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be enlightned, yet without thee mine affections cannot be enflamed; I can neither know, resolve, nor perform what is good without thee, for from thee comes both the will and the deed of thy good pleasure, I beseech thee Lord that thou wouldest give me thy grace to make conscience of performing this duty with my whole strength, and not carelesly and perfunctorily; And Lord do thou enlighten me with and convince me of thy Truths, and so affect my heart with the love of holiness and hatred of sin, &amp;c. that I may thereby be enabled fully, firmly (notwithstanding all the opposition that the flesh, world, or devil can make) to run the wayes of thy Commandements with joy and with speed, and when thou hast wrought in me the will so to do, give me also the deed and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42514:27"/>
that I may not trust to the strength of my resolutions, but to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual gracious assistance of thy Spirit for the performance of those things that through thee I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to do: Holy and blessed God, Christ hath sent me, wishing me to come to thee in his Name for any mercies I stand in need of; grant these things which I have begged for the Lord Jesus sake, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, or a prayer to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thou art to put up unto God, but it is to be done with thy whole heart, for thou must know that it is by the strength which thou shalt get from God by prayer, whereby thou shalt be enabled to perform this or any other duty profitably, for it is he that teacheth us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, he that begins a holy duty without God, will end it without God also. It is a dangerous thing to think that we can by our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42514:28"/>
parts, Learning, or by the strength of Grace already received without Gods further assistance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any thing that can please God, or edifie our own Souls; For though our Mountain be made strong, yet if he shall hide his face, there will be trouble. We may with much more Sense say, Now the Sunne shines so bright, and the Air is so clear, that now we can do well enough for a while, though the Sunne be Eclipsed; then to say, though our Hearts be never so much inflamed with the love of God; <hi>Now we are so filled and inflamed by his Love, we shall do well enough by our own strength, for at the present we need not Gods further assistance;</hi> Give us but Fewel, Matter to Meditate of, and we shall be able to continue and encrease our flames: Do not count it a Burthen but a Mercy and Priviledge, that God hath necessitated and commanded

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THey must be plain Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, not intricate and abstruse, For the main end of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation being the affecting of our heart, and resorming of our lives, and not informing of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, our considerations should be so plain, that they may be without difficulty understood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It must be certain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not controversial and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; <hi>For the end of Meditation is not properly to encrease our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but to improve our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Much less should our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations be Curious and Nice Speculations, or if we choose any
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42514:29"/>
Book, by reading whereof to help our Meditation, we must not choose such as are filled with flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes and Rhetorick, for let a truth be drest never so curiously, the Wit and Eloquence wherewith the Truth is clothed, leaves the Truth before it comes to the heart, as some Meats that are made in curious works are spoiled of all those curiosities before they come to the stomack; and the Bee lights not upon the Rose which hath the freshest colour, and the sweetest smell, but upon the Thyme that is an Herb of little beauty, Besides Eloquence to them that Meditate is much like Pictures in Books to Children, they neglect their Lesson to look on their Pictures, they will be looking on their pictures while they should be getting their Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? So the fancy will be playing with the Eloquence, when the heart should be feeding on and affected with the truths we read. The less
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42514:29"/>
time the Truth stayes in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the better; for the work of the understanding in this business is not to retain, but to convey the Truths to the heart; <hi>As Physicians use when they are to give Medecines to Cure any Disease in the Bladder', they give such as may soonest come to the part affected, for if they stay by the way they lose their vertue, before they come to the part which they shou'd cure;</hi> So if the Understanding shall stay dallying with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence or searching out the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or certainty of the Truth it considers any long while, the heart will lie cold and unaffected all that while: It is somewhat like that Story concerning Musi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ians that were to play before the Emperor of the Turks, who were so long tuning their Instruments which they should have done before, that he would not stay to hear their Musick; <hi>Therefore let the Truths you consider of to raise affections be plain, certain, nourishing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42514:30"/>
4. The fourth Rule is, that in case any doubt ariseth upon a plain known Truth (for Satan will be subject to cast in doubts against the most evident Truths) then do as the Arch angel did with Satan, you may enter the Lists with Satan, and it may be when you have a little considered and disputed the matter, the mist may vanish, and the Sun shine clear, and Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing resisted will presently fly: but if Satan shall still wrangle, and your Blasphemous Doubs shall not be removed, then dispute no more, but say as the Arch angel did, the Lord rebuke thee Satan: <hi>As a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is attempted to be ravished will strive and struggle a while, and if she findes that she can quickly get loose, she flies, but othewrise she cries out for help:</hi> The Arch angel first disputed, but when that would not speedily prevail, appealed unto God; To this purpose it is good to be exceedingly well grounded
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42514:30"/>
in Truths from the word of God, for that is the Sword of the Spirit, and that by which our Saviour si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced Satan in all his Temptations. 'Tis a dangereous thing to dispute with Satan by Humane Reason, we must <hi>put on the Armour of God,</hi> if we will be able to stand in the evil day of Temptation, and when all is done to stand.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Rule is, that we should not over-multiply our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, but as soon as by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering of the Truths of God we find our hearts strongly affected, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen we are to pass over that part: but this Caution must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that we must not as soon as we find our heart never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affected, leave off our Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>The Bee will not go from the Flower so long as any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is easily drawn out of it:</hi> and indeed it is a Temptation which the people of God ought
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42514:31"/>
to take notice of; That Satan is subject to make one pass over Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before we have drawn half the strength of them, as for Example, <hi>When we are confessing of our sins, as soon as ever our hearts begin in the least measure to be humbled, be fills them with joy, such joy may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be suspected to be from Satan, or our own naughty hearts, not from God.</hi> Corn when it springs up too fast, and grows rank, Husbandmen cut it down, a Corrosive that is laid on to eat dead flesh, must not be taken off as soon as it begins to smart, <hi>the Wheat in the stony ground did soonest spring up:</hi> We should let our Considerations take deep Root, and not passe over to affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and resolutions as soon as ever they take hold of our heart, but it is alwayes to be remembred, that in case our affections be very much inflamed, as soon as ever we begin our Considerations we are to yield
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42514:31"/>
to the Inspirations of God, and to follow the leading of the Spirit; for this Method that is set down, is not to bind up and limit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinry working of the Spirit of God; but if our hearts be only a little moved, we must do as I have said, not leave blowing the fire as soon as ever it begins a little to be kindled, for green wood <hi>(for such are we in spiritual matters)</hi> will suddenly go out, unless it be very well kindled.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Rules Concerning Resolutions.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. LEt your resolutions be firm and strong, not sleighty, let not them be Velleities or wishes, but resolved purposes or Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; <hi>Do not say with thy self,</hi> Well, I see very well that the wrath of God comes upon the <hi>Children of disobedience,</hi> and I must to Hell, or leave my taking the Name of God in vain; <hi>I do not well to swear, and I wish I could leave it</hi> but say thus with thy self, <hi>I am resolved by the blessing of God whatsoever comes of it; to leave my swearing;</hi> There is no dallying with God, nor giving a faint denial to sinne;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42514:33"/>
                  <hi>I have heard of one who hearing the sin of swearing spoke much against by some in whose company he was,</hi> observed their Discourse, and said, <hi>Well, by the blessing of God I will never swear more,</hi> and though he was a common Swearer before, he was never since heard to swear one Oath to this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let thy Resolutions be for the time present, not for the future; Do not say, Well, <hi>I do intend to leave my drinking, but for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I am engaged in such a meeting, and for that time I will do as I have done, but after that I will think of it, and take some order for the mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it;</hi> This is but one of Satans wiles whereby he cosoneth thee of the whole life by dayes, which he could not do by years; If Satan should say unto thee, <hi>Thou shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> never repent, never leave thy drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it may be it would startle thee, and he would be in danger of getting
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42514:33"/>
nothing of thee by asking so much:</hi> but he tempting thee only to let it alone this week, and afterwards for a week longer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he obtains the same thing at several times which he could not obtain at once.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Rule, Let thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions be not only against thy sin, but against the means, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and temptations to it; for it is better to discern Satan, if it may be, then to put a Sword in his hand, and say, <hi>thou canst well enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy self against him:</hi> This is <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, He doth not say to him that would fly Adultery, You may talk with a Harlot, but, <hi>Be not inticed by her words to uncle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anness,</hi> he will not give thee leave to go into her house, or so much as by her door, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5. 8. So when he diswadeth the Drunkard from drunkenness, he wisheth him not so much as to look upon the Wine;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42514:34"/>
For as the beauty of a Harlot, so the colour of Wine will enflame our desires after it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31. after this manner did <hi>Job</hi> resolve, <hi>I have made a covenant with my eyes that I will not look upon a woman,</hi> and he resolved not onely against the sin it self, but against the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and temptations to the sin, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. and God forbidding the <hi>Nazarites</hi> Wine, forbad them to eat Grapes, least by that they should be enticed to drink Wine. Now that I may press this Rule, I shall answer an Objection which generally wicked men are subject to make, as thus, <hi>When we perswade a Drunkard that he would leave his Drunkenness, that he would for two or three Moneths resolve not to go into a Tavern or an Ale house, he cries out of preciseness, and saith,</hi> What, do you count it a sin to drink in Tavern or Ale-house? I answer therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:42514:34"/>
1. That when our hearts are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the sinfulness of sin, and wrought up to a hatred of it, we do as when we exceedingly hate any man, we avoid all those places where we are likely to meet him; I may bid such an one ask God why he forbids the adulterer to walk by the doors of the Harlot; May he not say, <hi>Why, she lives in a street, and as honest and godly men walk that way as in any other place in the City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider that <hi>Licitis peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus omnes</hi> is a good saying, we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally perish by lawful things, <hi>for in things that are unlawful we are generally more watchful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Know this, that though to be tempted be not a sin, yet when we have found by experience that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Tavern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath been a Snare and temptation that hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally prevailed over us, then to be tempted with such a temptation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42514:35"/>
is a sin though one yields not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by going into temptation which we need not, we sin; for if one shall say, <hi>I resolve that though I do speak with the Harlot, I will not consent;</hi> though thou dost so, and resisteth all her Enticements, thou sinnest notwithstanding, for thou plainly breakest the Command, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But suppose that it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for thee to drink Wine in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern that thou hast been so often ensnared by it, yet one effect of true repentance is an holy revenge, by debarring our selves those things which are lawful, taking Gods part against our selves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 11.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Consider that if thy hatred of sin and love of God be not strong enough to stop thee from the beginnings, and keep thee from the occasions of sin, how canst thou
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42514:35"/>
expect that it should keep thee from committing the Sinne it self, when it hath got some advantage over thee. <hi>He that cannot stop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at first, will much less (when he hath rolled down a steep hil half way) be able to stop himself, for then he falls with more violence, and the same strength to hold will not serve then which would at first;</hi> therefore I shall continue the advice, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve not only against the sin, but against the occasion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I must give you one Caution, that though you finde your heart never so much resolving against and abhorring of any sin, yet take heed that you build not upon the strength of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, but beg of God that he would enable you by his strength, and that as he hath given you the will, so he would give you the deed also. It was well observed by one as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42514:36"/>
                  <hi>In effect it is true that we do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand many things by experience which we should not understand by knowledge, as this, I having often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times determined to do many things, the one more pious, holy, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an then another, and having seen for the most part the issue and effect to be quite contrary to what I determined; and on the contrary, observing that other pious and Christian things were done by me, without my prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination or forecast; I stood as it were confounded in my self, not understanding in what this secret did consist; I did not wonder that in things which I determined as a man, the contrary should come to pass of that which I would; but I did wonder that in the things which I determined as a Christian, the same should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall me; and finding my self in this Confusion, it came to pass that I read that Resolution of</hi> Saint
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42514:36"/>
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee; <hi>and considering that though the Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was pious, holy, and Christian, the contrary of that which he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved befel him; I understand that my determinations had not their issue and effect according to my desire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I did not well consider mine own utter disability to perform any holy and good work; So that I understood by experince, that although God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished my inconsiderateness in not suffering that to come to pass which I intended; yet on the other side he satisfied my general desire of doing good, by suffering that to came to pass which I did not procure, nor hope, nor pretend unto; whence I have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the will of God is, that I should depend on him in such manner, that I should determine or propound nothing without holding him before mine eyes, shewing unto him my
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42514:37"/>
good will, and referring unto him the issue and success of my desires and endeavours.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Directions for Vows.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw because Vows do very frequently, especially in young beginners follow upon resolutions, and because that very many pious and religious persons have been ensnared by rash Vows, and after Vows it is not fit to make enquiry, therefore I shall set down some Cautions of, and Directions for Vows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As we have said concerning Resolutions, let your Vows be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the occasions of sinne then against sin it self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the subject of your Vows is of things indifferent in themselves.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42514:37"/>
1. Take heed of making any perpetual Vow, for the reason why you make any Vows against any indifferent thing, as in drinking Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is, because then it was a snare unto you, but in process of time, it may cease to be a snare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, nay, it may be a very great Snare, and occasion Sickness or death, not to drink it, as in some cases hath happened.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let all Vows concerning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things be Conditional, and let these two constantly be two of the Conditions. First, That you will abstain from such a thing, or do such a thing, unless you shall be otherwise advised by some godly Minister or private Christian. <hi>I knew a Religious woman that had Vowed to Read many Chapters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day;</hi> when she was unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried she made this Vow, but afterwards in the time of her lying in, and other Weaknesses, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42514:38"/>
Chapters were so many, that the did much endanger the losse of her sight, and the neglect of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties, when her poverty and family grew great; Now had she added this Caution to her Vow, she might have been delivered out of that snare, and though it be true that in many cases a Vow may be dispensed withall, when we cannot keep it without sin, as in this case, one hath vowed a weekly secret Fast, ones Health, or Child with which one goes will certainly be destroyed by it, yet if it be but an inconvenience, though a very great one, it will not release one from ones Vow, Now the reason why I add that condition (unless some Minister or for want thereof some other godly Christian shall otherwise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise) is because the several cases that may happen are so various that it is impossible to specifie them all,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42514:38"/>
or think of them all, and very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to judge of them all, when we make the Vow: And moreover if we should leave it to our selves, we should be too partial, for as when our Consciences are much touched for our sins, we are subject to be too violent in our spiritual revenge, so in a little time when that pang is over, we are subject to be too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to our selves, therefore it is better to say thus, Lord, <hi>I do vow unto thee, that I will keep every week a day of Humiliation, or that I will not drink any Wine this three moneths next following, unless some such occasion shall be;</hi> That if it had then been, or then thought of when I made my Vow, that such or such, or some other godly Minister would (had I consulted with him then) wisht me not to make that Vow; then to say, I will do this or that, unless some such occasion be, that were the Vow to be made
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42514:39"/>
again, I would not make it. 2. Add this Caution, <hi>viz.</hi> If I remember it <hi>I will not drink Wine this moneth,</hi> the reason is, <hi>because if you drink Wine, though you did not think of it, you sin if your Vow be absolute;</hi> but if it be with that condition it is not a sin, and yet by adding that condition, we give our selves no liberty, since it is not in our power to forget it. The next Caution concerning Vows in indifferent things is this, add a penalty upon the breach of your Vow, which penalty is not added by way of hope of Satisfaction, that's gross igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Superstition, but it must needs run thus, <hi>I will spend half an hour an hour a day in Prayer for the Church to the end of this moneth, or else give so much to the poor, and in such a case if we do either, we sin not:</hi> the reason why we should add a penalty to it, because some incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies may be so great, that it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42514:39"/>
would bring some very great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon us, and then we have liberty to take the other part of the Vow, <hi>viz.</hi> And now this penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must 1. Not be two light and trivial, but it must be of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence that it may be a Tye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and yet not of so great weight as if it should happen, it might prove some great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to us; For a rich man to say he will give 6 d. to the poor is not considerable, and yet the same may be to heavy a Burthen for one that is very poor to give. The next Rule is, Let this penalty be alwayes of something that is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially good, as giving to the Poor, spending some time in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture; for as for Popish Penances, as whipping, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and such like, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and ridiculous: The next Rule is, Let this penalty be alwaies
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42514:40"/>
some holy Duty that is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thy Master sin, as if thy Master sin be Covetousness, let it be Alms; if it be voluptuousness, let it be fasting with prayer, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining wholly for a time from that wherein thou most delightest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The next Rule is, Let your vows be rather against the outward then the inward acts of sin, rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst speaking angrily then being angry, for though inward acts of sin are worse, yet they are not so much in our power. The next Rule is, if your vows are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doing holy duties, it is better to vow to spend some time in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy Scripture, or such like, then to read so many Chapters for thou wilt be tempted to read them over too fast, that thou maist have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereas if it be, so much time that thou hast resolved to spend, thou wilt not be so subject to this temptation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Rules for the concluding of Meditation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THou art earnestly to beg of God strength to perform whatever thou hast resolved to do in his service; This must be done fexvently, though briefly and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, proceeding from an earnest desire to do what thou hast promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and resolved, and also from an humble sense of thine ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Duty is Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, if thou shalt perceive any heavenly warmth of love or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual hatred of sin, or any other Spiritual effect wrought in thy heart, thou art to give God the glory, and not to rejoyce in thy self, but in the Lord, but thou art to rejoyce with trembling, knowing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42514:41"/>
that if thou art puft up, though thou hast the will to do good wrought in thee, yet if thou provokest him, he can stop it, that thou shalt never be able to do what thou resolvest to do.</p>
               <p>The first is an humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of our failings in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of this duty; <hi>For if we were not green wood, that love which is now but a spark, would have been a flame;</hi> God is not wanting unto us, but we are wanting unto our selves and him; After these are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there remain three Duties more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are to remember what Vows and promises we have made, and it is very usefull to write down all the Vows (as thou makest them) in a Book, because that we shall else be subject to forget the Vow, or the time, or conditions upon which we made it: And it is good to have a Book to keep a Register of things
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42514:41"/>
in it (besides a Diary which I have spoken of, and given Rules for in a Manuel, Entituled, <hi>A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory to Christian perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Let one head be (for which you are to leave some leaves) for Vows, under which you must write down all your Vows or Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as you make them, or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al promises for Christians, and such like.</p>
               <p>The Second must be for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, Eminent deliverances, and also answers of Prayers; These are to be set down with all perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Circumstances that may any way encrease the mercy.</p>
               <p>The third head should be for grosser failings, which were good to be writ down, not in Letters at length that every one may read them, but in Characters known only to our selves; there are other things which because I do not now speak purposely of that business I omit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:42514:42"/>
The second thing after Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ended, is, to remember what passages in our Meditation did most affect us, and as it were to lay them up in our thoughts, that frequntly we may in the rest of the day think of them; As when we walk in a Garden we content not our selves with enjoying the fragrancy of the flowers while we are there, but if we may have leave we often gather a Nosegay to smell of the rest of the day. In this business of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation do thou likewise.</p>
               <p>The third duty after Meditation is by degrees warily and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to go out of the presence of God to wordly employments; Do not go from the presence of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> a bird out of the Snare, with joy and with speed: And thou must go also watchfully and warily from such Employments, as one that carries some precious liquor in a shallow, broad, brittle dish he looks
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42514:42"/>
to his way, to the Dish and liquor that is in it, lest by holding of it awry by falls or stumblings, <hi>he should spill the one, or break the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> So must thou be watchful over thy wayes, else the grace that God hath powred into thy heart in this duty will be spilt. <hi>To rush into holy Duties or out of them, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues two great undervaluing of the things of God.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of the Duty and General Rules for Meditating upon Scripture.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are three great Designs the people of God have in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To</hi> be very ready and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in the holy Writ, that so upon all occasion whether it be for direction or answering of a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. We may not be to seek,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42514:43"/>
and to the end it is necessary that we read some Chapters in the bible, every day three or four Chapters every day will read over the Bible once in a year.</p>
               <p>The next Design and end that the people of God have in reading of the Bible is, that they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it: The first had need be done with all serious attention, but this with much more; And so I come to the third end of a Saints reading the Word, of which is that when he hath read it, he may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon it, this is the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and useful Design of our reading the Scripture, which is to be done with the greatest serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind as possibly can be. But as all Scripture is not equally suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this end, so neither can we think at all times to be in a fit frame and temper to perform this duty, we can go but slowly on in this way, and were every verse in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42514:43"/>
the Bible a fit Subject matter for our Meditation, our life were far too short to Meditate it over, or the third part of it; That this Meditating upon Scripture is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty needeth no more proof then this, to wit, that the Psalmist puts it as a necessary Ingredient, into the Character of a blessed man, <hi>viz. that he is one that meditateth in the Law of the Lord day and night,</hi> in the 1. <hi>Psalm</hi> and the 2. <hi>verse;</hi> If thou didst never Meditate <hi>(I do not say according to the Method that I have set down)</hi> upon the Word of God, thou art an accursed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turre; There are but a few who think this to be true, or are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that this Duty of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is so Indispensibly necessary, or at least, that live accordingly. Let us look a little into the holy Scripture, and see the practise of the Saints, <hi>David the holiest man for his affections that we read of,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:42514:44"/>
and you shall find him very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, nay indeed daily exercised in this duty, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 6. 77. 12. 119. 15, 23 48, 78, 79, 99, 146. by this means he saith he got more wisdom then those who one would think are most likely to get wisdom, for first Malice maketh a man very wise to do mischief, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the Divel helpeth such in their wicked devises. Secondly, Those who are aged are generally wise men, for VVisdom is with the Aged. And then Thirdly, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are wiser then their Pupils, yet <hi>David</hi> went far beyond them all, which wisdom he attained unto by being much in Meditation upon the Scripture, as he telleth us in his 119. <hi>Psal. &amp; ver.</hi> 98, 99, 100 <hi>Thou through thy commandments hast made me wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser then my enemies, for they are ever with me, nay further he saith in the</hi> 99. <hi>ver. I have more understanding then all my Teachers;</hi> how got he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42514:44"/>
that wisdom? <hi>Why it was by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Gods Testimonies his meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then he understood more then the Ancients,</hi> because, <hi>I keep thy Precepts, as he speaketh in the</hi> 100. <hi>vers. Joshua</hi> a King, not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great and important Affairs <hi>(being the Monarch of the Jews)</hi> yet he was commanded continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Meditate upon Scripture. The Book of the Law was not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of his mouth, but he was therein to Meditate day and night, as you may read more at large in the 1 <hi>Ch. of Jos. v.</hi> 8. I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in other kinds of Solemn medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. So is this, there is little of learninng required for performance of it, as <hi>Joshua</hi> was but a servant to <hi>Moses,</hi> and so not likely to be so learned a man; and <hi>David</hi> a man, the most conversant in meditation, and that with the best success that we do read of, yet he was but a Shepheard, and afterwards a

Souldier, employments which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much Learning to make a make a man capable of: As for the Rules and Direction of this Duty, they differ as to the main not much from those I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after given, for solemn Meditation upon some particular Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: As for the preparatory acts they are the same in both; We are to consider seriously with our selves of the Scope of the words, that so we may the more fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their drift and aim, and we are not to let the truth pass, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we have by effections, examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or resolution some wayes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged our selves in the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith, or some wayes else bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted our souls, by a general view taken of the words of the Text, we may see the abundant sweetness and fragrancy of the Word of God, as we do the odour of flowers by senting them; Now Meditation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42514:45"/>
draweth forth the Honey of the Flowers into our bowels, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth us thereby, the beauty and Odour of Flowers are very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but they nourish not, <hi>so bare understanding of the words themselves do rather delight then profit us,</hi> and if we go no further, it is but so much on in order to Solemn Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Meditation. I look upon it as one of the greatest sins of the Professors of <hi>England,</hi> That the reading, studying, and meditating upon Scripture is so much neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hence people grow not in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: <hi>I have writ the great things of my Law, and they are strange things unto you saith God,</hi> Hos. 8. 12. Doth any man let the Letters of his friends lye by him and never read them: If Lawvers should never read Law Books, but have them in their Studies, it would be very absurd; how wonderful would they be to seek in the resolving of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42514:46"/>
case, if upon the thousand part so good grounds as we have, that the Scripture is the Word of God, we should hear of some Prophecy from God, setting down what would be the doom of <hi>England,</hi> and all these publick Transactions, would not every one be industruous to get it, and read it? <hi>We have a more sure word of Prophecy, and that which teacheth of matters of far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concernment, then the temporal welfare of this Nation, and yet it lyeth by us as a thing forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rules for Meditating upon the Scripture, are either those which highly concern the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Meditations, or the right Manner of them; For the right Manner of our Meditations, let it be with all Reverence and Humility, and sense of Gods Majesty upon our Spirits, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42514:46"/>
how utterly unable we be to understand the VVord of God, without the Spirit of God; if any one in the pride of his heart shall think by the strength of his Gifts and Parts, Savingly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Mysteries of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will find himself quite mistaken; <hi>For as God sendeth the Rich empty away, so he will send the Wise, and the Prudent, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seemeth a strange carriage in Christ, <hi>to rejoyce in the Spirit, that God had hidden the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospel from the Wise and Prudent:</hi> It is wonderfull Arrogance for any one to think he can know God without his leave, whether he will or no, or think to see God by any Light but by his own. He may as well see the Sun without the Sun; one put a question why Christ came not as <hi>Moses,</hi> or as a Prince, but in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42514:47"/>
                  <hi>the form of a Servant, nor as John the Baptist in an outward austear way, but came eating and drinking,</hi> he was answered among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, especially for this, <hi>that he might deceive the reason of man.</hi> For had he come in the outward Form and Manner of a Prince, then humane reason, might have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to build upon that he was the <hi>Messias:</hi> Outward Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in high esteem with the World, but inward Mortification, and to be inwardly holy without proclamation, is most sincere.</p>
               <p>The second thing for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of your Meditation, if you would meditate aright, is to come with an indifferent mind, and take heed of bringing the Creature to your mind, but bring your mind to the Scripture, and hear what the Lord will say unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:42514:47"/>
Thirdly, Let your Meditations upon Scripture be very serious, we are to know God as well as to love him with all our mind &amp; strength: We may do the things of the World well enough, and yet mingle many thoughts of God with our worldly Employments, <hi>but we cannot mingle the things of God and the World together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Let the end of your Meditations be to raise holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to have stronger resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for God then ever you had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not only to know more of, but that we may have a greater love to God, or else 'tis not Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation but study.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Several Rules for the Subject of our Spiritual Meditation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THe first Rule to be observed in the choice of a Subject for your Meditation, is this, <hi>viz:</hi> To choose those places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to meditate upon, as are most suitable to your Master Sin, as if your Master Sin be Pride, choose those Scriptures to Meditate upon which is most in speaking against Pride, and set down Gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Detestation of it, or his severe Judgements executed upon it; And all his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings against it, as you may see in several places that set down the Evil Nature or Effects of it,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42514:48"/>
and so of any other Sinne that is not thy Master Sinne, for it is of great concernment, and a sure sign of Sincerity to keep our selves from our own iniquity: <hi>Thus you find</hi> David <hi>speaking of himself, that he kept himself from his own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Psal. 18, 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditate upon those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which you find suitable to the dispensation of Gods Providences, as when the Church is in danger of persecution, <hi>Then meditate upon those Scriptures which either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to have, or do commend the Saints of God for having a sence of the Saints sufferings upon their Spirits, set down the places that make Promises to those that are sensible of the sufferings of the Saints, and also those places that do set out Gods love to his people, and promises of support, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to them in the time of</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:42514:49"/>
their adversity meditate also upon the Histories of Gods deliverance of his people in their great straights, and also of the way and Method of his deliverance, of those Prayers also that prevaileth with God for their deliverance in such cases.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditate upon those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are suitable to mens personal providences, <hi>as if thou art rich, then meditate upon those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that set down the danger, and the duty of the rich: If thou art af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with sickness, poverty, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, imprisonment, meditate upon those places which set down thy Duty in those Conditions, and those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises that set down comfort for thee in those conditions.</hi> Meditate upon those Scriptures which set down the carriage of Saints in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and how God supported them, and at last Delivered them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:42514:49"/>
4. Let your Meditation be upon Scriptures suitable to your Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: <hi>As if you are tempted to uncleanness as</hi> Joseph <hi>was, then me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon those Scriptures which speak against uncleanness;</hi> It is fit to meditate of the hainousness of sin in such cases, and not of those Scriptures that may increase your Temptations, but of those that may remove them, as a person un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Desertion is not to meditate of those Scriptures which do speak of the sinfulness of sin, or of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of God, and his terrible Wrath executing judgements upon sinners, all which serve rather to terrifie a poor drooping Soul then to comfort it, but let him rather Meditate upon those Scriptures which do speak of the merciful nature of God, of the full satifaction of Christ, and of his great love to poor sinners, as to <hi>Paul, Manasses, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and some such
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42514:50"/>
other great sinners whom God hath pardoned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let your meditations be sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Ordinances that you are to be made partakers of, as if you are to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Then meditate upon your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory, concomitant and subsequent duties: Meditate upon the love of God the Father, upon the love of God the Son, Jesus Christ, consider the excellency of his person, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his sufferings, and how valid they be to the satisfaction of Gods Justice, and so likewise to consider of the excellency, nature, and use of the Sacrament.</hi> So if thou hast a Child to be baptized, consider the Duties and promises of belonging to that Ordinance, the Duties thereof belonging to thee for the present, but to the Child for the future.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Scripture is not to be meditated on as it is to be read:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42514:50"/>
There is no part of the Scripture but what is to be read by us, but there is a great deal of Scripture which cannot be a fit Suject for us to meditate upon, but such as I shall mention, though there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of Scripture besides, which may be fit proper Subjects for us to meditate upon, but these most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, as the <hi>Psalms of David, many Chapters of the Proverbs of Solomon, some choice places of the Canticles, most of the Holy Gospels, and most of the Epistles, Something of the Revelation, and then all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in general,</hi> and that for two Reasons, The one is, because the Promises themselves put us upon the Duty, and then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises bring Comfort; Far be it from us to despise the Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our heavenly Lord: Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate also upon the holy and blessed Commands of God, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Saints; and let this be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42514:51"/>
your Meditation to say thus within your selves, <hi>Why should</hi> Abraham <hi>love God, or</hi> David <hi>love God more then I? Why should the Angels love God more then I? God hath forgiven me thousands of Iniquities and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, but never forgave the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels one.</hi> When thou readest holy Examples of the Old Testament, you may see that not only such and such things are feasible, but that with far less help it was done, then now we in these Gospel times have to do it with.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let Christ be very much the Subject of your Meditation, when I consider the whole business of the worship of God from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World to Christ, and how God doth acquiesse in Christ, and that the highest Angels desire to know him.</p>
               <p>I fully conclude, that Christ is wonderfully worththy, to take
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42514:51"/>
up our thoughts, our chiefest love, and our greatest joy, so that the question will not be, whether Christ be worthy of our love, but rather whether our love be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Christ, and as the other, so this is unquestionable and of doubt, that it is not.</p>

               <p>Lord, <hi>I</hi> am come now to power out my soul before thee, and my tears in thy bosome, to tell thee the sad thoughts and sorrows of my heart; Ah my God, in this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of my Soul, and with tears in mine eyes, and pride in my heart,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42514:54"/>
and sencelesness upon my Spirit, I speak these things: Ah Lord, thou hast scourged me with scorpions, for my sins do encrease as well as my afflictions, these afflictions to me are scorpions, to me they have poyson in them, and at once I am scourged and stung with them, a sad ease it is when my punishment is heavier than I can bear, and yet notwithstanding I go from the presence of God too, and that more and more. My tears dry up in mine eyes, and my love goes out of my heart as soon as kindled; When the Candle of the Lord shined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Tabernacle in my first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, when the fire of thy love was kindled in my heart, I have had some discourses, of devotion, that I was not able to bear the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment that the remembrance and meditation of them brought to my soul, now almost as full of sadness as then of joy: after those
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42514:55"/>
times, as those after the Flood; my joyes and the acts and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my grace grace grew very short liv'd in comparison of what they were before; then they were <hi>Methusalems for age,</hi> and <hi>Sampsons</hi> for strength to what they are now; before though I fell spiritually sick, and my strength and comfort was gone, yet I was sensible of my weakness, it was a pain and a grief unto me that I could not walk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the delightful Garden of the Spouse, and to the sweet bed of his Spices; I could weep for want of tears; if not, I could mourn for sorrow, but now like a man that groaned and strugled so long that he can struggle no longer, but grown senceless, can hardly be perceived to breathe or live; If the sweetest Musick should be plaid by him, or the dearest friend in the world should come and ask him with tears in his eyes, <hi>Dear

Husband, or Dear Wife, how do you?</hi> the poor sick one doth not so much as open the eye to see who it is that speaks, or if open them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presently heavy with death, fall down again, and he dies; So is it with my poor Soul sometimes, <hi>I</hi> can hear my Saviour as it were saying unto me <hi>(for sometimes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I see him about my sick Soul,)</hi> Ah poor Soul how dost thou do? <hi>Is my Joseph yet living?</hi> But alas, Lord, thou knowest <hi>I</hi> have scarce strength or life to lift up mine eye to thee, Lord, <hi>Can these dry bones live?</hi> Can these dry eyes weep?

               <p>I do much wonder at my self and at many, nay some what at all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians upon dayes of humiliation, but most at my self to hear the tongue of a poor Christian confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and his eyes weeping for his sins, and speaking of them with such expressions and such fighs that one would think. Surely this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian keeps a strict communion with God, surely he would not sin for a world, surely God is in all this mans thoughts: And yet stay but whil'st he hath done his prayer, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42514:57"/>
you find in him such strong thoughts, words, and actions, that are almost incredible, loose and idle words, and vain thoughts, I but too often experience it, and makes it even past hope it should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with me: If any Town that was straightly besieged with cruel enemies, should send for aid to such or such, and when they came they should send out most of the Town to joyn with the enemy against those that came to help them, What should we say of such people! Lord, just thus are we, We have a world of corruptions and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Sin and Hell, and Satan, all beset us, and violently assault us, we pray for the help of God against them, day after day, We send our prayers to heaven for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, Well, God doth send his holy Spirit to helpt his poor Soul, in the Ministery of the Word tells us what we should do to overcome
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42514:57"/>
these enemies, and sending many motions of the Spirit to bring into our souls grace to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us; we will not do what he adviseth us to do, nay, but we take part with our corruptions, and resist and fight against the power of <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Thy tender mercies and former relishes of thy goodness are to me like the shadow of death, they are as Christ walking upon the waters, they terrifie me; Lord let me weep thee to me again; Oh my God I am undone, undone, undone; a poor undone creature; Those in desertion are in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times better condition then I am, they want the comforts, but then indeed they have the graces of the Spirit, but is not my poor soul that wants both in a sad condition, that can sit down and fall asleep when I should seek my Saviour?

was then, of what <hi>I</hi> am now: Nay Lord, thou only knowest <hi>I</hi> shall be a gainer: but alas! if now <hi>I</hi> am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone <hi>I</hi> shall have no more fire of thy love then <hi>I</hi> had when <hi>I</hi> lived in the midst of Glowing Coals of Devotion, how can <hi>I</hi> but go out now, since I had much ado to burn then?

then for his sake to overcome my corruptions; for it being but one act, though it hath more pain, yet being but of small continuance, it is less trouble, then all my life long to fight against sin; and thus I do ill even in my best wishes, in divers respects; For I chose <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,</hi> not because thereby I might more honour God, but that I might the sooner and easier come to heaven; And again, that I think I might content my self though I did not so much hate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, if I died a <hi>Martyr,</hi> all would be well; whereas <hi>Though I give my body to be burnt, and have not Charity, it would profit nothing,</hi> and to love God, it is impossible for him that doth not hate, and fight against his corruptions: Alas, O my Soul, how weary are we of our Spiritual Fight, and we would fain find some other way to Heaven, then by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

of it; O that I were dead to the World? yet while we know something better, we shal not think so; We talk much of the Vanity of the World, but who believes that the World is <hi>Vanity and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Spirit?</hi> Or who is sensible of this Truth?

these words in our hearing, as once Christ did to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was going to <hi>Damascus,</hi> surely I think they would have very much affected us: Is the Word of God less his Word because it is written?

should go to one that is given to Swearing, and tell him of the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of that sin, and lay it home to his Conscience in private, it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally doth affect him more then to hear the same sin reproved in publick, yet he should as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly apply it then, though he had not in this respect so much reason to apply it, as I have to apply these words to mine own soul; For the Minister doth not, nor can actually and particularly intend every one that is guilty of the sins he reproves (for he knows not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular person that is guilty of the sin he reproves) as God doth every one that reads his word; Therefore let us take this and apply it to our selves, as if God had sent these words written with his own hand to us in particular: VVhen it is said that the Scripture is written for our Learning, <hi>&amp;c.

if so be there were a receit given me, which I had a long time sought for, and endeavoured to get, being assured that if I had it, it would cure me; Surely I should not only read it, because I might be able to tell others what would cure such a Disease, or to enable my self to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of that matter, but I should read it with abundance of joy, and unquestionable resolution to take it: Alas, Lord, why do I not read thy Word so also, where the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable remedies of all spiritual diseases are set down? Surely it is my senselesness of the mischiefs of these Spiritual Distempers that makes me so little affected with grief for them, and with joy that I have found out the remedies for them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Blessed God, it is no more in my power to know thee by the strength of mine own abilities, if thou dost not manifest thy self and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42514:106"/>
thy truths unto me, then it is for me to see the Sun without the Sun; therefore Lord do thou take off the Veil that is upon my heart and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and that which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Truths. I read in thy Word that my blessed Saviour did <hi>rejoyce in Spirit, and give thee thanks, because thou did'st hide thy Truths from those that were wise and prudent, and reveal them unto babies;</hi> O that I were of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those Babes to whom thou wouldest reveal thy Truths: Lord, give me a powerful, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledge of the Truths that are included in these words.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And holy and blessed Father, If thou wilt be pleased to let me know thy mind in thy Word, though thy commands should be never so cross to my corruptions, (my base corruptions, which have hindred me from a world of joyes,

grace, and Communion with thee, which if it had not been for them I might have had long ago I will do them by the power of thy might; Lord forbid that I should be so wicked as to enquire of thee the Lord, (which I do or should do as often as I read the Scripture) as we read the <hi>Jews</hi> did desire the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah, to enquire of thee for them,</hi> though they were resolved before-hand what to do; Yet they said, <hi>they would do whatever thou shouldest command, whether it were good or evil:</hi> O that I had at least a heart to resolve to serve thee; If I must want, let me want riches, health, liberty, rather then grace; Rather let me want strength, then want a will to serve thee; I had as good sin unwillingly, as to do what thou commandest unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Lord, give me truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts.</p>

Those things that lie plain in these words is, <hi>That those that are of a poor and contrite Spirit, that tremble at the Word of God, are highly esteemed of him;</hi> So that poverty of Spirit, and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit, and trembling at the Word of God, are the three things that are here so highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and prized by God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But now let us seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether we are thus qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Am I poor in Spirit? Those that are so, have low thoughts of themselves, and are not troubled that others have low thoughts of them too; They like reproofs bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then praises; They do not murmure under afflictions, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonder they are no more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Is it thus with us?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Lord, If there be any thing of poverry of Spirit in me, if I take reproofs well, or afflictions
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42514:108"/>
in any measure patiently, certain it is, it is not at all from my self: I was born with as proud a heart as any, and certain I am that I did not change mine own heart; Thou takest away the stony heart, we do not give thee it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But alas, Lord, I am far from being poor in spirit in any measure, according to that which thou in thy VVord requirest. My passion, and the boylings of my heart, my loving to be called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and to be esteemed by others, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distempers and corruptions of that nature, which I have daily to struggle withal, evidently prove the pride of my heart; nay, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that thou laeyst upon me plainly show what the corruption is that thou intendest especially to cure: By the Medicine oft times one may know what the Disease is; and Lord, it is in vain (if there were no other end in it, then to

manifest my distempers to thee) for me to confess the secret pride of mine heart, the strange windings, turnings, depths, and the strange and new Monsters of pride and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, that <hi>I</hi> might daily discover in my self; alass Lord, thou knowest these altogether, and since thou dost so, what cause have <hi>I</hi> to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that thou shouldest shine upon such a dunghil as I am! But Lord, thou only canst cure me of this pride and hypocrisie of heart, for my prayers cannot; nay, though I consider and am convinced of rhe desperate wickedness of mine own heart, the vileness of my nature; the abominations of my life, yet these cannot work without thee, as a plaister though it be never so excellent, laid on the wounds of a dead man, it draws not; it heals not, so are all consideration and convictons to a dead heart.</p>

But, as to God nothing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that argues power; so to such a heart as every one hath by nature nothing isimpossible, that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues sin; and we have more cause to wonder that we have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the sin against the holy Ghost, then that we have done the evils that we have; For certainly, had God but given us up to the strength of our own corruptions, and to Satans subtlety and malice
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42514:109"/>
to improve them, we had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that sin long ago. And alass, what good doth the high esteem of others do us? are we ever a whit the more holy because they think us so? Nay, hath it not proved a means to make us more sinful? God hath abundantly declared his wrath against this sin, by that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which he hath poured out upon Satan for being guilty of it: how many severe threatnings are there in the word of God against pride? and how many precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to those that are humble?

               <p n="3">3. What are the things that cause thee to pride thy self? Are they thy gifts either of edification or sanctification? Consider that 1. They are very mean; scarce any of thy calling, hath weaker gifts of edification; and no Saint under
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42514:110"/>
heaven hath weaker gifts of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. 2. Suppose thy gifts were great, O what an heavy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count must there be for mis-spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Talents? What way canst thou worse mis-spend them then by priding thy self in them? Do men praise thee? Alass thou mayest go to hell with their praises, for so did the Scribes and Pharisees: Do all men speak well of thee? and dost thou pride thy self and rejoyce in that? Fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at what our Saviour saith, <hi>Wo unto you when all men speak well of you, for so did their Fathers of the false Prophets.</hi> 3. Consider how unkindly thou dealest with God; thou dost as a woman that should deck her self with the jewels that her husband had given her, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spighting his love, gives away those Jewels to those with whom she played the harlot, the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice them; is not this the act of an imperious whorish woman? as

God himself doth phrase it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 30. and do but read that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and you shall see whether you have not a bused all the blessings of God more then they did; They spent them in honour to, and in worshipping of Idols; and can one make a baser Idol in the world to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it then ones self?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us consider what are the remedies of this sin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider how much hell there is in thy heart, what a base and vile wretched nature thou hast: Consider what the Scripture speaks of men in their natural condition; and be sure the Scripture which was written by the Spirit of God, doth not use to do as those vain men do, who when they praise or dispraise, care not whether their expressions are true or false, so they be high enough; and they rather strive to speak as much as they can,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42514:111"/>
as then much as they ought. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatsoever the Scripture hath spoken is made good to the utmost by those that are in hell, and would by every man on earth, did God withdraw his restraining, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying grace, and were those sparkes of hell fire that is in every one by nature blown up to a flame, and heightned by those sufferings that are there inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider how little good and how much corruption there is in our best actions, from what carnal grounds, and for what carnal ends we perform our holy duties; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is more sin in our best actions then ever yet we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in our greatest abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Do but meditate upon those several considerations set down in the meditation of our sins, &amp; it will be a great preservative and remedy against pride. Lastly, Resolve
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42514:111"/>
with thy self never (unless the glory of God may be thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced) to speak or do any thing that may cause others to have high thoughts of thee, or at least not to that end; what-ever good duties thou dost, whether of prayer or alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do them as secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as may be, <hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</hi> Though thou art exceedingly to be humbled for thy sins, because they offend and dishonour God, and scandalize Religion, yet let not this at all trouble thee, that thereby the esteem that men have of thee is much abated: To conclude, pray earnestly as if thou wert to pray for thy life, for it is thy life, that God would humble thee; desire God to afflict thee, or use any means that he would sanctifie to that end; and when thou hast finisht thy Meditation, consider what

                  <p n="1">1. Consider how much thou art engaged to God for bodily Mercies, he hath given thee thy senses, sight, hearing, and other parts of thy body; It thou did'st want thy sight, what woulst thou give for it if thou wast Emperour of the world? How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound; wouldst thou give? A Diamond is not therefore worth no more then 6 d because a poor man can give no more: if thou shouldst reckon up what thy hands, feet, health, liberty were worth, to what a vast Sum would they arise? Thou hast all these things from God, thou hast not them from thy Parents, they know not before thou wert born whether thou shouldest be Male a Female, thou ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>'st say to God, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>In thy Book were all my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers written.</hi>

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:42514:118"/>
2. Consider what faculties of Soul God hath given thee; What a miserable condition are mad men in, those that are born Natural Fools; Thou art well, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands are sick, thou hast plenty when thousands beg their bread.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider what spirituality of Mercies God hath given thee, how many thousand poor ignorant Heathens are there which never heard of God and of Christ, who were born and bread where the Gospel is not preached, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Devil, but thou dwellest in the Sunshine, and under the droppings of the Gospel, and are not these great Mercies and unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable? If thou dost not value them, it argues so much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er goodness in God to bestow them upon thee; nay, hath not God made thee to know him; he hath not only given thee the light of the Gospel, but eyes to behold it.</p>

                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:42514:119"/>
4. Consider the greatness of God; why should he look after thee, nay, why doth he not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy thee? Thou art but a Worm, nay, a Viper: why doth he let thee hang upon his hand of Providence, and not shake thee off into Hell fire? As we walk we do not step out of our way, to avoid crushing a Worm to death: If we see an Adder, or such a venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we go out of out way to destroy it; God hath not dealt so with thee, but when thou hast run from God, he hath called after thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would not suffer thee to perish though thou wouldest; and when thou hast come against him with thy sins, and thy rebellions, he hath stood with stretched out arms to imbrace thee, Are not these Miracles of Mercy, O my Soul? how many mercies dost thou receive from God, even at that very time when thou sinnest against him?</p>

5. Consider the innumerable multitude, the infinite greatness of his Mercies, and the wonderful love wherewithall he bestows them: <hi>How precious are thy thoughts toward me, O God</hi> (saith <hi>David,)</hi> I am sure thou had just cause to say also, O my Soul. The Mercies that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed are, wonderful, but those that he hath promised, are far greater: <hi>What manner of love hath the Father bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God! Now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not appear what we shall be;</hi> That he should make us his Sons is very much; but that he should not spare his own Son, that he might spare us, is beyond all admiration.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Consider seriously how much God abhors Sin, and how odious it is to him, this you may see both by what God hath said, and what God hath done to shew the abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of it.</p>

Prophet cryeth out, saying, O do not this abominable thing which I hate; How often doth God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess his hatred of Sin? if one should spit in a mans face, or lay Toads or Serpents in his bosome, or whatsoever you could imagine, it could not be so abominable to him, as Sin is to God, he hates it more then we hate hel, how can we know any ones hatred of any thing, but by his expressions and his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? suppose you should see one take some curious, costly, or rare Dish of Meat which he loved above any thing in the world, and because there was some small crum of another meat which he had an antipathy against, he should fling all with violence and detestation away, were not this enough to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you that he abhorred that meat, a crum whereof made him abhor that which he so much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Suppose you should see one
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42514:123"/>
take a Watch, whose wheels and all the rest were cut out of intire Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and spying some little small and almost undiscernable Spider in it, should fling it to the ground with so much violence that he should break it all to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it would evidently argue how much he detested a Spider: What excellent Creatures are Angels, and yet because a Sin though but of thought was found in them, how doth it cast them like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into Hell! Suppose further, thou shouldest see the meekest, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest man, &amp; lovingest Father in the world, taking his Son, and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him with rod after rod, until that he were all of gore blood from head to foot, and though he cried out and begged of his Father to spare, yet he would not spare him, but scourged him to death: Would you not say that the Son had done somewhat that the

Father did wonderfully abhor? Hath not God dealt thus with Christ? Did he not chastise him until he shed blood from the Crown of the head to the sole of the feet? Did not Christ die under his correcting hand; did not Christ cry out again and again <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be possible let this cup pass from me?</hi> And did he not love Christ more then any Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Son, and all this because Christ was guilty of Sin, though but as a surety; these things are not inventions of wit or rhetorick, but real Truths; If the dostroying of <hi>Sodom, Gomorrha, Jerusalem,</hi> Angels and the most part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> posterity and the whole world, save eight persons; If the Sufferings of Christ be not enough to satisfie thee of Gods hatred of sin, then thou maist go on to thy own destruction: but know this, <hi>that it will be bitterness at the last.</hi>

2. Consider what thou dost when thou sinnest, every sinner doth vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually put Heaven and Christ, and God, and his favour and loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness, and all his promises in one scale, and that pleasure, profit, or honour, which sin promiseth, with a wouded conscience, the torments of hell, the wrath of God in the other scale, and doubtless virtually a sinner chooseth sin with all these mischiefs, before the service of God with all his mercies. It is as if a sinner should say, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then I wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <p n="3">3. Consider how often thou hast sinned against God, every uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted man doth nothing else; his plowing is an abomination, <hi>All his imaginations are only evil and that continually:</hi> Nay, though thou art one of Gods people, yet <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>that his sins are more in number than the hairs on his head,</hi> and dost thou think thy sins are fewer then <hi>Davids?</hi> how many years hast thou lived? how many dayes, hours, minutes? thy sins are more; The Hour-Glass that runs hath not so many sands in it as the sins that

thou committest in that hour; If thou dost not beleive this, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that there is not one of thy thoughts, words, actions, but is polluted with abundance of sins; If thou sayest <hi>(Our Father)</hi> since thou dost not speak it with that reverence, attention, fervency, faith, love, joy, confidence, admiration of his goodness, and many other which we are engaged to have, when we call God by the Name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou becomest guilty of all the contrary sins, and many more that are not named, in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that one word in thy prayer not as thou oughtest.

Blessed God, must all these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations pass as a Serpent on a stone without making any impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon my soul?

                  <p>It is enough, O my soul, and too too much, that we have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing our selves, and provoking God thus long; That we have as it were with all our power pulled down the vengeance of God upon us, and as it were kindling his wrath against us, but he hath not suffered his whole Displeasure to arise, nor suffered us to perish though we would; blessed be his Name that we have not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sinne against the Holy Ghost; which we certainly had done, had he given us up to the strength of our own corruptions,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42514:128"/>
and to the power and malice of Satan to improve them to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Is it true indeed that God saith, <hi>Yet return, and I will save thee;</hi> doth he stand with stretched out arms? doth he indeed stand with stretched out arms to imbrace us? is it possible he should be so gracious to forgive such and so many sins, and of such long continuance? well, blessed be God, we will go unto him, and never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him more. We will hereafter whensoever we are tempted unto sinne, say, what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sinne against such love, such mercy, such experiences? offend that God that hath pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us? that hath done such things for us, and is not content with that, but hath promised to doe more?

some measure sensible that I pray not with that servency and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rénce as I ought to do; for the time to come, I shall (by the blessing of God) mend that: I am too passionate, well, since God hath been so gracious, as to forgive so many, so great, so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sins, that mine own heart is not able to understand their vileness or number; I will not hereafter be troubled when I hear my neighbour, or underling, or when I hear my fellow <hi>N.</hi> use such or such taunting words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me; I will not be provoked by this or that despight or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous trick, that he or she doth use against me, but rather I will endeavour to say or do such a thing, to gain his good will, and to pacifie his anger conceived against me; for certainly his injuries are not comparable to my sinnes; and yet God forgives me them: there

                  <head>Considerations.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Canst thou not remember that thou wert by such an one when he died? didst thou not see how his countenance failed, his eye-strings broke, how he grew weaker and weaker, at last grew speechless; how he throtled in the throat how his teeth grated, how he sweated and strugled for life, and at last gaspt and died: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that thus thou must do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, how soon the Lord only knows; that thou art well now is nothing; that thou art young and strong now, is nothing; for how many are there that have been strong, and well, and as young as thou, within a very few dayes after have been in their Grave.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42514:130"/>
That thou must die is certain, when, where, how, none knows but he that made thee: only this is true, that generally men die sooner then they expect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider that there will be an end of the World as to thee; thou must leave Riches, Friends, Wife, Children, Houses, Lands, and thine one body also. Thy friends may stand weeping by, but they cannot prolong thy life one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider that when thou comest to die, it will certainly not repent thee that thou hast spent so much time in prayer, so much in meditation, so much in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it was never known since the world began, that any one did then say, O that I had prayed less; though these holy Duties now seem irksome and troublesome to thee, doubtless then they shall bring more comfort to thee, then all those Riches and Vanities in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42514:131"/>
which thou hast spent so much time, and took so much delight in. These things are certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, our understandings cannot (O that our lives did not) deny them.</p>
                  <p>Consider how that the dearest friends thou hast in the world, will hasten thy filthy carkass out of the doors; they will scarce dare to stay with it alone, but say as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Let me bury my dead out of my sight:</hi> and then how seldom will they think or speak of thee; or if they do, what good will it do thee?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Consider, alas, poor man, whether will thy soul go then, to hell or to heaven: dost thou know to which? dost thou not think thou shalt go that way which thou hast gone all thy life long? if thou hast walk't in the wayes of hell, how canst thou imagine that at the end of that journey thou should'st ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at heaven?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Consider, what good will all
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42514:131"/>
thy wealth, all thy pleasures, all thy vanities do thee at that day? they will all vanish as doth the morning dew. Alas, who knows not all these things, and yet not one of a thousand consider and lay them to heart; and to know these Truths, &amp; live unsuitably to them, doth but add to our folly &amp; mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: <hi>O that they were wise,</hi> saith God, <hi>that they would consider their latter end.</hi> These serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of our death, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for it, is one of the chiefest points of wisdom in the world.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Consider if thou miscarry in this great work of concernment, <hi>viz.</hi> thy death, thou art undone for ever. If thou mightest live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and mend that errour which thou committedst in thy dying ill, then there were some hope, but it is appointed for all men once to die, and but once.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Despise the World; O ye vanities and fooleries of the world, why should I spend my time and strength in following after you? what have ye done for me, or what can you do? when I shall stand most in need of comfort, you will not only prove <hi>vanities, but vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit: Solomon</hi> hath tried you, and he hath from his own experience, and from the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit, hath told me, that you are but vanity; and all

                  <p>O my Soul, since things are thus, let us not resist known Truths: shall we neglect these Truths because they are plain? if they are abstruce, then we doubt them; If they are plain, shall we despise them? Dost thou not know how soon thou shalt die, then what have we to doe that must be done before we die, do it with all thy might, for the night comes, wherein no man works: My children are not yet sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructed in the wayes of God; I will set apart half an hour in a day to instruct them for this moneth, or give so much to the poor every time I miss: there is such a neighbour or acquaintance who goes on in wicked wayes, and my words have so much power with him, that I am confident if I do earnestly beg of God to bless me in the work, and take him private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and lay before him his danger,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42514:133"/>
and press him to holiness, he may be wrought upon; I have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it hitherto, but I am resolved sometime within a week to take some opportunity to speak seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and home unto him, or give so much to the poor; and so every week give so much to the poor, until I have spoke with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And since it so much concerns me to be prepared for Death, I will every day make it one special clause of my prayer, to beg of God that he would fit me for that hour, and I will lay up a Treasury in heaven by giving to the poor, and make my self friends of this unrighteous Mammon, that when I fail, they may receive me into their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Consider how Dreadful and Terrible that day will be when the Sea shall roar, when the very powers of heaven shall be shaken, when Christ shall come with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of his Angels in flaming fire: When an Angel came down from Heaven to rowl away the stone, the Souldiers that watched there became as dead men; nay, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest men that have liv'd, have been exceedingly afraid at things of far less Terrour then those things are which will be at the day of Judgement; For <hi>Moses</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>did exceedingly fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when he heard and saw the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible signs that were at the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Law:</hi> and the blessed Apostle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 21. <hi>became as

If thou had'st a thousand worlds, O my soul, wouldest thou not give all for this, that God would say so to thee; Well, if thou wilt be watchful over thy wayes, live holily, love, and believe in Christ, and repent, the day will shortly come, when Christ shall say that, and much more.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 Consider, O my soul the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these Torments; certainly if God so heavily afflicts his own people as he did <hi>Job, Heman,</hi> and divers of his people who have been in disertion many years: How sad are the expressions of <hi>David,</hi> he saith, <hi>he roar'd for the disquietness of his Soul:</hi> And how many sad Expressions had <hi>Job,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42514:141"/>
that he had not time to swallow his spittle,</hi> and how <hi>that he chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a strangling then life,</hi> and many other exceeding sad expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which could never have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from an holy man, who is set before us as a pattern of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if his afflictions had not been very great: And <hi>Heman</hi> said, <hi>that the terrours of the Lord were so great, that he was almost distracted with them:</hi> and so from his youth up until that time that he writ that Psalm. <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. <hi>If this be done to the green tree, what shall be done to the dry?</hi> And if God chastise his people with such Rods, what Scorpions shall the Damned be Scourged with? and if the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous have been thus afflicted, tossed with Tempests, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, where shall the wicked and ungodly appear? what shall the portion of their cup be? even the dregs of the vials of Gods wrath, for <hi>upon the wicked he shall rain
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42514:141"/>
snares, fire and brimstone, and a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider what the sufferings of Christ were; if we do truly and seriously consider how much those words signifie, when our Saviour saith, <hi>My soul is heavy to the death,</hi> we shall be helped to understand what our Saviours sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows were. If the wisest, holiest and patientest man in the World, who was not oppressed or distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered at all by reason of any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily distemper of Mclancholly, I say, if such a man should come to an intimate bosome friend, and with a sad countenance should fell him that he was even ready to die because of the abundance of grief and sadness that lay upon his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, would not this argue that his sorrows were exceeding great? especially when his friend never heard him to complain in all his life, though the injuries and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings had been very great all
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42514:142"/>
along: If he should further say unto his friend, I beseech you to watch with me; surely it would argue an heart overwhelmed with grief. Now I say, for a Saviour to say so to his Disciple, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to sweat blood; O what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known sorrows did our Saviour feel! How then is it possible for the wicked to escape, when God spared not his own Son though he was but a surety; and those sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that made him groan, will crush thee to pieces; Woe be to that man that is to satisfie the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God in his own person.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider, O my Soul, the sad aggravating concomitants of these Torments; every Member and faculty both of Body and soul shall be tormented: here if our head akes, may be our heart doth not ake; if we have the Stone, we have not the Gout, or if both them, yet not some other Tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring disease; or if the whole body
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42514:142"/>
be tortured, yet one may possess his Soul in patience; but to have a tortured body, <hi>and a wounded conscience, who can bear it;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all this, none can help, none will pity those that are in hell; nay, what is the height of misery, that way God himself shall in the mid'st of all their roarings and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>laugh at their calamity when it comes, as desolaion, and as a whirlwind upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Consider seriously what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity means; for ever, ever, ever, to be tormented, is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming consideration: To lie under the torture of the Stone but one night, how tedious is it; but to be tormented to all eternity, O it is the Hell of Hells.</p>

Despise and abhor the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vanities and pleasures of the world: O vain world, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in thee but sin and misery, temptations, vanity and vexation of Spirit, and are thy vain profits and pleasures so much to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, as for them to dwell in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire? and are the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Sin that are but for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to much worth, that for them we should dwell in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting burnings? have we not had frequent experiences, that the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows we have had for commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Sin, have far exceeded the pleasures that we have had in committing of it, and surely the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42514:144"/>
terrors of an awakened conscience, are not to be compared with the horrors of the damned, and other insupportable and endless miseries of that place of torment.</p>
                  <p>Come, O my Soul, let us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and flatter our selves with vain and false hopes of the mercies of God: It is true, God is very merciful to them that fear him, and we may be sure of this, that if we do sincerely desire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to serve him, that we shall find his mercies as much above our thoughts and expectations of them, as the heavens are above the earth; but if we slight them, and are careless of his service, and turn his grace into wantonness, let us not deceive our selves with vain words, for <hi>because of these things comes the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience:</hi> and those that live so, shall surely find, that at that day the mercies of God will not serve at all to mitigate,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42514:144"/>
but abundantly to Justifie the wrath and fury of God, that he shall pour out upon the wicked: then they shall pay for every Mercy they have received, and the riches of his despised goodness shall but increase the Treasures of his wrath: therefore, O my Soul, since these things are so, what are we to do? why do we not <hi>fear him that can cast both body and soul into hell?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Habaccue,</hi> when he did but think but of some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Judgements that God had threatned, <hi>rottenness entred into his bones.</hi> If indeed the love of God did constrain us, so that we did from a principle of love make conscience of Sin, so that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offend God, it were well; but since we plainly find that it is not strong enough alone, let us not fear to call in and improve the consideration of the Torments of Hell to defer us from Sin; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is imperfect, but not Sinful;
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42514:145"/>
our great work we have to do in the world, next to the glory of God, is to avoid hell, and obtain heaven, and to resist our now three great enemies, the World the Flesh, and the Devil, who endeavour day and night, to drive us headlong into Perdition If any one in the World, much more if the Devil should appear to us, and offer us such a sum of money if we would give him our Souls that we might be dam'd, we think we should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor him and his offer; but alas, doth not every one that useth by extortion and violence either get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth or keepeth what is not his, do the same thing? his damnation is as certain and as infallible, though more secretly and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly contrived by Satan, as if Satan should visibly appear to him and he make a contract with him: therefore, O my Soul, let us take heed of the wiles of Satan, for he generally works by the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42514:145"/>
world, and the flesh to deceive us, therefore let us now resolve by the blessing of God to look upon the world and the flesh, to be as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and implacable enemies as Satan himself, let us not endeavour to please the World by vain Discourses, by omitting what God commands, or doing what he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids: Let us not be troubled, but rather rejoyce; <hi>when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled and scorned for righteousness sake;</hi> For the time to come, when I am to do any Religious Duty, I will not so much as consider what men will judge or say of me, nor endeavour to make the world my Friend, since God himself hath set enmity between us, and as for the flesh, I am sure we are no debtors unto that, we have paid it far more then ever we owed it, therefore for the time to come, I will rather abstain from lawful, then use unlawful pleasures, and I will take heed not only of those
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42514:146"/>
pleasures that are unlawful in kind, but those also that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in degree: and that I may better avoid unlawful pleasures, I will sometimes abstain from those that are lawful; and having seriously considered, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of this, that I have not made conscience enough in the matter of sleep, I have not redeemed the time from that, nor have enough considered the Sinfulness of it, but like the Sluggard that <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of, <hi>have turned upon my bed as a door upon the hinges,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore henceforth I shall endeavour to get as much time from sleep, as the health and strength of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will permit: and bcause I am confident that if the damned were in their natures changed, and were to live again on earth, they would think it a blessed change, to change their howlings into singing of Psalms, and their roarings into Prayers, nay if they were to live
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42514:146"/>
                     <hi>Methuselahs</hi> age upon the rack: Therefore whensoever I am at any time tempted to be weary of this labour of love that is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken in the hardest duties of Religion, I will endeavour to shame my self out of that temptation, by thinking thus with my self, that Hell is so much worse then we can suffer in this world, either in Gods service, or for Gods service; that it were not only a desperate wickedness but madness, for the avoiding of the one, to fall into the other.

Consider what great things God hath given to wicked men in this work, what vast dominions, power, wisdom, learning, Majesty, and indeed as to the things of the world, as much as their hearts can desire; if God gives such things to Doggs and Swine, what may we think are the dainties of that ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet which God feasts his children withal.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Consider, that if the holiest man that ever lived, lived near thee, what high expectations wouldest thou have of his carriage and conference, when thou sawest his zeal and patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But no man lived ever without Sinne; Therefore suppose an Angel should take upon him humane Nature, and live amongst us, with what enflamed expressions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections would he speak of God, of Heaven, and every thing that is Spiritual; But alas, his carriage, his holiness, his wisdom, where as
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42514:154"/>
nothing in comparison of Christs; For there was not any word, or action that eyer Christ spoke, or did, that if all the Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had studied and set down how it ought to have been done, or they themselves should have been to have done it, they could not have equalled it, nay, even God the Father had he taken our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he would not have spoke or done any word or thin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g which should have had (in respect of it self, or any circumstance) more holiness or wisdom then Christs words and actions had so that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in this respect, he that saw Christ, saw the Father, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self saith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider the wonderful wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, Certainly he was greater then <hi>Solomon;</hi> For though he was the humblest man that ever lived, yet he himself said so, nor did it any more argue pride in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42514:154"/>

3. Consider the wondeful and exceeding holiness of Christ, when he was in the height of all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies and Sufferings, he abated not any thing of his Love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God; For his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings did not make him forget, or diminish any thing, no, not in the least circumstance of his Graces, or of any thing that the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at his hands: To be so freely willing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The holiness of those in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is not comparably so much greater then the weakest Saint on earth: As the holiness of Christ was greater whilest he lived on earth, then that of those in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Nay all the Saints on Earth are fil'd from his fulness; For he
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42514:155"/>
is the Fountain that conveyes to his Saints, as they are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the infinite Ocean of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of the God-head; No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that the Angels when they saw his glory, cryed out, <hi>Holy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Lord God of Sabbaths.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Consider, that not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all these infinite Excellencies in Christ, <hi>he thought it no robbery to be equal to the Father;</hi> yet how exceedingly did he humble himself, and how gracious was he: The poorest man or woman in the Word, nay, the greatest Sinner that truly repented, with what love did he receive them: He was the Son of Righteousness, from whom the Angels receive their Glory, and yet he disdains not to shine upon such Dunghills as we are: It is strange, O my soul, to consider how willing Christ was to please every one; only provided it was in things that were not for their hurt that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired

them; Many times, nay, most times, when others were with him, when he in respect of himself, only would have done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, yet he did as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires required, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 3. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, even Christ pleased not himself, many times when he was hungry; If any came to him that needed Instruction, or if he were sleepy, and any came to him that needed Consolation, he would abstain from Meat and Sleep that he might do them good; it is not so with great men, but it was so with Christ, who was the great God.</p>

Do we indeed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them? Surely all is but meer words, and vain thoughts, if we

            <head>The Conclusion of the whole.</head>
            <p>I Found a great deal of difficulty in Writing this small Treatise of Meditation, not into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal or Directory Part, because Christian experience and study are things by which that party is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, but in the setting down of instances and examples therein I found the difficulty to lie: <hi>For Meditation is an harder work then to give directions thereunto:</hi> and I have generally found it easier to study a day, then to Meditate an hour; but of all the kinds of Meditation whereof Instances are set down in this Book, I found the greatest difficulty in those of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Meditations,</hi> they consisting
<pb facs="tcp:42514:159"/>
for the most part of Prayer, which the devout Soul when it hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded forgets so that if one might gain a world, when the heart is overwhelmed with Grief, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with Love, or ravished with Joy, one could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the powrings out of the Soul: In such cases, one may say of such Meditations, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of those Glorious things which he saw when he was wrapt into the third Heavens: they are neither lawful, nor possible to be uttered, many times the secrets in our communion with God, are of that nature, that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by reason of that scandal, nor possible to utter, because the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections being so intensly employ'd Invention, Memory, and intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual actings of the Soul, during that time do almost quite cease, and indeed whosoever goes about to invent Instances of Meditation,
<pb facs="tcp:42514:159"/>
if it be only a Learned Man, and not holy, his Studies may exceed his Actings that way, but if it be an holy experienced Christian, as his inward thoughts of Love, Joy, Grief, and admirings of God are above all that his Tongue doth or can utter, so those secret ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which he useth between God and his own Soul, when his thoughts are full of heaven, and of God, are much beyond what he can invent, or by study expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth; Therefore since those Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations that are fullest of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be remembred, to set down Instances of Meditations, except one should take them from some Saint as he was powring out his soul before God in secret; one can never set them fully down in secret I say; For the Soul is never so free, nor may be before others, as with God alone, and the truth is, if I had not had these Instances
<pb facs="tcp:42514:160"/>
of <hi>Solemn Meditation</hi> by me, I think I should hardly have set down any of that kind; I should only have referred him to the Psalms, It was so that I wrote these from the mouth of one to whom these unseen, I was oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so near that I could hear his secretest Devotions, if utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed though but with an ordinary voice; I am very confident for his part, he thought that none but God and his own Soul were privy to his Prayers, I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times considered it as a case of Conscience, whether it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by stealth to hear, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to publish the private Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of others, but consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much advantage it may bring to others, and how the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty himself can suffer nothing in it, his Name being concealed by me, I resove to publish them, besides. I very well know (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb facs="tcp:42514:160"/>
that the Spiritual expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between God and ones own Soul in secret, are forgotten al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as soon as ended; It is very unlikely that any should remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then ten years after, as the most of these are: I thought good to give an account of this matter, lest I should be thought to have that holy frame of heart, which many of the expressions in these Meditations argues, that he had that used them, and arrogate to my self that which is farre from me.</p>
            <p>If any shall be offended at the brevity and shortnesse of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of this great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty businesse of Meditation, I shall onely say thus much as to that.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I am not willing to overcharge or affright New Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners
<pb facs="tcp:42514:161"/>
(for, for such I do very much intend this Treatise) with too great a Number of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would not have this swell above the bigness of a Manual, for I have often observed, that when one hath perswaded some to buy some Book, and told them it hath been but a small price, it hath been almost as strong a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (the smallness of the price) as the goodness of the Book: and I would not be willing that both these Motives should be wanting to the buying of this Book.</p>
            <p>As for the plainnesse of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ile or Matter, I shall thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it, if it ought to be excused, I wrote this for the meanest and ignorantest sort of Christians that they might buy, and understand it, that they might buy it, I have
<pb facs="tcp:42514:161"/>
made it a Manaul, that they might understand it, I have made it plain, and spoke to them in their own Language; and to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I say, if any such shall read this Treatise, <hi>Indocti rapiunt coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> and though I highly prize Learning, yet I know that as to Prayer and Meditation, and all other acts of Devotion, wherein we keep a strict Communion with God, and watch over our own Souls, and experimental knowledge and acquaintance with, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed affections towards God, will more avail us then all the Learning in the VVorld, and doubtless it is not generally Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in those that live under Ordinances, but the <hi>Non-</hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Truths we know, that will undo us, if we do but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove these plain Truths, <hi>viz</hi> that God is, that there will be a Day of Judgement, that we must die,
<pb facs="tcp:42514:162"/>
that we ought to love God with all our Heart, with all our Soul, with all our Mind, with all our Strength, that we should do as we would be done to I say, if we did but improve these into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, we should attain to more holiness, then if we knew a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times more, and left those Truths (as generally men do) by them, as things forgotten, I doe very much think that the Truths of Religion have been spun into too fine a Thred of late dayes, and some have observed, that fewer have been converted of late years then formerly, when fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals have been Plainly, Powerfully, and Practically prest upon the Conscience, it is an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to think that Notions, so they be Spiritual, cannot be two accute or Speculative; I have one thing to entreat of the Christian Reader, and it was one end of publing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:42514:162"/>
this Treatise that I might with it publish th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se my desires. The thing that I am to request of you, will neither be charge nor trouble; It is your frequent, serious, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayers that I desire of you; I know it is used too much as a Complement among Christians, to desire prayers of their Christian friends, and they are too often Superficially promised, and too seldom conscienciously performed: Nor would I have thee, whosoever thou art that fearest God, account this my Request a thing of course, and that it is at thy Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to grant it or no; for suppose a poor Distressed Man overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, &amp; almost swallowed up with the sense of his Miseries and wants, should with Tears and strong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities beg relief of thee; Dost thou think it were an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thing (when it was in thy power) to relieve him or not?
<pb facs="tcp:42514:163"/>
Mightest thou not justly expect that the next time thou wentest to pour out thy Soul before God, that he should keep by him the denial that thou gavest that poor man, and give it thee, when thou in the distressed thoughts of thy heart, makest thy prayer to him? and dost thou think that the Lord will hold thee guiltless, when one whose afflictions are many, Corruptions strong, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to undergo, shall in the anguish and bitterness of his Spirit desire thy prayers, and thou refuse, or neglect: Consider whether at the day of Judgment thou wilt have any sufficient excuse to plead. I have sometimes thought that the Bills that have publickly been put up for the prayers of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation have been too little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it may be they have been too customarily and formally put up, it may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o, but it is not good for
<pb facs="tcp:42514:163"/>
us to be Judges of evil thoughts, little do we know what Terrours and Fears, and Anguishes of Spirit overwhelm them, while they are so little regarded by us; O that we were sensible of others afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and sorrows, whether spiritual or Temporal, as they themselves are, and as we would have them to be of ours, were our Souls in their Souls stead: And if the Lord should so by his providence order it as to bring us into those straits which we saw our brother in, and would not afford him so much as our Prayers, may we not justly expect that the next time that we our selves are in streights, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences should take up a Parable and Taunting Proverb against us, and say as <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren did, we are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought us, and we would not hear,
<pb facs="tcp:42514:164"/>
therefore is all this distress come upon us. And that which I would desire thee to beg of God for me is, That he would give me sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aim at his Glory in all my actions, but especially those that belong to my Ministry, that I might not be as a broken vessel, and that he would give me great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Discoveries of, and love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and the Lord Jesus Christ; and that he would give me gifts, and strength, and wisdom, oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and a heart to serve him, and mercies suitable to my wants, that my afflictions may be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, my Temptations conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and my Corruptions morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>One thing more I am to request of thee, that is, to do what I know is too much neglected by my self, and I fear by others; Thou art to pray for a blessing upon thy self when thou readest this Treatise,
<pb facs="tcp:42514:164"/>
and that God would make it a blessing unto others also, into whose hands it shall come: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you that you would help me with your prayers in this particular; When we do but take our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry daily bread, we crave a blessing, how much more when we doe things that concern our eternal good? When we take a Book, to that end, Spiritually to benefit by it, do we think that it is in our own power, or in the power of any Treatise that we read, (without Gods assistance) to do us good? Nay, the Word of God it self is but a dead Letter, if the holy Spirit be absent when we hear or read it. But that thou shouldest desire a blessing upon thy self in reading of this book, is not all I request of thee, but that thou wouldest also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thy Prayers further, even for others, that it may be also for their
<pb facs="tcp:42514:165"/>
edification whosoever shall read it; For as we are to pray that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sermon we hear may be for the Spiritual advantage of others, as well as of our selves; It holds also in reading of Treatises of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
