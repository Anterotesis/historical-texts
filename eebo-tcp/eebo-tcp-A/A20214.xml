            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Â¶ A short Answere to the boke called: Beware the Cat,</head>
            <l>To the ientil reder: harti salutacions,</l>
            <l>Desiring thee to knoe: Baldewins straunge faschions</l>
            <l>And if in aunsering: I appere sum what quick,</l>
            <l>Thinke it not with out cause. his taunts be rive &amp; thick</l>
            <l>Where as ther is a boke, called: beware the cat,</l>
            <l>The veri truith is so, that Stremer made not that,</l>
            <l>Nor no suche false fabels: fell ever from his pen,</l>
            <l>Nor from his hart or mouth: as knoe mani honest men</l>
            <l>But wil ye gladli knoe, who made that boke in dede,</l>
            <l>One Wylliam Baldewine. God graunt him wel to spede</l>
            <l>God graunt him mani new yeres, prosperite and helth</l>
            <l>As he hath in this thing: farderd the Comon welth</l>
            <l>With large lesure, browne studi: he musing all alone</l>
            <l>Devised by what meanes: he might win the whetstone</l>
            <l>Every thing almost: in that boke is as tru,</l>
            <l>As that at Midsomer: in London it doth snu.</l>
            <l>Every thing almost: in that boke is as tru,</l>
            <l>As that his nose to my dock: is ioyned fast with glu,</l>
            <l>Put vp your pipes Baldewine: if you can make no better,</l>
            <l>Many talk more wittili: that knoe not one letter,</l>
            <l>Put on your cap Baldewine: &amp; kepe your brayn pan warme</l>
            <l>Least ye go to Bedlem: if suche toyes in you swarme</l>
            <l>Rede this litel short Rime: Baldewinken, til more cum:</l>
            <l>And with Stremers excrements: be bold to noint your gum</l>
            <l>In stede of Diaglum, in stede of Coloquintida,</l>
            <l>In stede of ru barbarum, or casia fistula.</l>
            <l>If the maker hereof: had bin at more lesure.</l>
            <l>Ye had had from his hande: a more precious tresure</l>
            <l>But in the meane season: content your selfe with this,</l>
            <l>For your Bagagical boke, a warme a. r. s. you may kys.</l>
            <l>O r els a payre of stockes: if officers do wel,</l>
            <l>You hurt a harmeles man: which no such tales did tel,</l>
            <l>As ye were disposed: loude lyes on him to make,</l>
            <l>Which many witti things: writes for his countreys sake.</l>
            <l>Alas I wolde to God: your boke were halfe so good,</l>
            <l>I wysh you no more harme: nor to your swete hart bloud</l>
            <l>The pith of this paper, (if any man in it loke)</l>
            <l>Is to deni utterli, that Stremer made that boke</l>
            <l>The boke (of ten leaves) was printed every worde</l>
            <l>Er Stremer saw any pece, to wipe a way a t. o. r. d.</l>
            <l>Tergendis natibus, som thought his boke was good</l>
            <l>Or to cari spiceti, to cherische a sick mans bloud.</l>
            <l>Therfore ientyl reder: beware what credence thou ghive</l>
            <l>The truth here conteyned: thou mayst boldly belive</l>
            <l>Baldwins toyes do belong: to thee or any other</l>
            <l>As well as they do touche Stremer, his pore brother.</l>
            <l>And now Iuge good hirers: whether he be a good man</l>
            <l>Of whom I write these things: as truli as I can.</l>
            <l>If that be not a grete faute, so to hurt a mans name,</l>
            <l>Without sufficient cause: what crime shuld a man blame?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Omnia si perdas: famam servare memento: Qua semel amissa postea nullus eris,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>If thou lese all (sayth he) yet reserve honest fame</l>
            <l>If that be ones clene gon: go home and suck thy dame.</l>
            <l>I am loth for to rayle, as Baldwin hath begun</l>
            <l>For so betwine vs both: a fayre threde shuld be spun</l>
            <l>This miche I haue writen: that the truith shuld be knowen</l>
            <l>And that the falsite: shuld quite be ouerthro wen.</l>
