            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>WE might well call this short Mock-play of ours</l>
            <l>A Posie made of Weeds instead of Flowers;</l>
            <l>Yet such have been presented to your noses,</l>
            <l>And there are such, I fear, who thought 'em Roses.</l>
            <l>Would some of 'em were here, to see, this night,</l>
            <l>What stuff it is in which they took delight.</l>
            <l>Here, brisk insipid Blades, for wit, let fall</l>
            <l>Sometimes dull sence; but oft'ner, none at all:</l>
            <l>There, strutting Heroes, with a grim-fac'd train,</l>
            <l>Shall brave the Gods, in King <hi>Cambyses</hi> vain.</l>
            <l>For (changing Rules, of late, as if men writ</l>
            <l>In spite of Reason, Nature, Art, and Wit)</l>
            <l>Our Poets make us laugh at Tragoedy,</l>
            <l>And with their Comedies they make us cry.</l>
            <l>Now, Critiques, do your worst, that here are met;</l>
            <l>For, like a Rook I have hedg'd in my Bet.</l>
            <l>If you approve; I shall assume the state</l>
            <l>Of those high-flyers whom I imitate:</l>
            <l>And justly too; for I will shew you more</l>
            <l>Than ever they vouchsaf'd to shew before:</l>
            <l>I will both represent the feats they do,</l>
            <l>And give you all their reasons for 'em too.</l>
            <l>Some honour to me will from this arise.</l>
            <l>But if, by my endeavours, you grow wise,</l>
            <l>And what was once so prais'd you now despise;</l>
            <l>Then I'l cry out, swell'd with Poetique rage,</l>
            <l>'Tis I, <hi>John Lacy,</hi> have reform'd your Stage.</l>

                  <p>Faith, not above an hour: and, if I had not met you here, I had gone to look you out; for I long to talk with you freely, of all the strange new things we have heard in the Country.</p>

                  <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                  <p>And, by my troth, I have long'd as much to laugh with you, at all the impertinent, dull, fantastical things, we are tir'd out with here.</p>

                  <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                  <p>Dull and fantastical! that's an excellent composition. Pray, what are our men of business doing?</p>

                  <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                  <p>I ne'er enquire after 'em. Thou know'st my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour lyes another way.

                  <p>Why, as I use to do; eat and drink as well as I can, have a She-friend to be private with in the afternoon, and sometimes see a Play: where there are such things <hi>(Frank)</hi> such hideous, monstrous things, that it has almost made me forswear the Stage, and resolve to apply my self to the solid nonsence of your pretenders to Business, as the more ingenious pastime.</p>

                  <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                  <p>I have heard, indeed, you have had lately many new Plays, and our Country-wits commend 'em.</p>

                  <p>Nay, by my troth, that's a hard matter: I don't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that my self. 'Tis a phrase they have got among them, to express their no-meaning by.

                  <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, to tell him the meaning of thy last Play.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>How, Sir, the meaning? do you mean the Plot.</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>Faith, Sir, the Intrigo's now quite out of my head; but I have a new one, in my pocket, that I may say is a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; 't has never yet been blown upon. I must tell you one thing, 'Tis all new Wit; and, though I say it, a better than my last: and you know well enough how that took. In fine, it shall read, and write, and act, and plot, and shew, ay, and pit, box and gallery, I gad, with any Play in <hi>Europe.</hi> This morning is its last Rehearsal, in their habits, and all that, as it is to be acted; and if you, and your friend will do it but the honour to see it in its Virgin attire; though, perhaps, it may blush, I shall not be asham'd to discover its nakedness unto you.—I think it is o' this side.

                  <p>Sir, I confess I am not able to answer you in this new way; but if you please to lead, I shall be glad to follow you; and I hope my friend will do so too.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, here it is. No, cry your mercy: this is my book of <hi>Drama Common places</hi>; the Mother of many other Plays.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Drama Common places!</hi> pray what's that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, some certain helps, that we men of Art have found it convenient to make use of.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                  <p>How, Sir, help for Wit?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>I, Sir, that's my position. And I do here averr, That no man yet the Sun e'er shone upon, has parts sufficient to furnish out a Stage, except it be with the help of these my Rules.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101181:5"/>
                  <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                  <p>What are those Rules, I pray?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, my first Rule is the Rule of Transversion, or <hi>Regula Duplex:</hi> changing Verse into Prose, or Prose into verse, <hi>alternative</hi> as you please.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                  <p>How's that, Sir, by a Rule, I pray?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, thus, Sir; nothing more easie when under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: I take a Book in my hand, either at home, or elsewhere, for that's all one, if there be any Wit in't, as there is no Book but has some, I Transverse it; that is, if it be Prose, put it into Verse, (but that takes up some time) if it be Verse, put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Prose.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                  <p>Methinks, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> that putting Verse into Prose should be call'd Transprosing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>By my troth, a very good Notion, and hereafter it shall be so.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Sir, and what d'ye do with it then?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>Make it my own. 'Tis so alter'd that no man can know it. My next Rule is the Rule of Record, and by way of Table-Book. Pray observe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, we hear you: go on.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>As thus. I come into a Coffee-house, or some other place where wittie men resort, I make as if I minded nothing; (do you mark?) but as soon as any one speaks, pop I slap it down, and make that, too, my own.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> are not you sometimes in danger of their making you restore, by force, what you have gotten thus by Art?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Sir; the world's unmindful: they never take notice of these things.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                  <p>But pray, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> among all your other Rules, have you no one Rule for Invention?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir; that's my third Rule that I have here in my pocket.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                  <p>What Rule can that be?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, when I have any thing to invent, I never trouble my head about it, as other men do; but presently turn o'er this Book, and there I have, at one view, all that <hi>Perseus,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101181:5"/>
Montaigne, Seneca's Tragedies, Horace, Iuvenal, Claudian, Pliny, Plutarch's lives,</hi> and the rest, have ever thought, upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and so, in a trice, by leaving out a few words, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in others of my own, the business is done.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> this is as sure, and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a way of Wit as ever I heard of.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>I, Sirs, when you come to write your selves, o' my word you'l find it so. But, Gentlemen, if you make the least scruple of the efficacie of these my Rules, do but come to the Play-house, and you shall judge of 'em by the effects.</p>

                  <p>Phoo! the Author will be here presently, and he'l tell us all. You must know, this is the new way of writing; and these hard things please forty times better than the old plain way. For, look you, Sir, the grand design upon the Stage is to keep the Auditors in suspence; for to ghess present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the plot, and the sence, tires 'em before the end of the first Act: now, here, every line surprises you, and brings in new matter. And, then, for Scenes, Cloaths and Dancing, we put 'em quite down, all that ever went before us: and these are the things, you know, that are essential to a Play.</p>

                  <p>Pray, Sir, let's sit down. Look you, Sir, the chief hindge of this Play, upon which the whole Plot moves and turns, and that causes the variety of all the several accidents, which, you know, are the thing in Nature that make up the grand refinement of a Play, is, that I suppose two Kings to be of the same place: as, for example, at <hi>Brentford</hi>; for I love to write familiarly. Now the people having the same relations to 'em both, the same affections, the same duty, the same obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and all that; are divided among themselves in point of devoir and interest, how to behave themselves equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em: these Kings differing sometimes in particular; though, in the main, they agree.

                  <p>Now, Gentlemen, I would fain ask your opinion of one thing. I have made a Prologue and an Epilogue, which may both serve for either: (do you mark?) nay, they may both serve too, I gad, for any other Play as well as this.</p>

                  <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                  <p>And I would fain ask your judgements, now, which of them would do best for the Prologue? For, you must know, there is, in nature, but two ways of making very good Prologues. The one is by civility, by insinuation, good lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and all that, to— a —in a manner, steal your plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit from the courtesie of the Auditors: the other, by making use of some certain personal things, which may keep a hank upon such censuring persons, as cannot otherways, A gad, in nature, be hindred from being too free with their tongues. To which end, my first Prologue is, that I come out in a long black Veil, and a great huge Hang-man behind me, with a Furr'd-cap, and his Sword drawn; and there tell 'em plainly, That if, out of good nature, they will not like my Play, why I gad, I'l e'en kneel down, and he shall cut my head off. Whereupon they all clapping — a —</p>

                  <p>I'm sure the design's good: that cannot be deny'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And then, for language, I gad, I defie 'em all, in nature, to mend it. Besides, Sir, I have printed above a hundred sheets of papyr, to insinuate the Plot into the Boxes: and withal, have appointed two or three dozen of my friends, to be readie in the Pit, who, I'm sure, will clap, and so the rest, you know, must follow; and then pray, Sir, what becomes of your sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? ha, ha, ha.</p>

                  <p>I think so, Sir: and therefore would chuse this for the Prologue. For if I could engage 'em to clap, before they see the Play, you know 'twould be so much the better; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then they were engag'd: for, let a man write never so well, there are, now-a-days, a sort of persons, they call Critiques, that, I gad, have no more wit in 'em than so many Hobby-horses; but they'l laugh you, Sir, and find fault, and censure things that, A gad, I'm sure they are not able to do themselves. A sort of envious persons, that emulate the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of persons of parts, and think to build their fame, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating of persons that, I gad, to my knowledge, of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the world are, in nature, the persons that do as much despise all that, as — a — In fine, I'l say no more of 'em.</p>

Now, Gentlemen, pray tell me true, and without flattery, is not this a very odd beginning of a Play?</p>

                     <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                     <p>In troth, I think it is, Sir. But why two Kings of the same place?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                     <p>Why? because it's new; and that's it I aim at. I despise your <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and <hi>Beaumont,</hi> that borrow'd all they writ from Nature: I am for fetching it purely out of my own fancie, I.</p>

                     <speaker>Smi.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, Sir; but pray why all this whispering?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, Sir, (besides that it is new, as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) because they are suppos'd to be Polititians; and matters of State ought not to be divulg'd.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                     <p>But then, Sir, why—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, if you'l but respite your curiosity till the end of the fifth Act, you'l find it a piece of patience not ill recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd.

                     <p>How dost thou like this, <hi>Frank</hi>? Is it not just as I told thee?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, I did never, before this, see any thing in Nature; and all that, (as Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> says) so foolish, but I could give some ghess at what mov'd the Fop to do it; but this, I confess, does go beyond my reach.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, 'tis all alike: Mr. <hi>Wintershull</hi> has inform'd me of this Play before. And I'l tell thee, <hi>Frank,</hi> thou shalt not see one Scene here, that either properly ought to come in, or is like any thing thou canst imagine has ever been the practice of the World. And then, when he comes to what he calls good language, it is, as I told thee, very fantastical, most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably dull, and not one word to the purpose.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Smi.</speaker>
                     <p>It does surprise me, I am sure, very much.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iohns.</speaker>
                     <p>I, but it won't do so long: by that time thou hast seen a Play or two, that I'l shew thee, thou wilt be pretty well acquainted with this new kind of Foppery.</p>

                     <p>Why, Sir, you must know, they long had a design to do it before; but never could put it in practice till now: and, to tell you true, that's one reason why I made 'em whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper so at first.</p>

Now, now, now.

O Lord, O Lord! Out, out, out! Did ever men spoil a good thing so? no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, no ear, no time, no thing? you dance worse than the Angels in <hi>Harry</hi> the Eight, or the fat Spirits in <hi>The Tempest,</hi> I gad.</p>

You talk of time, and time; you shall see me do't. Look you now. Here I am dead.

Now mark my Note in <hi>Effaut flat.</hi> Strike up Musick. Now.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101181:13"/>
But then it's as full of Drollery as ever it can hold: 'tis like an Orange stuck with Cloves, as for conceipt. Come, where are you? This Scene will make you die with laughing, if it be well acted: it is a Scene of sheer Wit, without any mixture in the world, I gad.

                     <p>No, Sir; I have a precedent for it too. A person of Honour, and a Scholar, brought in his Funeral just so: and he was one (let me tell you) that knew as well what belong'd to a Funeral, as any man in <hi>England,</hi> I gad.</p>

                     <p>I gad, but I have another device, a frolick, which I think yet better than all this; not for the Plot or Characters, (for, in my Heroick Plays, I make no difference, as to those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) but for another contrivance.</p>

                     <speaker>Bayes.</speaker>
                     <p>That is my sence. And therefore, Sir, whereas e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one makes five Acts to one Play, what do me I, but make five Plays to one Plot: by which means the Auditors have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day a new thing.</p>

                     <p>Yes, Sir, as I have order'd it. You shall hear. He having passionately lov'd her through my five whole Plays, finding at last that she consents to his love, just after that his Mother had appear'd to him like a Ghost, he kills himself. That's one way. The other is, that she coming at last to love him, with as violent a passion as he lov'd her, she kills her self. Now my question is, which of these two persons should suffer upon this occasion?</p>

I make 'em, Sir, play the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel in <hi>Recitativo.</hi> And here's the conceipt. Just at the very same instant that one sings, the other, Sir, recovers you his Sword, and puts himself in a warlike posture: so that you have at once your ear entertain'd with Musick, and good Language; and your eye satisfi'd with the garb, and accoutrements of war. Is not that well?</p>

            <l>THe Play is at an end, but where's the Plot?</l>
            <l>That circumstance our Poet <hi>Bayes</hi> forgot,</l>
            <l>And we can boast, though 'tis a plotting Age,</l>
            <l>No place is freer from it than the Stage.</l>
            <l>The Ancients Plotted, though, and strove to please</l>
            <l>With sence that might be understood with ease;</l>
            <l>They every Scene with so much wit did store</l>
            <l>That who brought any in, went out with more:</l>
            <l>But this new way of wit does so surprise,</l>
            <l>Men lose their wits in wond'ring where it lyes.</l>
            <l>If it be true, that Monstrous births presage</l>
            <l>The following mischiefs that afflicts the Age,</l>
            <l>And sad disasters to the State proclaim;</l>
            <l>Plays, without head or tail, may do the same.</l>
            <l>Wherefore, for ours, and for the Kingdoms peace,</l>
            <l>May this prodigious way of writing cease.</l>
            <l>Let's have, at least, once in our lives, a time</l>
            <l>When we may hear some Reason, not all Rhyme:</l>
            <l>We have these ten years felt its Influence;</l>
