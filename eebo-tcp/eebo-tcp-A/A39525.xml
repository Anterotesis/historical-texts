            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>COnsidering the Testimonies and Sufferings of several Christians and conscientious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons formerly, against all Swearing; and now observing of late, that not only the Lawfulness of Oaths themselves has been disputed and pleaded for, as by the Athenians and others, but also the Definition and Nature of an Oath; and what an Oath is and what not, have been started and took notice of more than formerly; and also consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on one side, of the abounding of Swearing and detestable Oaths, among many in this Nation, enough to draw down Judgments and divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon it, as have been lately, for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in other places beyond the Seas; and also, on the other side, observing the Moderation of many, and that in Authority too, in Condescention to a People that have formerly suffered, because they durst not Swear at all. I could not be easy in my mind, until I had Written and Publish'd this to the World, hoping it may be of some use and service to most, if not all Men. As first to the common and prophane Swearers, that now so much abound upon the Earth, by shewing such the great
<pb facs="tcp:31735:4"/>
danger they hazard thereby to their Souls (besides the Judgments in general they may draw down upon themselves and others in the Land) And, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to such as are in Authority, by proposing and demonstrating to them, by evident Reasons and eminent Authorities, the danger of imposing Oaths, or any higher Asseverations or Expressions (instead thereof) than plain and simple Speech; which I desire all moderate Magistrates, that love and truly affect <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> (for whom I have great Respect and Affection) seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider of. And, Thirdly, to those that conscientiously scruple any Oath, by shewing such the danger of venturing to use, instead of an Oath, any higher form or manner of Speech, than Christ hath prescribed and allowed them, lest they be drawn into an Oath unawares. So wishing and desiring the good of every one, and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Swearers may leave off Swearing, and the legal or more solemn Swearers be satisfied with Evangelical Truth speaking, and those that are come to such Truth speaking, may never look back from the simplicity of that Testimony: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Friend to all, especially the moderate, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and ingenuous, of what Profession or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion soever they may be.</p>

            <head>The Position.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>No Man ought to Swear (under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-dispensation) any kind of Oath, in any Case; neither by reason of any Command from a lawful Magistrate; nor upon any other occasion or respect whatsoever; for these following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. BECAUSE Christ Jesus, whom all Men ought to obey, and fear to break his Commands, hath commanded, <hi>Not to Swear at all,</hi> Mat. 5. 34. and instead thereof, in Verse 37. commands, <hi>That our Speech be Yea, yea; and Nay, nay;</hi> and saith, <hi>That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is more than these, cometh of evil.</hi> Now any Oath is more than these; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31735:5"/>
being also forbad before, it must be of evil.</p>
            <p>II. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 16. in Case of Trespass, where Evidences of Witnesses is required, Christ's Command is, <hi>That in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished:</hi> And not by the Oath of two or three Witnesses; nor yet in the Mouth of two or three Swearers.</p>
            <p>III. In <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. The Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Above all things not to Swear, neither by Heaven, nor by Earth, nor by any other Oath;</hi> but instead thereof bids, <hi>That our yea, be yea, and our nay, nay; lest ye fall into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> Here the Apostle <hi>James</hi> is also very express to the purpose, agreeing with Christ's Command before in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. Therefore he that Swears any Oath, does quite contrary to the Apostle's express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and must hazard Condemnation.</p>
            <p>IV. A true Christian's Oath is needless; because such an one dare no more tell a Lie, than he dare to Forswear himself (if he should Swear:) And an evil Man's or false Christian's Oath, is worthy of no more Credit than a Lier; because he that dares to break his Word or be a false Witness, in a solemn affirming or denying of any thing, has no fear of God nor awe upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; and therefore, what should make
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31735:5"/>
such an one fear or scruple to break his Oath, if he Swears? Therefore, now, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is the use of Oaths or Swearing, among those that profess Christianity?</p>
            <div type="objections">
               <head>OBJECTIONS.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection</hi> 1. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. and in 10. 20. <hi>God commanded to Swear by his Name;</hi> therefore Christ did not forbid such Oaths as was by the Name of God; for the Father and the Son are one, and Immutable (or unchangeable) in their Nature and Will; and therefore how could the Son forbid that which the Father had commanded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> That Command of God was to them that were under the Law, to prevent them from swearing by Idols; and not to such that are under the Gospel, to whom Christ spoke: And therefore this proves no contrariety between the Father and the Son, any more than the Sons taking away the first Things, that were commanded by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, that he might establish the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which he himself commanded under the Gospel, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. See also in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12, 18. and 8. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. In <hi>Isaiah</hi> 19. 18. In a Prophecy relating to Gospel times, as seems manifest from Verse 20. it is said, <hi>That five Cities</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:31735:6"/>
                  <hi>in the Land of Egypt shall speak the Language of Canaan, and Swear by the Lord of Hosts;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how can Swearing, by the Lord of Hosts, be forbidden by Christ in Gospel times?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If Swearing by the Lord of Hosts be here prophesied of to be in Gospel times, then by the same Reason from Verse 21. to do Sacrifice and Oblation, must be also in Gospel times, as is there said the Egyptians shall do; and if so, how is the old Testament, wherein were the Sacrifices and Oblations, abrogated and disannulled when the new Testament came? As in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. In <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 23. The Lord speaking concerning such times, as wherein all the ends of the Earth shall be saved (which surely must be in Gospel times) said, <hi>That every Knee shall bow to me, and every Tongue shall Swear:</hi> Therefore some Swearing must be lawful in Gospel times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11. who, without doubt, knew how to interpret this Prophecy, yet he would not express it in such Terms as might contradict Christ's general Prohibition to Swear in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. therefore he words it thus, <hi>Every Knee shall bow to me, and every Tongue shall confess to God:</hi> Here the Apostle hath changed the word Swear, that was figuratively spoken in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31735:6"/>
the time of the Law, into Confess, in which it was to be fulfilled in the time of the Gospel. Therefore now it may be evident from hence, that no Sentence or Prophecy spoken by the Prophets, tho' expressed in <hi>Mosaical</hi> Terms, or in such Terms as were under the Law, ought to be expounded in any wise, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict any of Christ's general Commands or Prohibitions; but on the contrary, they must be expressed in Gospel Terms, that agree therewith; as is manifest by the Apostle's Example aforesaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. In <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 16. In a Prophecy relating to such times wherein new Heavens and a new Earth shall be created (which must be in the last times) it is said, <hi>He that Sweareth in the Earth, shall Swear by the true God:</hi> Therefore it is lawful in the last times, which are under the Gospel, to Swear by the true God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If according to the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Example, before noted in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11. we change the word [Swear] by the true God, into [Confess] unto the true God, we may interpret it right, and in Gospel terms, and then we shall not make the Prophet seem to contradict Christ, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. who is Lord of all the Prophets, Apostles and Angels, <hi>And whom we are especially to hear and obey in all things,</hi> Act. 3. 22. <hi>And also to</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:31735:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>confess him,</hi> Phil. 2. 10. And therefore if there should seem at any time a disagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sayings of Christ and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or the Apostles either, Christ's Sayings ought not be strained to comply with theirs (who were his Servants) but on the contrary, their Sayings must yield and comply to his, who is their Lord, and whom we ought especially to hear and obey in all things, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. In <hi>Jerem.</hi> 12. 16, 17. it is said, concerning the Gentiles, <hi>That if they will learn the ways of my People, to Swear by my Name (the Lord liveth, as they taught my People to Swear by Baal) then shall they be built in the midst of my People; But if they will not obey, then will I utterly pluck up and destroy that Nation, saith the Lord.</hi> Now here is a Promise of Acceptance to those that will learn to Swear by God's Name, and a Threatning of utter Destruction to such as will not; therefore, now, how dare any refuse to Swear by the Name of God, upon a solemn and a lawful Account?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This was spoken under the Law, wherein Swearing was; and though it was spoken to the Gentiles, yet it was to such Gentiles as taught <hi>Israel</hi> to Swear by <hi>Baal;</hi> and which must be in <hi>Baal</hi>'s time, that was long before the Gospel times:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31735:7"/>
Therefore what is this to Christians under the Gospel? But if it could be proved that this Prophecy did relate to the Gentiles under the Gospel, then, according to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word Swear under the Gospel dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, it must be expounded, that they must learn the ways of his People to Confess to his Name, and that he liveth; which is the duty of all Christians to do, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10. and 14. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 6. If Christ's Prohibition to Swear be so general, that no Oath is lawful to Swear, in any Case, under the Gospel; why did the Apostle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. say, <hi>For Men verily Swear by the greater, and an Oath for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is to them an end of all Strife?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

Under the Law, God allowed an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, which then could not come from evil, because God never allowed any thing that came from evil; but after Christ had forbidden this, with other things that were allowed under the Law, and commanded the contrary instead thereof, the breaking of his Command cometh of evil, and from the Devil that tempts Men thereunto.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That Angel had a peculiar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission that extended through the Law and the Prophets, wherein Swearing was, and

spoke as God's Representative or Ambassador (which would be a presumption for Men to imitate;) for as God aforetime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his Promise unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his whole Seed, by an Oath, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. so again by his Angel in <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 6, 7. he seems in like manner (as by an Oath) to confirm the same Promise, that it should then quickly be fulfilled, <hi>viz.</hi> that Time should be no longer; but that the Mystery of God should be finished, as he had declared to his Servants the Prophets; therefore that was no Example for us to follow. However, if any shall still think this Answer not sufficient or full enough to the Matter, let it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considered, That we read no where that Christ forbad Angels to Swear; but he plainly commanded Men not to Swear at all: So the evil lies in breaking Christ's Command, and in Men that so do, to whom his Command extended.</p>

Moreover Christ forbad Swearing by God the Creator, when he forbad Swearing by Heaven, Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because he gives that for the Reason why we should not Swear by these Creatures, (<hi>viz.</hi>) because Heaven is the Throne of God, and the Earth is his Footstool; and none can Swear by the Throne of God, but he must Swear by his Creator that sits thereon; as is manifest in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 22.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31735:10"/>
Matter may be decided by two Witnesses, at least, according to Christ's Precept afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, to wit, by him that makes the Oath, and by God, whom he calls to Witness with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In such a Case if a Man doth Swear, and call God to Witness with him unto the Matter, yet this will not make it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided according to Christ's Precept; for Christ saith, Take with thee one or two more; that in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses, every word may be established. Now the one or two more, besides himself, must be humane Persons, and not Gods; except the Party can call two Gods to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with him, which is absurd to suppose; and also, in such a Case, where there is two or three Witnesses, it may be decided by Christ's Rule, without their Oaths: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ's Rule, to have two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, extends only to such Cases as is possible to have so many Witnesses, and lays no necessity upon Swearing to the deciding thereof, according to, or by, his Precept. And, moreover, if one Swearing, calls God to witness with him; how is the Matter in Controversy decided, by the Mouth of two Witnesses, according to Christ's Precept, when only by the Mouth of one Man, every word is spoken, to testify the truth in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31735:10"/>
question? For if God should testify or reveal the truth of such a Matter in question im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by his own Mouth, there would be no need of any Man's Testimony to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his Evidence; because no Man can add any thing to Gods immediate Revelation or Testimony, which is perfect of its self.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ forbidding us to lay up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for our selves on Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> extends only to such laying up earthly Treasure as to set our Hearts on it; for our Hearts ought only to be with our heavenly Treasure, as is manifest from Verse 20, 21. Therefore, if any one can lay up things on Earth, where his Heart is not with them, Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand extends not to him, because such things are not properly his Treasure; for the word Treasure most properly signifies, that which is most precious in his esteem. Likewise, Christ forbidding us to take thought (or care) for our Lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for the Morrow, is not to be anxious or too much careful, or distracted or over-troubled in ones mind about them (which is also a setting our Hearts upon them) for so the words in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, properly signify; and therefore these Prohibitions are not so general, as that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. concerning Swearing, which is also as full against all Oaths whatsoever, both in the Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin as in the English: However if it should be granted (for Argument sake) that those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions aforesaid, are as general in all Cases
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31735:11"/>
as that of Swearing; yet this will not prove that of Swearing any whit the less general, nor that any Person ought to commit Sin, in breaking a Command of Christ's in any one thing, because they may do so in some other things; but rather such ought to repent and leave off those things wherein they do, or have broke his Commands (if it plainly so appears) and be more careful afterwards of keeping all his Commands. But if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially and ingenuously considered, there is but little sign that those Persons are very careful of laying up for themselves Treasures on Earth, or taking thought for their Lives, or for the Morrow, who hazard the losing of all their earthly Things and Enjoyments, and their Lives and Liberty too, because they dare not do that, which they believe, will be a breaking of Christ's Command, as aforesaid.</p>

If all Oaths are forbidden by Christ in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. how could the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (who without question) understood the extent of Christ's words, and would not do any thing contrary thereunto, so often call God to witness to the Truth of what he said (which is a formal Oath) as <hi>God is my Witness,</hi> Rom. 1. 9? <hi>I call God for a Record upon my Soul,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 23. <hi>Before God, I lie not,</hi> Gal. 1. 20. <hi>God is my Record,</hi> Phil. 1. 8.

                  <hi>Ye are Witnesses, and God also,</hi> 1 Thes. 2. 10. <hi>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not; my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence also bearing me Witness in the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 9. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If simply the saying God, or any thing else, is my Witness; or only the meer calling God, or any Creature for a Witness or Record, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on any Account, be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Oath, then <hi>Paul</hi> Swore by the Men he wrote to, in 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 10. as well as by God, when he said, Ye are Witnesses; and God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. And by the same Reason he Swore by his Conscience in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1. when he said, My Conscience also bearing me Witness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And also by the like Reason, <hi>Moses</hi> Swore by Heaven and Earth, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 41. 26. when he said to the People, I call Heaven and Earth to Witness against you this day: All which would render <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> too, to Swear by the Creatures; which those that plead against the universality of Christ's Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion themselves, confess, were always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and a breach of Christ's Command in the Gospel, and also of God's Command under the Law; when he permitted Men to Swear only by his Name, according to their own Explication and Interpretation of them.</p>
               <p>So if such Expressions could be proved Oaths, it is manifest that we ought not to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31735:12"/>
imitate them for the Reasons aforesaid; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are such Examples of the Prophets and Apostles sufficient or enough then, to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to us now the Command of Christ, for the abolishing all Swearing, no more than <hi>Paul</hi>'s then shaving his Head at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had a Vow, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 18. or his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying himself in the Temple, and offering with the four Jews that had a Vow, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 26. or his circumcising of <hi>Timothy</hi> because of the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 3. can warrant us to the Observation of those legal Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies now; nor indeed ought we to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Prophets or Apostles in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing, without having any Warrant or Precept to us for the same, especially when it seems against any general and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Command in Scripture, and most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it seems directly against any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Command or Prohibition of Christ, who is Lord of all the Prophets, Apostles and Angels, and whom we are especially to hear and obey in all things, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 32. for though they were exemplary for us to imitate and follow, vet it must be in such things that we are sure they were followers of Christ, and that are alike binding to all Christians, according to the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s own Exhortation, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. and not otherwise, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:31735:13"/>But however, to find a better Exposition of the Expressions, supposed to be Oaths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, than to make the Apostle and Prophets transgressours, as aforesaid, let it be seriously observed what the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Nature and Substance of an Oath is, which I here propose to all Men, as well to the Ingenious and Learned, as to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, to consider of, with my Reasons hereafter following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Oath, or the Substance of an Oath, is a Religious Tye, or a Sacred Bond, when it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a Temporal or Earthly Thing: As the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching or invoking of God, or any thing reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced and esteemed for a Deity, or the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or naming any superiour thing as a Surety, that most properly belongs to God, which is not in any Man's power to dispose of, and thereby bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul as a Pawn or Pledge for a Security to an Inferior, for confirming the truth of any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Temporal Matter in question is a Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is also confirmed by the Original, or Etymology of the Word <hi>Juro,</hi> to Swear, from the best Authorities, <hi>viz. Juro ex Jure vel quasi Jovem Oro, aut testem invoco—Quod jurare proprie sit ita sancte promittere ac si jus esset.—Seu juris servandi causa reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giose assevero.</hi> By which it seems, that Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31735:13"/>
being first among the Heathens, was an invoking or using the Name of their God (or that which they reverenced as a Deity) for a Bond-tye or Security of their Affirmations and Promises, whereby they bound their Soul to their Idol as a Pledge, for the truth and certainty thereof; so likewise when the <hi>Israelites</hi> were permitted to Swear by the true God, only for a time, to draw them off from their Idols; they, by the same reason, bound their Souls to him as a Pledge for a Security (which was better than to be bound to an Idol). And also by the Latin definition of the word <hi>Juramentum; viz. Juramentum est aliquod mente Juratur.</hi> An Oath is a bond or security of something understood in the Mind, binding the Soul and implying a Curse, in case of not then speaking the truth, though not perhaps so plainly expressed in Words at length, as it is but in few Oaths.</p>
               <p>And this seems further manifest, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34, 35, 36. where Christ gives some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they should not Swear by Heaven, Earth, nor <hi>Jerusalem, viz.</hi> because one was God's Throne, and the other his Footstool, and the last his City; and none could Swear by any of these Creatures, that most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged to God, but he must Swear by the Creator, as is plain from <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 22.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31735:14"/>
He that Swears by Heaven Swears by the Throne of God, and by him that sits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So here is a Swearing by God implied, and consequently a binding the Soul, when only Heaven and a Creature is used or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to Swear by; the like Reason is, when one Swears by his Head, because our Head and Body too are none of our own, but the Lords, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 8. and so properly belong to God. And, therefore, this is plain to all Men, That none ought, in any Case, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign that for a Surety, Pawn or Pledge (tho' but an Earthly one, and much more a greater and higher) which is anothers and none of their own; nor that any one can lawfully give any thing which is not in his power to dispose of.</p>
               <p>And so now seeing the nature of an Oath is such a binding of the Soul, for a Pawn or Pledge in temporal Affairs; was there not great reason why Christ discontinued the use of them, among Christians, by his Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34? For let it be considered, whether it would not be an unreasonable thing for any one to pawn his Soul for, or upon, any temporal matter, where there is no visible or intelligible proportion between the value of the Pawn or Pledge, and of the thing it was pawned for? And also, would it not be a dangerous thing to run such a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31735:14"/>
great hazard, in case of any mistake, as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Sense and Understanding is subject to, (tho' not designedly) as is frequently seen among those that Swear in Courts and before Magistrates, notwithstanding the Bond of their Oaths? And, also, might not this be one Reason too, why the Apostle <hi>James</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Brethren, That, above all things, they should not Swear, seeing it is one of the most dangerous of all things, for any one so slightly to put his Soul into such a hazard, (like laying ones Soul for a Wager) by his own consent and agreement? And would not all esteem it a very unreasonable thing of any Man that should require a thousand Pounds for a Pledge or Pawn, for any thing but of the value of a Shilling? And yet this would be far short of the Proportion of the value of a Soul, to any earthly temporal Matter. And doth it not also shew, that such as will give such an extraordinary Pledge for a small and trivial matter (in comparison of the Pledge) when duly considered, esteem but lightly of their Souls, or of what they Pawn; as <hi>Esau</hi> did, when he sold his Birth-right for a Mess of Pottage?</p>
               <p>And to prove that a Surety, Pawn or Pledge of the Soul, or of eternal and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, only makes or is properly called an Oath, when it is applied to, or offered, or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31735:15"/>
given for temporal and earthly Matters: Observe, That an Oath, according to the Apostle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. is such a Bond as is made by a greater; which, consequently may not be so when made by a lesser. Therefore, the same kind of Speech or Expressions, that are an Oath, being made b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a greater, may not so be when made by a lesser; as by these following Instances.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>The calling God to Witness,</hi> to bind any Affirmation, Promise or Denial, especially when relating to temporal and lesser Matters, most understanding Men, and especially the Learned, in most Ages, accounted it an Oath; but the calling a Man to Witness to any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Fact, or to any Affirmation, Promise or Denial; who counts it a Swearing? Or that one Swear by the Man so called?</p>
               <p>Secondly, To say, <hi>So do God to me, and more also</hi> if I do not such a thing, is an Oath, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 35. But to say to a Man, So do thou to me and more also, if I do not such a thing, who will account it an Oath by the Man?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To say, <hi>Our Life for yours</hi> I will do such a thing, is an Oath, <hi>Josh</hi> 2. 14, 17, 20. But for one to say, My Horse for thine I will do such a thing; who will say that such an one Swears by his Horse? Except any will say, That every one that lays a Wager al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Swears by the Wager that he lays.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:31735:15"/>Hence may be seen that a temporal Surety and Security is only proper for temporal Matters, and such a Bond or Security is not accounted an Oath; but whatsoever is higher, as things of a divine and eternal Nature, are too high and great to be offered for a Surety and Security for temporal and earthly Things; and therefore such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bond or Security for such an improper use is accounted, and properly called an Oath.</p>
               <p>Therefore, according to the definition and nature of an Oath, before mentioned, <hi>The invoking or calling God for a Witness, and many other high Expressions of the Apostle's, that he used only in treating of divine Matters; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the appealing (after any manner) to God as Judge, or any ways using his sacred Name, or mentioning any thing whereby it may be imployed, as by Heaven, Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being only designed for a further strengthning and confirming the Truth of any Speech, Affirmation, Promise or Denial, when relating only to humane, worldly and inferiour Matters, may be granted to be an Oath;</hi> but otherwise not so, when used only upon a divine and religious Account. For the same Words and Expressions, either such as are found in the Scriptures, or others that are commonly used in some Cases, which are good and lawful in themselves, when rightly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31735:16"/>
used, may be an Oath or no Oath, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their application, design and intent in using them; as will further appear by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, Reasons and Demonstrations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>1. If one should say in Prayer, So help me God, that I may walk in thy ways; here the words [So help me God] who will say are an Oath? But when these words [So help me God] are used to bind or confirm any Speech, or the truth thereof, in humane and temporal Affairs, they make up the common National Oath, for Jury-men, Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Likewise if one should say (religiously speaking) <hi>By Christs Blood</hi> the Saints are justified, or <hi>By Christs Life</hi> they are saved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9, 10. Who will say, That there is the least Sign of any thing of the nature of an Oath in these Affirmations, or in them words soused? But if any one should use these words [<hi>By Christs Blood</hi>] or [<hi>By Christs Life</hi>] in Affirmation or Denying, or in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising any thing relating to humane, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or temporal Matters; it would amount to an Oath of an high degree, or of the worst sort, that would be very irksome and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome for all sober and religious Persons to hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:31735:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. Also, if one should say simply, in a religious and serious manner, upon some good occasion, <hi>By God I am still alive</hi> and enjoy my health (meaning his Power, Favour or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) who will account this an Oath? But if a Drunkard or common Swearer should use these very words in his usual manner of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when only to confirm the truth of his Speech; or in his accustomed manner of Swearing, and express all the same Sentence too; would not all that should hear him, grant that he Swore by his Maker, that he was still alive and enjoyed his health?</p>
               <p>4. To say or religiously to affirm, <hi>As the Lord liveth</hi> he will preserve those that fear his Name, and continually trust in him from the snares of the evil one; who will account it an Oath? But for one to say, affirm or promise, any thing relating to humane and temporal Matters, in this manner; As the Lord liveth such a thing is, or shall be done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is called an Oath; as is manifest in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 6, 20. 3. and 28. 10. and also in <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 16.</p>
               <p>5. To assert or promise any thing, by the words [<hi>God is my Witness or Record</hi>] when it relates only to humane and temporal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to satisfie such incredulity or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust, that will be content with no less secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than by the Name of God, may be an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31735:17"/>
Oath, because his Name is here mentiond and used as a Bond or Surety for an earthly and inferior Matter; but for one sensibly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crely to say, God is my Witness or Record that I have lived in his fear; who can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it an Oath?</p>
               <p>6. Though the Apostle <hi>Paul, Called God for a Record upon his Soul,</hi> to confirm his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of sparing the Brethren, being in some divine and religious respect, as seems manifest in the next Chapter, and therefore might not then be an Oath in the Apostle: Yet what good Christians, in imitation of these words, durst promise or say in any thing relating to common and humane Affairs, I call God for a Record upon my Soul, that I will do, or I will not perform, such a thing; would not this be as great an Oath, as if he had instead thereof used the words [As the Lord liveth] or the words [So help me God?]</p>
               <p>7. Likewise, though the Apostle's saying, Now the things which I write unto you, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, before God, I lie not,</hi> might not be an Oath in the Apostle, because he treated and wrote of religious and divine Things, in which respect Gods Name, and the appealing to him too, may be lawfully used by sincere Christians, in many Cases: As for Instance, one may truly say, I speak or do a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31735:17"/>
or in the presence of God, if he be then livingly sensible thereof to assist him in the performing it; yet if another should speak the same words, that was not livingly sensible of his presence at that time, he would Speak (if not Swear) falsly, as well as he that said, The Lord liveth (when he was not sensible thereof) Swore falsly; though the Lord liveth, is as true in it self, as that nothing can be spoken or done but it must be so before God, as that it cannot be hid from his Presence. And, further, for one to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise or say, Before God, I will pay thee that Mony; or, Before God, I will not stay here; who will not account either of these Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to be an Oath?</p>
               <p>And, moreover, it may be observed, that being the Apostle used the word [behold] before the words [before God] and which, in the Greek, is without any Point or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma after the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for behold, and hath also the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifying because, or that, which is omitted in the English, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This Expression may be translated or understood in a moderater sense than it is commonly taken in the English; as, Behold, before God, that I do not lie or speak false; as much as to say, I do not speak false in these things I write unto you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am now sensibly before, or in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31735:18"/>
Presence of God, and therefore I cannot mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake (or be disappointed in the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may also signifie) at such a time. And let it be further considered, that to use the words [before God] to promise any humane, terrene or earthly Matter by, cannot be lawful or safe, in any sense however; for in the first place, altho' a Christian may sometimes say, or hath truly used them words in the Present and Preter Tense; yet who can appoint a time in the future, when he will approach to, or be sensibly before God, to perform any humane Matter in his presence? And if in saying, Before God I will perform such a Matter, could be only understood in such a common sense, as that all things are and must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before him, because nothing can be hid from his presence, it would be superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and using his Name in vain; because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done, but it must be before him; as well the breaking of the Promise, as the performing it: Or if such a Sense be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (the possibility of which is not easily to be conceived) whereby God is appealed to, or invoked to take notice thereof, as a Judge, and so consequently as a just Revenger, in case of non-performance of the Matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, which is of the nature of an Oath; to what purpose would it be for any one to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31735:18"/>
use or require such words for a strengthning or confirming the said Promise? So by this Reason also it would be an using or taking God's Name in vain.</p>
               <p>8. And also, though the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. after having just before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his godly Sorrow and Exercise for the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> &amp;c. said, I could wish my self Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed from Christ for my Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet what good Christian durst imitate or use these words of the Apostle, in such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sense as he used them, as to wish himself Accursed from Christ to confirm the truth of any Affirmation or Promise, and most especially when relating to humane and temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? And if any one should promise or say, I wish my self Accursed from Christ, if I speak false, or if I do not perform such a thing; what sort of Oaths would any sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian count worser than such an Expression, though the Party should excuse himself, by improperly pleading the Apostle's Example for it, as before-mentioned?</p>
               <p>So it is plain, from what hath been before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, That we are not to imitate the Apostles in any such extraordinary Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor yet in every particular and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing they might say or do, except upon such like occasion, and that we had the same Authority or Permission, or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31735:19"/>
or Precept therefore; for we are only to imitate and be Followers of them, and all Christians one of another, in all such general Duties, as is plain we are all alike command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our, and their Lord and Master, and not otherwise: For because one Christian has a Gift and Command to Preach, it doth not therefore follow, that all other Christians must imitate him and be Preachers too; nor because another may have a Gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, it will not follow, that all the rest must be Propheciers too, by only imitating him.</p>
               <p>But to come closer to the Matter still, if possible, and to answer the most critical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as may or can be: If any would yet imitate any of the said Apostles Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, in their Epistles, and use Gods sacred Name for a Witness to, or a Confirmation of any thing; surely they ought to do it in the like Cases and Sense, and by the same Spirit and Authority, as the Apostles did, and wrote their Epistles in; or else it cannot have the same approbation and acceptance (seeing Gods Name may be used amiss and in vain) but the contrary.</p>
               <p>As for Example, Would it not be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, for any Man, to Call or Summons an earthly King for a Witness or as a Surety, to any of the Man's own particular and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31735:19"/>
Causes? Yet if the same King should commissionate or require any of his Subjects, to call him for a Witness or to be a Security for a thing, wherein the King's Cause is chiefly concerned; it would be then no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in a Subject so to do.</p>
               <p>And, furthermore, seeing, according to several express Scriptures, that none can Worship (or Adore or Reverence, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Greek) God aright without his Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23, 24. Nor can any ask or pray, as they ought, except in Christ's Name or by the Spirits help, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26, 27. No, nor yet so much as to truly say, that Jesus is the Lord (though nothing is more true in it self) without the Holy Ghost (or Spirit) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. How can any, considering these things (that profess either the Scriptures or the Spirit, to be their Guide or Rule) invoke God for a Witness, or any other purpose, or any ways to imploy and use his Sacred Name for a Security in earthly Matters, if it was not a proper Oath (which is more than barely to ask a Petition in Prayer) in their own time? Or at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings of others, without they certainly know that they have his Commission or the Assistance of his Spirit at the time, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it rightly, and with such due reverence as they ought? For if none can approach
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31735:20"/>
Gods presence to worship him, or so much as to ask a Petition in Prayer, with a fit or due Adoration or Reverence, without Christ's Name or Authority, or the Spirit's assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; much more can any invoke God into their presence for a Witness or Surety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a sufficient Adoration or Reverence, without his Commission or the Assistance of his Spirit; for who are so bold, as perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily to approach the presence of, or speak to an earthly Prince, without his permission first obtained, or some one to introduce him, or to mediate for him? Much more, how dare any to invoke God into their presence, upon any account, when they please, and at any time appointed by Man, without first having obtained a divine Permission, or being required thereto by his Spirit?</p>
               <p>Therefore, from hence it is evidently plain and clear, That we ought to have a care of using any other form or higher manner of Expressions for asserting the truth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising any thing in all Cases, especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to temporal Matters, but what may plainly agree with Christ's Precept or form of Speech, which he prescribed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to use instead of an Oath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 37. <hi>viz.</hi> That our Word or Speech be Yea, yea; and Nay, nay (as is according to the Greek) which seems to be only a doubling of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31735:20"/>
such words that we commonly use for affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or denying of a thing, as Christ himself often did, when he said, Verily, verily, lest we should run into an Oath unawares, or so far as to use or take God's Name in vain (that is not to be used customarily or formally) or at least into any thing which Christ count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was more or higher than Yea, yea; and Nay, nay; and said, cometh of evil: Not but that I believe we may use other Words or Expressions for Yea, yea; and Nay, nay; that are equivalent thereunto, as truly or verily, or such like, for Yea and Amen are the same, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. but not such as are higher; for Christ's saying, Whatsoever are more (or more full according to the Greek) than these, cometh of evil, seems plainly to intimate that there may be other Expressions higher than these, though not in the Superlative Degree, that are dangerous to use (if they can be lesser than an Oath) or else why did Christ, here only, forbid what is in the Comparative Degree to Yea, yea; and Nay, nay; after he had forbidden what was in the Superlative Degree before in Verse 34. when he forbad all Oaths?</p>

            <head>Here follow a few Lines, by way of Postscript, from one that took a short view of this Treatise; which I thought meet also to Insert.</head>
            <p>I Have taken a short view of this Manuscript, with the Authorities therein quoted, and it seems to me highly to favour the Doctrin of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called QUAKERS, who have been, and are, exposed to great Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, for their refusing to Swear in any Case; however, let none, therefore, slight the Authorities, Arguments and Reasons therein urged, but rather, by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31735:28"/>
express Scripture, without undue Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences and corrupt Meanings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; for how mean soever the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments are that God makes use of, they are not to be slighted; for the Ass was made to rebuke, with Man's Voice, the Prophets madness, and then saw more than he did, and all his Blows could not get him forward; and the Reason you know was, he saw the Angel of the Lord with a drawn Sword in his Hand. And, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the Sufferings that the QUAKERS have been, and are exposed to, and the Laws that on this foot have been made against them; yet who can get them any further than a bare affirming or denying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Christ's Precept and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles? And although they use the Name of God, and those very words in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious way, which makes up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and formal Oaths, yet are very cautious of making use of that sacred Name in their worldly or temporal Affairs; and urging, that none can
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31735:29"/>
call Jesus Lord, but by the Holy Ghost And I have heard they have been very sollicitous to the Government, to have their solemn Words taken instead o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> very reasonable to be granted them on those Terms: Although I have heard the Government are for obliging them to some Form of Speech in their solemn Affirmations, wherein the Name of God is made use of, as these or the like words, <hi>viz.</hi> [before] [in the presence] of God, which the tendency of this Treatise seems not to allow in any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Affair, without a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and likewise to exclude that, because it so strictly contends for the literal Sense of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. That its not reasonable to conclude, that God will give a Command to any, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his own Son's positive Precept. Upon the whole, I must confess, The plain and simple way of affirming or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31735:29"/>
denying hath a tendency to advance the Repute of the Christian Religion; and this Cautiousness of making use of the reverent Name of God in temporal Affairs, if duly observed, would be a good step to put a stop to the breach of that Command, which forbids taking his Name in vain; though that may be done, and is too much in Matters relating to spiritual Things, as well as temporal; and if once People were come to God's Spirit, and its Leadings in all things, as their Phrases are, they would not take his Name in vain, in any wise.</p>
            <p>And for those that look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves concerned to stand firm in this Testimony, and most clear and strict to the literal Sense thereof, it's certain that not to make use of Phrases or Words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [before, or in the sight, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God] or to name God at all, is most likely to keep clear from that which is more than Yea, yea; and Nay, nay; and cometh of evil; for if once it be allowed, that the Name of God may be made use of in affirming or denying,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31735:30"/>
or binding the truth of our Words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any temporal Matters; how shall we able to distinguish what is more than Yea, yea; and Nay, nay; that cometh of evil, and what is not? For if I say in Evidence, in relation to such an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair [before God, or so help me God, in the Sight or Presence of God] this is true or false; what do I less than Swear, and imply, by such a Speech, God should judge, condemn or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish me, if what I affirm be not true? And wherefore do I use it, but to beget a greater Credit to what I say, by making use of his Name that is greater than my self? Which, as the Apostle said, is the manner of those that Swear, to Swear by the greater, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
