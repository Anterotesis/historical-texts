            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with us now but our miſ-fortunes; living meerly out of the ſtock, out of the intereſt and principall of their former gotten moneyes, which daily is exhauſted by the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of themſelves and families.</p>
            <p>For our ſelves, ſuch as were ſharers, are ſo impoveriſhed, that were it not for ſome ſlender helps afforded us in this time of calamitie, by our former providence, we might be enforced to act our Tragedies: our Hired-men are diſperſt, ſome turned Souldiers and Trumpetters, others deſtin'd to meaner courſes, or depending upon us, whom in courteſie wee cannot ſee want, for old acquaintance ſakes. Their friends, young Gentlemen, that uſed to feaſt and frolick with them at Tavernes, having either quitted the kin in theſe times of diſtraction, or their money having quitted them, they are aſhamed to look upon their old expenſive friends. Nay, their verie Miſtreſſes, thoſe Buxſome and Bountifull Laſſes, that uſually were enamoured on the perſons of the younger ſort of Actors, for the good cloaths they wore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtage, beleeving them really to be the perſons they did only repreſent, and quite out of ſorts themſelves, and ſo diſabled for ſupplying their poore friends neceſſities. Our Fooles, who had wont to allure and excite laughter with their very countenances, at their firſt appearance on the ſtage (hard ſhifts are better than none) are enforced, ſome of them at leaſt to maintaine themſelves, by vertue of their bables. Our boyes, ere wee ſhall have libertie to act againe, will be growne out of uſe like crackt organ-pipes, and have faces as old as our flags.</p>
            <p>Nay, our very Doore-keepers, men and women, moſt grievouſly complaine, that by this ceſſation they are robbed of the priviledge of ſtealing from us with licence: they cannot now, as in King <hi>Agamemnons</hi> dayes, ſeeme to ſcratch their heads where they itch not, and drop ſhillings and half Crowne-pieces in at their collars. Our Muſike that was held ſo delectable and precious, that they ſcorned to come to a Taverne under twentie ſhillings ſalary for two houres, now

The Tobacco-men, that uſed to walk up and downe, ſelling for a penny pipe, that which was not worth twelve-pence an horſe-load; Being now bound under Tapſters in Inns and Tippling houſes. Nay ſuch a terrible diſtreſſe and diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath befallen us, and all thoſe that had dependance on the ſtage, that it hath quite unmade our hopes of future recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For ſome of our ableſt ordinarie Poets, in ſtead of their annuall ſtipends and beneficiall ſecond-dayes, being for meere neceſſitie compelled to get a living by writing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible penny-pamphlets in which they have not ſo much as poetical licence to uſe any attribute of their profeſſion; but that of <hi>Quid libet audendi?</hi> and faining miraculous ſtories, and relations of unheard of battles. Nay, it is to be feared, that ſhortly ſome of them; (if they have not been enforced to do it already) will be encited to enter themſelves into <hi>Martin Parkers</hi> ſocietie, and write ballads. And what a ſhame this is, great <hi>Phoebus,</hi> and you ſacred Siſters; for your owne Prieſts thus to be degarded of their ancient dignities. Be your ſelves righteous Judges, when thoſe who formerly have ſung with ſuch elegance the acts of Kings and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, charming like <hi>Orphens</hi> the dull and brutiſh multitude, ſcarce a degree above ſtones and forreſts into admiration, though not into underſtanding with their divine raptures, ſhall be by that tyrant Neceſſitie reduced to ſuch abject exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents; wandring like grand children of old <hi>Erra Paters,</hi> thoſe learned Almanack-makers, without any <hi>Maecenas</hi> to cheriſh their loftie conceptions, proſtituted by the miſ-fortune of our ſilence, to inexplicable miſeries, having no heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalian Sack to actuate and informe their ſpirits almoſt

confounded with ſtupiditie and coldneſſe, by their frequent drinking (and glad too they gan get it) of fulſome Ale, and hereticall Beere, as their uſuall beverage.</p>
            <p>To conclude, this our humble complaint great <hi>Phoebus,</hi> and you nine ſacred Siſters, the Patroneſſes of Wit, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tectreſſes of us poore diſrepected Comedians, if for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, by your powerfull interceſſions we may be re-inveſted in our former Houſes, and ſetled in our former Calling, we ſhall for the future promiſe, never to admit into our ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny-roomes thoſe unwholeſome inticing Harlots, that ſit there nieerely to be taken up by Prentizes or Lawyers Clerks; nor any female of what degree ſoever, except they come lawfully with their husbands, or neere allies: the abuſes in Tobacco ſhall be reformed, none vended, not ſo much as in three-penny galleries, unleſſe of the pure <hi>Spaniſh</hi> leafe.
