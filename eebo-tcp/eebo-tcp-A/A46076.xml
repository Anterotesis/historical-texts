            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THOUGH I be none of the moſt Curious to pry into Foreign Matters, yet the various Reports we have had of the Proceedings of, and Conteſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſome of the Members of the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament, prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted me to deſire the Favour of you (as a Perſon I believe not much concerned in Factions or Parties) to let me know ſomething of the Matters of Fact were in agitation there: As alſo who theſe Perſons are, and their Actions have been, occaſioned ſuch great Heats concerning them, at ſuch a Juncture, when all good men ought to be cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the good of the Publick, and ought to ſtand by one another, as one man, to oppoſe the Evil Deſigns of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy. For my part, I find in ordinary Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that both good and bad People ſpeak generally of theſe matters, as they affect ſuch Men and Parties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I will avouch that my ſteadfaſtneſs to the preſent Government is known by good men to be ſuch, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Juſtice be termed diſaffected; and my Intereſt is ſo little with particular Parties, that I dare tell ſo much of the truth to the Government's Friends, and my own alſo, as is convenient: Will therefore ſtrain my Inclinations to give you a ſuccinct Account of ſome Matters of Fact; as alſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56237:3"/>
what I could learn concerning theſe men you writ of, which can give no Offence: And though my Obligations to Great Men (ſince the late Happy Revolution) be little, yet will do them all the Juſtice imaginable. But before I come to anſwer your Expectation in Particulars, will take the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (by way of a Ruſtical Preamble) to Paraphraſe a little upon ſome Wiſe Men's Sentences. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, That the moſt Univerſal Vice in the World was Ingratitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Puniſhable by no Statute Law, but by Publick Hatred and the Diſcourſe of the Schools, which is ſaid to be the greateſt Puniſhment; yea, Ingratitude ſways the Scepter in moſt places, as well in private as in publick men. Some men were ungrateful to their Countries, (of whom we could name ſeveral) and ſome Countries were ungrateful to their own Worthy, Loving, and Affectionate Children: Pride, Contempt, Avarice, and Envy, are ſaid to be the chief Reaſons, and ſeldom all theſe concur without Malice and height of Rigour: But I ſuppoſe that that part of a Nation is either the Indocile, Ignorant, or Vicious. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſuffered for doing good to his Country, even whilſt he was doing good to his Country-men in Priſon; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and put him to Death. Some will Object, That there is ſome ſecret Crime brings on a Puniſhment, and ſuffers for Crimes they may not be guilty of; and ſo it's their Judgment. But be it ſo or not, that's neither Argument nor Excuſe for the Inſtrument's being Cruel or Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to Puniſh by gueſs, without a fair Tryal, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Jury, in Eſtate, Fame, or Body; for he who makes no ſcruple to take away a man's Good Name, will make no ſteps to take his Life alſo if he can.</p>
            <p>Philoſophers as well as Hiſtorians declare, That the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi> denyed a Providence, but that the <hi>Stoicks</hi> aſſerted it; whatever might be in that Conteſt amongſt the Ancient Heathens and Modern pretended Atheiſts, yet we, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the name of Chriſtians, muſt not only own a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56237:3"/>
that it over-rules all Actions, Motions, and Events, exalteth one, and pulleth down another; but alſo createth Friends and Enemies, and that a Society of good as well as of bad Men may differ in Opinion, which oftentimes occaſions not only Jealouſies, Emulations, and Debates, but alſo Strifes, Contentions, Threats, Perſecutions, War, and the Death of many well and evil deſigning Men. <hi>Cato</hi> ſtruggled long before the People of <hi>Rome</hi> could underſtand his Counſels to be for their Good and Safety; he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted and contemned by them, nor did they ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his worth till they loſt him. <hi>Scipio</hi> was diſmiſt, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> exiled, and <hi>Seneca</hi> deſtroyed, he by a Tyrannical Prince only for his goodneſs. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered as an evil doer; yea, our Saviour himſelf was contemned, ſet at nought, and condemned to the ſhameful Croſs by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, out of Pride and Ignorance, for his kindneſs and goodneſs to them. So it's no new thing for good and bad Men to be miſtaken, and others to be miſtaken of them. It is an Ancient ſaying, That Loyalty often ſuffers the Puniſhment due to Rebels, and Treaſon receives the Reward of Fidelity. There may be two principal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for this; Ignorance, and Depravity of mens Natures. Ignorants not being Judges of Men fit for Government, nor the Governour's Actions, or Secrets of State, which is generally the failure or miſtakes of the Populace. Here you will always find <hi>Improbarum Duces,</hi> who influences the blind Populace <hi>vela dare ſuae fortunae,</hi> to accompliſh their Deſigns, though it were upon the Ruins of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. And under the Second may be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the Vices of the Mind, which would be too long to be named here; only this one obſerved by the wiſe, That we have the Wickedneſs of other men always in our Eyes, but caſt our own over our ſhoulders <note n="*" place="margin">Lintae foris talpae domi.</note>. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms all the Proofs of the former Reaſons of Ingratitude. Whence it comes to paſs, that a Peaſant would be a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56237:4"/>
a Tribune a Praetor, a Praetor a Conſul (as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaid) never minding what he had been in a little time before, but looking ſtill forwards to what he would be <note n="*" place="margin">Fortuna non mutat genus.</note>. I know not but <hi>Brutus</hi> thought (that when he had deſtroyed <hi>Caeſar</hi>) to have been <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf; but he had only in place thereof, Remorſe left with him, (with, <hi>Et tu mi fili Brute</hi>) for his great Expectations. Both good and great Men we ſee are ſubject to Envy; for ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never think themſelves happy, till ſuch and ſuch Men be out of their way, as in the caſe of <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai;</hi> but neither they, nor the Common-wealth can well know the want of ſuch Men till they be gone, when there is no retrieving: For in what ſad condition had <hi>Eſther</hi> and the poor Jews been, if <hi>Haman</hi> had conquered <hi>Mordecai?</hi> And it had been better for <hi>Haman</hi> he had let <hi>Mordecai</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Upon which Conſiderations, it were very adviſable for Societies, if they be any ways ſplit in Parties, to take the Wiſe Man's Advice, before they Accuſe or Proſecute, and to conſider three things: Firſt, their Strength whom they Accuſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, the Enterprize and Merit of the Cauſe. And Thirdly, the Perſon or Perſons they have to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and that in reſpect of their Superiours, Equals, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as no good Muſick, ſo no good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Society without Concord, which cannot well be without bearing of Injuries. And <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſaid, That Wiſe Men will bear with all Injuries, <hi>Ardua res haec est,</hi> where the Publick is concerned. I will therefore conclude this Point with a Sentence of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s, when in an Epiſtle to his Friend he was condemning Anger and Choler, he adds a <hi>But.</hi> But (ſays he) in caſe of exemplary and proſtitute diſſolution of Manners, when <hi>Clodius</hi> ſhall be preferred, and <hi>Cicero</hi> rejected; when Loyalty ſhall be broken upon the Wheel, and Treaſon ſhall ſit Triumphant upon the Bench. Is not this a Subject to move the Choler of any Vertuous Man? Now, leſt I ſhould weary you too much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56237:4"/>
with a ſimple Diſcourſe (yet knows it is to my Friend only) I come to ſatisfie ſo much your Curioſity as is in my Power, without Reflection or Byaſs: <hi>Nam pacis mihi cura temendae.</hi>

He being a Pious, Hoſpital, and Generous Man, left his Lady (being upwards of Eighty Years old) but poor: His Eldeſt Daughter was married to one Mr. <hi>Patrick Smith,</hi> Advocate, many Years before his Deceaſe.

            <p>For the Preſident had drawn up a Teſt for preſervation of Religion, Liberty and Property, (too long to be inſerted here) made a Speech in Parliament to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and, though ſeconded by very many, was thrown out, but ſome of the then Court-Party drew up another Teſt to their purpoſe, which was carried the very next Morning into the <note n="g" place="margin">The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles was a Committee of Parliament then in uſe, made up of the 8 States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, 8 Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſo many Biſhops, and 8 Burgers, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner and Stateſmen ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all there.</note> Articles, and paſt current there.</p>

The inſerting of which Confeſſion of Faith (the Intriguing Party then not underſtanding the thing, being fond to paſs their own Teſt with any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity without Examination) was the very thing made ſome of the Biſhops, Nobility, and Gentry ſtand firm againſt taking away the Penal Laws in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 1686.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56237:7"/>
Adjourning of the Parliament that Evening) had met together, and conſidered what they had done, in Voting the ſaid Whiggiſh Confeſſion of Faith (as they called it then) and procured the Royal Aſſent thereto, went in a Body to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and exclaimed againſt the Lord <hi>Stair,</hi> Preſident, as the only Man who had wheedled them in the matter, by ſurprize; but were told, the thing could not be helped then, being it was paſt the Royal Aſſent, but that the Contrivers ſhould be Animadverted upon; and in ſome few days that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being adjourned, and the Preſident in diſgrace, he retired to the Country, ſent his Son, Sir <hi>John Dalrym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> now Maſter of <hi>Stair,</hi> to the Duke, to ſignifie, that ſeeing his Father was not pleaſing to his Royal Highneſs, he intended to go to Court, and give up his Commiſſion to the King his Maſter, who gave it to him.

fly to <hi>Holland</hi> alſo. His Houſes made a Receptacle of Souldiers, His Heritable Office taken from him, and his Tenants ſpoiled.</p>
            <p>The then Government raiſed Proceſs of Treaſon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times againſt him, But they could not reach his Eſtate, by all the ſtretches of Law were made.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1687.

            <p>In <hi>November</hi> 1688. He, the ſaid Preſident, came over with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (now our Gracious King) His Majeſty being pleaſed to communicate his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, as a Man fit to give, and keep Counſel.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Lockhart</hi> being Preſident of the Seſſion when the King came over (but being unfortunately mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in <hi>March</hi> 1689. by a baſe Ruffian, for pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an Unjuſt Sentence againſt him (as he alledged) though no ſuch thing) my Lord <hi>Stair</hi> was re-eſtabliſhed in the Preſident's Chair again.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1690. he is created Viſcount of <hi>Stair,</hi> Lord <hi>Dalrymple</hi> and <hi>Glenluce.</hi> And though this hath been an Age, where meaner Men were aſhamed to ſerve God in their Families, I will add this one good Quality more to him, that he (beſides his Private Devotion) was never a day in the worſt of Times but he read the Scripture, and prayed himſelf twice in his Family, were there never ſo great or many ſtrangers preſent, which might be a Reflection in theſe days, but I hope not now, and to tell the truth, I dare give no worſe Character of him. As for his Behaviour in Matters of State, theſe are Matters I do not meddle with, let him put his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour in Publick who will venture to do it, if they can, but I judge it will puzzle any to do it; and Rational
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56237:8"/>
Men will Judge, that he who Rules his Family beſt at home, is the fitteſt to Rule in Publick, and I pray God long may ſuch Men Rule amongſt us. I will not ſay, but the Lord Viſcount <hi>Stair</hi> is envied by ſome People for his Parts and growing Greatneſs, but that ſhould be no Argument with Rational good Men, being that mens Vertues ought not to be accounted their Crimes. And I believe he may ſay in his Old Age, <hi>Whoſe Ox, or whoſe Aſſe have I taken</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Hic murus aheneus eſto, nil conſcire ſibi nulla paleſcere culpa.</note>?</p>
            <p>The Maſter of <hi>Stair</hi> is the foreſaid Viſcount's Eldeſt Son, liberally Educated and bred to the Law, being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Travels in the time of the <hi>Dutch</hi> War, he and one <hi>Ramſay,</hi> Son of Sir <hi>Andrew Ramſay,</hi> of <hi>Abbots-Hall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intimate Companions, happened to be at <hi>Chatham,</hi> and, as I am informed, preſerved one of the King's Men of War from being blown up by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> with the hazard of their own Lives; for which brave Action (when they were but very young) King <hi>Charles</hi> Knighted them, before he knew who they were, thus I heard it.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1672. Sir <hi>John</hi> was admitted, after his Tryals, to be an Advocate, which Employ he followed for ſeveral Years, being of the firſt Rank.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1683. when the ſaid Viſcount (his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) was forc'd to abſcond in <hi>Holland,</hi> as is ſaid before, the Laird of <hi>Claverhouſe</hi> (afterwards Viſcount <hi>Dundee</hi>) having the Command of the Army, which was ſent to the Weſt Country to Spoil and Dragoon the Diſſenting Party (not without our <hi>Scots</hi> Biſhops conſent) did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to poſſeſs himſelf of the Office of the Baily of Regality of the Lordſhip of <hi>Glenluce</hi> (which did Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably belong to the ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> and the Viſcount of <hi>Stair</hi> his Father) Sir <hi>John,</hi> now Maſter of <hi>Stair</hi> (by Creation of his Father Lord, Baron, and Peer of the Realm) did oppoſe the Lord <hi>Dundee,</hi> and beat him off,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56237:8"/>
for which he was convened before the Council, and fined in <hi>500l.</hi> which he paid.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1684. The ſaid Maſter was ſeized at his own houſe, when his Lady was juſt to lye in, and made Priſoner, being ſuſpected, it ſeems, by the then Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have Correſpondence from <hi>Holland,</hi> and to have carried on intrigues againſt the Government; and being brought to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> was carried from the Palace of <hi>Holyrood-houſe</hi> (where he was examined by the Miniſters of State) as a Trophe (it ſeems to diſgrace him) between the common Soldiers, along the publick Streets, to the common Priſon) more than half a Miles diſtance; was kept cloſe Priſoner there for ſeveral Months, not knowing for what Crime, (but as himſelf then ſaid) for the Original ſin of the Father. At laſt, after many Petitions, he had the favour granted him by the Council, to be enlarged to the Caſtle Priſon, where he lay a long time, till the Government was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med they could not fix a Crime upon him, ſet him at Liberty.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1687. there being none of the Advocates (but theſe who were advanced to be Lords of the Seſſion, for their then Zeal and Loyalty to the Cauſe in hand) (fit to be the King's Advocate <note n="i" place="margin">Attorney General.</note> the Court (hoping to gain him to their Party, and to wheedle his Father over from <hi>Holland</hi>) made the Maſter King's Advocate, (that being the time of the Toleration) and during a whole year he continued King's Advocate, there was none Proſecuted to death, but one Man, upon the ſcore of Nonconformity. The Court perceiving the Maſter's behaviour in that Poſt that year, and intending to take another courſe, by the Diſpenſing Power; and finding him not to be a fit tool for their purpoſe, brought in Sir <hi>George Mckhenzie</hi> again, to be King's Advocate, and they degraded the Maſter to be Juſtice Clerk; then they

            </p>
            <p>The foreſaid Convention being turned into a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (The Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> made Lord High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner) ſome People (who pretended great matters for Religion, Liberty and Property, being diſpleaſed, it ſeems, that they were not advanced inſtantly to ſome places of high dignity and truſt in the Government, recoiled: And then it was that we unhappily turned into Parties, which put the Subjects in a ferment, made our Proceedings uneaſie ever ſince at home, and makes the King's Affairs ſometimes to be retarded both here

            <p>In the Winter, 1690.

            <p>In the year 1692.

            </p>
            <p>In the year 1677. by order of Council he ſent a double Regiment of his Tenants and Vaſſals, in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Marquis of <hi>Athol,</hi> Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> and ſeveral other Noblemen and Gentlemen to the Weſt Country (which was then called the <hi>Highland Hoſt</hi>) there was a Commiſſion of the Council ſent along with them to try the Diſſenters; this created the Earl of <hi>Broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalban</hi> Enemies alſo. Upon the Revolution he ſtood out, but being convinced of his errour as to the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56237:10"/>
from that of Arbitrary and diſpotick power, to that of a mild, merciful and peaceable Government, tracing the true Conſtitution and fundamental Laws of the Nation; he joined forces, and offered his Service to the Government, by bringing in of the Highland Clans and Rebels by fair means, or neceſſary ſtratagems to make the effects anſwer the end.</p>
            <p>As for the Glenco-men, the truth is, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus eſt,</hi> to deſcribe them without reflection upon my Country-men, which I would willingly avoid; but the real truth is, they were a branch of the <hi>Mc.

I do remember when I firſt heard then of the matter; I ſaid to ſome great Perſons, that the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod would be to make theſe Men Priſoners, and ſend them abroad to be Soldiers, or to the Plantations, and wiſhes it had been ſo.</p>

            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Galloway</hi> died, as was mentioned: The three Daughters and their Husbands did contend about proving the Will of the Deceaſed, the Biſhop's Widow being poor, and detained from what effects the Biſhop left, by the contention and tedious unnatural Law De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of her Children: Mr. <hi>Hugh Dalrymple</hi> (the Lord <hi>Stair</hi>'s Son) being Factor for upliſting of his Father's Rents, the time of his Father's Exile, as aboveſaid, and the Viſcount himſelf likewiſe after his return home, did ſupport her with Money, that ſhe might not ſtarve, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Law debates; for which they took ſecurity, both from her ſelf and Mr. <hi>Patrick Smyth</hi> her Eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Husband to repay them.</p>
            <p>After long and litigious Debates, the Lords of the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion pronounced a <note n="i" place="margin">a Decree.</note> Decreet in favour of Mr. <hi>Patrick Smyth,</hi> being found to have the beſt right, and who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the Mother by his Credit.</p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>Duncan Robertſon,</hi> encouraged <note n="*" place="margin">ſic ſtetit ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia.</note> by ſome Perſons (not well inclined to the Lord <hi>Stair,</hi> to be ſure) preſented a Petition to the Parliament upon the 3d day of <hi>June</hi> laſt, complaining, that the ſaid Viſcount had pronounced an unjuſt Sentence againſt him. It would be needleſs, and not to your purpoſe, to repeat all the ſaid Complaint, and the great and long Debates followed thereupon; ſo I only give you the ſubſtance, and the moſt material points in the Complaint; (<hi>viz</hi>) That the Preſident in the Debate betwixt the ſaid <hi>Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56237:11"/>
and Mr. <hi>Patrick Smith,</hi> ſhould have done Injuſtice by making up himſelf (or by his Influence) a Debate, or Minutes and <hi>Interloquitor</hi> ſubjoyned thereto upon the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1692. and ſigned the ſame privately in the Vacation.</p>
            <p>2. That after there was a Decree pronounced in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Robertſon</hi> (againſt which Decree Mr. <hi>Robertſon</hi> gave in a Bill of Suſpenſion) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Bill the Clerk of the Bills refuſed to write a <note n="k" place="margin">A <hi>Siſt</hi> is a ſtop of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of a Decree by a Judge for a certain limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time.</note> 
               <hi>Siſt,</hi> by the Preſident's Order, thereby ſtopping the ordinary courſe of the Law.</p>
            <p>3. That the Preſident Tranſacted during the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Plea with Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> as Executor to the Biſhop, for a Debt due by the Preſident to the late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <note n="l" place="margin">Lord <hi>Stair</hi> pay Tithes to the Biſhop.</note> and had an <note n="m" place="margin">An Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Eaſe from Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> of the Debt, and took Allowance of <hi>20l. Sterling</hi> of Baily Fee, which the Biſhop would never have paid.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer made to the firſt was, That if Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertſon,</hi> or any other could prove againſt the Preſident, that he did ſign any <hi>Interloquitor</hi> or Debates privately, but what was the meaning of the reſt of the Lords <note n="p" place="margin">In Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of, and by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of all the Lords.</note> 
               <hi>in praeſentia,</hi> as well as his own Opinion, he were moſt unjuſtifiable; but nothing at all thereof was proved: On the contrary, one <hi>Smyth,</hi> a Witneſs <note n="q" place="margin">Produced.</note> adduced by <hi>Robertſon</hi> himſelf, Depoſed, that the King's Advocate did Dictate them, who is a Man of great Honour and Integrity, and owned the ſame. The Clerk alſo depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame, and Mr. <hi>John Frank, Robertſon</hi>'s own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, Depoſed, that the Point mentioned in theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, was ſtated by the Preſident, which ſhould have been debated, Mr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s Advocates declined to Debate, and Mr. <hi>Patrick Smith</hi> craving a Decreet, and that the ſame was pronounced in Mr. <hi>Frank</hi>'s own hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and others, ſo not done privately. Two of the Lords of Seſſion, <hi>Halcraig</hi> and <hi>Croſrig,</hi> depoſed to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56237:11"/>
ſame purpoſe, and one of theſe Lords doth exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that before the Cauſe was called, the Lords Reſolved, that the Parties ſhould Debate the very Points mentioned in the minutes, which was ſtated truly by the Preſident, as all the Lords reſolved. And it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleared (the aforeſaid <hi>Interloquitor</hi> being <hi>res geſta,</hi> known to, and authorized by all the Lords) by a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Decreet of Suſpenſion which followed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the firſt of <hi>February,</hi> 1693.</p>
            <p>It was anſwered to the Second, That the Clerk of the Bills, <hi>James Nicolſon,</hi> did refuſe to receive or write upon the Bill of Suſpenſion, becauſe Mr. <hi>Robertſon</hi> was litigious, and after two Decreets <hi>in foro,</hi> he offered a third Bill, and Mr. <hi>Patrick Smith</hi> having found Caution or Surety to Relieve Mr. <hi>Duncan Robertſon</hi> and his Wife of any Proceſs might be intended againſt them, as Executors to the Biſhop, (which was the Pretence or Reaſons of his laſt Bill of Suſpenſion) and all the Lords rejected the Bill, and diſcharged the Clerk of the Bills to receive any other Bill of Suſpenſion from Mr. <hi>Robertſon,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon Obedience, he having refuſed to Debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which Deliverance was ſhewn and duly intimated to the Clerk of the Bills, which is his Warrant: And that the Preſident never ſpoke directly nor indirectly to him about the ſame. The Lord <hi>Aberuchill</hi> alſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary depoſed, that the Clerk did refuſe to write a <hi>Siſt</hi> by reaſon of the ſaid Deliverance of the Lords <hi>in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was anſwered to the Third, That, as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Mr. Hugh Dalrymple,</hi> by his Father's Orders, (when in Exile) and the Preſident himſelf when he came home, advanced money to the Biſhop's poor Widow, to ſave her from ſtarving, during the dependency of the Plea, for which they took Bond, to be repaid as aforeſaid, which was a Security to them <hi>in omnem eventum,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56237:12"/>
any dependence upon the Event of that Plea of Law: For though <hi>Mr. Robertſon</hi>'s Title had been juſt, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the Lords, the Preſident's Security was good beyond exception.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the Widow was provided to a conſiderable <note n="r" place="margin">Or Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</note> Life-Rent by her Husband, which was a Debt unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably preferrable to the Intereſt of either Party, <hi>Smith</hi> or <hi>Robertſon;</hi> and the Advancement to her being leſs than her Proviſion, the Preſident could have no byaſs that way; beſides that <hi>Mr. Patrick Smith</hi> alſo had an unqueſtionable Intereſt in the Dead's part, and the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittim,</hi> and had acquired the Intereſt of a third Siſter, as <hi>Mr. Robertſon</hi>'s own Bill to the Parliament doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. So there was no Hazard to, or Injuſtice in the Preſident, though he had advanced more to <hi>Mr. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> or the Widow, which he never did, and made no other Tranſaction, but as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And as to the other member of that Allegation, That the Preſident got an Eaſe from <hi>Mr. Patrick Smith</hi> of the Debt due by him to the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>It was Anſwered, That it was a very falſe Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For by the Diſcharge granted to the Preſident, it will appear, that the ſeveral and particular Sums paid, are Inſtructed either paid by the Preſident himſelf, or <hi>Mr. Hugh Dalrymple</hi> in his abſence; that the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had no Advantage by it, nor was the Preſident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned what <hi>Mr. Duncan</hi>'s Claim was againſt the Biſhop, or his Executors, ſeeing the Preſident was not obliged to pay any more to the Biſhop, or any claiming Right to his Eſtate, but what was truly due, and to them who had the beſt Right.</p>
            <p>As to that, That the Preſident ſhould have taken an Allowance of <hi>20l. Sterling</hi> to himſelf Yearly of Baily Fee. The Preſident owns he did take the ſame, and Inſtructs his Right by an Original Charter <hi>Anno</hi> 1560.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56237:12"/>
And by another Charter under the Great Seal, <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. both Charters bearing an Heritable Office of Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary, and a Fee of Three Chalders of Meal out of the firſt and readieſt of the Fruits and Emoluments of the Lordſhip of <hi>Glenluce,</hi> which three Chalders of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Wigton</hi> (which is the Meaſure of that Country) will be four Chalders and a half of <hi>Linlithgow</hi> Meaſure, and which would be worth more than <hi>30l. Sterling</hi> Yearly; yet the Preſident being only in uſe to receive an Allowance of <hi>20l. Sterling,</hi> he exacted no more. And as the ſaid Preſident's Right was Inſtructed by his Charters, ſo the uſe of Payment appeared by two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Agreements, one with Biſhop <hi>Hamiltoun, Anno</hi> 1666. who preceded Biſhop <hi>Aitkin,</hi> and another, <hi>Anno</hi> 1688. with Biſhop <hi>Gordon,</hi> who ſucceeded him, both ſtating the Baily Fee at <hi>20l. Sterling</hi> Yearly. After debating of theſe Points before the Parliament, it was moved, that the Affair ſhould be committed to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee choſen for that particular Caſe, but it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Plurality of Voices, that it ſhould be committed to the Committee of Safety, who were appointed to give their Report thereof in open Parliament upon the Tenth day of the ſaid Month of <hi>June.</hi> And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee having accordingly examined many Witneſſes upon the moſt material Articles of the Complaint, <hi>viz.</hi> The alledged Injuſtice of the Sentence, nothing was proved as I can ſee againſt the Viſcount of <hi>Stair</hi> by <hi>Robertſon;</hi> on the contrary, it was proved by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Lords of Seſſion, Mr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s own Advocate, and ſeveral other Evidences, as aboveſaid, that the Preſident's Tranſactions were fair, and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence juſt; ſo that Mr. <hi>Robertſon</hi> did not think it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to inſiſt upon the other Articles of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. Upon the Tenth of <hi>June</hi> it was moved, I hear, in behalf of the Lord Preſident, that the Parliament
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56237:13"/>
would call for the Report of the Committee, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare the Preſident Guilty, or if nothing of the Complaint ſhould be proved againſt him, that they would Acquit the Lord Preſident, and appoint a ſuitable Puniſhment upon the Libeller for ſo impudent a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny; but the Motion was not favoured, there being matters of greater Importance in hand. However the Preſident's Friends ſay, they are glad (that even now in his Lordſhip's abſence) there are no greater matters of Complaint or Accuſation found againſt him through the whole courſe of his Life, being ſufficiently vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of this Accuſation by theſe and other grounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, judging there is enough known (and will be juſtified by all good unbyaſſed men) of his long Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Publick, Integrity of Life, firmneſs of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, his and his Families Sufferings in dubious and dangerous Times, and Dutiful Adherence to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Intereſt, before and ſince the late Happy Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luton: And that they do confidently hope that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's High Commiſſioner, and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament will ſometime or other find the Juſtice of the Nation intereſted to ſee the Laws and Acts of Parliament for Securing, Maintaining, and Defending the Honour and Reputation of Judges (who do Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent His Majeſty's Perſon and his Authority) fully and effectually executed by the Exemplary Puniſhment of the malicious Libeller, ſo as Judges in all time coming may be fenced and ſecured from ſuch bold and inſolent Attempts. And upon the whole matter, the Preſident's Friends ſay further, that he loſt <hi>100l. Sterling</hi> by theſe Tranſactions concerning the Biſhop's Affair, which he never expects again; ſo that according to the Wiſe Man's ſaying, As it is a hard matter to be both Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Juſt, ſo to ſtrike, and not wound, is Anger loſt, for he is invulnerable, and not hurt, who is ſtruck.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56237:13"/>As for the matter of the Indictment againſt the Earl of <hi>Broadalban,</hi> in ſo far as I can learn, the matter is thus: That the Earl, <hi>Anno</hi> 1691. promiſed to the King to reclaim the High-land Rebels, which way he did it, is in Publick now; but <hi>Mac Donnel</hi> of <hi>Glengary</hi> (who is the moſt ſenſible, and of greateſt Probity amongſt them) came in, and depoſed before the Parliament, That the Earl did, by Articles agreed upon betwixt him and them, engage, that if King <hi>William</hi> could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to ſuch and ſuch Articles, he, the ſaid Earl, ſhould with all his Friends and Followers, joyn the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Army. The ſaid Depoſition being read, it was moved that the King's Advocate ſhould be ordered to Commence a Proceſs of High Treaſon againſt his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that he in the mean time ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> And 'twas pleaded for the Earl, that he might have time to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his Anſwer before Impeachment, this being a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to him, and doubted not but he would make it appear to the Parliament there was no ground for the Impeachment.</p>
            <p>It was further pleaded for the Earl, That <hi>Glengary,</hi> not being ſummoned by a Judge to come in as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt him, and eſpecially conſidered that he was a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, had been in Rebellion againſt the King, and never knew he had ſubmitted to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs done privately at this time, and carrying an inveterate Enmity to the Earl's Family, he hoped the Parliament would not found a Proceſs of High Treaſon againſt him upon his Depoſition. Theſe Arguments did not prevail.</p>
            <p>It was further pleaded by the Earl, That he had an Ample Commiſſion from the King to do in that Affair all that he ſhould think fit for effectuating his Deſign: That as well His Majeſty as all the World knew that in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56237:14"/>
ſuch Negotiations there muſt be Allowances for men Commiſſioned to go, or at leaſt pretend to go great lengths, and to yield to ſuch Condeſcendencies as they find moſt taking for accompliſhing the Deſign. That the Effect and Conſequence had juſtified the Methods he had taken. That not only they there ſitting, and their Conſtituents at home, who ſuffered moſt in that unnatural and cruel War, but alſo the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (who for its own Safety was obliged to maintain ſome Regiments here in <hi>Scotland</hi>) yea, and all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy had reaped Advantage by his Conduct in that Treaty, many Troops and much Money being now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt the Common Enemy abroad, which that troubleſome War had exhauſted for ſeveral Years here at home. That ſeeing the thing it ſelf was good and advantagious for the Nation, he wondered Perſons ſhould take Exception againſt the particular Methods which in Prudence he was obliged to take in carrying it on; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that he had made it known to Their Majeſties, whatever he had ſaid or done in that Affair, and had their Approbation ſince.</p>
            <p>It was alledged, that things now Libelled, were not then known. It was anſwered, that upon a Complaint given againſt the Earl for theſe very things he is now accuſed of, His Majeſty recommended to the Privy-Council here to make Enquiry into the matter, which was done accordingly, and tranſmitted to the King; that the minutes of Council would clearly ſhew the ſame, and deſired that the minutes might be called for, but the Parliament did not think fit to call for them. The Earl of <hi>Melvil,</hi> then Secretary of State, and now Lord Privy-Seal, 'tis ſaid, roſe up, and avouched the truth of what had been ſaid, and aſſerted, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition taken bo the Council, was upon a Complaint (if not in the ſame words, yet at at leaſt to ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56237:14"/>
with what was contained in <hi>Glengary</hi>'s Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was ſent by the Council to him, as Secretary of State then; That he ſhewed it to the Queen (the King being then in <hi>Flanders</hi>) who kept it a whole Night by her, that the next day he tranſmitted it to the King, who (he knew by the Returns he got from <hi>Flanders</hi>) received and peruſed it. The Duke of <hi>Queensbury</hi> did declare likewiſe, that it conſiſted with his knowledge, that His Majeſty received the ſame, he being then in <hi>Flanders</hi> with the King, and heard his Majeſty Diſcourſe of the matter very often.</p>
            <p>Upon this ſome Perſon moved, That ſeeing His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had taken the Earl's Behaviour to his own Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and had been informed of all the Methods of his Proceedings in the matter, and had ſhewn a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Earl's Conduct, by preferring him at that time to ſeveral Places of Honour and Truſt, The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would pleaſe not to proceed in an Affair of ſuch Importance againſt one of His Majeſty's Miniſters of State, until he was firſt acquainted with it. But this being refuſed, it was deſired in behalf of the Earl, they would delay their Proceedings at leaſt until the next Meeting; but it was voted and carried, that the King's Advocate proceeded immediately againſt him; and an Order of Parliament was ſigned for Committing him to the Caſtle, where his Lordſhip was carried immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the riſing of the Parliament. The Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate ſent him a Copy of his Indictment, and he was ordered to give in his Anſwer thereto by the Firſt of <hi>July</hi> inſtant. Upon the Firſt inſtant the Earl deſired an Exculpation, which was granted to him. Upon Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing of the Parliament to the Seventh of <hi>November</hi> next, the Proſecution of the Earl is delayed till that time.</p>
            <p>As for the matter of the <hi>Glenco-men,</hi> made ſo much ado, we are ſomething in the dark as yet, nor will I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56237:15"/>
meddle to ſpeak, much leſs to write of any Point the Parliament have Voted, only the Hiſtorical part of that matter is this.</p>
            <p>That when the Earl of <hi>Broadalban</hi> did undertake to cauſe the Highlanders to lay down their Arms, give over Hoſtility, and to give Paſſive Obedience to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, by taking of the Oaths (which was very well done, whoever did it) before they laid down their Arms, there were two or three Indemnities iſſued forth by His Majeſty, encouraging them to come in; and they did come all in by the prefixed <note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>Diet</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the day appointed in the Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come in by.</note> Diet in the laſt Indemnity, except the <hi>Glenco-men,</hi> who it ſeems finding themſelves without Help or Support by the other Chieftains and Clans coming in, Old <hi>Mac Kean</hi> of <hi>Glenco</hi> himſelf only (as I am informed, as <hi>ad aram ultimam</hi>) went to, and prevailed with <hi>Campbel</hi> of <hi>Ardkinglaſs,</hi> Sheriff-Deputy of <hi>Argile-ſhire</hi> (a very worthy honeſt Gentlemen, and formerly a great Sufferer) ſix days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Diet was elapſed, who received him, and <hi>Mac Kean</hi> took the Oaths; though at the ſame time it was, and is ſtill the Opinion of many good men, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in theſe men, or to bring them to Conformity to the Government, were <hi>Penelope's telam texere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did the taking of the Oaths after the Diet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt was elapſed, ſave or protect them or him from the laſh of the Law (not having come in, in the terms of the Law) the mercy tendered in the Indemnity being Conditional, in caſe they came in, and ſubmitted before, or upon ſuch a day; but was a ground for mercy and mollification of the rigour of the Law, ſuppoſing him or them to have taken the Oaths <hi>bono animo,</hi> and upon true Repentance. I do not hear the reſt of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers came in, and took the Oaths, judging, it's like, he and they were ſafe by his only taking of the Oaths, though <hi>poſt meridiem diei.</hi> The Court (it ſeems) not knowing of theſe Tranſactions at a great diſtance of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56237:15"/>
Four or Five Hundred Miles (and being informed by all hands that they were Neſts of Thieves and Robbers) His Majeſty, after refuſal of many offered mercies, ſent to treat them as Enemies and Rebels: Yet at the ſame time His Majeſty, by his Inſtructions, as I am Informed, left room for Mercy to them, according to Diſcretion, and Circumſtances of Time and Affairs, which is all could be expected in Reaſon from His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The Maſter of <hi>Stair,</hi> Secretary of State, writ Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it ſeems, likewiſe at the ſame time to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Officers of the Army there, much to the ſame purpoſe, but (it's ſaid) in ſeverer terms, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding His Majeſty's Inſtructions, to treat them like the men they were repreſented. What may be in this, we know not, not having ſeen the Maſter's Letters; but many wiſh that they, and all the Inſtructions relating to that matter of the <hi>Glenco-men,</hi> had been Printed, to undeceive the generality of good men, who ſpeak as they affect, but could make no true Judgment of the matter as it then ſtood, only this, That the Parliament has been very Zealous to diſcover at whoſe Door the fault (in killing the <hi>Glenco men</hi>) lies. That they were killed in cold Blood, and under Truſt <note n="*" place="margin">Faber est quiſque fortunae ſuae.</note>, judging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecure and ſafe (with their Thirteen days Gueſts or Lodgers) is undeniable. But in fine, The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as you have it in Publick, finds that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Orders and Inſtructions had Mercy <hi>in graemio,</hi> ſo that it cannot lodge there, and God forbid it ſhould. They have likewiſe voted Sir <hi>Thomas Livingstoun,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of His Majeſty's Forces in <hi>Scotland</hi> (who ſent the Orders to Col. <hi>Hill,</hi> Governour of Fort <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> his Lieutenant-Colonel) clear of it, as alſo Col. <hi>Hill,</hi> have ſummoned Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Hamilton</hi> to appear before them, to Anſwer concerning the ſaid matter; and upon further Scrutiny where the ſaid Murder will fix, I know not (<hi>Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56237:16"/>
certant, &amp; adhuc ſub judice, lis eſt</hi>) for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers will readily ſay, that they obeyed but their Superiour Officer's Command; and the Maſter of <hi>Stair</hi>'s Friends here ſay, that they deſire the Maſter's Letters to be Printed, that the World may judge of them; and if he be judged to have exceeded Bounds, or His Majeſty's Inſtructions, it was his Zeal for the Government, but never intended at the ſame time that theſe men ſhould be killed in cold Blood; and that he did not at all know that any of the <hi>Glenco-men</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Oaths, (either before or after the Diet) when he writ theſe Letters, being at Court Four or Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles diſtant, as ſaid is; ſo it's wiſh'd the men, who had the Truſt of the Execution of the matter upon the ſpot, had acquainted the Court or our Government of theſe unhappy mens then Circumſtances, before they went ſo far on, in which caſe I doubt whether any of them had been killed or murdered, and conſequently no Reflection had been upon any part of the Goverment, or any ever mentioned in the Affair. It's an old ſaying, That the Counſels of Wiſe Men are certain, but Events uncertain.</p>
            <p>As for my own part, I know nothing of it, but God in Heaven, and the Maſter of <hi>Stair</hi> himſelf knoweth beſt if he be guilty of a deſigned murder of theſe men, or any others: Nor will I Argue about any Point ſuch a Wiſe, Loyal Parliament have voted or found. But this I may ſay, That I do not underſtand where the Maſter of <hi>Stair</hi>'s Intereſt lay to deſtroy the <hi>Glenco men,</hi> for if he be any ways ſuſpected to be a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> it was not his Intereſt upon that ſcore to deſtroy them by any means in <hi>Scotland,</hi> their Religion and blind Zeal bending them then altogether that way, whatever new Light theſe who are living of them have found of late, and if he be thought to be a Church of <hi>England</hi> man (though that be againſt our preſent Conſtitution, yet no man in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56237:16"/>
his right Wits will call it a Crime.) Theſe men were not Presbyterians, to be deſtroyed upon that ſcore; nor do I think any man would be ſo mad as to bribe him to kill them by Authority, without the Hand of Juſtice going along with it. Some good-natured People may ſay, out of good will to the Maſter, that they were Idle men, Robbers, Thieves, &amp; <hi>Telluris inutile pondus,</hi> Granting all that yet a Stateſman's Intereſt was, to make their Young men Souldiers, or to ſend them to the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which had been to good purpoſe. But a man of his Truſt, Capacity, and Reaſon, to be Acceſſory to their Deſtruction in cold Blood, is unaccountable. And being the Honourable Parliament has found that Slaughter a Murder (as no doubt it was) in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it was done, and that the Maſter exceeded His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Inſtructions, it were a very pertinent Queſtion to ask, What under God's Heavens, was the Maſter's Byaſs in the matter? I can imagine none. There was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation Printed and diſperſed (as you heard formerly) by Commiſſary <hi>Dalrymple</hi> (hearing that his Brother, the Maſter of <hi>Stair,</hi> and his Letters were made mention of in the Commiſſion appointed for Examining the <hi>Glenco</hi> Buſineſs) in Vindication of his Brother's Behaviour and Conduct, as Secretary of State, in the ſaid Affair; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting, That if People did Conſtruct ſome Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, Sentences, or Periods of his Brother's Letters ſo and ſo, without connexion of other Sentences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without hearing (in his own abſence) they did not know what to ſay of it. But if one Sentence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with others, the whole would not bear the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries the People might put upon them <hi>ſeparatim,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">It's a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great <hi>Seneca.</hi> That the beſt way to help every thing by a fair In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and where there is a doubt, is, to allow it the moſt favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and ſeveral other Arguments to this purpoſe. The diſperſing of which Informations, after the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion's Sentiment (and they being ready to report their Opinion in open Parliament) gave Offence to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. He ſaid, his Printing and Diſperſing of them,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56237:17"/>
was before the Vote of Parliament, and ſaid, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give no Offence, mean time he was reprimanded, and was obliged to beg Pardon.</p>
            <p>The Parliament ſince Summoning of Lieutenant-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi> have declared him Fugitive, for not appearing, he is gone ſince into <hi>Flanders,</hi> as we hear, to wait upon His Majeſty. The Parliament have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made an Addreſs to the King, to ſend Perſons home, who may be found Guilty, to be proſecuted for the ſaid Murder, or not, as His Majeſty thinks fit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> This Parliament have done great things for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Service, and Safety of the Publick: For though there might have been ſome miſunderſtandings between ſome of the Members, yet all concurred unanimouſly to ſerve the King and the Country. You know what was ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nation and Common-wealth of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Tantae molis erat, Romanam condere gentem.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For great matters take up much time to effectuate the ends propoſed; ſo as we have had good beginnings, good proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, hopes all our matters will end well; for though the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſperate and uneaſie <hi>Jacobites</hi> (who but fiſh in muddy Waters) ſhould vaunt upon the occaſion of ſome Accidents, (as to ſee ſome honeſt, well-meaning men differ only in Points of Opinion,) they being a People ſoon elevated to Caſtles of the Air, and ſoon caſt down to the Duſt, yet all the buſtle they make, comes to nothing at laſt, but expoſes themſelves the more to folly. And I am very apt to believe, that all our ſeeming Differences would evaniſh upon the ſight of our moſt Gracious King's Preſence, upon his Throne in our Parliament; ſo will conclude with a great Moraliſt's ſaying, or to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That by the two Bleſſings of Reaſon and Union, we might ſecure and defend our ſelves againſt the violence of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; Senſe and Reaſon we have enough, and what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the latter, I hope the Defeat of <hi>Lewis Le Grand,</hi> and our moſt Gracious King's (I mean King <hi>William</hi>'s) Preſence once here in our Parliament, would, I am certain, effectuate. I long to ſee His Majeſty here. <hi>Vale, &amp; bene valeat &amp; Vivat Rex noſter Gulielmus.</hi>
