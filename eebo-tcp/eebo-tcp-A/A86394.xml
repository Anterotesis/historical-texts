            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING deſirous for my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſatisfaction to ſearch and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after reverenced Antiquity, it was my happe to light on an old manuſcript, which although in ſound is Saxon-like, yet in ſome thing it ſavours of the Daniſh matters, &amp; of the ancient Britiſh Laws under the rule and government of the Danes: which writing writ in the Saxon tongue, I have tranſlated into Engliſh word for word, according to the true ſence and meaning thereof.</p>
            <p>IT was ſometimes in the English Laws, that the People and the Laws were in Reputation: and then were the wiſeſt of the People Worſhip-worthy, each in his degree, Lorle and Chorle, Theyn and underthem. And if a Chorle ſo thriued that he had full fiue hides of his own Land, a Church and a Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen, a Bell-houſe &amp; a Gate, a ſeat &amp; ſeverall
<pb facs="tcp:156892:16"/>
offices in the Kings Hall; then was he thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth the Theyns right worthy. And if a Theyn ſo thrived that he ſerved the King, and on his meſſage, or journey rod in his houſhold; if then he had a Theyne that him followed, who to the Kings expedition fiue hide had, and in the Kings Pallac his Lord ſeru'd, and there with his errand had gone to the King, he might after ward with his fore Dath his Lords part play at any need. And if an Theyn ſo thriued, that he became an Earle, then was he right forth an Earle right worthy. And if a Merchant ſo thriued that he paſſed thrice ouer the wide Sea of his own craft, he was thenceforth the Theyns right worthy: And if a Scholler ſo thriued through learning, that he had degree, and ſerued Chriſt, he was thenceforth of dignity and peace ſo much wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as there to belonged, unleſſe he torfeited ſo, that he the uſe of his dignity might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him.</p>
            <p>Theſe ruines of Antiquity make ſhew of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of Nobility, even from the beginning of this Iland: but times are changed, and we in them alſo. For King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, laſt of the Saxon blood, coming out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> bringing in then the title of <hi>Baron,</hi> the Thayne from that time began to grow out of uſe; ſo at this day men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not ſo much as the names of them. And in proceſſe of time, the name of Baronage began
<pb facs="tcp:156892:16"/>
be both in dignity and power ſo magnificent above the reſt; as that in the name of the Baronage of <hi>England,</hi> all the Nobility of the Land ſeem'd to be comprehended. As for Dukes, they were (as it were) fetcht from long exile, and againe renew'd by K. <hi>Edward</hi> the third. And Marqueſſes and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts were altogether brought in by K. <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and K. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt.</p>
            <p>But our Kings deſcended of the Norman blood, together with the Crown of the Kingdome, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an hereditary and ſucceſſory perpetuity unto honourable titles; ſuch I meane as are the titles of Earldome, and Baronies, without any difference of Sex at all, which thing I thought good to make manifeſt by the examples of the more ancient times. In the reckoningup whereof that I may the better acquit and discharge my ſelfe, I ſhall in the Firſt place deſire the Reader to obſerve three things. Firſt, concerning the diſpoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of our King in the creating of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Second, of the Cuſtome of transferring of Honours &amp; dignities by Families. And Thirdly of the force of time, and the change and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of things. For why, our Kings (who in their Kingdomes beare alone the abſolute rule and ſway) are with us the efficient cauſes of al Political Nobility. The titles of named Nobility by our Cuſtome, have this naturall and common, together with the Crown it ſelfe, that the Heires Males fayling, they devolve unto the Women except in the firſt Charters it be in expreſſe words other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:156892:17"/>
provided; and yet ſo that regard is alwayes to be had of the time, which is every where wont to beare ſway in the formality of things.</p>
            <p>In this manner (<hi>Harold</hi> being overcome) <hi>William</hi> the firſt King, and Conquerour, having obtained the Soveraignty according to his pleaſure, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dignities and Honours upon his Companions and others; ſome of them ſo connext and conjoynd unto the Fees themſelves, that yet to this day, the poſſeſſors thereof may ſeem to be innobled even with the poſſeſſion of the Places only: as our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops at this day, by reaſon of the Baronies joynd unto their Biſhopricks, injoy the title and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of Barons in higheſt Aſſemblies of the Kingdome in <hi>Parliament</hi>: he gave and granted to others Dignities and Honours, together with the Lands, and fees themſelves. He gave to <hi>Hugh Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> his Kinſman (a Norman) the Earldome of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Ad conquirendum et tenendum ſibi &amp; Haeredibus, adeolibere per gladium, ſicut ipſe Rex tenuit Angliam per Coronam.</hi> To <hi>Hanus Rufus</hi> (then Earle of <hi>Brettaine</hi> in <hi>France</hi>) and his Heires the Earledom of <hi>Richmond. It a libere et honorifice, uteundem Edwinus. Comes anteatenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erat.</hi> And the Earledome of <hi>Arundell</hi> (which <hi>Harald</hi> poeſſeſſed) he granted, with a fee unto <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Montgomery.</hi> The firſt two of which Honours (the Heires male fayling) by Women paſſed unto other Families: But the latter Earldome, <hi>Robert</hi> the Son of <hi>Roger</hi> being attainted of Treaſon, returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, who gave the ſame in Dowry unto Queen <hi>Adeliza</hi> his wife. But the
<pb facs="tcp:156892:17"/>
ſucceeding Kings, more ſparingly beſtowed ſuch dignities, to be holden of them in Fee, granting for the better and more honourable maintenance of their ſtocke add honour, the third part of the pleas of the Countie (as they term it) which they in their Charters cal <hi>Tertium denarium,</hi> or the third penny: ſo that he that received the third penny of any province, was called Earle of the ſame; and ſo by cuſtome the Women, the Heires male fayling.</p>
            <p>And if any Earle or Baron dying without Sons, had many Women his heires, howſoever order was taken either by way of Covenant, or partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concerning the Lands &amp; poſſeſſions, according to the Common Laws of the Kingdome, yet the dignitie and Honour (a thing of it ſelfe indiviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) was ſtill left to be diſpos'd of, according to the Kings pleaſure, who in beſtowing there of uſually reſpected the prerogative of birth: by which right, K. <hi>Henry</hi> the third after the death of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Scot, dead without iſſue (other Lands and revenews being by agreement given to his three Siſters) united the Earldom of <hi>Cheſter</hi> with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereof unto the Crown. This is manifeſt in the Earldome of <hi>Arundell,</hi> which (after <hi>Robert Be liſme</hi> Son to the aforeſaid <hi>Roger Mountgomery</hi> dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out by <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt) K. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon <hi>william</hi> of <hi>Albine.</hi> Q. <hi>Adeliza</hi> his Mothers husband, and by a new Charter, confirmd it in fee, together with the Inheritance to him and his Heires, with the third pleas of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> whereof he created him Earle. But <hi>Hugh</hi> the great, Nephew
<pb facs="tcp:156892:18"/>
of this <hi>william</hi> the firſt being dead without iſſue, all the Earldome was divided among his foure Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whoſe dignitie and honour for all that, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Caſtle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> was by <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, at length given to <hi>Richard Fitz-Alan</hi> (the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews Sonne to <hi>Iohn Fitz-Alan,</hi> and <hi>Iſabell</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the aforeſaid Siſters.</p>
            <p>I will now paſſe from <hi>Henry</hi> the third to <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt his Sonne, there being for a time great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention betwixt him and certaine of his Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz.

               </gap> thuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and <hi>Gilbert</hi> a Sonne called alſo <hi>Gilbert</hi>; but ſhe the ſecond time ſecretly marryed unto one <hi>Ridulph,</hi> of <hi>Mont Hermeri</hi> (without the King her Fathers knowledge) and in her own right, made the ſame <hi>Radulph</hi> Earle ſo long as ſhe lived: but ſhe being dead, <hi>Gilbert</hi> her Sonne by the aforeſaid <hi>Gilbert</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againe into the Earldome, <hi>Radulph</hi> his Father in Law being yet alive. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nner
<pb facs="tcp:156892:18"/>
he reſtored to the aforeſaid <hi>Humphrey</hi> of <hi>Bohun</hi> his Earldome and Conſtableſhip, unto whom he alſo gave in Marriage <hi>Elizabeth</hi> another of his Daughters, Widdow, to <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of <hi>Holland</hi>: and to the third he reſtored the Earldome of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and the Office of Marſhal, with the yearly increaſe of a thouſand marks, upon condition if the heires male of his body to be begotten fayling, both ſhould return againe to the King. At length this <hi>Roger</hi> dyed without iſſue, in the xxxv. yeare of him, the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in the laſt yeare of his raigne: and K. <hi>Edward</hi> his Sonne, the ſecond of that name, both by a new Creation and Charter, gave the Earldome and the Marſhallſhip to <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Brotherton,</hi> and his heire male.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I have thus propounded, thereby to ſhew how according to the diverſe diſpoſitions of Princes, and change of times, it hath by little and little varied in the firſt beſtowing of dignities and honours: Of which thing (that new Law) and to them of ancient time unknown, made by King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, ſeemeth afterward to be of no ſmall moment, whereby, he favouring certaine private men, more carefull of their own ſirname, then of their poſterity, it was thought good by him to decree to make Fees to belong to men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That Law which I would in latine call <hi>Gentili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium Municipale,</hi> and which the Lawyers common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call <hi>Mis taliatum,</hi> and <hi>Talliabile</hi>; or the Law of cutting off: for that it cutteth off Succeſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generall, and reſtraineth them to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb facs="tcp:156892:19"/>
heires of Families, which ſeemeth to have given an occaſion of change in the giving and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of dignities and honours. For ever ſince that time, in the Creating of any new Earle, it is begun to be altered by expreſſe words in all Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, provided, that it ſhalbe but for terme of life onely, or diſcend unto the heires males alone, the women being quite excluded. And for this I need not examples to prove; for why, the thing it ſelfe proveth the ſame. But the force and efficacie of this Law of Entaile (or of cutting off) I have thought good thus in few words to declare.</p>
            <p>And what I have ſayd concerning Earles, the ſame may be ſayd alſo of Barons, created by Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but in Barons created by Reſcripts, or writs of ſummons, yet reſting upon moſt ancient cuſtom not ſo.</p>
            <p>For in them (one onely excepted, ſent forth to <hi>Henry Bromflet,</hi> wherein it was provided him, that ſame <hi>Henry</hi> and his heires Male of his Body, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten, onely to be Barons of <hi>Veſey</hi>) women the heires Male fayling, were not in ancient time forbidden, orimbarred, but that they might be accounted, and by name ſtiled Honourable, with the preeminence of the dignity, and calling of Barons: and after they had borne a Child, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient favour of our Lawes, (and the cuſtome of the Kingdom) graced their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands alſo with the ſame honour, and with the ſame by Inheritance, ennobled their Children, yea without the poſſeſſions of thoſe places, from
<pb facs="tcp:156892:19"/>
whence the name of ſuch dignities and honours may ſeeme firſt to have riſen. For fees and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call poſſeſſions circumſcribed by the Law, are tranſlated and carried from one family unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and uſually enrich their Lords, and owners, the poſſeſſors thereof, but yet of themſelves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being, nor take away nobilitie, either dative or native; by example to maifeſt theſe things, were but needleſſe, &amp; of litle conſequence, for why, all the moſt ancient Baronies, &amp; the more ancient ſort of the Barons at this day, are in this point on my ſide, and if any ſhall object againſt me in this point, unto him I will oppoſe, either the force of time, or the careleſneſſe and lack of looking unto. But cuſtomes are ſtill like themſelves, nor muſt we detract from the authority of Kings, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have ſuch ſupereminent, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate prerogative, as that they may ſeeme ſometimes to have of favour granted ſome things beſide the Law, yet it ſhall nor appeare them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to have done, or yet ſuffered to have been done, any thing contrary to the cuſtom of Stocks, and Families, ſo ſometimes they, not regarding the ſolemnities of Ceremonies, and Charters, have onely by their becks (that I may ſo ſay) ſuffered dignities, and honours, to be tranferred, as in <hi>Ranulph Blundevill</hi> Earle of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> to be ſeene for the Earldome of <hi>cheſter,</hi> he permitted after the manner, to diſceud to <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Scot</hi> his Nephew, by <hi>Maude</hi> the elder of his Siſters: But the Earledome of <hi>Lincolne</hi> (the King thereunto conſenting) he yet alive, delivered unto <hi>Hawiſia</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:156892:20"/>
another of his Siſters, then married to <hi>Robert Quincy,</hi> by his Deede in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. yeare of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I ſay, were of old and ancient time, but at this day not ſo, for ſuch is the force of time, and change in altering the formes of things, as that in eating out of the old, bringeth ſtill in new: ſo unto Earles, whom we ſaid in ancient time to have been rewarded with the third penny of the province, whereof they were Earles, to maintaine their honour, and dignity; a certaine ſome of money is at this day, yearely paid them out of the Exchequer, and they the titles of ſuch places, as wherein they have no juriſdiction, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, or profit at all. Barons alſo who as the Fathers and Senators in ancient times among the <hi>Romans</hi> were choſen by their Seſtercia, were in like manner wont to be eſteemed and valued by Knights fees, for why he which had and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed thirteene Knights fees, and a little more, was to be accounted among the Barons, are now more ſeldom times choſen for their vertue, their great wealth, and large poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>Neither is there any let, but that a man may hould and ſtill retaine the name and title of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony, the head of which Barony, (as they terme it) he hath afterward ſould or alienated to ſome other common perſon.</p>
            <p>In briefe, our Kings Royall Majeſty is alwaies like it ſelfe, conſtant, and the ſame, which having regard to the vertue, ſtock, wealth, and ſubſtance,
<pb facs="tcp:156892:20"/>
of any man (whereby he may with his counſells ſervice, profit the Common-wealth) may in every place freelie give and beſtow dignities and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, ſomtimes chuſing no more Barons then one, out of one and the ſame Family, The cuſtome of the ſucceſſion of the former and more ancient Baron, being ſtil kept whole, &amp; not in any hurt, as wee ſee, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, wiſely to have done in the family of the <hi>Willobies</hi> of <hi>Erſby,</hi> brought forth alſo another Barony of <hi>Parham,</hi> wherefore we acknowledge our Kings to be the fountaines of Politicall Nobilitie, and unto whom we may with thanks refer all the degrees of honours, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, wherefore I may not without cauſe ſeeme to rejoyce, on the behalfe of our Nobilitie of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> which hath had alwaies Kings themſelves Authors, Patrons, Governors, and Defenders thereof, that when Lands, Fees, and Poſſeſſions, ſubjects to Covenants, or agreements, are ſtill toſſed and turmoyl'd with the ſtormes of the judiciall Courts, and of the Common Law, it is onely unto the Kings themſelves, beholding, and reſteth upon Heroicall orders, and inſtitutions proper and familiar, unto it ſelfe, ſo that,

            <p>That foraſmuch as in all great Aſſemblies and Congregations of men, having degrees and offices in the Common-wealth, it was thought fit and convenient, that order ſhould be taken for the placing and ſitting of ſuch perſons as are bound to reſort to the ſame, to the intent that they knowing their places, might uſe the ſame without diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the places of wch. great offices deſerve reſpect and admiration: and though meerly officiarie and depending on life, and the Kings gracious election, without any hereditary title or perfection; yet are they of ſuch high dignity, that all hereditary honour whatſoever, under the degree of Royalty (may at all times) without diſparagement give them place and precedencie. The placing of theſe moſt Noble and great Officers both in the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> houſe, and other Aſſemblies, is after this worthy and diſtinct order.</p>
            <p>That is to ſay, the Lord Chancellor or L. Keeper, the L. Treaſurer, the L. Preſident of the Kings Privie Councell, and the L. Privy Seale, being of the degree of Barons of the <hi>Parliament</hi> or above to ſit on the higheſt part of the form, on the left ſide in the <hi>Parliament</hi> Chamber; &amp; above al Dukes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe wch. are the Kings Sons; the Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his Uncles, his Nephews, or his Brothers or Siſters Sonnes: but if any of theſe foure great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers aforeſaid ſhal be under the degree of a Baron, then he or they to ſit on the uppermoſt part of the Sackes in the middeſt of the <hi>Parliament</hi> Chamber, in ſuch order as is aforeſhewed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:156892:22"/>As touching the other, it was enacted that the I. great Chamberlaine, the L. Conſtable, the L. Marſhall, the L. Admirall, the L. Steward, and the L. Chamberlaine of the Kings houſhold, ſhall be placed next to the L. Privie Seale, each of them above all other perſonages, being of their owne eſtates or degrees; and holding the ſame prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as they are formerly named.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the principall Secretary being of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Baron, ſhall be rang'd above all Barons, (not having any of the former offices alſo) and this range and precedencie to continue to all the great Officers in generall, which are before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; both in <hi>Parliament,</hi> in Councell Chamber, in the Starre Chamber, at the tryall of Peeres; and in all other Aſſemblies whatſoever.</p>
            <p>This in briefe is the effect of the Statute, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the dignity and place of our moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and ſupremeſt Temporall Officers, of which the firſt and chiefeſt is the L. Chancellor, or L. Keeper, who is ſaid to be the Kings Conſcience, his mouth, and confirmation, for by him all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of the law are bridled: the Kingswil in grace conſultations revealed, and his gifts and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives confirmed; before him all the great buſineſſe of the Common-wealth is diſpatcht, either at Councell Table, in Starre-Chamber, or in the Chancery, where hee hath a principall voyce, and precedence: and laſtly, he hath the keeping of the great Scale of the Kingdome, in which is expreſt a reputation ſo ſerious, that all Subjects
<pb facs="tcp:156892:22"/>
lifes and Eſtates depending on the ſame.</p>
            <p>The next in place is the L. high Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> to whoſe truſt the Kings Treaſure is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, who is a man of that noble, worthy, ſweet and generous diſpoſition, of important confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of noble eſtimation, excellent in wiſdom and high in eſtimation, and to his wiſdome and excellent judgement, is referred the whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Kings entire Eſtate, and the provident regard of the wealth and flouriſhing proſperity of all the K. Subjects: He is the prime Officer Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, betweene the King and his Tenants, and hath dependance on the Councell Table, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer and the Kings Royall Houſe and Family.</p>
            <p>The next to theſe is the L. Preſident, of the Kings moſt honourable Privy Counſell, and is the chiefe man (next the King) belonging to the high and honourable Aſſembly, and hath in his power, under the Kings Majeſty, the mannage of the priuileges of that Honourable Table.</p>
            <p>The next is the L. Privy Scale, an eſpeciall Enſigne of credit belonging to this Kingdome, having cuſtodie and charge of the Kings leſſer Seal, which gives teſtimony of the Kings fauours and bounty, but alſo making the way cleare and acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable to the great Seale, in which conſiſts the ſtrength of his Majeſties confirmations; Theſe firſt foure great Officers are civill, and judicature, as depending on the publique State: after whom follow ſix other which are as well Military as Civill, having the managing of all matters of Honour, and Warlike proceedings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:156892:23"/>The firſt of which is the <hi>L.</hi> Chamberlaine of the Kingdome, whoſe Office is of the greateſt imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all publique Aſſemblies, as Coronations, Parliaments, Tryumphs, or any Solemnitie, where the King himſelfe rideth in perſon: which Office is not Officiary, but Honorarie, depending by a feudall right, unto the Noble houſe of the Earles of <hi>Oxenford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this is the L. Conſtable of the kingdom, who was the firſt and principall Generall under the <hi>King</hi>? of all the Land forces, and in all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Martiall affaires, had the principall nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Officers, and ordering of Munition for ſuch imployment.</p>
            <p>Then is the L. Marſhall of the Land, a great and renowned Officer, in whom conſiſt the ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all differences in Honour, and diſpenſation of al things appertaining to the great or leſſer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Next followeth the Office of the L. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall of the Land, who is the Kings Generall, and chiefe Commander at Sea, and hath care and charge of all his Majeſties Royall Navy, and the cenſuring of all Marine cauſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The next following is the L. Steward of the Kings Houſehold, in whoſe truſt and government is repoſed the ordering of all the great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Families, the diſcuſſion of all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, the placing and removing of Officers, and the diſpoſing of all things therein, for his Majeſties renowne and dignity.</p>
            <p>The laſt of theſe great Officers, is the <hi>L.</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine
<pb facs="tcp:156892:23"/>
of the Kings Royall Houſehold, unto whoſe great truſt, faith, and integrity, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the guard of the Kings Royall perſon, he hath the controle, and commandement, of all Officers and others, whoſe dependance is on the Kings perſon; and howſoever ſome would limit his rule above the Sayters, yet it is over the whole Court, and in all places whereſoever the King is preſent: with many other priveledges which at this time cannot be fully recited.</p>
            <p>After all theſe great Offices, and Officers, I muſt neceſſarily add one great Officer more, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Kings chiefe and principall Secretary of Eſtate, who deſerves a due reſpect by his high and Honourable Place, in regard he is ſo intimate and nigh to all affaires, of his Majeſtie, either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or particular.</p>
