            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, usually to Consult in the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Marriage, Peace and War, with their Peers and Commons in Parliament.</head>
            <p>TO search so high as the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, that is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary <note place="margin">
                  <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror.</note> to lay down the Form and Government of those Times, wherein State-Affairs were led in another Form of publick Councils: For the People wrought under the Sword of the First <hi>William,</hi> and his Followers, to a subjected Vassallage, and could not possess in such Assemblies, the Right of their former Liberties, Division and Power having mastered them, and none of their own Nobility and Heads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left, either of Credit or Fortunes.</p>
            <p>What he retained not in Providence, (as the Demesnes of the <note place="margin">Dooms-day Book.</note> Crown) or reserved in Piety, (as the Maintenance of the Church) he parted to those Strangers that sailed along with him, in that Barque of his Adventure, leaving the Natives for the most part, <note place="margin">Admerus. Huntington.</note> (as appeareth in his Survey) in no better condition than Villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: He moulded their Customs to the manner of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and forbare to grant the Laws of holy <hi>Edward,</hi> so often called for.</p>
            <p>To supply his occasions of Men, Money and Provision, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <note place="margin">Ex libro Feoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris in Scaccio.</note> that all those that enjoyed any fruit of his Conquest, should hold their Lands proportionable by so many Knights Fees of the Crown, admitted them to enfeoff their Followers, with such parts as they pleased of their own Portions; which to ease their Charge, they did in his and his Sons times, by two Enfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offments, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. Statut.</note> the one <hi>de Novo,</hi> the other <hi>de Veteri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This course provided him the body of the War; the Money <note place="margin">Ex libro Rubro Scaccio.</note> and Provision was by Head-age assessed on the common People, at the Consent of the Lords, who held in all their Seigniories such Right of Regality, that to their Vassals, as <hi>Paris</hi> saith, <note place="margin">Cronicom de Dnustable.</note> 
               <hi>Quot Domini, tot Tyranni,</hi> and proved to the King so great a Curb, and restraint of Power, that nothing fell into the Care of <note place="margin">Benedict Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard in vita Hen. 2.</note> his Majesty after, more than to retrench the Force of his <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coited,</hi> that was in time like to strangle the <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though others foresaw the Mischiefs betimes, yet none at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the Remedy, until King <hi>John,</hi> whose over-hasty Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, brought in these Broyls of the Barons Wars.</p>
            <p>There needed not before this Care, to advise with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in any publick Assembly, when every Man in <hi>England,</hi> by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66272:3"/>
Tenure, held himself to his great Lord's Will, whose presence was ever regnized in those great Councils, and in whose Assent, his dependant Tenant's Consent was ever included.</p>
            <p>Before this King's Time then, we seek in vain for any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Called; they were ever Called for making of Laws, but <note place="margin">Claus. 6. in Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</note> not to Consult touching War or Peace: He first, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, (though darkly by the Records) used their Counsels and Assents in the 6th. year of his Reign.</p>
            <p>Here is the first Summons in Record to the Peers or Barons: <hi>Tractatur de magnis &amp; ardinis negotiis:</hi> It was about a War of Defence against the <hi>French,</hi> and at that time the Commons were admitted. As this time that may fitly be gathered by this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, <note place="margin">Paris 6. Ro. 2. in Dorso.</note> 
               <hi>Provisum est communi assensu Archiepiscoporum Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, Barronium &amp; omnium fidelium nostrorum Angliae quod no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem Milites per Angliam inveniend. de communi Ro.</hi> And this was directed to all the Sheriffs in <hi>England,</hi> the ancient use in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Laws.</p>
            <p>From this there is a break, until 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. where the next Summons extant is in a Plea-Roll of that year; but the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances <note place="margin">Claus. 49. Hen. 3 in Dorso.</note> are lost, from thence the Record affords no light, until the 49th. of the same King, where then the Summons to Bishops, Lords, Knights and Burgesses, are much in manner, though not in matter, alike to the Use of our Times. This Parliament was Called to advise with the King, <hi>pro pace asseveranda &amp; firmanda,</hi> they are the words; and where Advice is required, Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be admitted.</p>
            <p>To this King succeeds <hi>Edw.</hi> I. his Son a wise, a just, and a fortunate Prince: In his Reign we have no light of any publick <note place="margin">Edw. <hi>I.</hi>
               </note> Counsel in this kind, and so along to the 4th. of his Grandchilds Reign, but what we borrow in the Rolls of Summons, wherein the Form stood various according to the occasions, until that <note place="margin">Ex Rot.

            <p>The King in the 5th. of his Reign, Called a Parliament, and therein advised with his Lords and Commons, for the suppressing <note place="margin">Claus. 5. <hi>Edw. I.</hi> in Dorso.</note>

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King having invaded <hi>Gascoigne,</hi> in the 13th. year <note place="margin">Claus. 16. m. 27</note> of the Parliament, was Called, <hi>super ordinis negotiis statum Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus Gasconiae tangentibus;</hi> and in the 16th. to consult, <hi>ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraenandum Scotorum obstinantiam &amp; malitiam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before <hi>Edw.</hi> III. would resolve in his first year, whether Peace <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Claus. 1.</note> or War with the <hi>Scots</hi> King, he summoned the Peers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>super praemissis tractare &amp; Consilium impendere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chancellor, <hi>Anno</hi> 5. declareth from the King the cause of that Assembly, and that that was to consult and resolve, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King should proceed with <hi>France,</hi> for the recovery of <note place="margin">Rot.

            <p>The year following he re-assembled his Lords and Commons, and requireth their Advice, whether he should undertake the holy Expedition with the <hi>French</hi> King or no; the Bishops and <note place="margin">Parl. 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</note> Proctors of the Clergy would not be present, as forbidden by the Commons such Counsels: The Peers and Commons consult, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding the Religious and Princely forwardness of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign to this hard Enterprize; but humbly advise forbearance this year, for urgent Reasons.</p>
            <p>The same year, (though another Sessions,) the King demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advice of his People, whether he should pass into <hi>France,</hi> to an Enterview, as was desired, for the expediting the Treaty of Marriage: The Prelates by themselves, and the Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons <note place="margin">Rot.

            <p>In the following Parliament at <hi>York,</hi> the King sheweth, how by their former Advice, he had drawn himself towards the North Parts, and now again he had assembled them, to advise further for his Proceedings. To which the Lords and Commons having consulted apart, pray further time to resolve, until a full Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the State: To which the King granting, adjourneth that Sessions.</p>
            <p>At their next Meeting, they are charged upon their Allegiance <note place="margin">Rot. 7 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Sess 2.

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66272:4"/>
In the 13th. year, the Grandees and Commons are called to consult and advise, how the domestick Quiet may be preserved, the Marches of <hi>Scotland</hi> defended, and the Sea scowred from Enemies: The Peers and Commons (having apart consulted) the Commons desire not to be charged to Counsel in things, <hi>des queux ils neut pas Cognisaux,</hi> answer, that the Guardians of the Shire, assisted by the Knights, may effect the first, (if Pardons of Felony be not granted) the care of the Marches they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly leave to the King and Counsel; and for the safeguard of the Seas, they wish that the Cinque-ports and Maritime Towns, (dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged for the most part from many Burthens of Inland Parts) may have that left to their Charge and Care; and that such as have Lands near the Sea-Coasts, be commanded to reside in those Possessions.</p>
            <p>The Parliament is the same year re-assembled to advise, <hi>De expeditione Guerre in partibus transmarinis.</hi> At this Assembly <note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 13 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Sess. 2.</note> Ordinances are made for provision of Ships, arraying of Men for the Marches, and defence of the Isle of <hi>Jersey,</hi> naming such in the Record, as they conceived for the Imployments.</p>
            <p>The next year, <hi>De la Poole</hi> accounteth the Expences of the War; a new Aid is granted, and by several Committees, (in <note place="margin">Parl. 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.

            <p>The Pope's Undertaking proving fruitless, and delays to the <hi>French</hi> advantage, who in the mean space, (with <hi>Scotland</hi> and others) practised to root out the <hi>English</hi> Nation; in <hi>France,</hi> the King again assembled his Parliament the year following: In which the Peers and Commons, after many days of Deliberation, resolve to end that, either by Battel or Peace, and no more to trust to the Mediation of his Holiness.</p>

First, The Truce, after by their Assents accepted, and now ended, the King's Pleasure was to have their Counsels in these Prosecutions: The Commons being commanded, <hi>Y ils se devoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ensemble &amp; si ils assent le devoirent nostre au Roy &amp; all Grandees de son Counsel,</hi> who after four days consulting, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desire of the King, that he would be advised herein by his Lords, and others of more Experience than themselves in such Affairs.</p>
            <p>To advise the King the best for his <hi>French</hi> Imployments, a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <note place="margin">Parl. 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> was summoned, <hi>Anno</hi> 25. wherein the King by a more publick Dispatch, willeth the Commons to elect twenty four, or thirty, of their House, to consult with the Lords; these to relate to their Fellows, and the Conclusion in general, by the Lords to the King.</p>
            <p>In the 27th. a great Counsel is assembled, many of the Lay-Peers, <note place="margin">Parl. 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3</note> few of the Clergy, and of the Knights of the Shires, and Burgesses, but one a piece. This was for the prosecution of the <hi>French</hi> Wars, when honourable following. A Truce being offered, the King forbare his Peers and Commons, which they in Parliament accorded unto before the Pope's Notary, by publick Instinct.</p>

               <hi>John,</hi> the Parliament assembled, when after Consultation apart. The Prelates, Lords and Commons, advise the denial, although it be by dint of Sword.</p>
            <p>In the 43d. the King declared to the Peers and Commons, <note place="margin">Parl. 43 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3</note> that the <hi>French,</hi> against the Articles of the Truce, refused pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Moneys, and delivery of the Towns, summoning <hi>La Brett,</hi> and others of the King's Subjects in <hi>Gascoin,</hi> to make at <hi>Paris</hi> their Appeals, and had forraged his Countrey of <hi>Poitgers,</hi> requiring (in their breach) whether he might not regain hit style of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons had apart consulted; they advised the King to both, which he approving, altered the Inscription and Figure of his style.</p>
            <p>Two years after, it was declared to the Peers and Commons, <note place="margin">Parl 45 <hi>Ed</hi> 3.</note> that by their Advice, he had again resumed the style and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of <hi>France,</hi> and therefore called their Advice, for the defence

of the Realm against the <hi>French,</hi> securing of the Seas, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing of the Wars; of which they consult and resolve to give the King an Aid.</p>
            <p>The like Councel and Supply was the very next following. <note place="margin">

The Commons after two days debate, crave a Conference with the Lords; the effect is not entred in the Roll, only they by Sir <hi>Thomas Fuckering</hi> their Speaker, protest, that Counsels of War did aptly belong to the King and his Lords: Yet since the Commons were commanded to give their Advice, they humbly wish a Voyage Royal by the King; if not, that the Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> might, with the advantage of the Pope's <hi>Croycery,</hi> be used in that service, who accepted the Charge with ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
            <p>Here further the Commons pray, that the King's Uncle should not be spared out of the Realm, before some Peace was settled with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that the Lord <hi>Delaspar,</hi> sent with Provisions of Peace from <hi>Spain,</hi> might first be heard.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor, in the 7th year, in the Name of the King, <note place="margin">Parl. 7 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.

            <p>At the next Sessions, the same year, the Commons are willed to advise upon view of the Articles of Peace with the <hi>French,</hi> whether War, or such Amity should be accepted.</p>
            <p>They modestly excuse themselves, as too weak to counsel in so weighty Causes: But charged again, as they did tender the Honour and Right of the King, they make this Answer, <hi>Yils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudont que astmis services terres y mesne lour leige anecoit ore per testarior in Guyen si serront tenus del Roy Francois per tril sernior la villa de Callis &amp; auter terres acquise &amp; conquise des Francois per les fore neue verroit la Commen y aniuse Aiust fait si autrement preroit been faire,</hi> giving their Opinions rather for Peace than War.</p>

            <p>After this time the Journalls of Parliaments have been either not well preserved, or not carefully Entred: For I can find of <note place="margin">Hen. 7.</note> this nature no Record, until the first of <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> wherein the Commons, by <hi>Thomas Lovel</hi> their Speaker, Petitioned the King to take to Wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> to which at their request agreeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:66272:7"/>
The next is the third of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> in which, from the <note place="margin">Hen. 8. <hi>Rott. Parl.</hi> 3. Hen. 8.</note> King the Chancellor delivereth to the three Estates the Cause of their Assembly. The first to advise a course for resisting the Invasion of the <hi>Scots:</hi> Next how to acquit the Quarrel between the King and the <hi>Castiles,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guilders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, for resisting the <hi>Pope</hi> against <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> whose <note place="margin">Julius 2.</note> Bull expressing the Injuries done to the See Apostolique, was read by the Master of the Rolls in open Parliament: The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, Treasurer, and other Lords sent down unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to confer thereof.</p>
            <p>The last in the 32. where the Chancellor remembring the <note place="margin">Rott. 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8 Parl.</note> many Troubles the State had undergone in doubtful Titles of Succession, declareth that the Convocation had judged void the Marriage with <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve;</hi> yet the King would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without the Counsel of the three Estates.</p>
            <p>The two Archbishops are sent to the Commons with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <note place="margin">Ex Instrument. Original.</note> Sealed, which being read, and there discussed; they pass a Bill against the Marriage.</p>
            <p>In all these passages of publick Councel, wherein I have been much assisted by the painful Labours of Mr. <hi>Elsing</hi> Clerk of the Parliament, I still observe that the Soveraign Lord, either in best Advice, or most Necessities, would entertain the Commons with the weightiest Causes, either Forraign or Domestick, to adapt and bind them so to readiness of Charge; and they as warily avoiding to shun Expence: Their Modest answers may be a Rule for ignorant liberty to form their duties, and humbly to entertain such weighty Counsels at their Soveraigns pleasure; and not out of the wild sin of any Factious Spirits.</p>
            <p>I will only add one Forraign Example, to shew what use hath been formerly made of pretended Marriages, and of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments to dissolve them, their first ends served.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> the one to secure his Possessions in <hi>Italy,</hi> the other to secure the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Navar:</hi> To both which the <hi>French</hi> King stood in the way, projecting a Marriage of <hi>Charles</hi> the Grand-child with <hi>Mary</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Sister: It was embraced a Contract, <hi>per verba de presenti,</hi> passed, and a Book published, of the Benefit and Liberty to ensue the Christian World by this Match.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground <hi>Ferdinand</hi> begins to incite King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> to War in <hi>France;</hi> presents him with Succour, designs him <hi>Guyen</hi> to be the Mark: <hi>Dorset</hi> is sent with Men and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to joyn with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces.</p>
            <p>Then on the Borders of <hi>Navar</hi> the noise is, they come to assist <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in Conquest of that Kingdom, which (though false) gain such reputation, that <hi>Albird</hi> was disheartned, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> possessed himself of that which his Successors since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66272:8"/>
his ends served; the <hi>English</hi> Army in the depth of Winter, weak and weather-beaten, are returned fruitless.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> then allureth the Young and Active King to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>France</hi> on the other side <hi>Turway;</hi> and <hi>Turway</hi> is now the Object whether <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> goeth with Victory, but advised with that pittance, maketh an end with <hi>France,</hi> whose Eye and Heart was set on <hi>Maximilian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A new Bait the Old Emperor casteth out to catch the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Young man: He will needs Resign unto him the Empire, <note place="margin">Extract. Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. 15 15.</note> too heavy for his Age to bear.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal <hi>Sidanensis</hi> is sent over to Sign the Agreement, (which he did) and <hi>France</hi> must now again be made an Enemy.</p>
            <p>To prevent this danger, <hi>France</hi> releaseth his Title to <hi>Naples</hi> and offereth his Infanta <hi>Lampsia</hi> to <hi>Maximilian</hi>'s Grand-child, <note place="margin">Extract. Orig. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Noyen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is acted in the dark; and at <hi>Arno</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners come up the back Stairs with 60000. and the ingrossed Covenants, when they abused the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; a pace went down the other way. The Lord Cardinal returneth home, meeteth by the way the fowl play of his Master, and Writ to the King of <hi>England;</hi> not in Excuse, but in Complaint, <hi>contra per fideam Principium,</hi> an Honest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> dead, <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> are Competitors for the Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> is Courted for his help by both, the one with tye of Alliance (for the Infanta, Dauphin had offered to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> the other with the like; the one will make his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Ex Literis <hi>Car.</hi> Regis Hisp.</note> a Queen in present, which the Dauphin cannot do; and by his favour an Empress.</p>
