            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Seaſonable ANSWER To a Late PAMPHLET, ENTITULED, <hi>The Vindication of</hi> Slingsby Bethel, <hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the Sheriffs of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Middleſex, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE City of <hi>London</hi> is a place of ſo great Conſideration, and well known to abound ſo much with men of True Loyalty, undoubted Integrity, plentiful Fortunes, generous Tempers, untainted Credit, and every way fit to diſcharge its principal Offices, that it cannot be under any neceſſity of taking up with perſons of <hi>Factious Principles,</hi> Moot Honeſty, Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Eſtates, narrow and ſhrivel'd Souls, or Fly-blown Reputations, to diſgrace any of the Honourable Employments in it.</p>
            <p>And yet to the great ſurprize of multitudes that did, and that did not know him, Mr. <hi>Slingsby Bethel,</hi> one of the moſt Notorious, &amp; moſt Obſcure men that ever was made Free of the <hi>Leather-Sellers</hi> Company, was the laſt year, by the feveriſh Zeal of a boiſterous puffing Party of miſtaken Citizens, blown up into a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> though ſince that ſudden Guſt of popular breath is laid, he has dwindled and ſhrunk up into a Thing not commenſurate to the Dignity of an <hi>Ale-Conner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For now that his fond miſ-led Friends have had time to conſider and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, they have with a Modeſty to be encouraged, diſown'd the Man and his Manners; and notwithſtanding their late Midſummer Complement, upon occaſion of Diſcourſe concerning him, have been ready to bluſh for him ſince, as much as they ſweated for him at firſt.</p>
            <p>The Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> comparatively with any other Borough, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed City in <hi>England,</hi> is much more a Neighbour to the City of <hi>London</hi> in its Trade and Commerce, and in the number and condition of its Inhabitants, than in its Scituation; and was never ſo barren of Men, Honeſt, and Wiſe, and Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as that it needed to croſs the Water for Burgeſſes to ſerve in Parliament.</p>
            <p>And yet at the laſt Election the ſame <hi>Slingsby Bethel</hi> having now gained the Additional Title of Mr. <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Eſquire</hi> to promote his pretenſions, becomes very officious in tendring us his Service in the Houſe of Commons; and with as little Invitation to our Pockets as ever we had to his Table, over the Bridge come his Horſe and He (the principal Burghers being not yet reſolv'd which of the two to make a Senator) and being encourag'd by ſome few male-content Renegado's from amongſt us, who like Whifflers came juſtling and making El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-room for him, he ſets up for Himſelf, and will be our Repreſentative, and put his hands into our Purſes whether we will or no.</p>
            <p>This way of Addreſſing the more conſiderable ſort of our Burghers were ſo unacquainted with, that preſently we became curious in ſearching into the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of a perſon of ſuch extraordinary Application; and upon enquiry we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100217:3"/>
received ſuch a Character of him, as that the leaſt limb of our Body, the Men of <hi>Kentſtreet</hi> it ſelf, would diſdain to ſend him up to <hi>Oxford</hi> as a Repreſentative Broomſtick.</p>
            <p>Indeed he had once the Honour to be return'd by the Ward of <hi>Farrindon Without,</hi> one of the two Commoners, of whom the Court of Aldermen were to chuſe the more Worthy to be Alderman of their Ward; but it is to be noted, that he had the Honour likewiſe to be rejected by that wiſe and impartial Court; both which put together (eſpecially conſidering the grounds of his boaſted <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſent,</hi> which, in defence of that Ward, I ſhall in its due place explain) I am apt to think that the advantage of Credit from that Enterprize is not on his part ſo great, as to give him any juſt encouragement of hoping ever to arrive at ſo high a Dignity; but when <hi>Michaelmas</hi> is come, the Retinue diſcharged, the Horſe ſold, and the Gold Chain reſtor'd, he muſt ſit down content to be <hi>Slingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Bethel</hi> in <hi>cuerpo</hi> ſtill.</p>
            <p>Now for a Gentleman born and bred, one ſo well read and travell'd as he has been, and who is of too great a Spirit to ſtoop to the Office of Executioner, to ſerve the Greateſt Prince that ever was brought to the Block; for ſuch a Man to be ſo miſerably defeated in his pretenſions on both ſides the Water, to be ſo ſcornfully neglected, and re-buff'd in the Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> when he came over, reſolv'd to be their humble Servant; to be ſo unexpectedly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted and Un-Burgeſſed, when his Confidence of Succeſs had already put him to the trouble of preparing ſome Speeches for the Houſe: And then in the City to be denied Admittance into the Court of Aldermen; and while his younger Brother, the other Sheriff, is a Member of it, for him to be forced to dance Attendance upon it, to be made a Companion to Foot-boys, and to have no other Diverſion than what ariſes from being Spectator of the <hi>Olympick</hi> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>Span-Farthing:</hi> Theſe are Indignities which no man of ſo equal a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Wit and Bravery, can be expected to paſs by un-revenged one way or other.</p>
            <p>And therefore his Courage and Fancy being hereby raiſed, in a ſhort time he boldly ſets up for an Author; and that he may be even with <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Southwark</hi> together, he at once publiſhes a Libel upon both, under the Name of <hi>The Vindication of</hi> Slingſby Bethel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But certainly this Man is under an ill Fate; he is not more unſucceſsful in his Adventures, than unfortunate in writing their <hi>Commentaries;</hi> he plays Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with his own good Name, in that which he calls his <hi>Vindication,</hi> and waſhes, and lathers, and ſcrubs himſelf ſo long to no purpoſe, that he is ſuch a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the <hi>Labour in Vain,</hi> that no Suburb Sign can match him.</p>
            <p>He begins with a precarious Aſſertion of the Innocence of the former part of his Life, thinking no doubt, that being an Old Man, and having been a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, he might have the Liberty which the Proverb allows him; and hoping probably thereby to bury the Remembrance of his Pranks at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> (and I queſtion not but that, as well as he loves Money, he would be glad to be at the Charge of Five Pound to have it done in Linen) but the miſchief of it is, there are ſeveral Merchants living, who were Witneſſes of his Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there, that can teſtifie his firſt Paragraph to be falſe. Indeed he ſpeaks with a great deal of Diffidence of himſelf, and rather like one that deſires, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a thing to be true; however ſlily he carried himſelf in his <hi>Private Station,</hi> and whatever there may be between God and his own Conſcience, yet he tells us, that he did not deſerve (as he <hi>reaſonably hopes)</hi> any Reproach from Man. But to ſee how credulous Intereſt will make Men! How could he <hi>reaſonably hope,</hi> that none of his Contemporary Merchants at that Staple, ſhould tell his Famous Hiſtory, and diſplay him in his Colors at their Return into <hi>England?</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100217:3"/>
How could he <hi>reaſonably hope</hi> to ſurvive all thoſe who are able to juſtifie to his Face the Truth of what they had related, when he ſhould have the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to deny it? How could he <hi>reaſonably hope,</hi> that Factious and Turbulent Practices ſhould not deſerve to be puniſh'd at leaſt with <hi>Reproach</hi> and <hi>Infamy?</hi> How could he <hi>reaſonably hope—</hi> But that I may encourage Modeſty, eſpecially in ſuch a one as He, for the ſake of that bluſhing Parentheſis, I will ſpare him at preſent; till he give me further occaſion to deal more roughly with him.</p>
            <p>From his private Station, which I cannot allow to extend any farther than to his Continuance at <hi>Hamburgh:</hi> For after his Return into <hi>England,</hi> he himſelf acknowledges, that he did embrace Civil Offices; and 'tis well known, that he was always edging himſelf in to make one in all the late ſhiftings of the Scene, and the Continuator of <hi>Bakers Chronicle</hi> atteſts him to have been nominated one of the <hi>Councellors of State,</hi> who were to abjure the Family of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> and all Kingly Government; but theſe things it was his Intereſt to diſſemble and conceal; and therefore I ſay, from his <hi>Private Station,</hi> as he calls it, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately paſſes to the time of his being choſen a Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex;</hi> and becauſe I reſolve to keep up cloſe with him, I muſt e'en take the ſame Leap too.</p>
            <p>He tells us he was call'd forth by his Fellow Citizens to a Publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (meaning the Shrievalty) <hi>contrary to his Inclinations and Humor,</hi> which indeed is both true and falſe: 'Tis very true it was <hi>contrary to his Inclination and Humor,</hi> to be at the Charge and Expence which uſually attends the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that Office, as the Event has ſufficiently ſhewn; but that it was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Inclination and Humor</hi> to have in his Hands the Power of doing Miſchief, which accompanies it, is as falſe: For otherwiſe, why ſhould he take the Sacrament, according to the Rites of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Oath of Allegiance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (about which he and his Conſcience were not agreed for Twenty Years before) merely to qualifie himſelf for that Employment, when 'tis probable the Court of Aldermen would rather have given him Money to be rid of him, than inſiſted upon any high Fine to excuſe him.</p>
            <p>Well, Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> is Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and would have been a Burgeſs of <hi>Southwark:</hi> And what then? Why then he falls a complaining moſt bitterly of his hard Fate, that he can no ſooner leave his <hi>Private Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſtand in Competition for Places of great Honor and Truſt, but preſently men enquire whether he be fit to be truſted? and ſearch into the Hiſtory of his Life, and ſlander him with all the matter of Truth that they can col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. And is it not a moſt ſad and deplorable Caſe, that a man of his Bulk and Character, who comes and ſays upon his Word, that he is as honeſt, and wiſe, and every way as fit to be our Repreſentative as any man we can chuſe, ſhould be ſo contemptuouſly repulſed and baulked as he was by a company of inquiſitive and unconfiding Burghers?</p>
            <p>And now that by chance I have mention'd Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> and Honeſty, and Wiſdom in one Paragraph, I cannot but take notice of the extraordinary Caſt he gives us of both, in his aſſuming the Honor of being one of our Repreſentatives, and making one great reaſon of Writing this Vindication of his to be, That thoſe of the <hi>Neighbouring Borough may not be thought to have been miſtaken and deceived in the Perſon whom they preferred to a place of ſo great Truſt,</hi> p. 2. Was it <hi>honeſt</hi> in him to inſinuate to the World, That he had been choſen a Burgeſs for <hi>Southwark,</hi> when he was excluded by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Majority, and thoſe more conſiderable for their Quality than Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? It being highly probable, that the miſled men who crowded for him, might as eaſily have been perſuaded to give their Votes for <hi>John Doe</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100217:4"/>
               <hi>Richard Roe.</hi> And was it <hi>wiſe</hi> for him to tell us in Print, that we had elected him, when we knew we had not? No, No, Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> ſuch Tricks will not do with us. We that oppoſed you, are ſatisfied, that we were not (as you ſay well) <hi>miſtaken and deceived</hi> in you; and Multitudes of thoſe, who through a Blind Zeal appear'd for you, are now enlightened and convinced that they were miſtaken: So that I would adviſe you, as a Friend, that, if when His Majeſty ſhall be pleas'd to Summon another Parliament, you find the ſame hankering after a Memberſhip continue upon you, you would apply your ſelf to ſome other Borough, where you are leſs known than here.</p>
            <p>Having acquainted us, to our Amazement, that he was our Burgeſs, he proceeds next (with a Conſiſtency peculiar to himſelf) to let the World know the Obſtacles which hindred him from being ſo. He ſays, That to diſable him from holding any Place of ſo great Truſt, <hi>It was objected that he was a Papiſt and a Jeſuit; and that upon ſome Variance happening between him and Dr.</hi> Oates, <hi>he did declare, that he knew him beyond the Seas to be ſuch; that he was a Souldier in the Parliament's Army, in the time of the late Wars, and was moſt cruel and unmerciful in the Exerciſe of Arms; that being at</hi> Hamburgh <hi>at ſuch time as the Late King's Death was reſolved on in</hi> England, <hi>he did there ſay, That rather than he ſhould want an</hi> Executioner, <hi>he would come thence to perform the Office; and that he was not only one of the Late Kings Judges, but one of thoſe two perſons in Vizzards, that aſſiſted on the Scaffold at his Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To each of theſe Articles he ſays ſomething, which he hoped, no doubt, would look like an Anſwer; but the whole amounts only to this, that he ſtifly denies 'em all.</p>
            <p>But if none of theſe things were true, how comes it to paſs, that after he had boaſted under <hi>Article</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 3. That he has brought his Action at Law for the Vindication of himſelf in that point, he ſhould yet drop that Action with two more of the ſame Nature; and that the Proſpect of 30000l. (for ſo much he laid his Damage) ſhould not be ſufficient to encourage him to be at the common charge of the Law to go on with them? Whence ſhould ariſe ſo much Smoak if there were no Fire? How did it chance that the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors had not the like Brands of Infamy faſtened upon them? Whence did it proceed that all the Dirt of the City and Town ſhould be thrown into his Cart? Certainly he is one of the moſt unfortunate Men that ever left <hi>Private Station,</hi> if he be innocent.</p>
            <p>That he is Innocent, we have only his own Word, and how far that ought to weigh, we may judge from what follows in his next Paragraph, concerning a Paper, Publiſhed ſoon after the Election, entituled, <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> &amp;c. (which by the way I obſerve lies very heavy upon his Stomack) out of which Scandalous Libel, as he calls it, he unluckily ſelects that Paſſage between him and Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> one of the King's Watermen, who, when Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>pull his Coat over his Ears,</hi> replied, <hi>Ay Sir, ſo perhaps you would my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's too, if it were in your Power.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> declares to be moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe, and without any Color or Ground of Truth, <hi>p.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>There lying now ſo much Streſs upon Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi>'s Veracity, we will bring the Caſe to a ſhort Iſſue: If no ſuch words paſſed at the time and place of the Poll between thoſe two Gentlemen, then I will take Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi>'s bare Denial of the foregoing Articles, to be a juſt Vindication. But to ſee how Time will bring things to light! It happen'd, that on <hi>Wedneſday, June</hi> the <hi>29th.</hi> 1681. a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seſſions of the Peace being then holden for the Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> at the <hi>Bridge-houſe-hall,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100217:4"/>
               <hi>Bethel</hi> being there preſent, an Indictment was exhibited againſt him upon the occaſion of theſe words, together with the foul Battery that accompanied them; and the Battery and Words were proved by the Oaths of four ſubſtantial Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and the Bill accordingly found by the Grand Jury. Now I leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge, whether he that will Print a Lye, to wipe off a ſmart <hi>Repartee,</hi> is likely to boggle at ſaying, or un-ſaying any thing to bring himſelf off in Matters of ſo heynous a Nature as the Articles contain.</p>
            <p>Having hitherto put on as good and as bold a Face as the former matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, he next proceeds to ſome Exceptions of a leſs dangerous Nature, that have been made againſt him; and expreſſing a wonderful Glee, that the Laws of the Land do not make Covetouſneſs a Capital Crime, he becomes now uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and cares not much if it be admitted to be wholly true, that he is an Inmate, a Garreteer, and all that: For he hopes this will be no good Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Caſe of a Burgeſs to ſerve in Parliament; telling us it is a <hi>Maxim, That thoſe that are moſt ſaving of their own Eſtates, will be moſt careful of the Peoples;</hi> thereby unhandſomly inſinuating, that a Parliament-Man is only a kind of <hi>Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> for ſecuring the Peoples Money, whatever juſt occaſion there may be to part with it: But pray Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> come no more among us with your ſordid <hi>Maxims,</hi> 'tis well known, that we have better <hi>Maxims</hi> of our own; and you may ſee by all the Papers we have Publiſhed ſince you gave us the laſt Trouble, that this <hi>Maxim</hi> is like to do you but little Service with us. In <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> you will find, that one part of the Character which recommended thoſe Gentlemen to our Choice, was, <hi>That they were Liberal Benefactors to the Poor of our Borough.</hi> In our Addreſs to them at their ſetting forth towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> we declare it our Opinion, <hi>That it is highly reaſonable that we ſhould help to defray the Charge, as well as enjoy the Benefit of His Majeſties Gracious Government and Protection;</hi> and in our Addreſs to His Majeſty, upon the Occaſion of his late Declaration, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſſure His Majeſty, <hi>That whenever His Majeſty in his Princely Wiſdom and Providence, ſhall ſee fit to call another Parliament, we will take all poſſible care to chuſe ſuch Repreſentatives as ſhall be ready to preſent His Majeſty with ſuch Supplies as the Dignity of the Crown, and the Neceſſities of the Government ſhall require.</hi> By this Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> you may judge, that your Temper and ours do not at all agree, and you may reſt ſatisfied, that the Borough of <hi>Southwark</hi> will never be guilty of ſo great a Blunder, as to ſend to the Parliament ſuch a Miſ-repreſentative as your ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Subject of the following part of his <hi>Pamphlet</hi> is very pleaſant and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and with (or indeed without) Mr. Sheriff's Leave, that the Reader may know what Entertainment he is to expect, I ſhall give him the following Bill of Fare. 1. Here is the Grandeur of living in a Garret. 2. The Hoſpitality of keeping no Houſe; and, 3. The Charity of Starving Poor Pris'ners. But you will ſay, theſe are all empty Diſhes: Why truly if they be, I cannot help it, they are ſuch as Mr. Sheriff's Table and Book afford.</p>
            <p>For unleſs you will allow Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> the Titles of Great, and Hoſpitable, and Charitable, in ſpite of that Contradiction which his Actions give to them all, there is nothing which he ſays for himſelf, that can give him any ſhadow or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Right to either.</p>
            <p>Indeed, to vindicate his Honor from the Diſparagement of living in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, he ſays, That to avoid the Trouble and Inconveniency, which commonly attends the Shifting of Lodgings, he took the Houſe he now lives in; but ſuch a Houſe it is, as is rarely to be ſeen in the City of <hi>London:</hi> For this Houſe has neither Garrets nor Cellars, nor Rooms on the firſt Floor; ſo that either he muſt acknowledge himſelf to have taken only ſome Rooms of an Houſe, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100217:5"/>
conſequently to be an Inmate, or elſe he muſt be ſuppos'd to live in a <hi>Wird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill;</hi> for there is no other ſort of Houſe that I can think of, which anſwers that Deſcription.</p>
            <p>He goes on to tell us what I would not for a World ſhould be omitted by the Writer of his Life; That at the Beginning of his Year, he kept two Feaſts, of Famous Memory, to his great Charge: Nay, that he had agreed for a fair large Inn (much better, and more capacious than the <hi>other Houſe)</hi> and had reſolv'd to keep a plentiful Ordinary, and for one Year round, to live as merry as mine Hoſt; but, as he ſays, it fell out unluckily to this purpoſe, that the Ancient, Wiſe, Prudent, Sumptuary Laws of the City, lighting hard upon his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a Repulſe received from the Court of Aldermen, ſticking faſt in his Gizzard; theſe two Accidents gave ſuch a Check to his Natural Complacency, that he preſently un-reſolved all again, and has not been in an Entertaining Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor ever ſince.</p>
            <p>As for the former of theſe Accidents, I ſhall only make this Remark upon it, That of all Laws, Mr. Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi> has moſt diligently enquired into, and moſt religiouſly obſerv'd the Sumptuary Laws, they being (as he obſerves) <hi>moſt wholeſome</hi> for the Pocket: Though I cannot imagine thoſe Laws do forbid any Perſon to exceed a Nine-penny Dinner ſo ſtrictly, as not to allow him the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an <hi>Orange</hi> with his Plate of Veal; and yet this is a Law which a Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Citizen (who to avoid the ungrateful Repetition of the ſame word too often, ſhall be nameleſs) has for a certain enacted to himſelf.</p>
            <p>For the latter, I have obliged my ſelf to give an acount of it, ſo far as the Ward which return'd him is concern'd, and it is briefly thus: The Alderman of the Ward of <hi>Farindon Without,</hi> dying, the Principal Inhabitants, upon Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with one another, found themſelves divided in their Opinions, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Superiority of Merit between Sir <hi>Richard How</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pilkinton,</hi> and yet reſolv'd, if poſſible, to have one of them. Of this indeed they might have been certain, if they had return'd them two; but it is to be conſidered, that then there had been no Tryal of Skill between their two Parties; and alſo that being both worthy Men, either of them which ſhould be aſſign'd to that Office, would have ſeem'd to be the Court of Aldermen's Choice, rather than theirs: Hereupon, to leave as little ſcope as might be to the Court of Aldermen, for the exerciſe of their Prerogative, both parties conſented to return Mr. Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi> for one, as knowing him to be a perſon ſo un-acceptable to that Court, that they might be ſure of him of the other two, to whom it ſhould fall by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of their own Votes. So that that Gentleman who loſt it at the Poll, had more reſpect ſhewn him by the Ward, than he who carried it without a Poll; and they unanimouſly agreed to chuſe Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> becauſe they knew they were in no Danger of being troubled with him. And now Sir, much Joy to you of the Honor of that <hi>General Conſent,</hi> and the <hi>concurrent Votes</hi> which you ſo highly boaſt of.</p>
            <p>Now, becauſe the Court of Aldermen had diſcovered a Diſlike of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he therefore reſolves and declaims againſt Houſe-keeping; and groundleſly miſplacing his Anger, falls foul upon the Innocent; and without any Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Earth, does vent ſuch undeſerved Reproaches, and bitter Invectives againſt all the Diſhes of a Generous Sheriff's Table, even from Roſt-Beef to Cuſtard, that certainly it is his Intereſt to diſſuade all men from reading his Book till they have Dined: For no Hungry Stomach can with Patience bear, to have its good Friends and Allies ſo vilely abuſed.</p>
            <p>He ſays, that nothing can be leſs Honourable to the Sheriffs than Feaſting of the Companies, that good Eating is a great Expence of time, and a plentiful
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100217:5"/>
an Enemy to that <hi>ſober Induſtry which is the riſe and glory of a Trading City;</hi> as if a ſober induſtrious Trader, who intended to thrive and grow wealthy, were obliged now and then to ſatisfie himſelf with the refreſhment of ſucking a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and be glad to take up with the ſmell of a Cooks ſhop inſtead of a Meal. Beef and Mutton defend us! ſay I: If this man were Manciple, he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of a Week ſo effectually promote his Landlords Trade, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to ſit Rent-free; for within that time our Bellies would dwindle and grow ſo lank, that happy were he who could get a Taylor to adjuſt the Waſt-band of his Breeches.</p>
            <p>Being deſtitute of any farther Arguments to put a colour upon his ſordid way of living in ſo publick an Employment, he falls to his Prayers to God, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Sins, <hi>Fulneſs of Bread, which was charged upon</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>as one Cauſe of Gods Judgments, may not grow to that height in this City, as to become the Ruin and Deſtruction of it.</hi> I do not love to jeſt in Serious Matters, and ſhall therefore only take notice, that there are certain Citizens under his Cuſtody, who, through his Neglect, are able truly to plead Not Guilty to that Charge. Had Mr. Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi> fed the Poor, inſtead of Feaſting the Rich; had he ſupply'd the Defect of Splendid Entertainments by an extraordinary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards his Priſoners, he might have had a fairer Plea: But he himſelf, without bluſhing, grants it to be true, that he does not contribute to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their Neceſſities, and has ſo utterly renounc'd all Modeſty, as boldly to undertake to prove it his Duty to be unmerciful. For mark you me, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Stop to the uſual Payments; If any Priſoners be famiſh'd this Year, the Court of Aldermen, and a Committee of the City will take care to prevent the like Miſchief againſt the next: And my holding of my Hand, ſays he, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with others to open theirs, and encourage them to Chrritable Benevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Legacies, for the Maintenance of thoſe wretched People. <hi>Heavens,</hi> what Arguments are theſe! But ſuch a man can never be defended but by ſuch <hi>Logic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now trouble the Reader no further, after I have told him that I am a Perſon not at all delighted in enquiring after, or expoſing and publiſhing the Vices or Follies of any man; and, as probably I had never known that he has been reported to be a Jeſuite, one of the late Kings Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſs he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had told me; ſo the World had never known for me, that his carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own Company of <hi>Leather-Sellers</hi> has been ſuch, that they have thought fit, contrary to their uſual Method of Proceeding, to wave his <hi>Merit of Congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in their late Election of a Maſter, notwithſtanding that he is preſent Sheriff of <hi>London:</hi> That a Perſon who might have eſcap'd a troubleſome, and (to any but himſelf) a Chargeable Office, by ſwearing that he was not worth 10000 <hi>l.</hi> ſhould yet (to come off for a Shilling, at the time of the laſt <hi>Poll-Tax)</hi> give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Maid-Servant, to acquaint the Officers, that he was a <hi>Decayed Merchant;</hi> That when he knew the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Sermons were to be at S. <hi>Sepulchres,</hi> he ſhould yet perverſly make a Ridiculous Cavalcade to the <hi>Spittle</hi> by himſelf, like the Pied Piper of <hi>Halberſtadt</hi> drawing all the Boys and Girls in the Town after him. Theſe things, I ſay, with all which has gone before, I ſhould not have concern'd my ſelf to Publiſh, had he not provoked me to enquire concerning him, and by lewdly applying a Text of Scripture to himſelf, with a ſeeming, mighty Confidence of his own Innocence, challeng'd all the World <hi>to Come down and ſee.</hi>
