            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="3">3. And the third for our Sauiours <note place="margin">3</note> blessed comming to iudgment.

blame, or checke. And because these three watches must be managed and effected in our life and health time, and not in the houre of death, or vpon the day of iudgement. I will dilate of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them in order, but first intreate of some points in generall, which doe alike concerne these three sorts of watching, then descend to discuse of the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:3333:24"/>
My doctrine then is this. <hi>It is a most</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, it is most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to watch.</note> 
               <hi>necessarie worke for all men liuing, to watch ouer their liues,</hi> during their aboade heere; as also for the time of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration hence, and for their cheerefull and ioyfull appearing in iudgment, my proofes be these.</p>
            <p>First, because (as I shewed the second <note place="margin">Proofes of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine by Scripture and by reasons.</note> in the exordium and enterance to this Sermon) these three points were the chiefest things which euery one ought to be most carefull of as long as they liue; and wherein standeth the glory of God: so much as of man ought to be sought for in this life: And therefore are most needfull.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God commandeth vs in diuers places to watch, and pray, for these three ends, as heare <hi>Matth. 2. 4. 4. 2. Luke</hi> 12 36. &amp; 21. 36. &amp; 22 40. 46. &amp; 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. &amp; 5. 8. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 18. &amp; 1. <hi>Thess. 5. 6. 10. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now euery commandement of God binds the conscience perpetually to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute obedience, for God that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, is our great Lawgiuer: who is able to <hi>saue and destroy. Iam.</hi> 4. 12. To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that Gods will is the only rule of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3333:25"/>
euery mans will, vnlesse he be a professed rebell, then God in the very creation of Man and Angels: put this bridle in the mouth of all reasonable creatures, that no man without extreame and manifest impudencie, durst gainsay, but humbly and speedily obay, any thing if it were apparantly knowne to be commanded by God; but this is knowne so to be, and therefore must be obayed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is not a more effectuall doctrine to rouse the sluggard, then to heare the drumme of death, and Gods iudgement sounding in his secure soule and eares.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Watchfulnes is profitable to stirre vs vp to serue God sincerely without Hypocrisie.</p>

he <hi>spake to all, Luke</hi> 12. 41. So likewise heere it is like they looked for a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, but our Sauiour preuents them, saying. <hi>Those things that I say vnto you, I say vnto all, watch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore beloued let vs all as one man buckle our selues to this weighty worke: and know that all men must die, and come to iudgement; and therefore happy is he that is best prepared for it, this is a more precious worke, then to purchase lands, or buy oxen, yea then to <hi>dine Christ</hi> himselfe, or flee to <hi>Tharsus,</hi> as <hi>Ionah</hi> from the face of the Lord. O Lord open we beseech thee, our drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie eies, that we sleepe not in death, least the enemie say I haue preuailed against him; or where is now thy God: and thus farre as now of the necessity of this Text, and of watchfulnes.</p>
            <p>The next point is to seeke out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this <hi>watchword,</hi> which I suppose <note place="margin">The sense of this word watch.</note> is more euidently apparant (as colours of contrarie die or hue) by the contrary sense or speech. Now the contrary tearme to <hi>watchfulnes</hi> is to be sleepy, carelesse or secure, how matters fare or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3333:27"/>
fall, well or ill. Therefore in saying watch, our Sauiour meaneth sleepe not, as we read in <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 35. 36. <hi>Watch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c. least he find you sleeping.</hi> And in 1. Thess. 5. 6. <hi>Let vs not sleepe but watch and be sober.</hi> Now whereas there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall sleepe, a deadly sleepe, or sleepe in death, and a spirituall sleepe, heere the spirituall sleepe is only ment, which is a kind of dulnes of spirit, a satiety and vnaptnes to any godly exercise, as drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in prosperity, or carnall contents and besotted in sinne, whereby he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all feeling in heauenly things, as if he were in a naturall sleepe, or sicke of a lethargie, whereof men die sleeping, or without feeling, and this sleepe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ Iesus impliedly vnder this word <hi>watch,</hi> as being the <hi>Antithesis</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, commandeth vs to a voyd as the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest enemie to watchfulnes, whereof I raise this doctrine.</p>

               <hi>Seeing the whole lifo of a Christian is a continuall warfare full of labour and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>

               <hi>and we enuironed on euery side with many and mightie, fierce and malitious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we must while we liue in these earthy Taber nacles and tents (as souldtours in the field and pilgrimes in the world) in all care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, pietie, and sobrietie, constantly watch ouer euery periode of our liues and all our actions,</hi> that so wee may passe our daies religiously and holily according to Gods reuealed will during our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall liues.</p>
            <p>This proposition is thus prooued.

            </p>
            <p>Reasons enforce the doctrine: as first <note place="margin">By reasons</note> God commands vs to watch; which he would not, were it not behoouefull and needfull for vs. Secondly, the imminent dangers we stand in, perswade thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as the corruption of our nature: prone to sinne and to all mischiefe; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans manifold assaults and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; certaine vncertaine death; Gods wrath and vnsupportable iudgements; the baits and allurements of this life; as with so many cartropes pulling vs to sinne, and damnation, crosses, and death in euery creature we vse; and vnder eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry stone lurketh a Scorpion ready to sting vs to death, if wee bee not vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3333:32"/>
and constant in prayer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the benefites redounding to vs hereof, should set vs forward to this dutie, as namely: first, we shall liue righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously and glorifie God in all our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: <note place="margin">1.</note> secondly, we shall be as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate <note place="margin">2.</note> harnesse appointed, against Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, the world, sinne, and our owne concupiscences: thirdly, be helpfull to <note place="margin">3.</note> men: fourthly, hurtfull to none: fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Blessed of God in this life: sixthly, <note place="margin">4.</note> most happie in the life to come, &amp;c. <note place="margin">5.</note> which the Lord of glory grant vs all to doe.</p>
            <p>The first vse we are to make of this <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how weare to watch.</note> sad doctrine serues to instruct vs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are not to watch, and wherein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Sauiours will we must watch; where we are to vnderstand that our Sauiours minde, is not in watching we should forbeare naturall sleep, which is as needfull and profitable for vs as is our food: vnlesse it be for some part of the night, that we awake to God, and in that silent and solitarie time giue our selues to prayer. So <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God in his <hi>bedde and thought
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3333:32"/>
vpon him when he was waking,</hi> Psal. 63. 1. 7. <hi>At midnight rose vp to giue God thankes.</hi> Psal. 119. 62. <hi>And euery night washed his bedde and watered his couch with teares.</hi> Psal. 6. 6. and good reason had he so to doe. For this was the most conuenient time to speake without interruption, and talke at large and most familiarly with his God, which worke in truth, was to be preferred before any sleepe, Then in the day time. He was so taken vp with the affaires of the kingdome, that he often had no time to call vpon God in priuate, and therefore would rise at midnight, to pray &amp; praise the Lord. So our Sauiour, when for the presse of the people, and his indefatigable labour in preaching, and teaching the people, and working of miracles, he could not talke with his God in prayer, He would goe out to the mount to pray, and spend the whole night therein. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 12. and 21. 37. And so shou'd we doe, for the night is the fittest time for this holy worke, for then may wee haue elbow roome inough, without any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of wife, children, family or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3333:33"/>
friends, nor yet of secular affaires, to examine our hearts, if Christ called vs at <hi>midnight</hi> to iudgement, or at <hi>cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowing,</hi> or <hi>in the dawning,</hi> Mark. 13. 35. we might euery way be ready prepared and waking, yea walking with our God; and also to powre out our hearts to our good and mercifull God in prayer, and be heard. And yet this is no warrant for swinish wretches, who if they pray at all, neuer pray but in their beds, and that so drunken, drowsiely, and sleepingly, that in the middest of their lip-labour deuotion they fall asleepe, and withall ioy and comfort themselues, yea bragge it out, that they euer fall asleepe in a good worke, that is, as if they said they were ouertaken with sleepe, in abusing Gods Maiestie with their lippe-labour prayer, taking his name in vaine, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering vnto him the sacrifice of fooles, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 5. 17. and 6. 1. But by watching, <note place="margin">When we are to watch.</note> the Lord warneth vs to be vigilant and carefull ouer our whole liues and euery part thereof, that Satan with his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties and sleights, nor yet the world <note place="margin">We must watch ouer our selues.</note> with the enticements thereof, nor sinne

But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the tythes bee Leuiticall as you would haue them, and that they figure some mysticall secret we be not worthy to know: then must you confesse (as you do) that they be abrogated, now Christ is come, and being fuifilled in him, are not to be exacted by any, nor to be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Parishioner to any man, for this were to ioyne with the Iewes, that the Messias is not yet come, which is to deny the faith, and <hi>so Christ shall profit vs nothing at all,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> prooues of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> Gal. 5. 3. And if so, why should any Minister demand tythes, much lesse any secular man, or any Parishioner pay any, seeing this is to deny plainly, that Christ is come, but while we pay tythes, we looke for another, else by paying Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall tythes, you hold all the rectors and parsons appropriate, and also all the

            </p>
            <p>The first vse serues for instruction for my vigilant Christian, how hee is to watch generall and speciall for death: The first generall care whereof is, in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">1</note> a godly life, and then shall hee be sure of a godly and blessed death; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, hath three degrees, one in this life, when a man leades a new sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified heauenly life, and can say truely <hi>that now hee liues not, but Christ liueth in him, Galath.</hi> 2. 20. and this all such can <note place="margin">Obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to die well.</note> say as doe vnfainedly repent, beleeue, and obey, iustified from, and sanctified against their sinnes, and haue the peace of Conscience, with other good gifts &amp; graces of the holy spirit, which are <hi>the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3333:82"/>
earnest penny of their saluation;</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree is in the end of this life at our death, when the body goeth to the earth, and soule to God; the third at the last iudgement, when body and soule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnited doe ioyntly enter into eternall blisse, and of this first watch, I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the first part before.</p>
            <p>Then secondly we must watch and be <note place="margin">2.</note> in readinesse for the second degree of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, euen for death; <hi>for man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the house of his age,</hi> as <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 5. that is, towards his graue, and therefore must prepare for it, and labour to pluck out of our hearts that erroneous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, wherewith euery man natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blesseth himselfe, thinking so highly of himselfe, that though hee had one foot in the graue, yet beleeues hee shall not yet die: and what a folly is it for man to stumble thus at the threshold, ere they be aware of the house, many charge, and chide, olde age to come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them vnexpected, but who compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them thus falsly to conclude? So if any complaine of Deaths vnlooked-for approach, wee may answer, Who bade
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3333:82"/>
them bee so foolish, as not to looke for him? Cruell and vnmercifull Death makes league with no man, though (as <hi>Isai</hi> saith, chap. 28. 15. 18.) <hi>The wicked make a league with Death,</hi> that is, in the fond imagination, thinking that Death will not come neere them, though all the world should be destroyed; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this naturall corruption is in euery mans heart, we must daily fight against it, and expell it out; for so long as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes, we shall be vtterly vnfit to make any preparation for death, but will bee like the foolish debtor, that keepes no account of his debt, and then maruells how the Creditor should remember to demand it: thou hast owed this debt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since thou wast borne, and before thou wast borne, and is it strange, that now, after some yeares past, thou art called vpon for it? what if the day of payment be not expressed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpane, that which is presently, and at all times due, must continually be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we must labour to meditate often and seriously of our death, and of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3333:83"/>
the state of the dead whereunto wee all hasten; for rich &amp; poore shall lie down alike in the dust, and the wormes shall couer them, saith <hi>Iob.</hi> chap. 21. 23. to 26. but because our selfe-loue and world i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is so great, that wee account no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so bitter and vntoothsome, as the meditations of our departure, as <hi>Ecclus. 41. 1. O death, how bitter is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thee to a man that liueth at rest in his possessions, vnto the man that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to vexe him, and that hath prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in all things, yea vnto him that is able to receiue meate:</hi> and therfore let vs streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then this practice with prayer, as did <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Moses, Psal.</hi> 39. 4. and 90. 12. so wee may bee inabled to resolue our selues of death continually, for how soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by a generall speculation wee thinke sometimes something of our ends, yet vnlesse the spirit of God be our School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master to teach vs this duty, wee shall bee neuer able soundly to resolue our selues of the presence and the speedines of death, for hee alone must lighten our mindes with knowledge, and fill our hearts with his grace, that wee may
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3333:83"/>
rightly consider hereof, and so esteeme of euery day and houre, as if it were the very day and houre of our death. So the dangers foreseene will be lesse gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and we shall more easily contemn this world, with the vanities thereof, and keepe our selues in good fashion, (according to the Prouerbe, <hi>Remember the end, and thou shalt neuer doe amisse, Ecclus.</hi> 7. 36.) and approoue right Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: for (as saith <hi>Gregorie) The life of a Christian is nothing else but a continuall meditation of Death;</hi> and as a watchman euer thinketh and looketh for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies comming, and therefore will not sleepe; so must wee often meditate of death, and make account that euery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent day shal be our dying day, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night our bed to be our graue: and so for that remnant of time wee haue to liue euer walke in the feare of God, and so hee shall neuer need to feare Death, who by a godly life hath giuen due en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to the feare of God.</p>
            <p>We must not onely be euery day wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">4.</note> to die, but bee ready with oyle in our Lamps, esteeming euery day the last
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3333:84"/>
day of our liues; which that wee may the more cheerefully doe, we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour before death come, to pull out the stings of death, that is, the power &amp; strength thereof, by true repentance and faith in Christ Iesus. <hi>Sampson</hi> was soone vanquished when the Philistines found where his great strength lay; and thou mayest put safely a serpent in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, if thou pull out his sting, so take sinne away which is the sting of Death, then may Death (as a Bee without a sting) hum and buzze about thine eares, but not harme thee: wherefore if wee would liue when we are dead, wee must die to sinne, and to the world and flesh while we are aliue, and not omit these duties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To humble our selues for all our <note place="margin">Duties. 1.</note> sinnes past, confessing them wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our selues, and in prayer crying instantly to God for pardon of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the time to come, to turne to <note place="margin">2.</note> God, and to carry a purpose, resolution, and endeuour in all things to reforme both heart and life, according to Gods word.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:3333:84"/>
3. We must euer beleeue in Christ, by whom the sting of death is taken out, for they onely feare Death, who feare and doubt whether Christ died for them; if then Death hath bin slaine by Christ Iesus, then now to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is no death, but a sleepe, a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a passing from the world, and a going vp to God, a disioyning of the soule from the body, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 22. 23. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 3. and a consecration (as if wee said) it is a solemne ceremony by which the faithful are wholly consecrated and dedicated vnto God, to the end that hereafter they should render vnto him, no other sacrifice, nor exercise, but to sing and set forth the prayses of God, &amp; to sanctifie his holy name, and so it is called Baptisme also; for that by Death we passe (as Israell through the red Sea and Iordan) to the Holy Land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: for the thing that maketh vs most feare death, is, that we behold it in the myrrour of the Law, which sets it forth vnto vs vnder a shape, and shew that is very fearefull to looke vnto, and vnder the forme of a Sergeant, armed with the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3333:85"/>
anger and wrath of God, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and guarded with all the threats and curses of the Law, against all those that violate &amp; transgresse the same, who commeth violently and implacably to serue his writ to arest vs, to appeare before Gods high Tribunall, (all excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses set apart) and to receiue the sentence of damnation to hel fire eternally, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ease or release, baile or maine-prize; which dealing of Death is so terrible to the flesh and soule of a sinner, that the very remembrance of it is exceeding bitter to a man that is sowsed and soaked in the pleasures of this world; for it now flattereth none, regardeth no persons, weigheth not friendship, careth not for rewards to looke vnto, but in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very grimme, ougly, and cruell, and killeth downe-right without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy where it hitteth, and who can abide his comming. Now to free vs from this sight, fright, and feare, we are to behold Death in the myrrour of the Gospell, stinglesse, disarmed, and conquered by Christ, and so swallowed vp in victory for vs his Beloued and Elect.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:3333:85"/>
5. Seeing then that the sting of death is sinne, and that the power and force of euery mans particular death and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lieth in his owne sinnes, wee must heerein be exceeding watchful to spend our time and study in vsing all good meanes, that our sinnes may be remoued and pardoned; for see how many sinnes be in thee, so many stings of sinne be in thee also, which wound thy soule to death: therefore let not one sin remain, for which thou hast not humbled thy selfe, and repented seriously: and if we will liue eternally, let vs begin to liue that eterna'l life before wee die, which is the first degree of eternity. Let vs now rise to a new life, by the first resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we may haue part in the latter, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20. 6. and now labour for sauing knowledge, that we need not be Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized on our death-bed. Now labour we for true peace of conscience, that we be not to agree with our aduersary when we are arested, and when it is too late, we hauing nothing to pay, yet we see to our sorrow, that of all businesse this is least respected, much care is for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3333:86"/>
the body, little for the tenant the soule, and least for the Landlord <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> But such as hasten not their worke, shew they looke not for their Master, and they that take no care of paying their rent, shew they despise their Landlord, to their own losse, hurt, and confusion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Study, and exercise daily the Art <note place="margin">6.</note> of dying, most men lay how to liue in the world, but a Christians care should be how to die well out of this world, and that master-care carrieth about all the inferiour and subordinate cares and affaires of this life: therefore let vs invre and accustome our selues daily, by little and little to die before death come; for hee that leaues the world before the world leaues him, reacheth the hand to death, as to a welcome messenger, and with <hi>Simeon</hi> departs in wished peace: and as men that are appointed to runne a race, exercise themselues before in running, that they may get the victory, so should we begin to die now while we are liuing, that we might die well in the end; so <hi>Paul, 1. Cor.</hi> 15. 31. said, <hi>that hee
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3333:86"/>
died daily,</hi> not so much for that hee was daily in danger of death, by reason of his calling, but for that in all his dangers and troubles hee inured and exercised himselfe to die; for when men do make the right vse of their afflictions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to beare them patiently, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themselues as vnder the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, then they begin to die well: and to doe this indeed, is to take an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent course. He that would mortifie his greatest sinnes, must begin to doe it with small sinnes, which when they are once reformed, a man shall be able more easily to ouercome his miseries; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he that would beare the crosse of all crosses, namely death it selfe, must first of all learne to beare small crosses, as sickenesse, troubles, losses, which may fitly be tearmed little deaths, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of death it selfe, and wee must first of all acquaint our selues with these little deaths, before wee can be able to beare the greatest death of all. Against the afflictions and calamities of this life, are as it were the Harbingers and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyors of Death, and we must first learn
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3333:87"/>
how to entertaine these messengers, that when the Master shall come, wee may in better manner welcome and cheere him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As many as bee able to doe any <note place="margin">7.</note> good seruice, eyther for Gods glory or his Church, or Common-wealth, or to any priuate man or woman, because his departure hence is vncertaine, and the night of his day draweth on, hee must hasten with all speed to doe it, lest death preuent him, and it be laid to his charge, so that hee loose his reward, for this point note, <hi>Eccles. 9. 10. Iohn 9. 4. Galat.</hi> 6. 10. And hee that hath care to spend his daies in well-doing, shall with much comfort &amp; peace of conscience end his life, for he that labours for the good of others, shall be beloued while he is here, and lamented when he is gone; but such as onely make worke for themselues, as hogs at the trough, both liue without being desired, nor beloued, and dying are neuer missed, nor lamented. Let vs then doe all to Gods glory and mens good, and thus farre of our generall watch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:3333:87"/>
Next followes our particular vvatch for death, as thus.</p>
            <p>So soone as wee feele sickenesse seize <note place="margin">The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular watch for death.</note> vpon our bodies, then is it high time to begin our particular watch and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for death: where,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wee must consider whence our <note place="margin">1</note> sickenesse commeth, euen by the speciall prouidence of God; and the cause of this affliction is our sinne, as <hi>Lam. 3. 30. Mich. 7. 9. Math. 9. 2. Iohn 5. 14. Wherfore is the liuing man sorrowfull? Man suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for his sinne, and though there be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes of our death, yet sickenesse comes ordinarily and vsually of sinne:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speedily must we make a new exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our hearts, and all our liues passed, &amp; say with Israell: <hi>Let vs search and try our wayes, and turne againe vnto the Lord, Lamen. 3. 40. and so labour to bee reconciled vnto him in Christ, though wee haue formerly beene long assured of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee must make a new confession vnto God of our new and particular sinnes, not forgetting the old, specially the sinnes of our youth, and ignorance
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3333:88"/>
before our calling: and thereto. Thirdly <note place="margin">3.</note> make new prayers, and more earnest then euer before, with vnexpressed sighes and grones of the spirit, and that for pardon of the same sinnes, and for full reconciliation with God in Christ. In the exercise of these three duties stands the renouation of our faith and repentance, whereby they are increased, quickened, and reuiued: and the more sickenesse preuailes in the body, the more should we be carefull to put them in vre, that spiritual life might encrease, as temporall life is decayed, then are we to forgiue, and desire to be forgiuen of all the world, specially of our owne Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If our paines and sickenesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage vs, wee are to set speedily our <note place="margin">4.</note> house in order, and then send for our Parish Minister, who if it may be, must not be absent from vs while breath is in our bodie, but to exhort, perswade, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, answere our doubts, pray with vs, and for vs, help vs in our feares and temptations, and (as a Bride for her Bridegroome make vs ready, attyring
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3333:88"/>

            <p n="5">5. And because no godly meanes <note place="margin">5.</note> must be omitted to preserue life till God take it away, the Physitians skill is not to be refused, obseruing this order; that where the Diuine ends there the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian must begin, and not contrarily; for let vs neuer look for health in body, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till wee haue a faithfull and sanctified soule, desiring God to blesse the meanes he vseth for vs, which we truely cannot doe vntill our Consciences perswade vs of the pardon of our sinnes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This done, let vs set our soules in <note place="margin">6.</note> order, and see how wee stand in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, and so shall wee die more voluntarily, quietly, and patiently, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3333:89"/>
let vs labour that our sinnes die in vs, before we die in the world: and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we, what an excellent thing it is for vs, to end our liues before our deaths, and in such sort, that at that houre wee haue nothing to doe but to die, and that then we haue need of nothing, no not of time, nor of our selues, &amp;c. but sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortably to depart this life.</p>

            <p n="2">2.
