            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true Relation of His Majeſties private departure from <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> the eleventh of <hi>November,</hi>
betweene foure and five of the Clock in the After-noone.</head>
            <head>As it was delivered to the Houſe of Commons this morning, Novemb. 12. by Sir <hi>Iohn Cook,</hi> and
Maſter <hi>Crew,</hi> two of the Commiſsioners. With the Houſes Reſolution thereupon.</head>

               <date>Novemb. 12. 1647.</date>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Speaker had a Letter from Gen: <hi>Cromwell</hi> late laſt night, that His Majeſty was eſcaped, but no
particulars. This morning Sir <hi>John Cooke</hi> and maſter <hi>Crew,</hi> two of the Commiſsioners, came to the
Houſe, and delivered the particulars thus: Yeſterday in the afternoone His Majeſty ſhut himſelfe up in
his Chamber, and commanded that no body ſhould come to him: when it grew dark, he called for a
Candle, and afterwards for Snuffers; he came not out to Prayers, as he was accuſtomed; which after
ſome time, bred ſome miſtruſt: Then one of the Commiſsioners knocked at his chamber doore, and no
body anſwering, went in, and found no body there, the back-doore open, and His Majeſties Cloak lay in
the midſt of the roome on the floore, which for the preſent cauſed ſome feare that ſomewhat had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
on his perſon; but looking farther, found three Letters upon the Table, written with His Majeſties
owne hand, which argued that he was well. The firſt was a kind of Declaration or Remonſtrance, which
he deſired ſhould be communicated to both his Houſes of Parliament, to this effect, <hi>That He had as much
as in Him lay, endeavoured to give His Houſes ſatisfaction, and to re-eſtabliſh a ſetled Peace; but He ſaw that
nothing reaſonable would give them content, That He had certain information that the Agitators, or ſome of that
Faction, had an intent ſpeedily to murder Him, and that Maſter</hi> Peters <hi>had lately expreſſed ſo much to an intimate
friend of his: Therefore His Majeſty was reſolved to retire to ſome private place for a time, for His owne Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Letter was to my Lord <hi>Mountague,</hi> and the reſt of the Commiſſioners to give them thanks for their civilities to him, ſince his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to Hampton-Court. The third, to Collonel <hi>Whalley</hi> of thanks likewiſe for his civilities, for he had that morning given charge to the
Guards and others to have a care of his Majeſty, having likewiſe had ſome intimation of an intended attempt that day upon his Majeſties Perſon.</p>
            <p>A fourth Letter was found upon his Majeſties Table, ſubſcribed <hi>For his Majeſty,</hi> without any name to it more then two letters. In this Letter
his Majeſty was warned of the ſaid attempt on his Perſon, and earneſtly beſeeched to retire to ſome place of privacy for a time, and Broad-ſtreet in
<hi>London</hi> was propoſed as a place of ſecurity.</p>
            <p>The Commiſsioners could make no probable conjecture as then, whether His Majeſtie ſhould be gone, That the Scotch Commiſsioners had been
there the day before, but were yeſterday come for London. Hereupon the Houſe ordered a Committee, to examine the whole buſineſſe, and the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of thoſe that guarded him, and likewiſe ordered a ſtop of all the Ports, and a ſearch to be made in London for him. Some beleeve he is gone for
Scotland; others, that part of the Army have conveyed him away: but this day at 12. of the clock there was no certainty of either, but whereſoever
he be, God bleſſe him, and preſerve him out of the hands of his Enemies. And let all good men ſay, Amen.</p>
