            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Courtiers method followes.</head>

               <p>To the second meeting our Creditor is summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and brings behinde him his wife, like to a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wicker glasse bottle hanging at his taile, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Masking roome.</p>
               <p>Whereat the Courtiers skill in deliuering of the Maskers names, vnder their seuerall disguises, did purchase an euerlasting and indissoluble citie-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinitie with his female charge, ouer whom the more sleepy hir spouse, the more vigilant was my cousen courtier.</p>

               <p>Then for the quickning, continuing, and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his credit, our Courtier pretends how he has receiued newes that his feign'd kinred is very sicke: and thereupon a takes occasion (in stead of venison) to send her a bottle of that famous and farre fetcht <hi>frontineack:</hi> He bids himselfe to dinner the same day, and there in a cursorie way of commending the excellent art of man, in matter of Manufacture, he falls by chance vpon the remembrance of an extraordinarie stuffe which hee saw a great perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage weare lately in Court, not doubting but that his cousens shop did afford the like: His purpose was to haue a suit of the same very shortly, if they would but lay it by for him till his moneyes came in: Yet with a very little intreaty so cleanly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prompted, he was perswaded to take it along with him, but onely for feare lest the whole peece might be sold by the foolish foreman vnawares before his returne.

               <p>Then he procures this knowne customer to take the man of credence (as it were) modestly apart, and at his backe while he is walking downe the shop and auersed, to whisper, That this gentleman whom you see here, is sonne and heire to that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knight so potent in the Peake, or that most markable Malster of much Marlborne: Or the great Grasier of Grymsborow, or the like.

               <p>THe country Gentleman, hee is by this time come vp to London; and has brought his Atturney with him, one that professes the taking vp of money by writ of right. His Atturnie brings him to the ship behinde the Exchange, and leaues him there while he goes to fetch the onely <hi>Noue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint</hi> in those parts, whom he prepares at his shop with the purpose, aduising him withall in his eate, so to handle the matter in hall, that beards may wag all, which he deliuered with a most familiar wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him by the hand, to insinuate his meaning as vnto his share: He then brings the Scriuener vnto the Tauerne, good compliance is in all parties,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15400:9"/>
and the Scriuener according to the true practice of the most of them, at the first meeting, especially while they are with the borrower in a Tauerne, was more easie in promising, then they in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing.</p>
               <p>The atturney then softly tels the Gentleman apart, that he should doe well to bespeake sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per instantly, assuring him that if hee could but fasten that courtesie vpon the Scriuener for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, he were their owne for euer after, neither the summe nor the securitie could be matter of any difficulty.</p>
               <p>The counsell was held wholsome as vnto the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Atturney was forthwith preferd to the barre, where hee spake so learnedly in the cause, that vpon the same hearing, they recouered three full dishes on their side, the boyes drew the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the businesse very Clarke-like, the Kitchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid supplied with a Tales. The Mistresse call'd earnestly for the Postea, and the master hee rated and allowed the bill of costs.</p>
               <p>At the execution whereof, my Scriuener fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring left the shot should disperse and scatter it selfe amongst them, while the Gentleman was fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for money to discharge it; he to facilitate that hand, askes him softly in his eare; <hi>What is the summe that hee would haue?</hi> Then suspecting the long dwelling of his hand in the pocket, he tels him, <hi>He shall haue what summe he will:</hi> Let mee see, saies the Scriuener, there comes in this night of Sir <hi>Sam van Skynkers</hi> money, fiue hundred, and to morrow
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15400:9"/>
as much more I can supply you from one hundred to ten out of that as your occasions require; how say you?</p>
               <p>We will haue no drie reckoning replies the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: Heere's the full summe of the bill and a pottle ouer; Though we be Leicester-shire fed, yet we be not Brackly bred, I assure you.</p>
               <p>And for the summe which I should (or at least would haue) for especiall occasions, Let me see: There is a horse-race at Northampton on Munday come seuenight; I must needs haue new furniture for Cropeare, which I will send downe by Leicester Waggon.</p>
               <p>I will haue that Hawke which I saw in South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke this afternoone: clothes would doe well: But thats my least care of a thousand. A poxe a pride I say.</p>
               <p>Howsoeuer I must see the party I told you of by the way, before I goe out of towne, by any meanes if shee keepe the same lodging and the same name that she was wont to doe: thats all now. Lets see, A matter of some three hundred will doe't, so farre forth as my present and most vrgent occasions doe presse me at this instant:
<q>
                     <l>As for payment,</l>
                     <l>And for rayment,</l>
                     <l>For hedges and mounds,</l>
                     <l>And stocking of grounds,</l>
                     <l>For Corne for seed,</l>
                     <l>Or Cattle to breed,</l>

Or the Wolfe at the doore,</l>
                     <l>And a thousand things more.</l>
                  </q>
They are nothing so important and concerning as the least of these: I would not misse Munday come seuennight for three such summes, I tell you Sir: Munday come seuennight! That were a iest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>For that and what you please beside, saies the Scriuener, you shall finde no default on my partie: This honest Gentleman that is with you knowes the course of these kinde of businesses: He and I shall take care of you wheresoeuer you dispose or repose your selfe: And so with thanks for your costs and kindnesse, I shall take my leaue at this time.</p>
               <p>The Scriuener departs, and the Gentleman staies behinde, onely to hugge and endeare the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of him that procured this meeting: He prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the prosperity of their iourney, commends the comely cariage of the Scriuener, and vowes euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting acknowledgement of his Atturneys actiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And so they betake themselues to their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging likewise for that night.</p>
               <p>The next morning my Gentleman sends his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turny to see that the money which he spake for, be told out and made ready for him against his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, which should be when and where it shall please the honest Scriuener. (For by this time he had attained so much of reputation among them.)</p>
               <p>The same day and the next were both spent in continuall quest of the Scriuener. But the Boyes in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15400:10"/>
the Shop according to their masters direction made answer, one while that he was gone to Sir <hi>Sam</hi> for moneys: Another while that he was at the sealing of writings at such a place: Then that he was at the speeding of a commission of Bankeruptisme at Guild-hall, God blesse the place and euery good man of the Grand Iury: And then shortly after, that he was but euen now gone forth, and that it was impossible but that he should meet him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the dust of Popes-head Alley had put out his eies by the way.</p>
               <p>The time weares out, &amp; the horse-race comes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the apprehension whereof puts our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into such a perpassion, that on the next day early in the morning he goes to the Scriueners shop, where sodainly and vnawares he finds him saying his praiers, while he was withall crosse garte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of himselfe; and had he not knowne him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by his crosse-garters than by his praiers, questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse he had lost his labour.</p>
               <p>Godmorrow (saies the Gentleman) perhaps I doe disturb your deuotion?</p>
               <p>You Rascall, how chance you doe not hang out the Labells? (saies the Scriuener to his boy.) Then he proceeds with his praiers, and suddenly bespeaks the Gentleman, asking, What is your will with me Sir? Haue you any businesse with me I pray now?</p>
               <p>O Lord Sir, (saies he) I hope you remember what past betweene vs at the Ship on wednesday night last, touching the three hundred which I was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15400:11"/>
indeed to haue the next morning, parcell of the thousand which was to come in then.</p>
               <p>Hum (saies the Scriuener) I thinke there was some such matter: I remember we talked of it: But what were the names of your security which you did then giue me?</p>
               <p>For names (replies he) why I gaue you none, for I conceiued it should not need: Or if it doe, you shall haue lands that for seat, and site, value, and Virgin title, shall beare and ballance your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage downe to the center.</p>
               <p>Now you come to me (saies the Scriuener) goe you two to the Antwerp, but only to prepare me a particular of this land, and I will be with you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.</p>
               <p>They goe before the particular is made ready. The wine is burnt, the Scriuener with much paine has past through his praiers, and recouers the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne do ore, by that time he was come to <hi>(Amen.)</hi> He returnes to his old complement, pockets the Particular which they deliuer him, and puts all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse into this cup; He drinks freely, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises nobly: So that now there was no doubt made but we might be at Northampton most opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And so much for that meeting.</p>
               <p>After dinner they came both againe to the shop, where they found my Scriuener wrapt warme in his gowne about him, fast asleepe (Good man.) For if euer he were good, he was then good; Or (at least) I am sure he was then and there at the very best of Scriueners good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15400:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the height of their holinesse, and the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their punctuality.</p>
               <p>They must by no meanes trouble him before he be fully recouered and enabled for a second meeting at the Mermaid after Exchange time. They attend the while: the clouds of claret shortly spend themselues: he wakens, they salute him.</p>
               <p>At length with much adoe hee calls them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and askes them for their particular: they shew the errour in his pocket, and so he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises their dispatch the next morning without any faile, and they are gone to bespeake furniture for Cropeare in the meane time. At the appointed houre my Atturnie comes to know if the writings were ready to seale, and the money proportioned into seuerall hundreds, in so many seuerall bagges or no.</p>
               <p>The Scriuener replies, that it should be forth with prepared accordingly, so as they should bring good city security with them, but only to vndertake for the property and transparancie of the title of the Lands so tendred, and that was all should need for the matter, procuration being euer prouided for, and writing taken to estimation according to the repate of the place where it was to bee written, and that was all that was now remaining to be considered of on the Gentlemans behalfe. This new taske re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired more time in possessing and perswading of some Citizens his Country-men, who knew him and his lands so well, that it was disputable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was more deare and desired vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:15400:12"/>
They ioyne with him in the security, and become immediatly bound with him by bond for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the money at a certaine day to come, and to the great amazement of the Scriuener, thanke him for this counsaile in aduising and directing them to the cautionary causeway of security both laterally and collaterally, by direct &amp; oblique lines which he most mathematically had imagined and contriued in his head, as well for his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity as for their indempnity, without deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any other assurance as yet, and so my Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is dispatcht without further tie vpon lands or person hitherto, sauing what is mentally reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon the growth of this summe, by these his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing friends and countrimen.

               <p>He now studies how to take vp without expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to bee a principall for himselfe, or to be too promptly drawne into security for others. Hee findes out for property for this purpose a young heire, who for a third share of the summe, was content to beare the onely name and blame of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, and to yeeld to the ensafing of my Citizen, by such counter-bonds, sales and assignments, as by the Scriuener and himselfe, could be deuised to vphold the reputation of a wonderfull wary man.</p>
               <p>Can you now call this man a borrower for doing his friend a courtesie? Or is this man in a declensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it appeares by the booke, that he is in the way of purchasing? No such matter, this cries vp his credit: And howsoeuer these monies be repaid,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15400:13"/>
yet he is sure of the land, which before any insol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uency shall appeare on his party, he does intend to conuey ouer in trust secretly, to the vses of his liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood for the time of restraint to come, and like one that prepares his tombe while he is yet liuing, hee resolues what lodging to take vp on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters-side, when his credit shall depart this mortall life.</p>
               <p>Besides, he had another way of borrowing, hee findes out an old vsurer of the same parish, father to diuers daughters, who catcht at espousall prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, onely by their fathers countenance, and their concise carriage.</p>
               <p>The one of these he singles out from the heard, and pretends most pure and vnfained loue vnto her: He visits her in his gowne at Midsummer, whereat the old man conceiues great ioy and comfort, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his grauity, and delights in his decency. He on the other side peceiues the powle-cat in the Pursenet, makes present vse of it. He shewes him the conueiance which the heire made the other day vnto him of all the houses in Conny-hoope-lane a one side; and desires to be furnisht by him with so much as might bring the other side into his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie likewise: for that it was now offered vnto him vpon reasonable conditions, so should bee reduce all (as it were) into a circle, and his daughter should hold that for her Iointer, and haue the euidence in her owne custody.</p>
               <p>The old man lik't this passing well, and for feare left the bargaine should be snatcht out of his hand,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15400:13"/>
he takes him into his closet, tells out the monie, and sends him away instantly.</p>
               <p>The old man turnes him about, and (pointing at her sweet heart) bespeakes his daughter thus:</p>
               <p>There goes he that labours for you most indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously, studies your good right carefully, I pray God make you thankfull for him accordingly: For you shall haue a husband (bee it not vainely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) that for thrift and husbandrie may be the very browch of all the Citie.</p>
               <p>In stead of going forthwith vnto his Chapman, for the housing and candle rents, he is housed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently at a widdowes in the way, where he spends his time till candle-light.</p>
               <p>Here he likewise protests and professes loue by whole sale: hee shewes her the monies, and tels her what a bargaine he could now haue, if shee would ioine stocke with him in such a commoditie come lately into the Downes with the last East-Indian ships. It might please God that this might be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py occasion of vniting their persons as well as their parcels together.</p>
               <p>The Widdow was hereupon taken with such a Sorpego in her wrists, that her fingers ends itcht to be telling out of her part, and to take issue vpon his promise of the vnion, which she performed with much dexterity.</p>
               <p>Then he puts all together, and assures her that he will be gone the next tide to Grauesend.</p>
               <p>When hee comes home, hee dispatches letters speedily to the old Vsurer, certifying him of his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15400:14"/>
good progression in Connie-hoope-lane, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring his patience for certaine daies, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuing of his assurance by good and sufficient counsell would take vp.</p>
               <p>The time pretended for the Downes, and to draw downe a good estate for his young Mistresse, is vpon better consideration bestowed at <hi>Rumford,</hi> where whosoeuer had seene him in the lift of his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, would little thinke him to be so little a thing as might bee contained within the compasse of a counting house, or be confined within the prospecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a false light.

Hereupon the Cormorant and the Crow contend for the prize: The Crow claimes it as a Stray lost, and left without the bounds of any watry couerture on the dry land at a low ebbe, The Cormorant challenges it neuerthelesse, as being still within his high water-marke; Then the Crow alledges that its so wasted (wanting water) that it is become no better then Carrion, and therefore it does properly belong vnto him. The Cormorant denies that, and assures him that the Oister is yet aliue, and therefore no carrion. But the Crow had giuen so much credit formerly, that he would now scarce beleeue his owne eies (especially in his wifes case) he would by no meanes beleeue this to bee true, and therefore in hope to cousen the Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, he desires that he may only feele with his bill whether it were so or no? Leaue is giuen by the Cormorant, who thought it was enough for the Crow to smell vpon the prey, intending that neuer any more should come to his share: Then the Crow who knew how to tickle a Trout at his pleasure, did without assistance of Constable or aduice of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, make a most violent entry vpon the Oister, which presently claps to his doore, shuts the Crow within, and caught him so fast by his bill of entry, that all <hi>Colchester</hi> and the custome-house can testifie to this day, with what vncustomed and vncourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entertainment he was there receiued.</p>

               <p>Being thus prouided on Munday the first of March, the wind blew faire from the East, when they left the Temple-staires: And the same day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saint <hi>Dauids</hi> day, the aire grew thicke and very foggy, insomuch that the pinace had lost the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,

had it not in stead of a light in her Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne hung vp a Leeke in the maine top, by the sent whereof it recouered sight of her againe the next morning by breake of day.</p>
               <p>On the second, third, and fourth day the weather was very variable and stormy, howsoeuer they still spoond onward for most aduantage.</p>
               <p>About eight of the clocke on fryday the fifth of May, their Pylot who had beene a Spectacle-maker and a Prospectuary without Temple-barre, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a saile making towards them which they suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his flag to be the water-bailiffe of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon a Councell was call'd aboord, the Captaine to consider what was to be done in this imminent extremity.</p>
               <p>Some aduised that it were fit to make the land, if they knew where to touch without hazzard.</p>
               <p>Others of higher resolution aduised to stand the fortune of a Sea-fight, and to draw their number out of sight into the hold, whereby to encourage the enemy to a neerer approach, which opinion was generally receiued and allowed.</p>
               <p>Presently, as the occasion required, it was agreed that for the sublimation of euery sparke Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, there should be an extraordinary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance made instantly (that was) the full propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one pipe of Tobacco, and a Temple-pot of six to euery two of them, which when they had cheerefully past about; the Taylor whose conscience was more tender then his stomacke, would needs <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

bee resolued in two points concerning his soules health before the fight should begin. The first was, whether the cause and quarrell which they were to vndertake were iustifiable or no, for that he euer held Ludgate more worthy then Newgate in diuers respects: and the next was in case he should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in the action, whether <hi>Limbus patrum &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantum,</hi> were not vnder his owne shop-boord or no.</p>
               <p>Before my Taylor could haue opinion herein of their Captaines Chaplaine, who had beene a Vini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-man formerly, and a fellow of excellent sharpe apprehension: the supposed enemie came within shot, wherevpon euery one of them began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him to his charge.</p>
               <p>But iust as Matter Gunner was ready to let flie, (not for feare I hope) they perceiued no other assailants but the Church-wardens of new Braine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, who were bound for London to buy bells, not for the Church but their morrice dance against the ensuing Whirson-ale. Hereupon for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter recouery, the allowance was againe doubled to euery one of them. And on they passe brauely till on Saterday the sixth, they discerned firme land, lying vpon the Savoyans Eastward. Here the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine drew out the one halfe of his forces, and with his long boat put them to land, where they found a most spatious continent fit for plantation at foure degrees beyond the Temple, the climate excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding temperate so long as you pay the Tennis-court

keeper for your lodging, the accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons most excellent, either thorow the white Hart into the Couent-Garden, and so into the countrie round about; or from the great house thorow the Swanne into Drury-lane, and so forth free as bird in the aire: The Lacedemonian women supply them with fish and fruit of all sorts, which they bring downe in aboundance from the vpland coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: insomuch as there is neither feare of want of victuals, so long as they haue mony; Nor of security while they doe put themselues vnder the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Denmarke-house: Heere they left the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdasher and certaine other to winter it, and the rest returned aboord the ninth day of May, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their course still West and by North: On the the twelfth day, <hi>Cape Virde,</hi> or Greenes wharfe, did shew it selfe vnto them, where they likewise put in, &amp; forraged cleane thorow it on both sides. This place (besides other goodly beasts of all sorts) is most famous for Harts, whose hornes are of the comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est branch and spreading, as also of dimension and extension that can be; so that in memory of them, the Captaine named the place <hi>Harts-horne-Ally:</hi> Then the which no place hitherto discouered, is of a more capable continent, or more rich in Minerals, Vegitatiues or Victuals, or more agreeable with the constitution of our countirimen, especially if they be married.

               <p>In the meane time we exhort you that both with cheerefull contribution, and otherwise with your aduice, you doe not onely vphold the old ones, but also further and aduance the said two new plantations so happily discouered, and so prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously pursued hitherto, by you the Councell and Aduenturers of the said company, and at your only charge and expence.
