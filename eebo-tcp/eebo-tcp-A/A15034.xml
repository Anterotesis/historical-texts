         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I aunswered him, I was a Gentleman of <hi>England,</hi> vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily exiled with a burnyng desyre, to sée the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of other Countries, the order of their gouernment, <note place="margin">A necessary regard for Trauelers.</note> and manners of the people. And are you of that blessed Ile (quoth he?) where the people liue in peace and prospery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vnder the rule of a Mayden Quéene, crowned with such deuine vertues, as the whole world may hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">The vertues of the Quee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Maiestie, maketh the Iland of Eng lande famous through out the whole Worlde.</note> her fame.

Wherefore, in honour of your Soueraigne, whose fame armeth al true knights, with an earnest desire to doo her seruice. I am glad of the meane, to bestow on you, or any of hir nation, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affection of a friend.

               <p>Furthermore, what remembrance is theare of faire <hi>Sirinx</hi> coynesse, refusing to be God <hi>Pans</hi> wife? other then that she was metamorphosed into a fewe vnprofitable Réedes: Or of <hi>Anaxaretes</hi> chaste crueltie towardes <hi>Iphis,</hi> ouer then that she remaineth an Image of Stone in <hi>Samarin.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But in the behalf of <hi>Mariage,</hi> thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds haue ben chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into <hi>Olyue, Pomegranate, Mulberie,</hi> and other fruict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full-trées, swéete flowers, Starres, and precious Stones, by whom, the worlde is beautified, directed and noorished.</p>

Parmenio</hi> presented this trauel vnto the Emperour. The Emperour séeing the two names, and not the shape of those, hee commaunded to be drawne, demaunded the Paynters meanyng héerein, who pleasantly aunswered, that he could not take the view of <hi>Ophellas</hi> face, for feare of being fyered with the lightning of her tonge, and that <hi>Borihauder</hi> was drowned with teares, which as showers of Raine folowed the thunder claps, of his wiues Fistes: But in good time (had she died) this <hi>Demideuill Orphella</hi> fel so extremely sick, as in euery mans iudgement, it was néedefull to giue Phisick to her soule, but bootelesse to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow any of her body: <hi>Borihauder</hi> séeing her, as he thought at a good passe, was so accustomed to sorrow, as hee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to toule her passing bel, with this counterfet mone.

Ah, ah, Traytour, I am not yet dead, ah villain, villaine, I am not yet dead: and through this passion, choller so dryed her <hi>Catar,</hi> as shortly after, she perfectly receyued her health: and so canuassed her husband <hi>Borrihauder,</hi> as by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of sorrow, &amp; payne, he hung himselfe in a Crabtrée:</p>

               <p>If the wisest, and the worthyest, be thus ouertaken in their affections, what easie baites may beguile thée, who in yeares art young, of substaunce delicate and lustie, and therefore apt to looue: reddy in conceyt, and of considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnperfect: whot in desire, and in discretion colde: My sonne, by experience I know, and to preuent thy ouerlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mischaunce in choyce: I haue chosen thée a wife, fayre to please theae, ritche to continue looue, her Parents my assured fréendes, and she thy affected loouer: loue her well, beare with her in small faultes, as a woman and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, &amp; bridle thy owne euill affections as a man, her head and gouernour: and in thus dooing, God will multiply his blessings vpon you, and make your aged Parents to dye in peace, to sée you liue in prosperitie.

               <p>Pardon me (quoth <hi>Bergetto)</hi> for this penance was but a due payne for my presumption, which I hope to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with patient suffering: and sure in this milde aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: <hi>Bergetto</hi> shewed a moral vertue, and Doctor <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senigo,</hi>

               <p>Well, notwithstanding <hi>Bergettos</hi> temperaunce, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueler caught hold vppon this question, as a Mastiue vppon an old drye Mariebone, &amp; to proue a womans hatred more <note place="margin">A Caueller, hath colours for euerie question.</note> greater then her loue: hée auouched manye cruell autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.

            <p>Well (quoth his Mystresse) if you canne cleare your trespasse, by one of these questions, I must do no iniurie to Iustice, and therefore, saye your pleasure.</p>

            <p>To your second thrée questions, a man maye offende through ignoraunce, which is excused without a pardon: for ignoraunce, is without intent of euill: therfore to be suffered, though not to be cherished: A man may offend, through necessitie, which commendeth Iustice, with the vertue to forgiue: for necessity, is bound vnto no law, and therefore, deserueth not to be punnished with the rigour of law: To the third, a man may offend through rashnes, &amp; make amends w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: which Iustice may pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out preiudice to equity: &amp; herein (faire Mistres) I haue showen my trespas, &amp; the reparation of my trespasse. <note place="margin">Three iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, may pas vnreuenged.</note>

            <p>To your third thrée questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, a man may hurt his friend against his will, which is an iniurie: yet, ought not to be reuenged: for reuenge, can but afflict y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trespasser, and the misfortune, gréeueth him: Before the husband, a man may kisse the wife, by mistaking: which is an iniury, not to be reuenged: for the wife may wipe away the wrong w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her hand, &amp; the husband by reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, may make worke for the Chirurgion: And to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last, a man must be content to take good wordes of a beggerly debtor: which is an iniury not to be reuenged: for a man can haue of a Cat but her shin, &amp; of a begger, but his scrip: vnles he wil sel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Appotherm y the greace of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one, &amp; the dice maker, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bones of the other.</p>

            <p>Wherevpon <hi>Bergetto,</hi> to strengthen himself the better, made this remembraunce, of the yesterdayes reporte.</p>
            <p>It is (ꝙ he) already approoued, if the married in forced Mariages, could as well finish with the Church, as they <note place="margin">Free choise in Mariage defended.</note> can account with their consciences: their ioy to be Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was not so colde, as their desire to be deuorsed would be whot: therfore by this awkeward successe in forcement: a frée choise in Mariage, can not choose, but continue (as I thinke) as much loue betweene the Married, as the other sowed debate.</p>

Sir (quoth <hi>Soranso,</hi> taking <hi>Bergettos</hi> parte:) of two <note place="margin">Defence, &amp;c.</note> euils the least is to be chosen: and it is lesse euill for a man, to lyue a while hardly, and satisfye his owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then to liue euer discontented and please his fréendes. The good behauiour of the maryed, may winne the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to consent, and amend their exhibition: or death may come, and put them in possession of theyr Parentes ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
            <p>If either of these chaunce, as one is shortely like to happen, the penaunce that they indured, wyll season theyr prosperitie, and counsell the Married to kéepe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their teacher, to leape within their latchet, and lyue within theyr compasse: The louing aduise of the husband, wyll reforme the disposition of euill in the wife.

               <hi>Plato</hi> sayeth,) there is no woman so perfect good, but in some one point may be reprehended: nor no man so fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, but that somewhat in him may be amended: so that if the Husband gently reprehend the fault of his Wife, and the Wife patiently suffer the offence of her Husband, the abylytie of theire estate wyll sustaine a househould, and their looue and agréement wilbe an especiall comfort vnto them selues, and a commendable example vnto all the neighbours.</p>
            <p>The best of bothe your euils (quoth Doctor <hi>Mosseni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go)</hi> is starke naught: but our question was not, to chuse <note place="margin">Reproofe, &amp;c.</note> the least of euyls, but that which is simply good: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to aunswer to the sequell of this rashenesse in Mariage, you saye, theyr good behauiours may recouer theyr Parents good wyll, but I Prophesie, that theyr e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill demeanures, are more likely to extinguish the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Father: for necessitie wyll accustome the Husband with dishonest shyftes, and kéepes his fayre Wife from béeing ydle: for want muste be supplyed, what shame so euer ensue.

               <head>¶ The Question that arose, by behouldyng, the MOWNTIBANKES, in the thirde Nightes Pastime.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>AT the accustomed Houre, Supper was ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi> in with manie daintye Dishes: whiche were saused, with sundrie shorte ciuill, and pleasaunt euentes of the Gentlemen, and Gentlewomens wittes: For he, or shée, was helde of weake capacitie, that either of forestuddie, or, vpon offered occasion, coulde say nothing of good regarde.</p>
               <p>In the ende, when Supper was done, and Quéene <hi>AVRELIA,</hi> and the most Honourable of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie had taken their places vppon a Scaffolde made for <note place="margin">Breuitie, is best, for Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble talke.</note> the nonce, there mounted, a <hi>Mountebanke,</hi> his necke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chayned with liue Adders, Snakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eau'ts, and twentie sundrie kinde of venemous vermines, whose mortall <note place="margin">Mountiba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks of Italie, are in a maner, as Englysh Pedlers.</note> stinges were taken away by Arte, &amp; with him a <hi>Zanni,</hi> and other Actors of pleasure: who presented themselues onelie with a single desire, to recreate <hi>Segnior Philoxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and his worthie companie: and not with the intent of common <hi>Mountebanckers,</hi> to deceyne the people with some vnprofitable Marchandize.</p>
               <p>In the middest of this pastime, an auncient Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (of the generall Societie) séeinge these Uiperous Beastes, by cunninge vsage, to be made so Domesticke and affable, whether it were vppon an impression of his owne greife or of the experience he had of an other mans Plague, I know not; but sure I am, he burst into these passions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11965:46"/>
O GOD, (quoth hee) of what mettell is a Womans tongue, which correction cannot chastise, nor lenitie quiet, <note place="margin">The strange nature of a Womans tongue.</note> when these dumbe Serpentes, by the one or the other are tamed?</p>
               <p>Marie (quoth a pleasant Companion) it is made of the same mettle, that <hi>Virgils</hi> Brasen Flayle was off, which strooke both his friendes and foes.</p>
               <p>But (quoth the Gentleman) <hi>Virgyll</hi> knew, &amp; taught others howe to pacifie this engine.</p>
               <p>It is (true quoth the other:) but in teaching the secrete vnto his Seruant, coste him his owne life. So a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knowes howe to holde her Tongue, by hauinge of her will, but if a man thinke to stay it, he must beate her to death.</p>
               <p>A young Youth named <hi>Phrisio,</hi> thinking to winne the Spurres, by building a Fortresse for women, who haue <note place="margin">Defences, for a chidynge wyfe.</note> no weapons but their tongues, to defend, and offend, tooke vppon him, to prooue a chiding wife, though shee bee a little vnpleasaunt, both profitable and necessarie: his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were these.</p>
               <p>Unsauerie receytes tourne to holsome effectes: The strongest Poyson is pleasaunt in taste, and the remedie for the poysoned, offendeth the mouthe with tartnesse: Nettles that stinges the Hande, maketh Pottage to comforte the heart: the bloude of the Scorpion cureth the biting of the Uiper. If poysoned, vnpleasant, and bitter thinges retaynd a vertue for the benefite of man: in my imagination (quoth hée) an vnquiete wife is not vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable though shée bee a little vnpleasaunt:</p>
               <p>Her anger kéepeth Seruauntes in awe, and her quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse ouerseeth their negligence: If her tongue runne at ryot, where shée huntes, there is store of abuse, which must be chased either with blowes or wordes: If the furye of her speache offende her Husbande, it is lyke, that) her outrage, groweth from his faulte: And where an iniurie is offered, it is sufferable, yf the wronge bee blamed:
<pb facs="tcp:11965:47"/>
but which maketh a full amendes, for her furious moode: as the clowdy and raynie daie, lightly cleareth towardes night: euen so, though she bitterly scowld at boorde, shée will be sure, to kisse swéetely a bedde.</p>
               <p>The auncient Gentlemen, commending the quick wit <note place="margin">In blaming, mildnes is to be vsed.</note> of this yong Gentleman, vsed thys circumstaunce before he refelled his error.</p>
               <p>Ah (quoth he) if witt were as aduised in Iudgement, as he is ready in censeight: his imaginations, would turne to wonderfull effectes: but as fairest colours soonest staine, as swéetest flowers are blasted with a breath: as beauty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures, are blemished with a little care, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Sunne threateneth suddaine raine: yea, as euerye mortall thing hath his imperfection: euen so, witt beinge <note place="margin">Wit simply is imperfect.</note> mortall, and assigned by Nature, to make man glorious, aboue other creatures, by rashnes, corrupts the ripenes of his conseightes: and to good purpose, his pryde is thus abated: for otherwise, man which enioyeth witt, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe his Creator, and to lyue content, with the liberties of the sea, and to kéepe him with in the limits of the earth, woulde search the secreats of heauen: and I thinke, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possesse <hi>Pluto</hi> of hell.</p>
               <p>Yong Gentleman (quoth he) I vse not this ceremony to represse your libertie of speache: for the error of youre rashnes, I will refell with reason and experience: but least heareafter you should be as arrogant in opinion, as you are ripe in conseight: I haue thought good, friendlye, and bréefelye to signifie your imperfection: and nowe to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere your late suggestion.</p>
               <p>I affirme that Nature hath created nothing to a néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse purpose: but notwithstanding, our abuse, or mischance, changeth hurtefull thinges, into occasions of our healpe: Surfit, and Sicknes only, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth Medicine: and as you affirme, the bloud of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> cureth the biting of the <hi>Viper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But take away the cause, which procéedeth from our gréefe, and you shall finde medicine, an enemye to health:
<pb facs="tcp:11965:47"/>
and the stinge of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> no better then death: and trust me, he is to be reckened a foole, and his misfortune to passe vnreléeued, that wilfully indammageth his health in hope of remedy. In like sorte let him liue vnpittyed, to ouersée the slacknesse of his seruaunts, who wyll marry a wife, whose tongue shall ouer-rule himselfe. But more perticularly to discribe the properties of an vnquiet wife, and more largely to discourse the displeasures of her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate husband: I will approoue her lowringe, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, as his life is vnpleasaunt: you say her quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse ouerséeth the negligence of seruaunts: but I affirme, that her curstnesse maketh them as swift to runne away, as they were slowe to serue her: and common vse avowes, that often shyfte is neyther beneficyall for Mayster nor <note place="margin">Shift, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, for Maister and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt.</note> Seruaunt: for proofe, as the rowling Stone gathereth no Mosse, and want of vse canckereth Iron, in likewise thrifte flyeth the fléeting Seruaunt, and idlenesse consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his abylytie of seruice. Now touching the euill rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening of those which are serued: their wanderyng ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes not onely charge their common accountes, with double wages, but with secret pylferyng, they sette theyr Maisters in more déepe arrerages.

In the end, deuining what should be the secret meaning of this Simbole or Ensigne: quoth he, <hi>Segnior Ismarito,</hi> this Cognizance of your quicke wit, pleaseth me much, and withall remembreth me of a neglected curtesie, which (I thinke) will showe you the Image of your <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix,</hi> and blason the secresie of your whole deuise: and thereuppon he lead <hi>Ismarito</hi> into a moste curious priuie Gallerie, where (drawing a faire Curtaine, and reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kissing his hand) he shewed <hi>Ismarito</hi> the Picture of a <note place="margin">An honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fauor.</note> Royall Princesse, moste ritchly and liuely set foorth, with which a Marchaunt of <hi>Venice,</hi> who traffiqued toward the Westerne Islands, presented him: which <hi>Ismarito</hi> beheld, with a regarde so duetifull, as their néeded no glose, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the zealous affection of his heart.

               <p>After the Prieste and the rest of the companye, were wearye of laughinge: and the Fryer almost dead with wéeping: It is an office of Charitie (quoth the Priest) to put Saint <hi>Frances</hi> againe in his Tumbe: for it is so long

               <p>Well, for that night, they bounde and stript him, lyke a dead Coarse: and in stead of swéete Flowers, laid him <note place="margin">Rude people extreame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers.</note> in a bundell of Nettles.</p>
               <p>The next mornyng, the rude Countrie people (who in reuenge are without ciuyllytie or order) cruelly scourged the poore Fryer. And (setting hym the forenoone naked in the Sunne) annoynted his bodie with Honey: so that the Hornets, Waspes and Flyes, tormented him with the paynes of Hell.</p>
               <p>In the afternoone, with a hundred Torches, Tapers, and other waxen lyghtes: this rustick multitude, caryed seconde Saint <hi>Fraunces</hi> vnto his Tumbe: and had not other Fryers vsed mylde &amp; plawsible requests, in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, <note place="margin">The best way to win the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie.</note> they would surely haue buried him aliue: for threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, increaseth a tumult: when faire wordes, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture staye it.</p>
               <p>The poore Fryer discharged from the handes of these vngentle people, learned afterwardes to be more warie: but for all this punishment, was nothinge the honester.

               <p>To perswade her to consente, was vnnaturall: too yealde to Death, was more gréenous.</p>

               <p>Swéete <hi>Cassandra,</hi> (quoth he) that men loue, is vsuall, but to subdue Affection, is impossyble: and so thornie are the motions of incontinent Desire, as to finde ease, the <note place="margin">The force of Necessytie.</note> tongue is only occupied to perswade.

            <p>Who so inuented this sonet <hi>ꝙ</hi> Quéene <hi>Aurelia,</hi> deserueth to be well fauoured of his Mistresse, in that he kept her so carefully in his bosome.</p>
            <p>Nay <hi>ꝙ Dondolo,</hi> if his eyes were so subtyll, as absent, he could see her behauior, his affection were more daungerous then his seruice necessarie.</p>
            <p>We geue you to know <hi>(ꝙ Isabella)</hi> that we waye not though our husbandes, a hundred myles of, knowe our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours at home.</p>
            <p>I thinke so quoth the plaine Doctor, for so farre off they may (sighe at their one mischau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but) not chaste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your amisse. Perchaunce they should not be charged with such iniurie, as this company should be (quoth <hi>Maria Belochy)</hi> if wee would offer to aunswer your enuious sugiestions.</p>
            <p>Laides I speake not with intent <hi>(ꝙ Soranso)</hi> to make a question of your behauiors, but admit you of all creatures the most perfect: yet for that you haue motions, as well bad, as good, you maye many tymes make showe of euill, and yet not doo amysse, which if your husbandes be so quicke sighted, as to perceiue, they will iudge by their owne eyes, and not by your hartes, and so from shaddowes may growe euill effectes.</p>
            <p>If there sight be so quick, <hi>ꝙ Franceschina Santa,</hi> then</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11965:63"/>
If their sight be so quick (quoth <hi>Franceschina Sancta)</hi> then, though by a negligent trespasse, their wiues some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time giue them cause to sigh, with a number of louing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadges, they will giue them daylye occasion of reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe.</p>
            <p>I graunt as muche (quoth <hi>Soranso)</hi> but this will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <note place="margin">The euyll of Ielousie.</note> the Husband will turne his owne mistruste, to hys Wiues sorrow, and receaue her good vsage to his owne pryuate comfort.</p>
            <p>Indeede (quoth <hi>Aluisa Vechio)</hi> the loue of a ielous husband, is sawced with such frowarde motions, as I had rather be matched with him, that regardeth mée not at al, then with him that loueth mée too muche: for of the one, though I am not beloued, yet I shall not be much crossed: of the other, I being too much beloued, I shall neuer be in quiet.</p>
            <p>I am not of your mynde (quoth <hi>Helena Dulce)</hi> I had <note place="margin">Harde is the difference, be tweene a care lesse and a ielous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande.</note> rather haue my Husbande ielous, then carelesse: for being carelesse, no good vsage will reconcile him: and being Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, the Wife may studie out how to please him.</p>
            <p>Yea, but (quoth <hi>Katharina Trista)</hi> Men are so easye conceited, that if they perceiue a woman studdieth how to please them, they straight waies, imagine, she will lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise studdie how to deceiue them: and therefore, God shéelde mée from a Ielous Housbande. I haue heard, the <hi>whightstreaked Carnation Giliflower,</hi> was the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos</hi> of a Faire Gentlewoman, beheaded by her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, vpon this Ielous thought, that his wife beinge so faire, could not but be beloued of the Gods, although hée <note place="margin">Ouid. Meta. lib. 10.</note> had no cause to suspect men. And where haue yée a larger Example of Loue, then the Aduenture of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who by extreame sorrow and sute, recouered his Wife out of <note place="margin">Eurydice.</note> Hell, and by ouer Ielous Loue sent her thither againe.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Mossenigo</hi> was smyling out a scoffe, vpon this <note place="margin">Preuent a Scoffer, and he beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a Sotte.</note> tale, which Quéene <hi>Aurelia</hi> intercepted, by ending of the Gentlewomens contention.

therfore, good, we tourne backe agayne.</p>
            <p>In déede Madame (quoth <hi>Fabritio,)</hi> if we trauell styll, to choose the leaste of Euylles, it wyll be longe before we come to the Fountayne of Goodnesse.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes (quoth <hi>Isabella,)</hi> the Sonet, which mooued the late Question, directes a fayre way to happinesse in Mariage: for it commendeth loftie Loue: And if, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the oulde Prouerbe: <hi>The best, is best cheape:</hi> this Aduenture, geueth Hope, and promiseth good Fortune. <note place="margin">A Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of lofty Loue.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is true (quoth <hi>Soranso,)</hi> &amp; I dare vndertake to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue it, the happiest estate in Mariage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dondolo,</hi> because he would not be disgraced, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riyng a Burgoys fayre Daughter of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> offered to prooue the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Quéene <hi>Aurelia,</hi> licensed them to shew their reasons.</p>
            <p>Whervpon, quoth <hi>Soranso:</hi> to geue great Ladies and Gentlewomen of calling, their true right and honor, who lightly, marry not their Inferiours in reputation, but for some especiall Uertue, that doth commende their choice, and cleareth the Bleamish of their Husbandes basenes? I must confesse, that he which rayseth his thought so hye, vndertaketh (no doubt) a tedious sute: his delayes wyll be gréeuons, and his Solliciters wyll be well rewarded, in what sort so euer he be regarded. But what of this? <hi>Quo quid difficilius, eo pulchrius:</hi> Perryll maketh honor perfect: the styngyng of the Bée, mendes the swéetenes of Honie: Roses best refresheth our Sences, when we prick our handes to reache them: He that crackes the Nut, thinkes the Kernell swéetest. The reason is, not for that the goodnesse of a thing, is the better, for the euil thervnto <note place="margin">The euyll of a thyng, com mendeth the goodnesse,</note> belonging: but, for that the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euyl, maketh vs holde the good in more reputation: especially, in loue. The Affection, whiche is forced with teares, wonne with sighes, gaind with expence, and compassed with sorow, is held most pleasant, most perfect &amp; of longest continuance. Againe, easie gotten good wyll, beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in a while loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some: the cause is, as I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the pleasure was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

Once, a man, in louing his better, to encrease his passion, shal lack no occasion, both to séeke, sue, sigh &amp; serue: &amp; yet, to féede his hope, he shal want, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faire lookes, good wordes, nor possybilytie of fauour. For, for to obtain a great Ladie, acquireth many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces, not for that shee is precise to loue, but for that shee is wise, (or woulde bee so thought) in herprocée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges. But whether she loue or no: <hi>Ouid</hi> saith, there is no woman, but wil indure the demaund: she is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with seruice to be courted: &amp; in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence, rewardeth with good countenance.

               </note> the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual vse: that loue spareth no degrée, transgresseth euery law, &amp; bringeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mightiest in bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage to the meanest.

But whether he spéede or faile: be accepted or reiected: well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, or yll intreated: the ymagination, that time wil inuest his desire w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> delight, is to the Affected, a Paradice, <note place="margin">Hope to com passe great matters com forteth more then the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssession of tryfles.</note> farre exellyug the possession of equall loue: But if in the end, her affection, or his good fortune, concludeth his wish in desire: her loue, whiche can not choose but be great: in that she marieth beneth her callyng: And her Abylytie, which allured at the first, with his inhabylytie: to realysh both, can not but make the Husbande fortunate, and the Wife well pleased: for that in recompence of this aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement, she may presume, somwhat, to rule her Heade: but, which most contents, she shal haue the satisfaction of <note place="margin">Reproofe of loftie Loue</note> her fancie a bed.</p>

A woman cannot myslike affectionated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, because they procéede of loue: But her kindred disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his attempte, for that the conclusion, tendeth both to their and her dishonour: A woman séeing her seruaunts passions, cannot but sustaine him with pittie, her Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">One kinsman hath an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers honor.</note> séeinge him in good way to bee beloued, will lye in waite for his lyfe: For though she may dispose of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, her kindred hath an interrest in her honour, which if she consent to staine, or deminishe, shee dooth iniurie to her whole house.</p>

            <p>Yea (quoth <hi>Soranso)</hi> but, this Cardinall, for all his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and glose of Iustice, is for this Act, so often regestred <note place="margin">Defence. &amp;c.</note> for a Tirant, as I feare mée he will neuer come among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Saints, But the example of these Mariages are vsuall, and such ensuing vengeaunce is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The vncontrouled wife desireth to walke at lybertie, and to be visited of many: of which the ruling Husbande, woulde barre her: as well to preserue his mynde from mistruste, as to kéepe his Chimney from being fyred.</p>
            <p>The vncontrouled wife disdayneth the Countrie and desireth the Citie: which the rulyng Husband would mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, for that in the Countrie, the exercise of huswiuerie inlargeth his Wiues estimation, and in the Cittie, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hazardeth her reputation.</p>
            <p>The vncontrouled Wife, desireth without checke to pratle, and without discreation to gouerne: which the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng Husbande in no wise would allowe, for that manye wordes is a bleamish to his wiues modestie, and the rule of his Wife, is warrant sufficient, for the wise to ouer rule him for a Woodcocke.</p>

               <hi>Segnior Fabritio,</hi> to conclude <hi>Don Dolos</hi> opinion, with his owne Iudgement, saide in trueth, that <hi>Marriage</hi> coulde not away with such seruitude: as the Husband, who is wise and the chéefe, shoulde obay the wife, who in common construction, is simple, weake and the inferiour. And where a Rich woman (as <hi>Don Dolo</hi> hath said) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth her poore Seruant, because she is the cause of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, she will looke to gouerne: which if she doo, her indiscression, will moue others to speake, and her Husband to sorrow: and if he challenge the preuiledge of a husband to direct, hee shall bée bounde to a lyfe more bitter then Death. Not, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in respect of his former estate, he may endure these crossinges of his wife, but because, as hee is growne in estimation: so is hée growne in hautinesse of mynd, and can now wurse brooke an vnkinde word, then in times past, an iniurious déede.

cleared the mistes of Ignoraunce, and vnmasked the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes of the superstitious Monkes, Friers. &amp;c. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated in the swéete comfort of those Aucthors, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the hard passages of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>And for that <hi>Health,</hi> is the most precious Iuell of the <note place="margin">Phisyck.</note> worlde, knowyng the Constitution of his owne bodie, he studied so muche in <hi>Phisicke,</hi> as without the direction of Doctors, hee knewe, what meate and Medicine, agréede with his nature.</p>
            <p>To minister <hi>Iustice,</hi> vnto the Ignorant multitude, and to kéepe hymselfe out of the Forfaites of Lawe, he <note place="margin">Lawe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> studied the ciuill Law, and specially, the Statutes of his Countrey: And (questionlesse) the Gentleman, that is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt in the Lawes of his Countrey, is an enemye to hymselfe, and a Cipher in the comon weale.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Militarie</hi> Knowledge, he was experienced, as wel, by seruice in the Field, as in readyng <hi>Vegetius</hi> and other <note place="margin">Art Militarie</note> Aucthors in his Studie. And some trauell in this Arte, is néedefull, as well as comendable for a Gentleman: for it is not ynough for hym, to be <hi>Togatus,</hi> as a Romayne Dratour, nor <hi>Paliatus,</hi> as a <hi>Gretian</hi> Phylosopher: in that he must as well in the field, looke his enemie in the face, as imbrace his frend in the house: and therfore, though he bare a Pen in his eare, to write his owne Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) hee is bounde to weare a Sword by his side, to doo his Countrie seruice.</p>
            <p>For Gouernment, and Ciuil behauiours, he read <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarches</hi> Moralles: <hi>Gueuaraes</hi> Dial of Princes: the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> of Count <hi>Baldazar, Castillio:</hi> and others.

            <p>He (likewise) studied <hi>Cosmographie,</hi> and had therin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable knowledge: which studie, can not, but much please and commende a braue minded Gentleman: For <note place="margin">Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie.</note> by the vertue therof, he shalbe, in his Studie, able to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>He was a good <hi>Hystorigrapher,</hi> and had read manie rare Chronicles. How pleasing this studie is to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is liuely expressed in his owne nature, <hi>greedy of</hi>

            <p>These Gentlemanly studies he vsed, intermedled with others of more pleasure, whiche I had not leasure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, nor memorie to beare away: but in all his actions, and behauiours, he exposed a Gentleman so perfect, as in <note place="margin">Segnior Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loxenus a perfect Cour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>This Sonet, mooued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> company to smile, not because the inuention was vnwittie, but in that, it was the fruites of Doctor <hi>Mossenigoes</hi> Muse, who to reuenge vppon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe all the iniurie, which he had done to the sexe of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, became inamoured of <hi>Katharina Trista,</hi> the waspis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest Damosel, among the whole troupe of Gentlewomen: But knowing the Doctors <hi>Phylosophie,</hi> could not so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his affection: but that time would make them all sporte and him smarte, they dissembled their knowledge of his folly, as déepely as hée couered the passions of hys fancy: notwithstanding to raise some speach, and to set the Doctor a work with hope.</p>

            <p>By your wordes, Maister Doctor <hi>[ꝙ Lucia Bella,]</hi> the wife is the greatest cause of this contention, and yet in common opinion, the Husband is most blamed.</p>

            <p>The Husband replieth that if he had not béene so mad, the diuell would not haue married her.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11965:89"/>

               <p>The Husband ought to beware, that in the presence <note place="margin">Laciuious talke to be shunned of the husband</note> of his wife, he vseth no filthie lasciuious talke: for besides the witnesse of his owne indiscression, he maketh her a passage for many an vnhappy thought.</p>

               <p>Generally, the Husband ought not to forbid his Wife, <note place="margin">Modest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie not to be forbidden the Wife.</note> in assemblyes modestlie, to intertaine time, in deuising with the better sorte: for in such ielous restraint, he shall leaue a suspition, that he inioyneth her this open pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, for some secret trespasse, and so bothe slaunder himselfe, and iniurie his wife.</p>
               <p>The Wife should haue an especiall care, to shun the <note place="margin">Light com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to be shunned of the Wife.</note> company of light Women: for the multitude, though they can charge her with no misdemeanour, yet they well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne her honor, by the known euils of her companions.</p>
