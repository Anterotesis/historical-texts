            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Deſign of this Work.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt Part of this Work we took our riſe from this Propoſition, <hi>There is a God,</hi> and from thence we proved that, <hi>Jeſus Christ the Son of Mary is the Meſſias who was to come.</hi> We ſhall now take
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94927:5"/>
a contrary courſe, and begin with this Propoſition, <hi>There are at preſent Chriſtians in the World,</hi> and from thence prove that, <hi>There is a God who has been pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf by the means of Religion.</hi> There we have had but a faint proſpect of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by the Light of Nature and Revelation of <hi>Moſes;</hi> Here we ſhall as it were draw the Curtain, and diſcover <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with that brightneſs of Truth and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Light, as will wonderfully illuſtrate both the Religion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Revelation of Nature, and in an excellent manner confirm the truth of the Exiſtence of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to which, we ſhall do theſe three things. I. We ſhall conſider the ſhell and bark, If I may ſo ſay, of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> by examining all thoſe Arguments that are drawn from the external Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> gave of it, and by conſidering their natural Capacities, the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that were made to them, their prejudices, the peculiar frame of their minds, their Martyrdom, and the reaſons that induced them to ſuffer it, &amp;c. And all this before we proceed to the conſideration of the Writings of the <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi> II. We ſhall conſider theſe Writings themſelves, and enquire whether they are forged or not. We ſhall examin the ſubject-matter of them, and endeavour both to defend them againſt the ſuſpicions of the Incredulous (by ſhewing that they contain nothing but what is certainly true) and to evince the Divinity of them by the Character of thoſe things they contain. III. and laſtly, We ſhall endeavour to ſhew the very ſubſtance and ſpirit of Chriſtianity, by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Excellence, uſes, advantages, the end, genius, and in general all the beauties which are proper and natural to it. And this is what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to treat of in the following Sections whereof this ſecond part is compoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94927:5"/>
But ſince our Adverſaries by their prejudices may be inclined to fear, leſt we ſhould impoſe upon them, by making them believe ſuch Doctrines as can't be proved by Reaſon, and ſince it is much for our advantage to remove all ſuch ſuſpicions, we will for a while doubt of every thing with them, and raiſing our ſelves by degrees to the Knowledge of thoſe matters of fact which eſtabliſh Chriſtianity it ſelf, admit of nothing for truth but ſo far as appears evident.</p>
               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Where we ſhall enquire whence the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had their <hi>Original,</hi> and what their <hi>Profeſſion</hi> is, by looking back into the firſt Ages wherein they appeared.</head>
                  <p>IN order to which, we ſuppoſe that there are now <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> and there have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ſuch. From this I gather that I muſt look back into paſt Ages to find out the Original of my Religion. In this ſearch I paſs therefore from Age to Age, till I come to <hi>Constantine,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to clear this doubt.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt make a little ſtop. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of this Prince gives at firſt ſome occaſion of ſuſpicion, and we eaſily miſtruſt a man who being Maſter of the moſt conſiderable part of the World, ſeems probably to have eſtabliſhed the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> therein, either by <hi>Force,</hi> or <hi>Policy,</hi> looking perhaps upon it as more proper than that of the <hi>Heathens</hi> to carry on his deſigns.</p>
                  <p>Yet that ſuſpicion ſoon vaniſhes, ſince we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured there were <hi>Christians</hi> in the World before
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94927:6"/>
                     <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time. All the <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers who lived before him ſpeak of them; and the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Hiſtorians are wholly employed in deſcribing their ſufferings. But ſuppoſing that theſe Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans lived in the days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or after him, they muſt needs have either loſt the uſe of their reaſon themſelves, or have imagined that the men of their age had loſt theirs, when they give them the Hiſtory of the Chriſtan Church, down from the Apoſtles to <hi>Constantine,</hi> if 'twere certain there had not been Chriſtians in the World before that Prince. And therefore this muſt be too extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant a ſuſpicion to be entertained long.</p>
                  <p>But here is ſomething ſtill more obſervable, <hi>viz.</hi> that on the one hand the Chriſtians who lived before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> were then poſſeſſed of the Books of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> and on the other, that thoſe very Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of the truth of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of his miracles, of the pouring out the holy ſpirit on the Apoſtles, and of all other matters of fact that eſtabliſh the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion,</hi> that they hardly ſpeak of any thing elſe; their books are full of them; and their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is altogether built upon this foundation. And therefore if <hi>Conſtantine</hi> invented the matters of fact which eſtabliſh Chriſtianity, he muſt not only have forged the Books of the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> but alſo the Writings of <hi>Clemens, Juſtin, Iraeneus, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and in general of all the Fathers who lived before him, becauſe every one of their Writings have an eſſential relation to thoſe matters of fact that prove the truth of Religion.</p>
                  <p>And ſhould we go up a little higher than the reign of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> we ſhould hear of Chriſtians that were afflicted during the three firſt Centuries of the Church, and perſecuted throughout the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94927:6"/>
whole World, and puniſhed with moſt barbarous and new invented torments. They were put to Death upon wheels and ſcaffolds, tortured by fire: their fleſh torn with pincers; their bodies were mangled by cutting off limbs one after another: they were thrown into Rivers, and caſt into the Sea, and expoſed to Wild Beaſts; wrapp'd up in garments dipped in ſulphur, to ſerve for torches, and ſet up to light Paſſengers in their Way. In fine, it was never known that men ſo univerſally agreed in any one thing as in their deſign of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Chriſtians; in ſo much that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary people who have generally ſome compaſſion for the greateſt malefactors upon the Scaffold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the Chriſtians to the place of Execution with acclamations of Joy.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, 'tis a very difficult matter to reſtrain one's Curioſity ſo much, as not to deſire a more particular Knowledge of a people perſecuted by the World with ſo much rage and malice. For to ſee the whole World ſo ſtrangely incenſed againſt one ſect of men, one would eaſily think them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies of all mankind, and the offspring of Hell it ſelf born for a common plague to the Reſt of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apolog.</note> What then were the great Crimes theſe Chriſtians were guilty of? They were accuſed of impiety, murther and inceſt. 'Twas pretended that they violated the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to the Gods; that they murthered their own Children, which they ſcrupled not to eat up after having Killed them; and laſtly, that they lay promiſcuouſly together, the Brother with the Siſter, and the Son with the Mother.</p>
                  <p>But firſt of all there is little likelyhood that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould ſuffer Death, and torments worſe than Death it ſelf, in defence of a Religon which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94927:7"/>
engaged them to the Commiſſion of ſuch infamous actions. That ſtedfaſt conſtancy they ſhew'd in the midſt of their Torments, and which their Enemies themſelves acknowledged, ſutes very ill with the voluptuouſneſs and enormities they were accuſed of.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, were they queſtion'd concerning theſe Crimes which they are obliged to clear themſelves of, they would produce in their Behalf the Apologies of <hi>Juſtin, Athenagoras,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> wherein they earneſtly deſired the <hi>Senate,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours that they would make a ſtrict enquiry into their lives, and inflict upon them ſuch torments as were a thouſand times if poſſible more cruel than thoſe they had already endured, if they were really gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lty of what they were accuſed.</p>
                  <p>They would ſhew us likewiſe a letter from <hi>Pliny</hi> to <hi>Trajan,</hi> which ought to be looked upon as an authentick monument of their Innocence: Since <hi>Pliny</hi> there informs the Emperour, that having ſtrictly inquired into the lives of the Chriſtians, he found nothing elſe but that they aſſembled together in remote places early in the morning, and there ſaid their prayers to heaven, and bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under a Solemn Oath, not to commit Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Adultery, Injuſtice, or any other crime. They would alſo produce an anſwer from <hi>Trajan</hi> to <hi>Pliny,</hi> wherein that Emperour gave poſitive orders, that for the future there ſhould be no particular enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries made after the Chriſtians, but thoſe only ſhould be puniſhed, who ſhould diſcover themſelves. And that we may not think that, theſe letters are forged, we may conſider that 'tis <hi>Tertulian</hi> that mentions them in his Diſcourſe to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, whom he could not impoſe upon, without endangering his own life, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing his Religion.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt Perhaps we may ſooner ſuſpect the credulity of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> than their innocence. We are ſure their Conſtancy proceeded from their hope, and their hope from their perſwaſion. But who knows the ground of that Perſwaſion? Are there not <hi>Mahumetans</hi> ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of the Divinity of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as to die in defence of that Errour? The multitude then of Martyrs ſhews an infinite number of perſons to be ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the truth of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> but proves not that perſwaſion to be well grounded. We m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt therefore go a little further.</p>
                  <p>And here we may eaſily ſuppoſe without fear of being miſtaken, that the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> had ſome ſort of <hi>Common ſenſe.</hi> Thoſe who made it their profeſſion to ridicule the plurality of Gods, and the many ſuperſtitions of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> which were really contrary to Reaſon; thoſe who put in practice ſuch wiſe Rules of <hi>Morality,</hi> who were ſo regular in their behaviour, ſo averſe to all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes that diſorder Reaſon; who formed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch rational Ideas of the Deity in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to others, thoſe men, I ſay, could not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of the light of Nature. Now ſuppoſing them to have but the leaſt glimmering of that light, 'twill be hard to conceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that they ſhould wholly renounce their Eſtates and Fortune, and couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer Death in defence of any cauſe whatſoever, unleſs they had very powerful Reaſons to believe it were good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94927:8"/>
This conſideration will be further ſtrengthn'd by two very important Reflexions. And firſt, we ſpeak not here of ſuch only who being born <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> blindly followed the prejudices of <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Education:</hi> but alſo of a great number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who renounced <hi>Paganiſm</hi> to embrace Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and laying aſide the favourable prejudices of Education and Birth (which in them were quite contrary to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,)</hi> were yet willing to die for it as ſoon as 'twas known and embraced.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The truth of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together founded upon mattters of fact. For if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> wrought Miracles, and roſe again from the Dead, than is the Chriſtian Faith True. But if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> wrought no miracles, nor roſe from the Dead, then is the Chriſtian Faith falſe. And ſurely 'twould have been folly or madneſs in thoſe men to forſake ſo flouriſhing a Communion as <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> to take upon them the name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> a name ſo vile and contemptible in thoſe days, to ſuffer vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily the loſs of their Eſtates, and undergo a moſt terrible Death, only to defend a Religion grounded upon ſuch matters of fact as they had no reaſon to believe to be true. Thoſe indeed that are born and live peacably in a Communion, may blindly believe the Doctrines of it: but he that is never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquainted with the conſtitution of man's heart, can ſcarce imagin men to be ſo ſenſleſs, as to renounce the prejudices of Birth and Education, to offer violence to their deareſt and moſt tender Inclinations, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a <hi>Faith</hi> purſued with fire and ſword, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all the powers of the World, unleſs they had firſt duely examined the nature of it, and knew well upon what grounds they thus embraced it.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected that ſome of theſe men were of the meaneſt ſort of people, whoſe example cannot be alledged as a precedent for Wiſe and learned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94927:8"/>
men, We'll grant it. But then it muſt alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd that the Vulgar uſually embrace that Religion which is attended with Power, and Proſperity, Pomp and Authority, and hate even <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf, when once deſtitute of all theſe outward helps. How is it poſſible then that againſt all outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, they ſhould have acted ſo contrarily to themſelves in this Occaſion?</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing the commmon ſort of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to have loſt their Reaſon, can we ſay the ſame of the Doctors of the Primitive Church, as <hi>Clement, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp, Juſtin, Iraeneus,</hi> &amp;c? 'Tis certain on one hānd theſe men were men of very good ſenſe (as their Writings, thoſe Monuments they have left us evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrate) And on the other, 'tis very well known they lived in a time ſo very near to that of the Apoſtles, that it is abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould have been deceived in this reſpect. For <hi>Polycarp</hi> converſed a long while with St. <hi>John, Iraeneus</hi> ſaw <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and <hi>Juſtin</hi> was a more ancient Father than <hi>Iraeneus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had thoſe Doctors only told us that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles wrought ſeveral Miracles, we might perhaps have ſuſpended our belief upon their bare word. But ſince they ſuffered Death in defence of the truth of certain matters of fact, which they muſt neceſſarily have fully been informed of, ſince I ſee that <hi>Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> Diſciples and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries with the Apoſtles, chearfully came to the ſtake to maintain a Religion eſſentially founded upon thoſe matters of fact, (ſuch as were the gift of divers Languages conferred upon the Apoſtles, the power of working Miracles, and imparting thoſe very gifts themſelves to others;) Since, I ſay, theſe Chriſtian Doctors ſuffered Martyrdom for the confirmation of matters of fact which the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is eſſentially united to; I confeſs I begin to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94927:9"/>
be convinced. Nevertheleſs let us ſearch more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into this matter, and ſee whether we ſhall yet have any Reaſon to entertain any further ſcruples.</p>

                  <p>I ſuppoſe I ſhall not be obliged to prove with a great many arguments there were ſuch men as <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who ſuffered Martyrdom. <hi>Euſebius</hi> who wrote their hiſtory could not wholly have invented it, unleſs he had corrupted all the Writings of the Fathers that lived before him; for they all ſpeak of it. <hi>Iraeneus, Juſtin, Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi> &amp;c. mention it, as a known matter of fact. The firſt of them glories in ſeveral places of his works that he had ſeen <hi>Polycarp</hi> in his youth; and it appears they all ſuffered Martyrdom in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe <hi>Primitive Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Apoſtles deceived <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> and the reſt of their Diſciples, is a thing much leſs to be ſuſpected; becauſe they themſelves ſtuck not to boaſt of their being able to work miracles, heal all kind of diſeaſes, ſpeak all ſorts of languages, and impart to others thoſe gifts they called <hi>the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And it is impoſſible that <hi>Clemens, Polycarp,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould have ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be deceived in this reſpect, eſpecially to

                     </gap>uch a degree as to ſuffer Death for the teſtimony of a Religion founded on ſo many impoſtures.</p>
                  <p>But whence appears it that the Apoſtles boaſted of a power to work miracles, and impart the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt? It appears not only from their own Epiſtles which can't be forged (as we ſhall prove by and by) but alſo from the writings of the Doctors of the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> and in fine, 'tis manifeſt of it ſelf. For as we can't deny that there was ſuch a man as <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out overthrowing the common Opinion that he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Empire of <hi>Darius,</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ſubdued all <hi>Aſia</hi> under his conduct; becauſe one matter of fact depends upon the other: ſo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acknowledge the Divinity of the <hi>Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> without believing the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> his pouring out the Holy Ghoſt on the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the miraculous Gifts imparted to thoſe that believed. For take away theſe matters of fact, and what would become of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion?</hi> Wherein would the Divinity of it conſiſt? Wherein would lie the Strength, Promiſes, and Eſſentials of it? Since therefore <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> ſuffered Martyrdom for the truth of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> it follows alſo that they died in defence of the truth of thoſe matters of fact we juſt now mentioned. So that thoſe matters of fact being very palpable, and it being very eaſy for <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> who lived and converſed with the Apoſtles, to know certainly whether they really had the pretended gifts of divers tongues, of healing all ſorts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and of communicating theſe extraordinary gifts to others, ſo as to render them frequent in the Church, I do not ſee how its poſſible to call the truth of them in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The ſoul of man however fruitfull in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, can hardly raiſe here a doubt of a moment's
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94927:10"/>
continuance. For ſhould I fancy they may have given me a falſe Relation of the Martyrdom of <hi>Clemens,</hi> of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and the ſucceſſors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: this thought ſoon vaniſhes, when I conſider the number, quality, and unanimous conſent of the Witneſſes of this matter of fact. For can we think that the Suceſſours of <hi>Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> would have ſuffered a real Martyrdom in imitation of one that was but imaginary? Would they ſo coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly have imitated a fictitious Martyrdom of their own invention? And ſhould I imagin <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> were impoſed on by the Apoſtles, I am ſoon convinced of the contrary; ſince thoſe matters of fact which we have now before us, are matters of <hi>Experience</hi> ſo evident in themſelves, that we cannot be miſtaken in them. Laſtly, ſhould I doubt whether the Apoſtles endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men of the truth of them, I am made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that there can be no <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> without theſe matters of fact, and that the Apoſtles could never have eſtabliſhed the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> unleſs they had firſt perſwaded men of the truth of them. This will be farther ſeen by what we ſhall offer in the following chapters.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while may we not know what the profeſs'd Enemies of Chriſtianity ſaid of them? For it ſeems unjuſt to hearken to that only which the Chriſtians alledge in defence of their own cauſe. This is no hard matter; We find <hi>Porphirius, Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> ſurnamed <hi>the Apoſtate</hi> maintaining that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did no miracles at all but by a <hi>magick</hi> power, and that it was a <hi>fantom</hi> which appeared to the Diſciples inſtead of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> riſen again from the dead. Whereupon I think it neceſſary to make ſome few Reflections. It is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that thoſe who were far more exaſperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than the <hi>Incredulous</hi> of theſe

                  <p>Thus it immediately appears that the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> were men of very good ſenſe, and very honeſt and ſincere principles too: that part of them lived in a time ſo very near that of the Apoſtles (in whoſe days all thoſe things came to paſs) that they muſt neceſſarily have known the truth of them; that in the mean time they ſuffered Death to ſeal the truth of a Religion, founded upon all thoſe matters of fact; and laſtly, that their Enemies themſelves durſt not preſume entirely to call any of them in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But I will not yield my ſelf conquered for all that, but rather raiſe my ſelf a little higher, and ſtop for a while at the latter end of the firſt Century, which is the time wherein St. <hi>John</hi> (the laſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) was yet living, and wherein <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> whom we juſt now mentioned flouriſh'd: and this ſhall be our fixed point in the following Chapters.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Where we yet further prove the Truth of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> by ſeveral undeniable matters of fact.</head>
                  <p>'TIs an hundred years ſince there were no <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> at all in the World, and now there are ſome in all parts of it, at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> &amp;c. I confeſs I am ſome what ſurpriſed to ſee this progreſs, yet not ſo much as to be convinced of the truth of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Religion was eſtabliſhed in a leſſer time. We muſt then go yet farther, and conſider that the Chriſtian Faith was not only deſtitute of the aſſiſtance of Policy and Authority, but received notwithſtanding the continual oppoſitions of both.</p>
                  <p>'Tis obſervable that other Religions, as that of the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> were eſtabliſhed in the World by ſome ſingular and extraordinary <hi>proſperity,</hi> and by the <hi>policy</hi> of perſons raiſed to dignities and grandeur; but <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in a ſmall time became Maſter of mens <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> tho it was attended with nothing but ſhame and Miſery, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the powers of the World ſtrove to ſtifle it in its very birth, and for that purpoſe invented ſuch tortures and puniſhments as no other intereſt could have made men deviſe.</p>
                  <p>We might indeed queſtion the ſufferings of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> were we not aſſured of them from the Writings of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and had we not a clearer proof in the complaints of the Fathers, who certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were not ſo extravagant as publickly to complain
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94927:11"/>
of an imaginary perſecution, when it was ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to complain of one that was real.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I would fain know what this <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith</hi> and Doctrine is which made men ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſuffer, and abandon all things. But to my great amazement I find that they believed that a certain crucified man was the Son of God; that a man hang'd and nailed on a Croſs was the <hi>ſovereign</hi> judg of the World, and the object of our Adoration. I confeſs I can't but acknowledg ſome ſupernatural power in all this. For tho' men of as mean appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as thoſe who firſt preached the Goſpel, might without any Miracles have weigh'd down the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Emperours and Prelates, and all the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and glory of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> objects very ſuitable to the worldly and ambitious heart of a man, yet how can we conceive that they could without the help of Miracles, perſwade men to believe a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox ſo offenſive to Reaſon, and which appears at firſt view ſo horrible as this, that the Son of God was nailed on a Croſs?</p>
                  <p>We can never perſwade our ſelves without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to our Reaſon, that thoſe who from their youth repreſented their Deities to themſelves, as the greateſt and moſt glorious <hi>Beings</hi> they could imagin, and gave the name of <hi>Divine</hi> to whatever they thought in the higheſt degree beautiful and magnificent, ſhould yet ſubſtitute to all theſe great Ideas, the notion of a God who died an infamous Death upon the Croſs; That not one alone, but an infinite number of perſons embraced an Opinion that immediately overthrew all their firſt Ideas of a God; that this great change was not gradually and inſenſibly brought to paſs, or in the compaſs of ſeveral ages, but in a very few years, and with an incredible ſwiftneſs, by the Myſtery of vile and contemptible perſons, of no power or authority in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94927:12"/>
the World; and that the paſſion they had for a Doctrine which ſeemed at firſt ſo monſtrous to Men, induced them to ſuffer Death in defence of the ſame, after having renounced their Fortune, Reputation and Pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>But does not prejudice over-rule in all this, and make me Fancy I ſee that diſtinctly which I perceive but confuſedly? in truth I ought yet further to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt my ſelf, and tho' I honour <hi>Errour</hi> too much, in ſuſpecting it may be ſo coherent, ſo united to the Principles of <hi>Common ſenſe,</hi> and involved in ſo many appearances of Truth; yet I will not paſs by any ſcruple for all that has been hitherto ſaid.</p>
                  <p>I find then that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World an hundred years ago; I know that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> believe in a certain <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> crucified. I know alſo that this Opinion of theirs was not innate. I am fully perſwaded that neither the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Prieſts, nor their ordinary Guides taught them this Doctrin, becauſe they were the profeſs'd Enemies of it. I am compelled therefore in deſpite of my ſelf to credit, at leaſt in ſome reſpect, the Relation the ancient Doctors of the Church unanimouſly gave of it, <hi>viz:</hi> that ſome perſons called <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> went about the World, preaching that this ſame <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was the Son of God, and the <hi>Meſſias</hi> whom God had promiſed to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe fundamental Truths require a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Examination; and therefore we muſt ſhew more diſtinctly whether there were ever ſuch men as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the World; what their Original was; what Doctrine they preached; and how they were qualified. This we ſhall preſently ſee, by laying down for a certain Principle, that the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> had the books of the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> in their poſſeſſion at that very time we have choſe for our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94927:12"/>
fixed point. I ſhall not at preſent enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Books are forged or not, my deſign being to argue ſome time without entring upon that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. For whether they are forged or not, at leaſt we learn from them certain undeniable matters of fact, which will wonderfully illuſtrate all our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Enquiries,</p>

                  <head type="sub">Which demonſtrates that all the matters of fact contained in the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> can never be forg'd.</head>
                  <p>IF the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> be forged, It may well be preſumed that the Contrivers of that forgery (who certainly could have no other deſign but to make it paſs for truth) endeavour'd to ground it upon ſome foundation either good or bad: So that we have reaſon to believe, that tho' they ſhould have invented all that they relate, at leaſt they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented not the Names, Country and Perſons of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, under whoſe Names they ſpeak, and to whom they aſcribe the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>

commanded all the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be taxed in the days of <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> and where it muſt have appeared that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf (if there was any ſuch Perſon) was alſo taxed.</p>
                  <p>'Tis all one as if a man ſhould publiſh in this age a book full of excellent precepts of <hi>Morality,</hi> intermixt with ſeveral fictitious actions, which book he would have the World receive as the Doctrine of ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and extraordinary man, who in the beginning of this age raiſed up ſeveral men from the Dead, healed all ſorts of Diſeaſes, calm'd the Winds and Tempeſts of the Sea, gave Authority to ſeveral of his Diſciples to work many ſtrange Miracles, was at length ſeiz'd and put to Death in <hi>Germany;</hi> and whoſe Diſciples who bore ſuch and ſuch names, and were born in ſuch and ſuch a Countrey, came afterwards into <hi>France,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed themſelves throughout the other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> preach'd his Doctrine, and at length died all unanimouſly in defence of it. What think you of this Tale? And how would it be received in the World but as a Syſtem only of many evident and palpable falſities? What think you thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would ſay of it, who ſhould be thus accuſed of ſo dreadful a parricide? They would certainly reply that that fictitious book was purpoſely deſign'd to blaſt their Reputation. But it appears the <hi>Jews</hi> never attempted to clear themſelves after that manner. They confeſs there was ſuch a perſon as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that their Fathers put him to Death: neither do they deny the leaſt Circumſtance of his <hi>Life, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> excepting thoſe which might probably make him paſs for the Son of God. But we have here ſomething ſtill more clear and convincing than all this to offer.</p>
                  <p>Either thoſe Books which you may think forg'd or not forg'd, ſpread of themſelves the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine throughout the World, after they had
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94927:13"/>
been carried into ſeveral Parts of it, before there were any Apoſtles to preach it there, or elſe thoſe Books were compoſed after the Apoſtles had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed their Doctrine in the different parts of the Univerſe. I ſee no <hi>medium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> inſtructed men in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine before any of the Apoſtles had preached it, how could the <hi>Romans</hi> be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which is a meer Name, had wrote an Epiſtle to them; or thoſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been in their City; or the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had preached the Goſpel to them; or in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral all <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Galilee</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with his Diſciples had preached there; or in particular the people of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he was there condemned to Death by the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But if the New Teſtament was not collected into ſeveral Books, nor compoſed till after the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had preached the Goſpel in the ſeveral parts of the World, it muſt follow from thence that there were ſome Apoſtles before that time, and a certain <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> crucified, who was reputed the Son of God, and the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> according to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>So that whether thoſe Books be forg'd or not, ſtill I am certain they relate certain fundamental matters of fact which are neceſſarily true. For it is certain there was ſuch a perſon as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and was at laſt crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 'Tis alſo as certain that <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were Fiſhermen who followed him out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and preached the Goſpel after his Death in ſeveral Parts of the World. Wherefore then ſhould I be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon that ſhould queſtion a thing never ſo much as doubted of among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> or the <hi>Jews,</hi> nay which the Incredulous themſelves of theſe times do not pretend to call in queſtion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94927:14"/>
But to ſtop a little here, It ſeems that <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> living in a certain Corner of <hi>Judea,</hi> pretended himſelf to be the Son of God, or if you will the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> 'Tis very ſtrange indeed that a Man of ſo mean an extraction, who all his life time followed the profeſſion of a Carpenter, (as his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſo often reproached him to have done) ſhould notwithſtanding pretend himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was to have been (according to the profeſs'd opinion of that age) ſurrounded or attended with pomp, ſplendour, and temporal Proſperity. Let us therefore enquire a little into it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Jeſus</hi> (whoever he might be, and whatever Idea we may frame to our ſelves of him) gathered together a company of Diſciples, ſome of which he took from among Fiſhermen on the bank of the Lake of <hi>Genneſareth,</hi> ſome out of the Towns of <hi>Galilee,</hi> nay and ſome he called from among the <hi>Publicans</hi> themſelves, whom the people ever had in <note place="margin">Origen. contra Celſ. lib. 16.</note>abomination (as the Firſt Enemies of Chriſtian Religion laid to his charge.) Thoſe men which thus followed him were of mean Education and Birth. They neither had Learning nor Politeneſs; they neither were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the heart nor the inclinations of men, neither with the Policy of Princes, nor the elevated <hi>Morals</hi> of the <hi>Stoicks;</hi> nor laſtly, with the miſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſecret Wiſdom of the <hi>Sages.</hi> But they were mean and ſimple Perſons, as the Enemies themſelves of Chriſtianity readily acknowledge.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not at preſent examin what Reaſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them ſo firmly to adhere to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor what convincing arguments he uſed to engage them to follow him. It is enough we know they were ignorant perſons, who looked for the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> according to the common Opinion of thoſe times,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94927:14"/>
and ſo might probably be thought to have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>But here I cannot but admire that thoſe mean and ignorant people, who had undoubtedly framed to themſelves a very ſublime Idea of their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and imagined no leſs than that he would have diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Crowns to them (to uſe that expreſſion, ſince this was always a ſtrong opinion amongſt the <hi>Jews)</hi> I ſay, I cannot but admire that thoſe ignorant ſort of people ſhould content themſelves with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and apparent meanneſs of a man, who took quite another form upon him than that of a Conqueror.</p>
                  <p>It can't be denied that <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> was in a very poor and mean condition when he called his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſince <hi>Porphirius, Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> reproach him with it. Beſides this is ſuch a matter of fact as no man would invent tho' he could eaſily have done it, and which he could not eaſily invent, tho he would have done it. 'Tis certain the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time and always before expected a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant <hi>Meſſias.</hi> 'Tis alſo as certain the Diſciples adher'd to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> notwithſtanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd opinion they were prepoſſeſſed with at that time; this is what we are ſurpris'd at.</p>
                  <p>Since the Diſciples found not in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> all the Glory and temporal power they were ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded their <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould have been inveſted with, they undoubtedly imagin'd that what their Maſter did not then actually poſſeſs, he would certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſome time after. They did not at all queſtion but that he was to re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and overcome the Enemies of the <hi>Jews.</hi> This made them to diſpute the <hi>Priority</hi> among themſelves. They would know who was to be <hi>the greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that is, in the flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which they termed the <hi>Kingdom of heaven</hi> in imitation of the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi> Nay
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94927:15"/>
two of them importuned our <hi>Saviour</hi> to grant them to ſit the one on his Right Hand, and the other on his Left, as ſoon as he was exalted to that ſtate of Glory.</p>
                  <p>I admit not of theſe matters of fact meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in the New Teſtament, but becauſe they are very conformable to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tradition, and Reaſon it ſelf. Common <hi>Senſe</hi> aſſures us that the Diſciples adhered not to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> without ſome hope or other. Now what could they hope for from him whom they looked upon as the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but that which they expected from the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> a temporal deliverance attended with the like Proſperity.</p>
                  <p>But not to advance any thing doubtful or in the leaſt uncertain in it ſelf, I affirm that the Diſciples conſidered <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that they could not regard him as ſuch but either in the ſenſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or in that of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that is, either as a temporal Deliverer, or a ſpiritual one, and conſequently that whatever ſenſe we take it in, ſtill were they to hope for ſome advantage or other from him; but let us ſee how far this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Conſideration will lead us.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Diſciples were ſtrongly prepoſeſſed with the thoughts that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that is, the perſon that ſhould have raiſed up their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the utmoſt pitch of Proſperity and Glory, this <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf was ſeized, and nailed on a Croſs, where he ſuffered a moſt infamous Death, infamous in the eſteem of all Nations, but more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accurſed in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law. What a mighty thunder bolt muſt this have been to ſuch men who had fed their fancies with ſuch charming hopes! They were long ſince perſwaded that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> would make his appearance in a very Glorious State; that he would overthrow at his coming the Empire
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94927:15"/>
of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> together with all the <hi>Roman</hi> Grandeur, and thereby make the <hi>Jews</hi> abſolute Maſters of the World. All theſe things they impatiently expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and yet this <hi>Jeſus</hi> was diſhonoured by an infamous puniſhment he was compelled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. The <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves not only ſacrificed him, but they ſacrificed him even to <hi>Ceſar</hi> himſelf, and delivered him up to the <hi>Romans</hi> to put him to Death. There was no power able to deliver him out of the hands of his Tormentors; ſo that he died, and his Diſciples heard of his Death, or rather were eye-witneſſes of it. In truth I cannot conceive how they ſhould after all this have ſtill preſerved the leaſt of their pretentions. They might reaſonably grieve at the loſs of ſuch pleaſing hopes, but nothing could redeem the loſs of them. They might abhor the furious paſſion of the chief Prieſts and <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> who had utterly deprived them of their dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Maſter: but they muſt at length lay aſide the opinion they had entertained of him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing can be ſo likely as that which St. <hi>Luke</hi> makes them utter in the midſt of their ſorrow and aſtoniſhment. <hi>But we truſted that it had been he, which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael; and beſides all this, to day is the third day ſince theſe things were</hi> done. Luke 24. 21.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing they had no ſuch Hopes or Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is enough that the Diſciples look't upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> as the promiſed <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Nay 'tis all one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was in the ſenſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> or in that of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For if it was in the ſenſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they could not but imagin that <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have raiſed up the glory of the <hi>Jews</hi> to its utmoſt height, ſo far were they from conceiving he was liable to be put to Death by them. But if it was in the ſenſe of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they ought ſurely to have believed that in caſe he ſhould die, he would certainly raiſe up
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94927:16"/>
himſelf and thoſe that believed on him from the grave, becauſe the whole Syſtem of <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> eſſentially depends upon this foundation.</p>
                  <p>Thus, were the Diſciples prepoſeſſed with the general opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they could not chuſe but loſe it at the ſight of the Death of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and were they prepoſſeſſed with the profeſs'd Doctrine of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they could not likewiſe but be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of their Errour, when they ſaw that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> roſe not again from the Dead.</p>
                  <p>What then ſhall we think of certain Fiſhermen, who were a moſt mean wretched ſort of people (as the Enemies of Chriſtianity called them) who had not the courage to accompany their Maſter even when they looked upon him as the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but gave him over to his Executioners? Sure they are by this time ſenſible of their miſtake. What care then does it appear they took to hide themſelves, to conceal their ſhame and confuſion from men? let us ſee what was the Event, and we ſhall know the Truth.</p>
                  <p>We find that few weeks after the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Diſciples publickly ſhewed themſelves in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and confidently affirmed that they had ſeen their Maſter who was riſen again from the Dead; had ſpoken with him, handled him, eat with him, converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him for forty days; and laſtly, that they had ſeen him aſcend into Heaven. 'Tis certain this was the Teſtimony of the Diſciples, ſince the Faith of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> was founded on this Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>Who could have thought of this unexpected turn? The Diſciples affirmed that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> but could they ſtill believe it, when they ſaw him give up the Ghoſt? Or if they did not believe it, were they now grown bolder to maintain an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, than before to follow their Maſter, when they thought him the true <hi>Meſſias?</hi> Could certain Fiſhermen, dejected fearful Fiſhermen, who ought
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94927:16"/>
with ſhame to have owned their Error, could they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch a fable, preach it with ſo much confidence, maintain it with ſo much boldneſs, expoſe their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to all ſorts of Torments, and even to Death it ſelf, in defence of ſuch an incredible fiction? Could any of them imagin that they could ſeduce Mankind, or had any one of them imagined it, could the reſt have been ſo extravagant as to approve of his ridiculous fancy? Did they think the World would believe them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their bare Word? And were they then no longer in any dreadful apprehenſion of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> that had inhumanely put their Maſter to death? Did they believe they might ſafely reproach the <hi>Jews</hi> for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to death, without being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeverely puniſhed? Were they not ſenſible into how many troubles and afflictions this fable would inevitably caſt them? And if they were, could they ſtill be ſo couragious as to maintain ſuch an impoſture? Is it poſſible that no one of them ſhould recant his opinion, not one contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that all ſhould unanimouſly depoſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the moſt rigorous puniſhments inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, a matter of Fact which they knew to be altogether <hi>Chimerical</hi> and falſe? Certainly this is a thing ſo very ſtrange, or rather which appears to me ſo very abſurd and extravagant, that I queſtion whether our incredulous Adverſaries could perſwade themſelves of it, provided they would but reflect never ſo little upon it.</p>
                  <p>But let us continue ſtill to diſtruſt our ſelves; may we not probably have made ſome falſe Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in what we juſt now affirmed? we will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go over again the ſame principles we juſt now eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the more I reflect upon them, the leſs I conceive how we can poſſibly call any of them in queſtion? For can I deny that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ever was in

the World, that he ever had any Diſciples, or that thoſe Diſciples thought him at firſt the promiſed <hi>Meſſias?</hi> But why ſhould I alone queſtion a matter of fact which the <hi>Thalmudiſts,</hi> nay <hi>Julian, Porphirius,</hi> and all other Enemies of Chriſtianity have always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged? This is what I have ſhewn to be abſurd.</p>
                  <p>Can I queſtion but that if <hi>Jeſus</hi> died and roſe not again from the dead, his Diſciples were then unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the opinion they probably entertained, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Son of God? If ſo, either they underſtood nothing at all by theſe two words, <hi>the Meſſias, the Son of God,</hi> or elſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood quite another thing than that he was a Meer Man, who was to remain for ever under the power of Death after his Crucifixion.</p>
                  <p>Can I deny that the Diſciples declared the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> after his Crucifixion? It's ſelf evident. All the Earth has heard of the preaching of the Apoſtles, who all unanimouſly declared that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was riſen again from the Dead: and 'tis purely upon their teſtimony that the World believ'd it.</p>
                  <p>Can we imagin that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> let ſlip a long period of time, as twenty or thirty years after the Crucifixion of their Maſter, and ſo having had time to embolden themſelves, and to contrive an impoſture, they ſuddenly appeared in the World, and preached that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was riſen again from the Dead? If ſo, how could the compilers or forgers of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> make the world believe that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> preached his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> a few Weeks after his Crucifixion? How comes it to paſs that the <hi>Jews</hi> never had the leaſt thoughts of contradicting our Scripture in that reſpect? And what is the reaſon that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> yearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate two feſtivals ſucceſſively one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one for the commemoration of the Death and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94927:18"/>
Reſurrection of the Lord, and the other for that of the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which was purpoſely given them to preach the Goſpel in all places? If the Diſciples had not preached the Reſurrection of their Maſter till a long time after his Death, would it not have been ask'd them, <hi>what have you done ſince your Jeſus was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Roſe he not ſooner from the Dead? Or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do you now preach his Reſurrection ſo long after it?</hi> What could have obliged the <hi>Jews</hi> to aſſert that his Diſciples had ſtolen away his Body by night, if his Reſurrection had been preached ſo very late in the World? And how comes it to paſs that there were <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches eſtabliſhed almoſt every where, by the ſole teſtimony of the Apoſtles, few years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Can we ſuppoſe that it was out of ambition or revenge that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> publiſhed his Reſurrection, as deſigning to make the Chief <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> paſs for Paricides, or immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe their own names to Poſterity? But could the Diſciples think of revenging themſelves on thoſe Men that had ſo clearly ſhewn them their miſtake in the <hi>Meſſias?</hi> Or could they fancy there was any revenge purely in inventing ſuch a ridiculous fable? Would they buy their Revenge ſo dear as at the price of their own lives, and expoſe their perſons to inevitable Torments, and certain death? then as for ambitious thoughts, did they entertain them immediately after the death of him who could only ſupport and confirm them? Had they any reaſon to aſpire after Glory and Grandeur, juſt when all their hopes were deſtroyed with their <hi>Meſſias?</hi> Is it likely a few poor Fiſhermen ſhould have had ſuch thoughts? Certainly had that been their deſign, they would ſoon have relinquiſh'd it, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſcandal affixed to their profeſſion, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94927:19"/>
and barbarous perſecution it continually drew upon them, would have ſoon baniſhed out of their Minds ſo ridiculous and extravagant a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                  <p>But to what purpoſe is it for any one to delude himſelf? 'Tis well known that when a Malefactor is put to the rack, he is forc'd to confeſs his Crime, the torments he endures extorting a confeſſion of his moſt ſecret Actions. This is a way almoſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcover truth; and human Juſtice often puts it in execution for that purpoſe; How were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible therefore that ſo many impoſtors together, that had been ſo often examined, and urged by Fire and Sword to recant what they had aſſerted, ſhould yet ſo conſtantly perſiſt in a falſe depoſition? For 'twas not only one ſingle witneſs, but a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Witneſſes, who were not compell'd to ſuffer one ſingle puniſhment only, but all ſorts of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 'Twas not only in one ſingle place, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every place where they preached, they were urged to recant their opinion by the ſevereſt torments. Neither was it for one ſingle Moment, but for every Moment of their lives that they were thus expoſed to perſecution. Not one ſingle party was on their ſide? But <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> Kings and Magiſtrates, Prelates and People, openly declared themſelves their Adverſaries. They were not only aſſaulted with Perſecutions, but reviled, contemned, and reproached, yet for all that not one of them recanted his Opinion. Being Separated or Confronted, they all unanimouſly depoſed, not only that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was riſen from the Dead, but that they had ſeen him after the Reſurrection. If this be the Method commonly uſed to maintain an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, I wonld gladly know how <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf is to be defended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94927:19"/>
But perhaps the Diſciples were themſelves delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Peter</hi> or ſome other Apoſtle, being ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as to remove the body of our Lord out of his Sepulcher, perſwaded the other Diſciples their Maſter was really riſen from the Dead, and ſo they firmly believing his report, went about the World, preaching his Reſurrection. But this Opinion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiarily falls of it ſelf to the ground. For the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> not only teſtify'd that they had all ſeen <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> after his Reſurrection from the Dead, but that the holy Ghoſt fell on them in the likeneſs of <hi>fiery Tongues.</hi> They teſtify'd likewiſe the Truth of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s other Miracles, and 'tis impoſſible they ſhould all have been deceived in reſpect of all thoſe matters of fact at once.</p>
                  <p>Above all, 'tis neceſſary to obſerve this laſt kind of miracle, <hi>viz.</hi> the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt on the Apoſtles in the likeneſs of fiery tongues. For thoſe Apoſtles boldly affirmed that with the help of that very miracle, they were endowed with the gift of divers Languages, ſo that <hi>Greeks, Romans, Parthians, Perſians, &amp;c. heard them ſpeak every one in their own Language.</hi> This is a matter of fact which neither the Apoſtles could have deceived the World in, nor they themſelves have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in. It can't be imagined they could have deceived the World, or that ſome Fiſhermen could have been ſo bold as to pretend they were endowed with the gift of divers Languages, unleſs it had been really ſo; for they would in every place have been immediately convicted of the moſt notorious Cheat in the world. There were at <hi>Rome</hi> men who ſpoke <hi>Greek,</hi> as well as in <hi>Greece</hi> ſome that ſpoke <hi>Latin.</hi> And by reaſon of Trade, it generally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that there are men of all Languages in every Country. Now if St. <hi>Paul</hi> really underſtood no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language but that <hi>Greek</hi> ſpoken in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> can
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94927:20"/>
we ſuppoſe he would have been ſo bold as to boaſt in <hi>Aſia</hi> of his ſpeaking <hi>Latin,</hi> or any other forreign Language? Would he not have certainly met with people, who would have immediately convicted him of falſhood? Neither is it more likely that the Apoſtles could have been themſelves deceived in this reſpect, becauſe 'tis a buſineſs of <hi>inward</hi> ſenſe. I may eaſily be deluded outwardly, and think that I ſee a man indeed, when I ſee but the ſhadow, or fantom of a man. But I can never perſwade my ſelf that I ſpeak ſeveral different Languages, when I ſpeak but one. But when I ſee that men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Countries, who ſpeak different Languages, do all underſtand my ſpeech, there can certainly be no illuſion in that.</p>
                  <p>The Validity of a Teſtimony is no longer incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, when we are ſure of two things; Firſt, that the witneſs is not himſelf deceived; and Secondly, that he does not intend to deceive Others. Now this might eaſily be verified concerning the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For firſt the matters of fact upon which their depoſitions were founded, are ſo evident and notorious, that none can ever be deceived in relation to them. Thus how is it poſſible that the eyes ſhould think they ſaw, what they did not really ſee, that the ears ſhould agree to witneſs nothing but what was agreeable to the Teſtimony of the eyes; that the hand ſhould touch that which both the eyes and the ears perceived, not once only but ſeveral times, not the eyes, the ears and the hands of one ſingle man, but of ſeveral men together, that they ſhould unanimouſly profeſs themſelves to be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an extraordinary power, and that too of working miracles, unleſs they themſelves knew the certainty of it? but tho we ſhould ſuppoſe a man ſo Whimſical as to impoſe upon himſelf after that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious rate, yet ſure we could not without extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94927:20"/>
imagin, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> had utterly loſt their ſenſes by the ſame kind of madneſs; that this madneſs begun exactly after the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that the ſpreading of the Goſpel over the face of the Univerſe was a wonderful contrivance of the ſame; that it was joyned to that <hi>Morality</hi> which is ſo excellent, ſo ſublime, and yet ſo juſt and pious in it ſelf, that the very Enemies of our Religion always reverenc'd it, And Laſtly, that all manner of vertues deriv'd their original from ſuch pretended madneſs, which works a change upon the World, ſanctifies mankind, and exactly fulfills all thoſe Oracles which foretold the calling of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if it appears that thoſe men did not impoſe upon themſelves, much leſs ought they to be ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of having had the will to deceive others; becauſe their <hi>Simplicity</hi> and mean <hi>Education</hi> allowed them not to frame any ſuch deſign; and beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion they were in to ſee themſelves fruſtrated of their hopes by the unexpected Death of their Maſter, would wholly have diverted them from it. Their temporal concerns too could not admit of it, and their ſhame to ſhew themſelves to the World after what had happened, was of it ſelf ſufficient to hinder them from it. Moreover their Conſcience would have check'd them for their ſuperſtitious fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the vain ſhadow of a <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they could ever have agreed together ſo as to contrive that ſtrange and notorious impoſture. But ſuppoſing they undertook it, the Torments inflicted on them would have made them repent ſuch a raſh deſign; and the confeſſion of one ſingle perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them would have ſufficiently diſcovered them all. Laſtly, their Shame and Poverty, the Gaols and the Chains, the Stripes, the Fire and the Sword that were uſed againſt them to make them
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94927:21"/>
recant, ſufficiently warrant us that they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deceive the World. And if one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo diſpoſed is to be looked upon as an unheard of prodigy, how much more unlikely is it that a whole Society could have conceived ſuch an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant deſign?</p>
                  <p>If the Teſtimony of the Diſciples be falſe, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but look upon them as Mad men, or rather as Raſcals, nay perhaps as both. And yet their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently ſhews the glory of their Innocence and Wiſdom, to confound both theſe Calumnies. Let any man but read over the Books of thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Writers, and there he will to his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction find, that <hi>Honeſty, Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>Self denial</hi> is inſeparably interwoven with the moſt pure and moſt judicious <hi>Morality</hi> that ever was.</p>
                  <p>But this Reflexion puts me in mind that I muſt now haſten to the conſideration of the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> not to ſee whether they be human or divine (for that will be conſidered in its own proper place) but whether they be forged or not. For if once we ſhew that they are not forg'd, we need only read them over, to know the Teſtimony the Diſciples bore of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Truth will ſerve for a confirmation of what we have already ſaid, we ſhall begin the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Section with the Conſideration of it.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Wherein we ſhall prove that thoſe Books can never be ſuppoſititious.</head>
                  <p>WHen I examin the Books of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> all the doubts I ſtrive to raiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, amount only to theſe three, I. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Books were not compoſed by ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, who probably might have aſcribed them to the Apoſtles? II. Whether thoſe Books, ſuppoſing they were compoſed by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards corrupted by the <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> III. Whether the Apoſtles the pretended Authors of thoſe Books, did not themſelves fill them up with many fictions for their Maſters honour, and the advantage of their Religion? It is but juſt we ſhould examine whether theſe three ſuſpicions are well grounded or no.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, it is certain that in taking away the evidence of the Books of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> we overthrow that of all other Books, and call in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the account of all things paſt. For who will warrant me that <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Orations are his own, if I can't reaſonably aſſure my ſelf that the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> were written by St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf? But
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94927:22"/>
hold! Perhaps it was eaſier or more advantageous to counterfeit the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> than thoſe of Humane Learning. This is what we muſt a little enquire into.</p>
                  <p>And I. the facility there is in Counterfeiting the the works of an Author, wholly depends upon the ſeveral Circumſtances of time, place, and perſons, upon the ſubject matter of that Book, the temper of mens minds, their different notions, and their various intereſts which muſt be carried on in it. Now to counterfeit Books of Humane Learning ſeems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more eaſy in all theſe reſpects, than to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit thoſe of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. Becauſe they who counterfeit a Book of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning, may take as much time as they pleaſe for it; but here we know not what time can be imagined the Books of the <hi>New Testament</hi> were forged in. If we look back from age to age, we find the Chriſtians had thoſe Books continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, and that they were quoted by the moſt ancient Fathers, who looked upon them as Sacred and Divine.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is eaſy to counterfeit Books of Humane Learning, becauſe there are generally but few peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that intereſs themſelves at all in them, at leaſt but very indifferently: but it would have been a very difficult matter to counterfeit thoſe Books which compelled men to ſuffer Martyrdom, as the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> did. If a man that lends out his money ſeeks the beſt ſecurity he can for it; what then muſt that perſon do, or rather what muſt an infinite number of perſons do, who utterly renounce all things for the ſake of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?</p>
                  <p n="3">III. There has been found ſome who have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited Books of Humane Learning: but none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known that were willing to die in defence of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94927:22"/>
their forgery. Now none here can be ſuſpected to have forged the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> but only thoſe who ſuffered Death in defence of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and conſequently to confirm the Truth of theſe matters of fact on which Chiſtianity it ſelf is founded.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. A man may very well counterfeit a Book of Humane Learning, but not always, nor in all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and 'twould be very ridiculous in a man to forge Letters that muſt have been written not long ago to whole Societies, or Epiſtles that muſt have been depoſited in the hands of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of perſons, and in very many different places. Now this muſt needs be affirmed of all the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, which make up a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And how could the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have poſſibly been made to believe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote an Epiſtle to her; or the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that ſhe had received two Epiſtles from him, and ſo of the reſt unleſs it had been ſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. This argument is ſo much the more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſince he that grants one point in this matter, unavoidably grants the whole: and if you ſhould agree with me, that perhaps one ſingle Epiſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all thoſe of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was not forg'd, you muſt grant the ſame thing of them all; or at leaſt it will be to no purpoſe for the Incredulous to to cavil thereupon. For what if I ſhould grant the four Goſpels to be forg'd, does not the Book of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles contain, nay does it not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuppoſe the ſame eſſential matters of fact, related to us in the Goſpels? ſhould I grant the ſame of the Book of <hi>Acts,</hi> are not the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſufficient to inform us, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> wrought ſeveral miracles, roſe again from the Dead, and aſcended into heaven, and that the Holy Ghoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94927:23"/>
upon the Diſciples on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt?</hi> and that's as much as I deſire. In a word, ſhould I grant all the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be the works of another man, I need but receive thoſe of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or thoſe of St. <hi>John,</hi> to prove the ſame thing. There being never an Epiſtle in all the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but what mentions or implies thoſe eſſential matters of fact, without which there can be no ſuch thing as <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the World.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee whether we can perſwade our ſelves that all the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excepting one fragment, or ſingle Epiſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, are forg'd; and whether we can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch a ſuſpicion which no Heretick, no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, or Incredulous Perſon ever entertained.</p>
                  <p>But how is it poſſible all the Epiſtles of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſhould be forg'd, ſince they muſt have been committed to an infinite number of Perſons, as they were really in the begining of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and ſince <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, that in his time they carefully preſerved in ſeveral Churches the Originals of thoſe Epiſtles which the Apoſtles had wrote to them?</p>
                  <p>Again, in what time, and on what occaſion could this Forgery have been made? Was it during the lives of the <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> No: For could the World conſider thoſe Books as Sacred and Divine, which the Apoſtles themſelves forg'd. Was it then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Death of the Apoſtles? Do we owe it to <hi>Clemens, Polycarp,</hi> and the other Doctors of that Age? By no means: for thoſe Diſciples of the Apoſtles ſeparated themſelves as ſoon as thoſe great Lights of the World were extinguiſhed. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> to decide a controverſy with a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> occaſioned in the Church about the time wherein they were to celebrate the Feaſt of the Chriſtian <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> or <hi>Paſſover.</hi> Thoſe two great men differed much in that point, but yet they both
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94927:23"/>
greed unanimouſly to receive the Writings of the Apoſtles, and to look upon them as the true ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of their Faith and Manners. Moreover, what Probability is there that ſo great a number of Churches could have been induced to receive ſo many falſe Epiſtles, ſo ſoon after the Death of the Apoſtles, and when there was ſo many Perſons yet living who had converſed with them? In truth, this is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant a Notion that we hold our ſelves not at all obliged to refute it.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected that the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> queſtion'd the Authority of ſome Epiſtles, ſuch as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whoſe Author was never certainly known, the ſecond Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> &amp;c. I grant it: but then I preſume that this conſideration makes for us, ſince it cannot be conceived that the Ancient <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> ſhould diſpute ſo long about ſome Epiſtles in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, had the reſt altogether been as liable to ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>But may we not reaſonably imagin that during thoſe ſtrange diſorders which followed the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> either perfect cheats, or but partly perſwaded of that Faith, might have compoſed the Books of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and ſo after having inſerted in them what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtories they pleaſed, aſcribed them to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, to gain the greater veneration and reſpect for their fictions? No certainly, becauſe the devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hinder'd not but that there might be very numerous Churches at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at <hi>Theſſalonica, Philippi,</hi> &amp;c. whom it would have been impoſſible to have perſwaded that the Apoſtles had wrote them ſome Epiſtles which muſt have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready depoſited in their hands. And beſides that, it appears plainly that the Books of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were compoſed before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:94927:24"/>
becauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Church eſtabliſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is often mention'd therein, without the leaſt hint that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was then utterly deſtroyed. Beſides how could it come into any mans mind to forge ſuch Books after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> whoſe deſign was only to humble the pride of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to induce them no longer to hate the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> as being ſtrangers, and to perſwade them that tho God as yet ſuffered the carnal worſhip of their Law, they ought not to expect to be juſtified by that. This I ſay was the end of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eſpecially the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſeems earneſtly to deſire to unite the minds of the two Nations. And Heaven having ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it ſelf againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> by the deſtruction of their City, the confuſion of their Tribes, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and that general diſperſion which made them Tributaries to all other Nations, there was no need of any further reaſons to prove that the <hi>Jews</hi> were not the only Nation called to the Knowledge of the true God. 'Twas enough that this proof was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently written by the hand of God in the juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that people.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, 'tis neceſſary to obſerve that by ſhewing that the New Teſtament was compoſed before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I ſhew alſo that it is as ancient as the <hi>Apostles</hi> themſelves: which affords us one determination very advantagious to our Cauſe. So that this objection being very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to, inſtead of proving any thing againſt us, nothing hinders but that we paſs on to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſecond ſuſpicion we were willing to entertain concerning the Books of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">Proving that the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were never corrupted.</head>
                  <p>'TIs certain that from the Apoſtles time to ours, the New Teſtament was ever look'd upon as ſacred, and not to be corrupted, without impiety and Irreligion. But whether it were Reaſon or Prejudice that made it ſo eſteemed by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I ſhall now examin. It is enough that the eſteem men have of it ſeems as ancient as the Book it ſelf. Its being conſidered as the foundation of all our hopes, and the original of heavenly Revelation, its being read and order'd to be read in Publick and Private from the Age of <hi>Clemens, Polycarp, Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Iraeneus</hi> to ours: I ſay all this ſhews that it could not have been corrupted in its Eſſentials. But this Truth very well deſerves a more ſtrict conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then how is it poſſible that all the World ſhould have unanimouſly conſpired to corrupt this Book? For tho' one ſingle Doctor of the Church ſhould have attempted it, yet the reſt would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have oppoſed it. Tho' all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctors diſperſed up and down the World ſhould have agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, yet the people would never have conſented to't. Tho' the Doctors and the People together ſhould have been inclinable to it, yet ſure their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries would not have failed to reproach them with it. The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> whoſe only aim was to cry down their Religion, would never have concealed it. <hi>Julian, Porphirius,</hi> and all other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Enemies of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would have drawn ſome advantage from it. In a word, tho' the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94927:25"/>
of their Adverſaries had favoured ſo ſtrange an Enterpriſe, yet the different parties, and various <hi>Hereſies</hi> which ſoon after ſprung up among the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> were an invincible obſtacle to it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis well known that immediately after the Death of the Apoſtles, the Church was ſtrangely diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral various Controverſies. For not to ſpeak here of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> that abominable Sect, which deſerves not the honourable name of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> certainly the Opinion of the <hi>Millenarians</hi> (which <hi>Papias</hi> ſeems to have been the Author of) found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Tradition fifteen years after the death of St. <hi>John:</hi> the Controverſy which ſoon after happened concerning the Chriſtian <hi>Paſſover,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Diſputes of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> againſt the <hi>Origeniſts</hi> concerning the Reſurrection, and ſeveral other Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrin, I ſay theſe Diſputes might eaſily have divided the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> in the firſt Century of the Church. Next to them ſucceeded the famous Diſputes of the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> with the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and with what heat and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities they were carried on, is ſufficiently known to all the World. But however fatal all thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies were to the Church, yet they produced that good effect by the direction of Providence, which orders every thing to ſome good end, that they preſerv'd the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> pure and entire, and at preſent ſtrengthen our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief againſt all ſuſpicions we might probably enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in this reſpect.</p>
                  <p>For tho the <hi>Millenarians,</hi> the <hi>Origeniſts,</hi> and the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſhould have attempted to corrupt the Scripture; yet how were it poſſible that the <hi>Orthodox</hi> which were ſo exaſperated againſt them, ſhould have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to be done; or that if the <hi>Orthodoxes</hi> had had any ſuch deſign, their Adverſaries which were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94927:25"/>
ſo incens'd, ſhould have agreed with them in the ſame Intention?</p>
                  <p>Should I further grant this mutual agreement poſſible, doubtleſs the almoſt infinite number of Copies, of Editions, and Tranſlations made at firſt of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> rendered the execution of that deſign impoſſible. For tho' a man had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one ſingle Copy among all thoſe Copies, or tranſlated thoſe Books falſe, yet how could he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt all the other Copies of them which are diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World? or how could he alter ſo many other Tranſlations which have been made of them in different times and in different places?</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing this were feaſible, if the Writings of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ever corrupted, it muſt have been either in their Eſſentials, or in things of little Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; I mean by their Eſſentials, thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous matters of fact related in the New Teſtament, as well as all thoſe others which if true demonſtrate the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Now if thoſe Writings were not corrupted in their Eſſentials, it neceſſarily follows that they contain ſeveral true matters of fact ſufficient to prove the Truth of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> But if they were altered in their Eſſentials, there muſt have been added to them the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Reſurrection, Aſcenſion</hi> into Heaven, the pouring out of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> the power the Apoſtles had of ſpeaking ſtrange Languages, and of imparting miraculous gifts to others. Now I affirm that all thoſe matters of fact could not have been added to the New Teſtament, unleſs the whole Book was forg'd; becauſe the ſubject matter of the New Teſtament conſiſts of nothing elſe but of thoſe matters of fact, or if you will of ſuch things as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently relate to them, and which would certainly be falſe, if thoſe matters of fact were falſe. But let
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94927:26"/>
us joyn Experience to Reaſon, and conſider that if the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had corrupted the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the Books of the New Teſtament would now be quite different from what they were in the former ages; and that having been continually altered from that time untill now, nothing could be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent than ſuch an alteration. Yet 'tis eaſy to perceive the contrary, and it evidently appears by an almoſt infinite number of places of the New Teſtament quoted in the Books of the Fathers, that there never was a Book that ſuffered leſs alteration by the revolution of years than that did.</p>
                  <p>There are but two things, in my opinion that may be anſwered to this Argument; the firſt is, that in corrupting the Books of the New Teſtament, thoſe places quoted in the Works of the Fathers might alſo have been altered. But this thought can never enter into any reaſonable mans mind: for he muſt then ſuppoſe that there was a perſon in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Immortal, who might have had time enough to alter ſo many Books compoſed from Age to Age; and a man too ſo much Maſter of other Mens hearts and underſtandings, as to have been able to corrupt a Book the moſt univerſally read, and moſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved that ever was, and to alter alſo with it all the Books of the ancient Fathers, without any body ever perceiving it, or making the leaſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing that may be anſwered, is that this corruption of the Scripture was done before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Fathers begun to write, that is, fifteen or twenty years after the Death of the Apoſtles. But we need only recall to mind all the reaſons that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded us that the Books of the New Teſtament were not forged by the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles: and it will appear they are no leſs concluſive in this place. In ſhort, we need but joyn the Martyrdom of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94927:26"/>
the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> (who were not certainly ſo <hi>Whimſical</hi> as to die in defence of their fictions) with the paſſion the people had for the Writings of the Apoſtles, the Diviſions which diſunited the Church immediately after their Death, the variety of Tranſlations, the number of Copies, the conſtant and perpetual Tradition of the Ancient Fathers, the connexion of the eſſential matters of fact of the Goſpel, which is ſuch, that he that admits of one, is obliged to admit of the other too, (as he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> alſo, and he that denies thoſe matters of fact is no longer a Chriſtian) the number of the Books which the New Teſtament conſiſts of, the Repetition of the ſame matters of fact in them, the want of Time and Opportunity to invent, or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially corrupt them, the impoſſibility of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Book was wholly forg'd, the prodigious multitude of people who muſt have been impoſed upon in that reſpect, the nature of the matters of fact they muſt have been made to believe, <hi>viz.</hi> that whole Societies had received ſome Epiſtles from the Apoſtles, which contained ſuch and ſuch things which they ought to have well remembred) the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of time paſt, which evidently ſhews that from <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> down to us, that is, for ſixteen Ages together, the Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not eſſentially corrupted; the diſtance of places where thoſe Books muſt have been forg'd or corrupted, together with the impoſſibility of making many fictions (which in all appearance thoſe Books would have been full of) paſs for Truth, and that ſo ſoon after the Death of the Apoſtles, when the World had their preaching yet freſh in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; the ſilence of the Enemies of the Chriſtians on that account, who never mentioned any thing concerning that pretended forgery; the diſtinction
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94927:27"/>
the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> made at firſt between the Writings of the Fathers and thoſe of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they looked upon as the abſolute Rule and Standard of their Faith: All theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſay, put together plainly ſhew us, and that too in an evident manner, that it would argue mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the higheſt Degree longer to entertain either of the two former Suſpicions.</p>
                  <p>I paſs on therefore to a third, which is, that the Apoſtles themſelves compoſed fables for the honour of their Maſter. But ſince this is the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of them all, and that which <hi>Julian, Mahomet,</hi> and almoſt every Incredulous perſon of theſe times chiefly urge againſt us, it is but reaſonable I ſhould more particularly and throughly examin it in the following Chapters; for truly upon that chiefly depends the ſolid proof of our Religion.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did not Write what was falſe.</head>
                  <p>TO comprehend diſtinctly that the Authors we ſpeak of did not impoſe upon us in their Writings, it is fit to conſider thoſe Writings in particular one after another. They conſiſt of three principal parts, which are the four Goſpels, the Book of <hi>Acts,</hi> and the Epiſtle of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Mathew</hi> writ the firſt, and his Goſpel is quoted by <hi>Clemens</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> Diſciple and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with the Apoſtles. <hi>Barnabas</hi> quotes it alſo in his Epiſtle. And <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the time of St. <hi>John. Juſtin, Iraeneus,</hi> who lived a little after; <hi>Athenagoras, Tertullian,</hi> and all the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94927:27"/>
other Doctors of the Church which ſucceeded them, unanimouſly received it.</p>
                  <p>There is not only the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> concerning which 'twould be a very difficult matter to entertain any reaſonable ſuſpicions; but the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Mark</hi> was alſo a while after written for a ſecond ſupport of our belief. The ſame Fathers who teſtify of the one, teſtify alſo of the other. <hi>Papias, Clemens Alexandrinus, Juſtin</hi> ſpeak of it; and St. <hi>Iraeneus</hi> relates that <hi>Mark</hi> the Diſciple of St. <hi>Peter</hi> compoſed his Goſpel of thoſe matters he had heard the latter ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Luke</hi> who accompanied St. <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells, wrote a third Goſpel which the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have alſo received.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, St. <hi>John,</hi> the laſt of the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a fourth Goſpel towards the latter end of his days, as the Doctors of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> tell us; and this Apoſtle declares at the end of it that he himſelf is the Author of it: <hi>this is the Diſciple,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which teſtifieth of theſe things which he has ſeen.</hi> chap. 21. 24.</p>
                  <p>It is to be obſerved firſt of all, that the four <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,</hi> who all agree in the plainneſs and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity which appears in their Relations, have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs a very different ſtile from one another. Thus St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſes himſelf after a very ſimple man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner if compared with that of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who being a <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> ought to have written in a more lofty ſtile than St. <hi>John,</hi> who was originally a Fiſherman. And this conſideration removes the Suſpicion we might entertain, that all thoſe Goſpels were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by one and the ſame Author.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may obſerve that altho' theſe Writers agree eſſentially in the matters they relate, there is nevertheleſs ſome ſmall difference betwixt them, which very ſenſibly ſhews us, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94927:28"/>
their Goſpels ſeparately: Divine <hi>Providence</hi> having ſo ordered it the better to confirm ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet our incredulous Adverſaries will not ſtand to this Aſſertion. They will perhaps imagin that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> having got together at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> after the Death of their Maſter, took certain Meaſures to make men believe certain ſuppoſititions matters of fact, which they very exactly and preciſely ſet down, leaſt they ſhould contradict themſelves in the Teſtimony they ſhould give of them; and that after having founded ſeveral Churches by then preaching, ſome of them took ſpecial care to digeſt thoſe very matters of fact in Writing which they had preach'd throughout the World, after having invented them. I think this is the moſt plauſible objection of theirs that is likely to be raiſed againſt this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>But in order to confute this imagination, it might perhaps ſuffice to call to mind what I have before mentioned, the abſurdity there is in ſuppoſing that a few ſimple and ignorant Fiſhermen dejected by the Death of their Maſter, undeceived of the opinion they had entertained that he was their <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and ſo fearful that they fled when he was ſeized upon in order to his Crucifixion, ſhould contrive amongſt themſelves how to deceive other men, when they themſelves were ſo miſerably deluded; that they ſhould dare to invent a matter of fact which would certainly fix an eternal blot and ſcandal upon their Nation, by making the <hi>Jews</hi> be looked upon as ſo many abominable Murtherers; that all the Diſciples ſhould contrive this deſign together; that not one of them ſhould confeſs the Truth; that the diſtance of Places, the ſeverity of Puniſhments, the force of Truth, the Remorſe of Conſcience, the Pleaſures of the World, which they utterly loſt by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94927:28"/>
ſhould not be capable to break off this unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous contrivance of falſhood; that they ſhould glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer for the confirmation of their Fables; that they ſhould add to Conſtancy a virtuous life; that theſe Cheats ſhould preach nothing but <hi>Vertue, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Charity,</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of God and <hi>Humility;</hi> that they ſhould command us to love our Enemies, and bleſs them for the ſake of God which curſe us; that Falſhood ſhould immediately undergo the trial of torments; that the ſimplicity of ſome groſs ſort of men ſhould be capable of that nice Ambition, which conſiſts in making men deſire to immortalize their own names by ſuffering Torments and Death it ſelf; and that the Malice of ſome impoſtors ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to make Charity reign, to eſtabliſh in the World all ſorts of Vertues; to deſtroy the <hi>Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Idolatry, by making the true God be every where adored, and to accompliſh all thoſe Oracles which concerned the calling of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this conſideration will be much ſtronger and more conſiderable, if we conſider the behaviour of the Apoſtles in oppoſition to that of thoſe <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> who ſo much diſturb'd the Church almoſt in its infancy. What Pride, ſelf Intereſt and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was there not ſeen in them? Their thoughts were wholly bent upon making new Sects. Every one of them ſet up for a Ring-leader of factions. <hi>Simon</hi> called himſelf, the great <hi>Vertue</hi> of God, and his <hi>Helena</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt. Menander</hi> who ſucceeded him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he was <hi>Vertue</hi> it ſelf, which was ſent down from Heaven for the ſalvation of mankind. <hi>Baſilides</hi> boaſted that he declared things more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, and far more wonderful than the two former. And among this ſame rank muſt be alſo inſerted <hi>Cerinthus, Carpocrates, Marcion,</hi> &amp;c. who all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to excel one another, in the particular deſign of raiſing themſelves above all: not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94927:29"/>
at this time that which they pretended; that thoſe who had attained to a certain degree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which according to them, was a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, might live as they pleaſed, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to all ſorts of Paſſions. Such you ſee is the Character of Impoſtors.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> invented thoſe matters which they wrote after having preached them, they muſt themſelves have looked upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as a meer Fiction. What is then the Reaſon they ſeem to us ſo different from thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> which we juſt now mention'd? And wherefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of inventing, as the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> ſuch Doctrines as were favourable to their ſeveral paſſions, did they on the contrary preach a <hi>Morality</hi> which wholly tends to mortify all Evil and Irregular affections? Why did they not ſet up for Ring-leaders of factions? Why did not every one of them take a pride in himſelf? Why did they plot together to raiſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man; being ſo unanimous that they never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted one another; ſo humble that there was not one amongſt them that took upon him to be Head and Maſter; ſo diſintereſſed that not one of all the Paſſions incident to men ſeemed to have a ſhare in their conduct?</p>
                  <p>Further it is obſervable, that thoſe Ancient <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> we juſt now mention'd invented many points of Doctrine in oppoſition to one another. They talk'd of <hi>Inviſible Eternal Spirits.</hi> They reaſoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the principle of the World. They gave out many very fantaſtical Ideas of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and of the Holy Ghoſt. They eſtabliſhed a ſubordination of Heavenly Vertues: and becauſe all theſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines did meerly depend upon Speculation, and not on Experience, 'twas an eaſy matter for them to uſe them to ſeduce the Simple and Ignorant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:94927:29"/>
The Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> on the contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd whatever they ſaid, not as thoſe Impoſtors by ſome Eternal Inviſible Spirits, and ſome abſtracted and impenetrable Speculations, but by thoſe matters of fact whoſe knowledg meerly depended upon the Senſes themſelves. Now 'tis well known that the Senſes of the moſt ſimple are as much enlightened as thoſe of the moſt Learned, which evidently denotes they had no manner of deſign of impoſing upon men.</p>
                  <p>But it is not enough to ſhew that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were not of ſuch a character as to invent thoſe things which they preach'd: let us therefore proceed yet further, and endeavour to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that it is abſolutely impoſſible that the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould have invented thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                  <p>But here we obſerve on the one hand, that men are more particularly concerned in the matters of fact which the Apoſtles relate, nay and all mankind. The <hi>Jews</hi> who are repreſented in them as moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Parricides, could not look upon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome concern. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> whom the truth of theſe matters of fact engag'd to ſuffer <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> could not but examine them with attention. And the <hi>Heathens</hi> whoſe Religion thoſe matters of fact would certainly ſubvert, if once acknowledged to be true, were very much concerned not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch a forgery. Laſtly, the <hi>High-Prieſts</hi> were too jealous of their Authority, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> too much averſe to all new Sects, and the <hi>People</hi> too much devoted to prejudice and ſuperſtition, ever to admit of theſe matters of fact without a ſtrict examination.</p>
                  <p>We obſerve on the other hand, that thoſe very men who publiſhed them, were ſo far from being ſparing or cautious in their choice of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances they related, that they ſet down expreſly ſo many that muſt needs have been well known; that either they muſt have been immediately convinced of their falſhood, or we acquieſce in what they told us.</p>
                  <p>For I. if you ask, in what place did they teſtifie and affirm the truth of theſe matters of fact? We anſwer at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in <hi>Judea,</hi> the very places where all theſe things occur'd. And leſt you ſhould any ways queſtion it, we will prove further by the Teſtimony of all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that the Apoſtles eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by their Preaching a Church at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

II. Would you know the time? 'Twas in the ſpace of three years that the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Death, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> were brought to paſs: and a few Weeks after the <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> the Apoſtles begun to Preach publickly in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Would you know the witneſſes of the truth of theſe matters of fact? We can produce a great number of perſons who both lived and converſed with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Would you fain know the nature of the matters of fact here atteſted? We ſhew you that they are very evident and ſingular ones; that the Sick are healed, the Winds and Seas huſh'd, the Dead raiſed, a man put to death who convers'd with his Diſciples, and aſcended into Heaven, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. If you would know their number: we can ſhew that the whole Life of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was but one continual ſeries of Miracles.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Laſtly, Would you know the proofs of all this? The Apoſtles themſelves boaſt of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived miraculous gifts, and that too by a good Title, as we ſhall ſhew in the ſequel of this Work.</p>
                  <p>In the interim do but unite all theſe Circumſtances together, and ſee what an irreſiſtible evidence ariſes from their Union? How could the Apoſtles perſwade ſo many perſons concerned in this thing, ſo many that had both known and ſeen <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Would they not ſoon have loſt all Credit, if ſearch had been made into the places, and the truth of what they affirmed ſtrictly examin'd? Or rather, how is it poſſible that whilſt they ventur'd to publiſh ſuch things in the very places where they muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been brought to paſs, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould not have ſtopt the progreſs of the Goſpel, by diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the World ſo viſible and evident an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture? For the Apoſtles did not publiſh only one ſingle matter of fact of this nature. They affirm'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94927:31"/>
alſo that their Maſter had raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead, together with the Son of the Widdow of <hi>Naim,</hi> and the Daughter of <hi>Jairus;</hi> that he had heal'd almoſt an infinite number of people poſſeſſed with the Devil, Deaf, Blind, and ſick of the Palſy; and that his fame had ſpread throughout all <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor were the Apoſtles content barely to preach all theſe things, they put them alſo down in writing, and their Writings are diſpers'd throughout all the World. Therefore they hid not themſelves, but were willing every one ſhould know the certainty of what they teſtify'd, and examine as much as they pleaſed the matters of fact they related. They gave them out to the World, and expoſed them to be ſearch'd all manner of ways. But ſuppoſing I ſhould grant thoſe Books to be written forty, fifty, or ſixty years after the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſtill is it evident that before that time there was a Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> founded by the preaching of the Apoſtles; and it is certain that the Apoſtles had declared by word of mouth the Miracles and Reſurrection of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> which are the eſſential matters of fact contained in thoſe Books.</p>
                  <p>For how could they otherwiſe perſwade the World to worſhip a crucified man? or convince them that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was the true <hi>Meſſias?</hi> How was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Chriſtians ſhould look upon that Book as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, which went upon a ſuppoſition of what was never done? By what kind of agreement ſhould four perſons who wrote in different times and places, and copy'd not one anothers Writings (as is plain if we read them over with never ſo little attention, and conſider their different manner of relating the ſame things) I ſay by what kind of agreement ſhould they have conſpired to inform us of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, if the Apoſtles had not firſt of all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly and univerſally publiſh'd them? How could
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94927:31"/>
the Apoſtles have perſwaded men to turn <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> had they not declared the <hi>Miracles, Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſince Chriſtianity can't ſubſiſt without theſe matters of fact? Thus we ſee 'tis to no purpoſe for Impoſtors to diſguiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for all their ſhifts and tricks ſerve only to diſcover them.</p>

                  <p>THoſe men who have a deſign to deceive the World, muſt have more <hi>skill, wit</hi> and <hi>cunning</hi> than others; which skill, wit, and cunning will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their works in ſpite of all their Art, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</p>
                  <p>But when I ſtrictly examine thoſe Authors whom we call <hi>Sacred,</hi> I neither find Cunning, Wit, nor Affectation in their Books. Every thing they contain ſeems to me very ſimple, naked and open. They all exactly relate their own Weakneſſes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. They do not conceal their true <hi>Birth</hi> and extraction. They diſcover their <hi>ambition</hi> in their controverſy, who amongſt them ſhould be the greateſt in the flouriſhing Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> their groſs <hi>ignorance</hi> in the Queſtions they asked their Maſter, and one another, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:94927:32"/>
All theſe things plainly diſcover the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and impartiality. But yet there ariſes here a certain ſcruple which ſeems not altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and may deſerve a little conſideration. Who knows (perhaps ſome will object) but that this is an affected ſincerity which prepoſſeſſes our minds in their behalf, only to deceive us the more ſecurely? In order to overthrow this notion, I ſhall not aſſert that the Writers we ſpeak of were originally Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and <hi>Publicans,</hi> and that it would ſeem very ſtrange that men of that Birth and Education ſhould affect ſimplicity, and be capable of ſo refined apiece of policy, of which there can hardly be given an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample amongſt the moſt able Politicians, that ever took upon them to deceive mankind.</p>
                  <p>Neither ſhall I ſay, that ſince the four Evangeliſts compoſed their Writings apart, 'twould be very ſurpriſing that they ſhould all concur in the deſign of impoſing upon the credulity of men, by Writing after ſo ſimple and ingenuous a manner; and that they ſhould not only be entirely conformable to one another in this reſpect, but alſo ſhould agree with the other Writers of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis ſufficient to obſerve, that they ſometimes relate ſuch things, as at firſt view ſuggeſt thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in us which <hi>Piety</hi> utterly rejects, and <hi>Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> makes uſe of to oppoſe the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> by attacking its divine head. This they would never have done, had they only affected an ingenuous ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. Thus it's ask'd, why <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who was ſubject to his holy and ever bleſſed Mother, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the obſervation of the Evangeliſts, ſhould make her this anſwer, which is ſome what rough and ſevere: <hi>Woman what have I to do with thee? my hour is not yet come.</hi> Thus <hi>Julian the Apoſtate, Celſus, Porphirius,</hi> and other Enemies of the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> ſtick not to ſay that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> gave ſome
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94927:32"/>
marks of his weakneſs in the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> where the fear of Death made him ſweat great drops of Blood, and where he cried out ſeveral times, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible let</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.</note>
                     <hi>this Cup paſs from me.</hi> They alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that this exclamation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> when nailed on the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> was an expreſſion of his deſpair.</p>
                  <p>I know not here what to admire moſt, either the impudence of theſe proud Enemies of our Religion, or the force of Truth which ſtill becomes ſtronger the more they endeavour to ſhake it. For as for the firſt, If the Enemies of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> wont believe the report of the Evangeliſts, how came they to know that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> uttered theſe words, which give them occaſion to think he wanted conſtancy? But if they will believe the report of the Evangeliſts, why ſhould they refuſe to believe ſo many miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matters of fact, which the Evangeliſts left to us in writing, after having been eye-witneſſes of the ſame?</p>
                  <p>It is certain that we may find in our principles wherewith to explain thoſe places they bring againſt us. The words which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpoke to his bleſſed Mother, give us only to underſtand, how very jealous he was of the duties of his <hi>Calling.</hi> He ſpoke to her as a Mediatour between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> as the perſon in whom ſhe ought neceſſarily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in order to her Salvation; and who doubts but in that quality he had ſome Authority over her?</p>
                  <p>As for the ſorrowfulneſs he expreſſed in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it might proceed from a double cauſe, the one natural, and the other ſupernatural. He might very well fear Death as <hi>Man;</hi> and the pains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on his Humane Nature might force him to utter ſome innocent complaints. But that was not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94927:33"/>
all that made his torments grievous. He was load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Sins of Mankind, and ſubject to the curſe of the Law. He looked upon God as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but God offered himſelf to him as an angry Judge. The more he loved his Father, the more ſenſible he was of the Grief he ſuſtained in being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from him. The meaſure of his ſufferings conſiſted in the meaſure of his vertue; and what he ſays here to his Father, is rather the Language of his Love, than that of his Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>But if the Incredulous ſhould ſay they are not obliged to ſubſcribe to my explanations, becauſe it is incertain whether they have any other ground than my bare imagination; I am willing they ſhould entertain this ſcruple, and cheriſh it till by eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my principles, I have an opportunity of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet more fully all thoſe difficulties. But in the mean time I hold that nothing can more demonſtrate the ſincerity of the Evangeliſts than thoſe places juſt now mentioned: and I affirm that the ſincerity of the Evangeliſts being well demonſtrated, does invincibly prove the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>

                  <p>For certainly either thoſe who compoſed the Goſpels had a deſign to deceive Mankind in behalf of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Religion, or they had no ſuch deſign at all. If they had any ſuch deſign, they would have taken ſpecial care not to ſet down thoſe Circumſtances of the death of their Maſter, which might give the World an occaſion to ſuſpect he wanted Courage, or thought himſelf forſaken of God. But if in writing the matters of fact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Goſpel, they had no manner of deſign to deceive Mankind; we muſt then of neceſſity look upon them as being very ſincere Authors, who would not deceive us, unleſs they themſelves had firſt of all been deceived. So that all the queſtion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94927:33"/>
is, whether the matters of fact they tell us of are ſuch as are ſhewn only by Illuſion. And we need here only conſider whether all the Diſciples could have fancied they ſaw an infinite number of very ſingular and ſenſible Miracles, ſuch as ſick men heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Dead raiſed to Life, &amp;c. and have believed that they themſelves work'd miracles, when all the while there was no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>'Tis to no purpoſe here to alledge, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts affected an ingenuous ſimplicity to avoid the ſuſpicion of diſhoneſty. For had that been their deſign, they would have taken ſpecial care not to furniſh impious men with places and paſſages on which they might raiſe imaginary triumphs. Nor is there any reaſon to believe that the Evangeliſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated thoſe words, becauſe their ſimplicity was ſo great that they had not judgment to diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were for or againſt their cauſe. For what probability is there that men who had wit enough to deceive other people, ſhould have ſo little in this occaſion? Muſt a man needs be wiſe and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he chuſes to repreſent his Maſter conſtant and undaunted, rather than ſorrowful unto Death? And yet 'tis not one ſingle Evangeliſt that relates the hiſtory of his paſſion after this manner, they all agree in this reſpect. And how could this be ſo? but that they only propoſed to themſelves to ſpeak the plain truth, and they ſpoke it without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the impreſſion it would make on Mankind, without examining whether the Incredulous would take occaſion from thence to ſlander the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while, if what has been ſaid here is not ſufficient, I am willing more particularly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin the matters contained in the Goſpels.</p>

                  <p>THoſe Books contain an infinite number of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, divine and admirable things; but the principal of them are reducible to theſe four heads, I. The <hi>Birth, Genealogy,</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with all the Circumſtances of them, which we ſhall not ſpeak of at preſent, leaſt we ſhould be too tedious, having already mention'd them in our firſt part of this work. II. The Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Office, confirmed by an infinite number of miracles from his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to his <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> III. The holineſs of his life and converſation ſeen clearly in ſeveral occaſions, and ſhining throughout the various Actions of his life. IV. His Doctrin and his Prophecies. From theſe four different heads ſpring forth ſuch beams of Truth as wonderfully il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this whole matter. Let us therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them in their order, and keep ſtill to our uſual method, which is to raiſe as we go along as many difficulties as we can, and urge them on with all their force, to ſtop if it be poſſible the complaints of the Incredulous againſt us.</p>
                  <p>We may very well conſider in the miracles of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> their number, variety, and greatneſs, the noiſe they made in the World, and the manner in which they were received. And firſt the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts make appear the number, variety and greatneſs of them, in telling us that he changed Water into Wine in <hi>Cana,</hi> that he reſtored ſight to the Blind, hearing to the Deaf, and health to the Sick; that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94927:34"/>
he cleanſed the Leprous, healed the ſick of the Palſy, cured one of a withered Hand, another of a Dropſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a third diſeaſed with an Iſſue of Blood, that he caſt out many Devils, raiſed the Dead to Life, appeaſed the ſtormy Winds and Tempeſts, and at ſeveral times wonderfully fed many thouſands in the Wilderneſs. Theſe Miracles are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous indeed, ſeem very much different from one another, and cannot proceed but from a Divine Power.</p>
                  <p>To this we muſt further add, that they are of ſuch a nature as could not be concealed from the knowledge of men, that they muſt neceſſarily have an infinite number of witneſſes, ſo that had the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> purely invented them, they might ſoon have been contradicted by an infinite number of people.</p>
                  <p>And yet it ſeems the moſt inveterate enemies of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> durſt not altogether deny the evidence of them; becauſe they accuſed him of healing the ſick on the Sabbath Day, and pretended he caſt out Devils by <hi>Belzeebub,</hi> the Prince of the Devils: this ſort of calumny being as it were an extorted confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his infinite Power, and a Teſtimony which they bore in ſpite of themſelves to the Truth of his Miſſion.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, 'tis eaſy to believe that the Evangeliſts did not invent of themſelves what they make the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> utter on this account, becauſe they unanimouſly agree in the relation they give us of it; they repreſent <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> refuting this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, and aſſuring us in this occaſion, that blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt would never be forgiven, a thing which could not eaſily enter into any mans mind: In a word, the <hi>Jews</hi> that came after, being compelled to own that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had done ſeveral miracles, were obliged to ſay that he had found out the true pronunciation of the great word <hi>Jehovah,</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:94927:35"/>
and that 'twas by the help of this pronunciation (a pattern whereof he had found in the Temple) that he wrought ſo many miracles. See into what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant opinions men neceſſarily fall into, when they endeavour to ſhun the force of Truth.</p>
                  <p>But not to inſiſt on all theſe vain Chimeras, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks neither of theſe two Truths can reaſonably be conteſted. The firſt is that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have work'd many miracles. This is what his enemies reviled him with, when ſtanding round about his Croſs they ſaid, <hi>he ſaved others, himſelf he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave. Let him now come down from the Croſs, and we will believe him.</hi> The ſecond is, that the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples who followed him, knew for certain whether he wrought any miracles or not. For ſince we have here to do with evident and ſingular miracles above the reach of Human Power, they could not but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know the truth of them.</p>
                  <p>Things being thus ſuppoſed, I further conſider, that of the many Diſciples <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had, there were but two that proved unfaithful to him: but it was not long before they did right to the Truth, tho each of them in a very different manner. The one was moved with a ſenſible regret, and wept bitterly, the other was ſo tormented with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of Conſcience, that he was forced to make himſelf away.</p>
                  <p>Had <hi>Jeſus</hi> been an Impoſtor, how came <hi>Peter</hi> to repent, and <hi>Judas</hi> to deſpair. If he falſly boaſted of many miracles, thoſe two men, thoſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perpetual witneſſes of his Actions, muſt needs have known it; and and if they did certainly know it, whence could then proceed the Repentance of the one, and the Deſpair of the other?</p>
                  <p>'Twould be to no purpoſe to uſe any Evaſions in the hiſtory of <hi>Judas,</hi> which the Writers of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> have repreſented to us as a thing publickly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94927:35"/>
known to the World. <hi>This man</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the firſt Chapter of the Books of Acts verſe 18.) <hi>purchaſed a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his Bowels guſh'd out. And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jeruſalem, inſomuch as that field is called in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tongue, Aceldama, that is to ſay the field of Blood.</hi> Is it poſſible to be more particular in any thing? And could the Author of the <hi>Acts</hi> be ſo fooliſh to imagin he could invent all theſe Circumſtances, and make St. <hi>Peter</hi> utter them without making him ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and himſelf liable to be contradicted</p>
                  <p>In like manner the Evangeliſts tell us all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They ſay that at his death there was a <hi>great Darkneſs,</hi> and a <hi>dreadful Earth-quake,</hi> that <hi>the Rocks burſt,</hi> and <hi>the vail of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</hi> If all this were meer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, thoſe Writers ſhew'd but little reaſon in chuſing ſuch ſtrange Circumſtances to impoſe upon mens belief. Was it ſuch an eaſy matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that on the day <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was crucified, the vail of the Temple rent in twain, and ſeveral other notable Prodigies were ſeen? Was it not a pretty way of getting credit amongſt men? And thoſe men too who related ſuch ſtrange things contrary to the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of every one, and ſo ſoon after they muſt have been brought to paſs, could they gain over to their ſide ſo many thouſand people?</p>
                  <p>As to the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts relate that the Stone of his Sepulchre was ſealed, and a watch ſet over it; that the Soldiers ſaid the next day that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> came by night and ſtole away his body whilſt they ſlept, &amp;c. If you doubt whether the Souldiers were ſuborned by the chief Prieſts, and gave out that the body of <hi>Jeſus</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:94927:36"/>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> had been ſtole away by his Diſciples, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> will inform you of it in ſuch a manner as will infallibly clear all your doubts. <hi>Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſome of the watch came into the City, and ſhewed unto the Chief Prieſts all the things that were done. And when they were aſſembled with the Elders, and had taken Councel, they gave large money unto the Soldiers, ſaying, ſay ye, his Diſciples came by night and ſtole him away while we Slept. And if this comes to the Governours ears, we will perſwade him and ſecure you. So they took the mony, and did as they were taught: and this ſaying is commonly reported among the Jews unto this day.</hi> Chap. 28. v. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Here the Evangeliſt is far from deſigning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Publick in thoſe things he pretends were publickly known. It is therefore to be confeſs'd that a watch was ſet over the Sepulchre of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that ſome of the watch reported ſuch things as are mentioned by the Evangeliſts, or at leaſt that it was ſuppoſed, that that ſame was their report. The queſtion therefore is, whether the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did really ſteal away the body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from the midſt of a company of Soldiers that were appointed to guard it. But do but only reflect a little on the perſon of the Diſciples, who were no better than poor and fearful Fiſhermen, on their Diſperſion, their trouble and heavineſs, the triple denial of the ſtouteſt of them all, together with all other Circumſtances of that Event; and it will appear that they were ſo far from executing ſo dangerous an undertaking, that it was impoſſible ſuch a deſign could have ever entred into their heads.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> was ſo truly convinced of the Truth of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> that he wrote to <hi>Tiberius</hi> about it. And 'twas on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Letter, that this Emperour went
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94927:36"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o the Senate, and propoſed the inſertion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> among the Gods. We have no Reaſon to ſuſpect this hiſtory, eſpecially if we conſider that <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelf relates it in the Apology which he addreſſes to the Senate and the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, who needed only to have conſulted their Regiſters to find the actions of <hi>Pilate,</hi> as they were ſo often deſired to do by all thoſe who wrote Apologies in behalf of the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time we have no great occaſion of this outward Teſtimony, becauſe there can be nothing more inſeparably interwoven than theſe truths are: And we need only read carefully the Goſpels over to be ſatisfied therein. We have ſeen the miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with all their Circumſtances; we ſhall now ſhew that his holineſs of life was no leſs extraordinary than his Miracles.</p>

                  <p>IF <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was neither the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> nor the Son of God, and if he falſly boaſted that he wrought many Miracles, his Diſciples muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have conſidered him as an Impoſtor, as ſoon as his Death fruſtrated the hopes and promiſes they received from him. And if they conſidered him as an Impoſtor, there is little appearance they ſhould propoſe him as a model of Vertue and Perfection to mankind.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing they had this deſign, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably imagin that having neither the Learning nor Eloquence of the Authors of that Age, they would have had no better ſucceſs in drawing an
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94927:37"/>
imaginary Character of their Maſter, than others in repreſenting the Excellencies of thoſe great men it was their intereſt to flatter. Yet if we chuſe the politeſt Writings of this kind, the lives of great men compoſed with all art imaginable, Panegyricks that coſt thirty years labour; add to theſe all the collected notionsof Vertue, the Wit and Obſervation of the moſt paſſionate, judicious, and elegant Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors can furniſh us with; joyn, the <hi>Cato's</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides</hi>'s together, nay ſeparate their Vertues from their imperfections, and aſcribe to them all the good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities we find diſperſed in other men; I will yet maintain that all theſe Ideas, Notions and Characters come far ſhort of that perfection the Evangeliſts make us conceive of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that too without Hyperbole or Art, but by a bare and ſimple recital of his Actions.</p>
                  <p>The Heroes of whoſe vertue the Ancient <hi>Heathens</hi> ſo much boaſt, directed their Actions to no other end than the glory of their Country, or their own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition: Whereas <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> referr'd all his Actions to the Glory of God. It may properly be ſaid of them, that they aimed at nothing elſe but to furniſh an infinite number of perſons joyned together in a Society wherewith to ſatisfy their moſt inordinate paſſions, as we have already obſerved elſewhere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Cato.</hi> Whereas <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> deſign'd only to ſubdue the vicious deſires and inclinations of mens hearts. The Ancient <hi>Sages</hi> would ſometimes renounce Riches and Honours, but 'twas only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſlaves to Glory. If they overcame ſome ſmall paſſions, 'twas only to ſubmit themſelves to the the Tyranny of greater. They ſacrificed their other affections to their Pride and Ambition of Fame. Nay they were ſo puff'd up with the conceit of their own Wiſdom, that they imagin'd themſelves happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Gods, fancying they ow'd the temper
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94927:37"/>
and inclination of their minds to none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that they were free from any paſſion, and were ſole Lords of all. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> on the contrary teaches us firſt to renounce vain glory. This is the firſt principle of his Religion. <hi>God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> And he is ſo far from having us imagin we can be happy without the concurrence of God, that he ſhews us the wretched weakneſs and corruption of <hi>man</hi> when ſeparated from his Maker. This the continual uſe of that prayer he taught us, would fully inſtruct us in, tho' his Morals and moſt holy Life ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After what manner can we think the Eternal Son of God muſt have lived in the World, ſuppoſing he came into it, unleſs as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> What other language ought he to have ſpoken but that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> What kind of Vertues ought he to have practiſed but his Vertues?

But who will aſſure us that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> did not flatter their Maſter in his Character, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him as he ought to be, not as he was? This thought has yet leſs ſolidity than the former. For if this here be but a witty conceit of thoſe Writers, I ask how could ſome poor, ſimple and ignorant Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen invent ſuch a model of Vertue, as was never ſeen or thought of before, and whoſe Idea is ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what all <hi>Antiquity</hi> gives us of its Heroes? Beſides, the <hi>Evangelists</hi> make no Eulogies upon their Maſter, nor aggrandiſe his Vertues, nor affect to give us a more particular view of his beſt Actions: but they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give us a bare and ſimple Recital of them, without any Art or Deſign; Nay ſuch is their ſincerity, or if you will their want of judgment (for we freely permit the Incredulous to make what ſuppoſitions they pleaſe) that they related ſuch things as at firſt ſhock our thoughts, and which Impious men chiefly inſiſt upon, ſuch as this complaint of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, My God, My God,</hi> &amp;c. Beſides this, the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with which they relate all the actions of their Maſter, will ſufficiently convince us of their <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> For is it probable the Evangeliſts ſhould have invented or forg'd the murmurings of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who reproach'd them ſaying, <hi>Why do ye eat and drink with Publicans and Sinners?</hi> &amp;c. And that controverſy betwixt the ambitious Diſciples, on whoſe account it was that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> having taken up a little Child, told them they muſt be like that Child, if they would qualifie themſelves for the Kingdom of Heaven, &amp;c. a wonderful diſcourſe indeed both for its ſhortneſs and ſimplicity, which ſufficiently ſhews us the very Soul of our bleſſed Lord! 'Tis not one ſingle Writer of all theſe, that relate thoſe Actions, there are three of them, who wrote after ſuch a manner as manifeſtly evinces they copy'd not one anothers Writings. And if you would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94927:40"/>
be further ſatisfy'd, the Apoſtles themſelves prove the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of life of their Divine Maſter, by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Actions. The <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> ſhew us how well the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> lived by following their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. If you ſhould deſire we ſhould produce ſome authentical teſtimonies of <hi>Holineſs, Vertue,</hi> ſweet and peaceable <hi>temper</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> there are abundance to be had in the Writings of their very Enemies.

                  <p>Thus the truth appears on all ſides; and I ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perceive it as ſoon as I frame any Idea to my ſelf of the life and actions of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Yet I am willing however, that the Incredulous ſhould not wholly conform their judgment to mine; and if this Argument does not move and convince them as much as it does me, they need only paſs on to the conſideration of others.</p>

And when ye ſhall hear of Wars, and Rumours of Wars, be ye not troubled: for all theſe things muſt come to paſs, but the end is not yet. For Nation ſhall riſe againſt Nation and Kingdom againſt Kingdom: and there ſhall be Earthquakes in divers places, and there ſhall be famines and troubles: for all theſe are but the beginnings of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, &amp;c. When ye therefore ſhall ſee the Abomination of Deſolation ſpoken of by Daniel the Prophet, standing where it ought not (whoſo readeth let him underſtand) then let them which be in Judea, flee into the mountains. Let him which is on the houſe top, not come down to take any thing out of his houſe, &amp;c. But wo unto them that are with Child, and to them that give Suck in thoſe days.

And except that the Lord had ſhortned thoſe days, no fleſh ſhould be ſaved, but for the Elects ſake, &amp;c. And then if any man ſhall ſay unto you, lo here is Chriſt, or lo he is there: believe it not.

They will be no longer ignorant of the <hi>Abomination</hi> of <hi>Deſolation</hi> ſet up in the holy place which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of, when they ſhall ſee the <hi>Jews</hi> ruſhing into the Temple, and there cutting one anothers throats on a ſolemn feaſt day. But if they would further conſult our Eccleſiaſtical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, or the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> they would find them all agree in this Relation, that the faithful Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, who were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> fled to a little City called <hi>Pella,</hi> after having been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of it by the Spirit; and there will be no longer reaſon to think theſe Words of Jeſus Chriſt obſcure, <hi>But pray ye that your flight be not in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. There are few people but what perceive the exact Conformity of this prophecy with its E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; and we need not at all queſtion the certainty of it: But 'tis not ſo very certain that it was not compoſed after the Event, and it will concern us to enquire into it.</p>
                  <p>It appears then firſt, that the Goſpels wherein 'tis related, were compoſed before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe St. <hi>Luke</hi> wrote not the Book of <hi>Acts,</hi> till ſome time after he had compoſed his Goſpel, as he teſtifies himſelf in theſe Words: <hi>The former treatiſe have I made O Theophilus of all that Jeſus begun both to do and to teach,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 1. 1. Beſides, it ſeems that St. <hi>Luke,</hi> had written the Book of <hi>Acts</hi> before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> becauſe he is ſo far from ſpeaking of that Event, that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he ſpeaks of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as of a City that was ſtill in being, and wherein there was a flouriſhing <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps this is not ſo much inſiſted upon; It may be further ask'd whether that prophecy might
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94927:42"/>
not have been inſerted in the Goſpel by ſome Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who having ſeen the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> might have took occaſion from thence to honour their Maſter, by pretending he had foretold it.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of this doubt, we ſhall obſerve firſt, that tho' this <hi>Prophecy</hi> be the ſame in ſubſtance in the three Goſpels wherein 'tis related, yet 'tis expreſſed after a very different manner, which is ſufficient to perſwade us that it was not inſerted by one and the ſame Author in the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and in the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Luke.</hi> For to examin the beginning of it only, it appears that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates it thus, Chap. 24. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſee ye not all theſe things? Verily I ſay unto you, there ſhall not be left here one ſtone upon another that ſhall not be thrown down. And as he ſat upon the Mount of Olives, the Diſciples came unto him privately ſaying, tell us when ſhall theſe things be,</hi> &amp;c. Now St. <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſes himſelf thus, Chap. 21. <hi>And as ſome ſpake of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how it was adorned with goodly ſtones, he ſaid, as for theſe things which ye behold, the days will come in the which there ſhall not be left one stone upon another.</hi> Here he does not ſay as St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that the Diſciples as he ſat upon the Mount of <hi>Olives asked him ſaying, Maſter, but when ſhall theſe things</hi> be? &amp;c. Laſtly, after this manner alſo St. <hi>Mark</hi> begins this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chap. 13. <hi>And as he went out of the Temple, one of his Diſciples ſaith unto him, Maſter, ſee what ſtones and buildings are here. And Jeſus anſwering ſaid unto him, ſeeſt thou theſe great buildings? there ſhall not be left one ſtone upon another that ſhall not be thrown down. And as he ſat upon the Mount of Olives over against the Temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew asked him privately, tell us when ſhall theſe things be,</hi> &amp;c. This laſt Evangeliſt perfectly explains and reconciles the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94927:42"/>
other two together, by delivering all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the matter of fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was two ſeveral times asked concerning the buildings of the Temple, and that the laſt time was as he ſat upon the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> from whence one might very well ſee the Temple, and where that proſpect gave occaſion to his Diſciples to deſire that he would explain what he ſaid of its Demoliſhing, when he was yet in the Temple it ſelf. In the mean while it is to be confeſſed that the little difference we perceive in this reſpect between the Evangeliſts, utterly overthrows the ſuſpicion we might entertain, that this Prophecy was forged by ſome body or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had inſerted it in all the three Goſpels.</p>
                  <p>But II. it's worth our obſervation that the Diſciples having confounded together two very remote E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents in the queſtion they asked their Maſter, <hi>viz.</hi> the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the end of the World, ſaying, <hi>tell us when ſhall theſe things be? And what ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and of the End of the World?</hi> Mat. 24. 3. <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> anſwered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out undeceiving his Diſciples, and without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing what they had thus confounded together. Now what likely-hood is there that a man who had ſeen the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but could not imagin it ſhould be attended with the End of the World, ſhould make the Diſciples utter ſuch a Queſtion, without making <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> anſwer the leaſt thing for the clearing of it?</p>
                  <p>But rather III. how ſhould he have been able to joyn in this Prophecy the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the <hi>coming of the Son of Man in the Clouds with great Power and Glory?</hi> How could that Man who had been an eye-witneſs to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> have reaſonably ſaid, that preſently after the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation of thoſe days, <hi>the Sun ſhould be darken'd,</hi> and <hi>the Moon ſhould not give her light;</hi> that <hi>the Stars</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:94927:43"/>
                     <hi>ſhould fall from Heaven, and the powers of Heaven be ſhaken;</hi> that <hi>mens hearts ſhould fail them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things,</hi> and that <hi>the World ſhould mourn,</hi> &amp;c. How were it poſſible he ſhould have intermixed all thoſe Circumſtances with the hiſtory of that matter of fact, the falſhood of which he muſt needs well know, if he compoſed the Prophecy after the Event?</p>
                  <p>But do we not fall here from one difficulty into a greater? For if all thoſe ſigns which were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did not really come to paſs, wherein then lies the truth of this ſame prophecy?</p>
                  <p>To anſwer this Objection ſome think it ſufficient to ſay, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> expreſſed himſelf in this place after the uſual manner of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who ſay, that <hi>Nature trembles,</hi> and <hi>Heaven and Earth is moved,</hi> when God viſiteth men after ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner either in his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice.</hi> They further add, that the Judgments of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on the <hi>Jews,</hi> are repreſented to us as a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and as a <hi>Singular coming,</hi> by reaſon of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible plagues he inflicted on them. But what ſeems to me more reaſonable and natural than this is, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> thought it not convenient to undeceive his Diſciples who being prepoſſeſs'd with a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Opinion of their Nation, thought that <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſhould laſt as long as the World, and that the ruine of the one, ſhould be the ruine of the other. He therefore ſeemed to ſide with their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and repreſented thoſe two Events to them by the ſame ſigns.</p>
                  <p>And indeed I conceive there might be ſeveral Reaſons which obliged <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſo to act. For not to alledg here that Obſcurity is the true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of all <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and that it was neceſſary this here ſhould be ſomewhat overſhadowed, as well as the reſt, leſt any one ſhould foreknow the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94927:43"/>
time of its Accompliſhment, God having reſerved that knowledge to himſelf, as it is delivered to us in this ſame Prophecy, was it not alſo Neceſſary that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould follow the ordinary Cuſtom of all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which is to unite ſeveral very remote events together in one ſingle <hi>Prophecy,</hi> to ſhew that the remoteſt things are nigh one another in the ſight of God? Beſides, the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being the greateſt and moſt perfect <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the End of the World, what could be more wiſely thought of than to repreſent the one to us by the other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Notion of the Diſciples, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded thoſe two Events together.</p>
                  <p>There happened <hi>Peſtilences, Wars</hi> and <hi>Famines</hi> immediately before the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> there will alſo happen the like immediately before the end of the World. As the Tribes which dwelt in the holy Land, mourn'd to ſee the effects of the Curſe of Heaven falling upon their Nation; ſo ſhall all the Tribes of the Earth mourn, and be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, when God ſhall deſtroy this inferiour World, and proceed to the laſt Judgment. As the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> happened not till the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was preached throughout the World, that is, in all the parts of the known World: ſo in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance the end of the World will not happen till all the Nations which lay concealed and unknown have been converted to the Faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As there were ſeen falſe <hi>Christs,</hi> and falſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> before the final deſtruction of the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſo there will be alſo falſe Teachers who ſhall endeavour to ſeduce men, before the End of the World; and it will be often ſaid, <hi>lo here is Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>lo he is there,</hi> before the laſt day of Judgment. As before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem Jeſus Chriſt</hi> gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſome Chriſtian Churches the Elect, from the four Winds of Heaven, and that by the preaching
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94927:44"/>
of the Apoſtles his <hi>Myſtical</hi> Angels; ſo likewiſe at the end of the World, he will ſend his Angels to raiſe his Elect from the Duſt and Obſcurity of the Grave. <hi>For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4. 16. As there were ſeen ſeveral Comets and terrible Signs that foretold the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> as the Smoak of the City and Flaming Temple hid the light of the day, and darkned the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars;</hi> ſo without doubt the end of the World will be alſo attended with Signs and Prodigies much more terrible. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Earth ſhall be burnt up, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Epiſtle 3. 10. As the Deſtruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after an unexpected manner; ſo alſo ſhall the laſt day come as <hi>a thief in the night.</hi> As <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and the Temple were utterly deſtroyed as ſoon as the <hi>Jews</hi> had compleated the meaſure of their ſins: ſo this World which we inhabit muſt periſh as ſoon as the end or <hi>Calling</hi> of all Nations ſhall be fulfilled, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſays in that <hi>Prophecy</hi> we now have under Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, one may reaſonably imagin the Diſciples to be always prepoſſeſſed with this Opinion, that the End of the World would immediately follow the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For when it was reported among the Diſciples that St. <hi>John</hi> ſhould not die, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid to one of them ſpeaking of <note place="margin">John 21. 22.</note>him, <hi>If I will that he tarries till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> They ſtretch'd that <hi>till I come,</hi> as far as the end of the World: but they might have confined it to the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> a time which the Apoſtles in reality ſaw, and in which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> viſited the <hi>Jews</hi> in his juſtice. Further, this Tradition being ſpread abroad, that the day of the Lord drew nigh, the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:94927:44"/>
were ſo terrifi'd at it that St. <hi>Paul</hi> to comfort them, again ſent them the following aſſurances to the Contrary. <hi>Now we beſeech you, Brethren, that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by ſpirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Chrst is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day ſhall not come, except first,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Theſſ. 2. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>In a word, there is no reaſon to wonder that that Prophecy of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſo faithfully related by his Diſciples, ſhould have left this Impreſſion in their minds. For <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> on the one hand had given ſuch marks and ſigns of his coming, that it ſeemed as if the laſt judgment was immediately to follow it; ſaying, that he ſhould appear <hi>as the lightning that cometh out of the Eaſt; and ſhineth even unto the Weſt:</hi> and on the other hand he had declared ſeveral times that all thoſe things ſhould happen to that generation, <hi>that many of thoſe who were preſent</hi> with him, <hi>ſhould not taſte of Death until they had ſeen all thoſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since then <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> united thus two ſeveral Events in one and the ſame Deſcription, but two ſubordinate Events, as like unto one another as the Copy and the Original may be, it follows thence that his <hi>Prophecy</hi> muſt have had two accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, the one very nigh, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. This in my opinion is the true way of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelling all thoſe Difficulties. The Diſciples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together two very remote Events, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſuffered them to continue in that Opinion. 'Tis neceſſary that the <hi>Event</hi> ſhould juſtifie the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> but not that the Prophecies ſhould be contrary to their Event. It is neceſſary therefore they ſhould be obſcure before their Completion, but clear and eaſy when once accompliſh'd.</p>
                  <p>But however probable what I've laid down may ſeem to be, I ſhould be very ſorry any one ſhould
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94927:45"/>
think I lay the ſtreſs of my argument upon it. I make a diſtinction between bare Conjectures, and true and certain Principles; and I leave all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations I have juſt now given to the Readers judgment, to uſe according to his Diſcretion. I am indifferent whether he uſes my Notions, or thoſe of any other Man, to ſolve certain difficulties which may occur therein: I ſhall only inſiſt upon two cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truths, which in my opinion admit of no Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. The firſt is, that this Prophecy is ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially related, that it is abſurd to imagin it compoſed after the event: or that a man took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (at which none but <hi>Titus</hi> and his Army were ſeen) to make Jeſus Chriſt ſay, when he foretold that Devaſtation, that <hi>he would come in the Clouds of heaven;</hi> that <hi>he would ſend his Angels to gather his Elect from the four winds;</hi> that <hi>they would ſee him coming with power and great glory; as the lightning that cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt;</hi> that all <hi>the Tribes of the Earth ſhould mourn at his coming;</hi> and that <hi>day ſhould come as ſuddenly as the fire of Sodom and Gomorrah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Truth which ſeems to me altogether unqueſtionable, is, that notwithſtanding that little darkneſs with which the Wiſdom of God thought fit to overſhadow this prophecy, it was nevertheleſs in all Reſpects ſo very exactly related in all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and ſo clearly fulfilled, that ſuppoſing it compoſed before the Event, we cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to proceed from a <hi>Prophetical</hi> Spirit. For what can we Read in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but what is included in this Prophecy? The <hi>beginning,</hi> the <hi>continuation</hi> and <hi>ending</hi> of the Misfortunes of the <hi>Jews</hi> are all to be found in it. It does not foretel a particular Captivity of that people, but a general diſperſion of the whole Nation: <hi>and they ſhall be led Captives into all Nations,</hi> Luk. 21. 24. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:94927:45"/>
wept over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on another occaſion at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into it, and uttered theſe Compaſſionate Words, <hi>O that thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes. For the days ſhall come, that thine Enemies ſhall caſt a Trench about thee, and compaſs thee round, and keep the in on every ſide, and ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That they continually offer Violence to thelr Reaſon, by reſiſting the Truth which appears ſo ſtrong and invincible on all hands; and that tho' their <hi>Reaſon</hi> is ſometime perverted and blinded by their Paſſions, ſo that they cannot ſee things in their due light; yet the <hi>Objects,</hi> the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of things, and the <hi>Truth</hi> which is immutable, never ſhift or turn a ſide to follow the fooliſh fancies of their Underſtanding, or the perverſe Inclinations of their Heart?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For the perfect underſtanding of this Matter, it is ſufficient to obſerve the time in which the Diſciples begun to declare it.</hi> And when the day of Pentecoſt was fully come, <hi>ſays St.</hi> Luke, they were all with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in one place. And ſuddenly there came a ſound from Heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty Wind, and it filled all the houſe where they were ſitting. And there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And there were dwelling at Jeruſalem, Jews, devout Men, out of every Nation under Heaven. Now when this was noiſed abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that every man heard them ſpeak in his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, &amp;c. But Peter ſtanding up with the eleven, lift <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>p his voice, and ſaid, &amp;c. Then they that gladly received his Word, were baptiſed: and the ſame day there were added unto them about three thouſand Souls, &amp;c. And fear came upon every Soul, and many wonders and ſigns were done by the Apostles, <hi>Acts Chap. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 41, 43.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this matter of fact was not invented, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the bare Conſideration of it: becauſe this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94927:47"/>
is a thing as muſt have been brought to paſs at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> upon a ſolemn feaſt day, before men of all ſorts of Nations, and as I may ſo ſpeak, in the ſight of all the Univerſe; and which Conſequently is ſuch as could not poſſibly have been forg'd or invented.</p>
                  <p>What then can be objected to ſhake the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Hiſtory? Can it be ſaid that this Matter of fact was inſerted in the Writings of St <hi>Luke,</hi> long after the Death of that Author? But then it muſt at the ſame time be confeſſed, that the whole Book was forg'd, becauſe that is an eſſential and fundamental matter of fact, on which the other things contained in the Book of <hi>Acts</hi> altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. Thus for inſtance, the preaching of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and the ſucceſs of it wholly depend upon it. Whatever is contained in their Epiſtles abſolutely relates to it. And laſtly, every thing in the New Teſtament is forg'd, if the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt on the Apoſtles be a meer Invention.</p>
                  <p>Shall I believe that St. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf invented this matter of fact, and that no one ever ſpoke of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? If ſo, what was it the Apoſtles ſaid to thoſe they preach'd the Goſpel to? What did they ground their preaching upon, but only on the <hi>Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt? What other right but that had they to preach?</p>
                  <p>Did the Apoſtles themſelves to deceive Mankind, pretend that they had received the Holy Ghoſt? This is the only plauſible ſuſpicion the Incredulous can entertain; yet for all that it is abſurd. For when was it they made this Pretenſion? It muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be either after they had founded a Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or ſome time before. If it was after they had founded a Church therein, how was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this Church ſhould have been afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the Apoſtles had received the Holy Ghoſt; that they had publickly ſpoken all ſorts of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94927:47"/>
Languages, and that their preaching attended with ſeveral ſtrange prodigies, had been the occaſion of the forming that Church?</p>
                  <p>But if the Apoſtles pretended they had received the Holy Ghoſt, before there was ever any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church eſtabliſhed in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nay if it were by a falſe atteſtation of this matter of fact, and many other ſuch that they founded this Church: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles muſt of neceſſity have learned all the Languages in the World ſince the death of their Maſter, and together with that the ſecret of making the lame walk, and healing the ſick: becauſe theſe are what they call the gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But perhaps 'tis a queſtion whether there was ever any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church founded at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> If ſo, then muſt the Ancient Doctors of the Church who lived in different times and in different places, have conſpired together to deceive us in this reſpect; and the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> and all other profeſs'd Enemies of our Religion, as well <hi>Ancient</hi> as <hi>Modern,</hi> who never conteſted the truth of this matter of fact, muſt utterly have loſt their Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>In a word, ſuppoſing the Book of <hi>Acts</hi> compoſed long after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, when there could be no longer any flouriſhing Church in that City, yet there is no point gained. For it is true ſtill that the Apoſtles ſet down the matter of fact we ſpeak of, and that their Epiſtles are filled with ſuch things as viſibly relate to it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here further add that the Book of <hi>Acts</hi> mentions nothing of the Death of the Apoſtles; which manifeſtly ſhews that it was compoſed during their lives, and conſequently in a time wherein the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> flouriſh'd: nor that it mentions nothing of the laſt deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> no not ſo much as any of the ſigns or preſages of it; which induces us to believe that that Book was compoſed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94927:48"/>
ſome time before that great Event; it being very probable that the Author who compoſed it meerly for the Glory of the Apoſtles and of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> (as the Incredulous undoubtedly imagin) would never have failed to have inſerted in it the Hiſtory of all thoſe dreadful Misfortunes which fell upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which the Chriſtians look upon as the effect of their rejecting the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſince my deſign is not to leave the Reader the leaſt ſhadow of a doubt, I promiſe to prove by and by, that the Apoſtles both received and imparted many miraculous gifts. In the mean while till the Method I have preſcribed to my ſelf, gives me leave to enter upon that ſubject, I think it fit to make ſome few Reflexions concerning the ſucceſs of the Apoſtles's preaching, which is that eſſential head to which all other matters contained in the Book of <hi>Acts</hi> relate.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Wherein we ſhall take into Conſideration what ſucceſs the Preaching of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had.</head>
                  <p>THis matter of fact is related with very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Circumſtannces. As I. That thoſe men who firſt preached the Goſpel were Fiſhermen, that is, groſs and ignorant people, of no appearance, or authority in the world. II. That thoſe men went about preaching that they had ſeen Jeſus Chriſt riſen from the Dead, and aſcending into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that they had long before been Eye-Witneſſes to his Miracles. III. That they offended by their preaching all the Powers of the World, and expoſed their perſons to an infinite number of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94927:48"/>
Dangers and Misfortunes. IV. That they ſuffered them with Patience, or rather with Joy. V. That the ſucceſs of their preaching was ſo ſwift and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as is almoſt inconceivable.</p>
                  <p>In all this St. <hi>Luke</hi> has told us nothing but what our own Reaſon would tell us. We may conclude that they were men of no extraordinary birth, or credit in the World that firſt preached the Goſpel, ſince no body has ever ſaid any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>'Tis manifeſt that thoſe men ought to have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that they had ſeen Jeſus Chriſt work many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſeen him riſen from the Dead, and aſcending into Heaven: becauſe they would never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſo many Nations as they did, had they only ſaid they knew all thoſe things by hear ſay: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles inform us that that was the ſubject of their preaching.</p>
                  <p>There is no doubt but all the Powers of the World perſecuted theſe men: for as much as Policy is an Enemy to all new Sects, and the People themſelves are always Jealous of their Religion.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be doubted neither, but that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles very couragiouſly ſuffered the effects of that perſecution: becauſe had they recanted, or drawn back for fear of puniſhments, their deſign would have miſcarried in its very beginning.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, who can deny but that the ſucceſs of their preaching was very ſwift and ſudden; in as much as in a ſhort time there were ſeveral Churches eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in all parts of the known World? This is a matter of fact which was never conteſted.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as well as St. <hi>Luke,</hi> tells us all theſe things. The Book of <hi>Acts</hi> informs us of the Truth of them; and the Nature of things will not ſuffer us to doubt but that they were ſo: which ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94927:49"/>
deſtroys the ſuſpicion we might entertain, that they were all forg'd or invented.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I cannot conſider all theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, nor unite them together, and obſerve the proportion they have one with another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſently believing the Truth of that <hi>Religion</hi> which they ſo plainly Prove and Eſtabliſh.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Wherein we ſhall examin the matters contained in the Epiſtles of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THo' the Ancients had not unanimouſly received the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> tho' <hi>Clemens, Polycarp,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> had made no mention of the ſecond Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> yet it would be ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that they were written to ſome Churches, that is, to whole Societies, who for a long while preſerved the Originals of them, to aſſure us that they were not forg'd.</p>
                  <p>'Tis then our concern to ſee whether we can find therein any Characters of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We cannot Read St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles without obſerving therein I. The <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> of that Apoſtle. II. His <hi>Impartiality</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the advantages of the World. III. His <hi>Courage</hi> in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during afflictions, which inſtead of diſheartning, rather overjoy'd him. IV. A continual <hi>repetition</hi> of the Teſtimony which the Apoſtles bore of the Truth of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Lord. V. Such things which manifeſtly denote that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. and that thoſe that then believed very frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:94927:49"/>
The <hi>Piety</hi> of that Apoſtle ſo variouſly diſcovers it ſelf in his Writings, that we cannot think it diſſembled without offering Violence to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For tho' a man ſhould conſtrain himſelf upon ſome occaſions, yet is it poſſible he ſhould after the very ſame manner during a great part of his life, in all his Actions, in all his Words, in his manner of telling of things, which oftener diſcovers the bottom of the heart, than the things he ſpeaks of. I know very well Hypocriſy covers it ſelf with the external ſhew of Vertue: but really there is yet ſomething which I can't expreſs, a ſimple and natural air in <hi>true</hi> vertue, which is not to be met with in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy: or rather Hypocriſy is neither ſo ſubtle, nor clear ſighted, but that it diſcovers it ſelf on one ſide or other, nay often it lets drop a wordwhich un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſques it to the eye of the World.</p>
                  <p>However I am willing the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be ſtrictly examin'd, to ſee whether any thing but what is very natural and ſincere can be found in them. Could there proceed from the Malice and Perfidiouſneſs of a man, who had ſo lately accuſed his Nation of a Crime he knew to be utterly falſe, ſo many Exhortations to fear God, ſo ſtrong, ſo moving in themſelves and ſo often repeated, that they wholly take up the Writings of this Apoſtle? Could his humility proceed from thence, whereby he refers every thing to God as to the <hi>Center</hi> of all good things? ſo ſincerely telling us, <hi>What haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? And if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>We are yours, you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is God's,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 23. Could his hatred too for vice ariſe from thence, which upon all occaſions he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fys and expreſſes after ſo ſtrong and lively a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:94927:50"/>
His <hi>Charity</hi> appears no leſs in his paſſionate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the ſanctification of his Brethren. All his Epiſtles are a continued ſerious of tender or moving Exhortations, or rather ardent requeſts he makes them to love one another. He deſires they ſhould live ſoberly, juſtly, and religiouſly. He addreſſes himſelf both to Servants and Maſters, to Poor and Rich, to Parents and Children, to Young men and Old men. Having no prejudice nor hatred for any one, he pours out himſelf in thankſgivings and bleſſings for all men, he ſpeaks to them after a very tender and moving manner. He calls them his <hi>little Children,</hi> his <hi>Beloved,</hi> his <hi>Bowels,</hi> his <hi>Glory,</hi> and his <hi>Crown.</hi> And what was his deſign in all this? only to inſpire them with the love of God, and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How does he extol the excellence of Charity.</hi> Tho' I ſpeak, <hi>ſays he,</hi> with the tongues of men, and of Angels, and have no Charity, I am become as ſounding braſs or tinkling Cymbal; and tho' I beſtow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and tho' I give my body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, does not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thinketh no Evil, rejoyceth not in Iniquity, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in the Truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things. <hi>1 Cor. 13. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Such is the Idea St.</hi> Paul <hi>had of Charity, in which appears the force of Reaſon and of true Vertue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fantaſtical weakneſs of ſuperſtition: he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Charity to miraculous gifts, and therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the ſpirit of true Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This conſideration of the Character and Vertue of this Apoſtle is ſo much the more conſiderable, that it forces us in deſpight of our ſelves, to aſſert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> one of theſe two things; either that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>wicked</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:94927:50"/>
man, and a notorious Impoſtor; or elſe that he had heard the voice of Jeſus Chrict in the way to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> that he had received the Holy Ghoſt, and was truely the Apoſtle of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever proves that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was no wicked perſon, does even thereby prove the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire therefore the Reader throughly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtyle of his Epiſtles, and examine them from the beginning to the end, to diſcover the true Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Character of them.</p>
                  <p>What is it this Apoſtle deſires of God? that thoſe whom he ſpeaks to might live good lives, and that God might be glorified by their works. What does he complain of? Vice. What is it he chiefly praiſes? Vertue. By what motive does he act, or ſpeak as he does? By quite another motive than that of ſelf intereſt.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Luke</hi> had already told us in the Book of <hi>Acts,</hi> that he work'd for his Living, and that his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to make Tents. Whereupon we ſhall make theſe two obſervations. I. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> bred up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> would have thought it beneath him to follow ſo vile a profeſſion, had he been worldly minded or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Secondly, that this Apoſtle reſolved to work with his own hands for his Living, in a time which other people would have greedily embraced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire wealth. For what could have been refuſed to thoſe men, who opened to mankind the direct way way to Heaven, and gave them certain hopes of Eternal Salvation? For it cannot be denied but that was the opinion of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if St.</hi> Luke <hi>ſhould be thought to have impoſed upon us in the Relation of this Matter, 'tis but hearing what St.</hi> Paul <hi>himſelf ſays of it, who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi>

                     <hi>would not have undertook to perſwade thoſe people of it againſt their own proper knowledge.</hi> Behold, <hi>ſays he to the</hi> Corinthians, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdenſome to you: for I ſeek not yours, but you: For the Children ought not to lay up for the Parents, but the Parents for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>2 Cor. 12. 14.</hi> And I will very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you, &amp;c. <hi>and then,</hi> have I caught you with guile? <hi>And in another place,</hi> Have I committed an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in abaſing my ſelf that you might be exalted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have preached to you the Goſpel of God freely? <hi>2 Cor. 11. 7.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have ſpoken to them after this manner, had he preach'd only out of ſelf inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, according to the Cuſtom of thoſe who carrying a worldly mind along with them into the Sanctuary, are meer huchſters of Religion, and make a Trade of the moſt ſacred and ſublime Myſteries of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing St. <hi>Paul</hi> acted not by a principle of ſelf intereſt, which is generaly the <hi>center</hi> of other mens Actions, who will aſſure us that he owed not his Virtues to Pride, which is another nice kind of Intereſt, to which ſome men direct all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
                  <p>I am very well perſwaded that men may out of a capricious fancy aſcribe the beſt Actions to <hi>Pride,</hi> and give the name of <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> to the moſt ſincere <hi>Vertue.</hi> For what can put a ſtop to the continual rovings of a Soul, that endeavours only to raiſe doubts and ſcruples? But then I alſo affirm that there are ſuch viſible marks in the conduct and actions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as manifeſtly evince in ſpight of Incredulity, that his Vertue was ſolid, and his ſelf denial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>incere. But this I hope will more plainly appear by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflexions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:94927:51"/>
We need but a very indifferent Knowledge of mens hearts and inclinations, to know that as there are two different ſtates into which men may fall, ſo likewiſe there are two different ſorts of Paſſions, which then ariſe in the ſoul. <hi>Proſperity</hi> is the cauſe of pride with all the other Vices that accompany it <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> that of Covetouſneſs, with all that is conſequent upon it. Not but that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is found ſometimes even in Proſperity, as well as Pride in the midſt of Miſery: but that is not my meaning. I only would ſay, that Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is as it were the Kingdom of Pride, and Poverty the Kingdom of Avarice: becauſe a man that is rich, being content in that reſpect, generally ſeeks after Glory. Whereas a man that has ſcarce wherewithall to live, little thinks of acquiring glory, but aims only at a bare ſubſiſtance. Whence it follows that inſtead of vainly imagining that St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſign'd to reduce himſelf to extream Poverty, and at the ſame time was very earneſt in the purſuit of Glory, it is rather more natural to believe, that he could not ſo much as propoſe to himſelf Glory, as the only end of all his Actions, untill the firſt found himſelf exempted from Want and Miſery.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs this reaſoning ſeems to carry with it the force of Conviction; ſince there have been thoſe who have deſpiſed riches only to gain the eſteem of men. It muſt therefore be further added (to diſtinguiſh St. <hi>Paul</hi> from this laſt ſort of men) that he was not only poor, and forced to labour for his living; but that he ſuffered alſo all the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and Diſgraces a man is capable of enduring. 'Tis well known how much Adverſity dejects our minds, and humbles the proud thoughts of our hearts, and we may venture to ſay, that had thoſe Philoſophers we lately mention'd, been overwhelm'd with a continual ſeries of Misfortunes, ſtill leading
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94927:52"/>
on and following one another; had they been loaded with Chains, mark'd with ſtripes, expoſed to ſtorms and ſhipwracks, to the ſcorn of the learned, the bitter ſcoffs of Princes, the hatred of Magiſtrates, and the fury of the People, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, their Pride would ſoon have been abated, their hopes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, and the Natural love of eaſe and quiet, together with the impatience to get out of ſo wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Condition, would ſoon have ſuperſeded all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, thoſe very <hi>Philoſophers</hi> who ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed riches and dignities, deſpiſed them only out of ſelf love, but not for the ſake of others: ſince being little concern'd at the welfare of their neighbour, they commonly retired into ſolitary places, or kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany only with other wiſe men, where they took pride in applauding one another, for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the <hi>World</hi> to give themſelves wholly up to the ſtudy of <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> But here the Apoſtles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook every thing to labour for the Converſion of mankind. St. <hi>Paul</hi> made Tents, as well as <hi>Abdolominus</hi> dug in a Garden: but the one ceaſed not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men by preaching the Goſpel, whilſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minded nothing but his own repoſe and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> had this conſolation that however they renounced riches, they eſteemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy in the enjoyment of true Vertue. For blinded as they were by ſelf-conceit, they were far from imagining their Vertue <hi>falſe,</hi> and the Idea they had of its excellency, was their only comfort for what they had loſt of the things of this World. Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles being but Impoſtors, as <hi>Irreligious</hi> men ſuppoſe, could not have that comfort which ariſes purely from the ſenſe of ones own Vertue, but were wholly deprived of the ſupport of a Good Conſcence, which keeps the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94927:52"/>
ſoul from ſinking under the greateſt dangers and afflictions. In a word, conſider this matter on which ſide you will, ſtill you will find ſomewhat ſingular in the conduct of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and that no Character equals his <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Character.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But perhaps ſome will object that St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſeems to boaſt a little too much in ſome of his Epiſtles of the Excellence of his Revelations. He writes to the</hi> Galatians, <hi>Chap. 2. 9.</hi> that he had received nothing from the moſt excellent of the Apoſtles, <hi>or rather,</hi> that he was not behind even the very beſt of the Apoſtles. That James, Cephas, and John, who ſeemed to be Pillars of the Church, had given him the right hand of fellowſhip; <hi>Chap. 1. 16.</hi> that after he had been made an Apoſtle, he did not confer with fleſh and blood, neither went he up to Jeruſalem to be there approved of by the other Apoſtles; <hi>Chap. 2. 11.</hi> that he withſtood Peter to the face, and blamed him becauſe he deſerved to be blamed.</p>
                  <p>But this difficulty cannot perplex thoſe who ſhall be acquainted with the reaſons that obliged St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak and act thus. There were ſeveral falſe Teachers among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who endeavoured to deſtroy the fruit of the preaching of that Apoſtle, by joyning the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, and alledged for it the Authority of <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> whom they had ſeen at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He therefore fearing leſt under pretence of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of the three principal Apoſtles of our Lord, they ſhould ſubvert his Work, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to ſhew that the Excellence of his Miniſtry was not in the leaſt inferiour to that of any other Apoſtle. Under this conſideration he compares himſelf to the other Apoſtles in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> beginning it after this manner. <hi>Paul an Apoſtle (not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Criſt and God the Father;</hi> &amp;c. And tis upon the very ſame account; that comparing himſelf in his ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94927:53"/>
to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to ſome Teachers, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diſturb him in his Miniſtry, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf after this manner. Chap. 11. v. 22, 23, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>Are they Hebrews? So am I: Are they Iſraelites? So am I: Are they Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt? (I ſpeak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in ſtripes above meaſure. Of the Jews five times received I forty ſtripes ſave one. Thrice was I beaten with rods. Once was I ſtoned, thrice I ſuffered ſhipwrack. In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, in perils by the heathen, in perils among falſe brethren, in wearineſs and painfulneſs, in watchings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in hunger and thirſt, in faſtings often, in cold and nakedneſs. Beſides thoſe things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the Churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended and I burn not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Can any one ſuppoſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have preſumed to ſpeak ſo particularly of all his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with ſo much confidence, for the good of the Church whom certain Seducers would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from the faith, if thoſe afflictions had not been real and well known to the World? If what he aſſerts had been falſe, ſure he muſt have perceived that far from ſilencing his Enemies this way, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupplied them with new matter to reproach him with? But if what he aſſerts was true, who doubts but that he was ſtrongly perſwaded of the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> when we ſee how much, and in what manner he ſuffered in defence of the ſame? What piece of impoſture, or miſtaken principle can inſpire a man with ſo much confidence as this Apoſtle ſhew'd? Produce a wicked man that can undergo a continual Martyrdom in defence of a cheat, and yet breath out nothing in all his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings but <hi>Zeal, Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> Produce a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94927:53"/>
wicked man, who being juſt come out of Priſon, ſhall ſtrive to re-enter into it, and continue preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Goſpel, which has coſt him ſo many ſtripes; who being an Enemy to his own Nation, a perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeducer, who having renounced all his poſſeſſions only for the ſake of preaching to others, ſhall yet not ſo much as receive his diet and cloathing from them; Nay who after this uſage ſtill preaching on, will not ſo much as exempt himſelf from any labour (however vile and contemptible) for a livelyhood; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> declared he would not in his Epiſtles to thoſe people, who would undoubtedly have refuſed him nothing; who in fine, after all this, ſhall ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and without affectation reject the glory which his preaching and ſelf denial ſeem to merit; and who to ſhew the reaſonableneſs of his refuſal ſhall teach us to aſcribe all honour and glory to God as the firſt great Author of our <hi>Being,</hi> and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end of all our Actions. 1 Cor 9. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Even ſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>has the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel. But I have uſed none of theſe things, that it ſhould be ſo done unto me. For tho' I preach the Goſpel, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to glory of, for neceſſity is laid upon me. Yea, wo is unto me, if I preach not the Goſpel. For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward; but if againſt my will, a diſpenſation of the Goſpel is committed unto me. What is my reward then? Verily that when I preach the Goſpel, I may make the Goſpel of Chriſt without charge, that I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe not my power in the Goſpel.</hi> And in another place, Phil. 3. 8. <hi>Yea doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs, for the Excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord; for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> rooted up all Vanity out of his heart. He was not carried away with vain ſhews of glittering Vertue and Merit; But ſought only the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94927:54"/>
remiſſion of his ſins. All his ſtrength was in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He affirmed that <hi>God had ſent his Son into the World to ſave ſinners, of whom he was chief.</hi> He confeſſed that he had blaſphemed that holy name by which we muſt be ſaved; that he had perſecuted Jeſus Chriſt in his members. He imputed his Converſion to <hi>Grace,</hi> and ſpoke of nothing but of Grace. Now what could ſo much humble the heart of man as the conſideration of the Immenſe greatneſs of God, the wretched miſery of mankind, their deſperate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and the infinite Mercy of God manifeſted to them in the ſending his Son: all which took up the Diſcourſes, Epiſtles and Mind of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who including all his deſigns in one, propoſed nothing elſe to himſelf, but <hi>the knowledge of Jeſus Christ and him crucified?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome perhaps will object, is it not true that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in acting as he did, got himſelf immortal honour? This the Event has ſufficiently ſhewed; and therefore why ſhould we not believe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> acted by a principle of vain glory, having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen what would certainly happen?</p>
                  <p>Certainly it would be a very pretty conceit to imagin that <hi>Saul</hi> who was prejudiced againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and a proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> deſigning to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortaliſe his name, ſhould affirm an impoſture that as much ſhocks our Reaſon as that of the Diſciples (if we may believe what the Incredulous ſay) that he ſhould have imagined he could deceive both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future ages by ſuch groſs fictions; that he could have drawn <hi>Strength, Courage, Conſtancy, Charity, Piety,</hi> from ſuch a chimerical project and perfidious deſign; that he ſhould <hi>have fought with beaſts at Epheſus,</hi> out of the hopes of an imaginary immortality, which one day would not flatter his aſhes in the Grave; that he ſhould retain ſo much Pride in the midſt of Shame and Torments; and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94927:54"/>
that a vain notion which is the uſual effect of <hi>Idleneſs, Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Proſperity,</hi> ſhould immediately triumph over the moſt real, and moſt lively <hi>Sentiments</hi> of Nature.</p>
                  <p>But what of all this? St. <hi>Paul</hi> was perhaps a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,</hi> a man that underſtood the World, who had ſome ſecret ſelf intereſt in all his deſigns and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But is it poſſible that his Character would never have been known? Would he not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted and ſo betrayed himſelf? Was there no way of diſcovering his Ambition, when the people taking him for <hi>Mercury,</hi> would have ſacrificed to him in <hi>Lycaonia?</hi> And if we would reflect upon his Epiſtles, might we not find marks of that prodigious Vanity which made him act thus?

                  <p>So boldly does this Apoſtle ſpeak of the <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> He does not only ſay in general terms that Jeſus Chriſt was ſeen after his <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> but in particular that he was ſeen of <hi>Cephas,</hi> of <hi>James,</hi> of the other Apoſtles, and of himſelf; that

he was ſeen by five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greateſt part was then living, whom he appealed to as witneſſes of the Truth of what he ſaid, and who might eaſily have contradicted him if it had been falſe. But if ſo great a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple really ſaw Jeſus Chriſt after his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> that matter of fact can never be falſe. For how is it poſſible that five hundred, three hundred, nay fifty perſons, ſhould maugre all puniſhments, conſpire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to maintain a fiction? But if ſuch a number of perſons neither ſaw, nor certified they had ſeen <hi>Chriſt</hi> after his <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> how ſhould St. <hi>Paul</hi> have preſumed to write this to an infinite number of perſons, who ſeeing and converſing with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, muſt have known the certainty of it? How durſt he name thoſe whom he pretends that Jeſus Chriſt appeared to after his <hi>Reſurrection?</hi> How great was his boldneſs to aſſign ſo great a number of Witneſſes of that Truth, and to affirm that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them were ſtill living? How comes he to ſpeak of it ſlightly, by the way, or only as a thing univerſally known? He tells it, but not with any turn of Wit or fineneſs of Expreſſion, which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors uſe to varniſh over a ſpecious lye, who uſe the more art and inſinuation, the more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the things are they would induce men to believe.

                     <hi>Knowledge by the ſame ſpirit; to another Faith by the ſame ſpirit, to another the gift of healing by the ſame ſpirit; to another the working of Miracles; to another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; to another diſcerning of ſpirits; to another divers kind of tongues: but all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf ſame ſpirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>You ſee how St. <hi>Paul</hi> curſorily mentions this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, as a matter of unconteſted Experience. Mean while 'tis obſervable that we have not to do with one ſingle gift, but ſeveral miraculous gifts, in which there was no Artifice or Illuſion. For tho' it might be pretended that ſome certain people had received the gift of tongues, and altho' thoſe very people ſhould not immediately be found out by thoſe, who perfectly underſtood thoſe Languages; yet how could there be others who expounded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Languages, and underſtood men of all Nations, others who healed the Sick, others who by Faith wrought miracles, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps the Incredulous will not be ſatisfied with that one Text of Scripture, and therefore here is another of the ſame ſtamp, 1 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. 1, 2. <hi>Tho' I ſpeak with the tongues of Men and of Angels, &amp;c. and tho' I have the gift of Prophecy, and underſtand all Mysteries, &amp;c. And tho' I have all Faith, ſo that I could remove Mountains,</hi> &amp;c. 1. Cor. 12. 29, 30, 31. <hi>Are all prophets?</hi> ſays he in the foregoing chapter. <hi>Are all workers of Miracles? Have all the gift of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Do all ſpeak with tongues? Do all Interpret? But covet earneſtly the beſt gifts: and yet ſhew I unto you, a more excellent way.</hi> 'Tis then he begins his Encomium of Charity, and prefers it before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miraculous gifts. In like manner he ſpeaks in this place indirectly, and as it were by the by of thoſe gifts; and the manner of his Expreſſion mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94927:57"/>
ſhews, that this matter of fact was publickly known.</p>
                  <p>But if they ſhould ſtill require a greater demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this Truth, ſuch a demonſtration as ſeems to me above all ſubtilty of Cavils and Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it's ſufficient to obſerve that among all thoſe Gifts, that of Tongues was ſo common (by reaſon it was very often imparted by the Apoſtles's impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands) that there aroſe a great Diſturbance and Confuſion in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it; becauſe all thoſe who had received that gift, being deſirous to ſpeak ſtrange Languages in the Church, the Congregation was not in the leaſt edified by it. And it obliged St. <hi>Paul</hi> to write to them very ſharply thereupon, to which end he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deſigned the 14. Chap. of his firſt Epiſt. to the <hi>Corinthians, I would,</hi> ſays he to them, v. 5. <hi>that ye all ſpeak with tongues; but rather that ye prophecied that the Church may receive edifying.</hi> Now to prophecy in the ſenſe of this Apoſtle, is to declare the word of God, and expound it to the people, <hi>I thank my God,</hi> adds he further v. 18, 19. <hi>I ſpeak with tongues more than you all. Yet in the Church I had rather ſpeak five words with my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that by my voice I might teach others alſo, than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue. Wherefore,</hi> adds he a little further v. 22. <hi>Tongues are for a ſign not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophecying ſerveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</hi> That is, as any one may eaſily conceive, that the gift of tongues which God had granted to the Church after a moſt extraordinary and wonderful manner, was deſigned either to confound, or convert the Infidels by that evident teſtimony of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: whereas the gift of prophecying, that is, of declaring God's Will, and expounding it to the people, had been wholly given men for the good and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94927:58"/>
Edification of the faithful. Now to theſe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gifts St. <hi>Paul</hi> certainly alluded, when he ſaid in his firſt Epiſt. to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> Chap. 5. v. 19. <hi>Quench not the ſpirit.</hi> And tis concerning thoſe ſame gifts and ſignal miracles that he ſays to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, O fooliſh Galatians,</hi> &amp;c. Chap. 3. 5. <hi>He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that miniſtreth to you the ſpirit, and worketh mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles among you, doth he it by the works of the Law, or by the preaching of the Faith?</hi> Laſtly, 'tis concerning theſe miraculous gifts that the Apoſtle ſpeaks, when he ſays, <hi>that the ſign of his Apoſtleſhip was manifeſted among the Corinthians, in all Patience, in Signs, and Wonders, and mighty Deeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may ſee to what perplexity and confuſion the Incredulous are reduced; and how angry ſoever they may be, there are but two ſides they can take. They muſt either aſſert that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had loſt his ſenſes, when he wrote thoſe things we juſt now mention'd; which they'll never do, becauſe their opinion is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wanted no cunning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a great many perſons: or they muſt confeſs that the faithful very frequently received many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts in the Ancient Church; that thoſe gifts were various; that there had actually been ſuch perſons in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who had cauſed ſome kind of diſturbance in it, by ſpeaking divers Languages as they were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt; and conſequently they muſt own the <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of our Religion.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That we ought to look upon the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> as a divine Book.</head>
                  <p>I Doubt not but that we may certainly find ſeveral unqueſtionable Characters of Divinity in that Book. For not to repeat here what we have already ſaid in our firſt part of this work, concerning the Books of the Old Teſtament, and which is no leſs true of the <hi>New</hi> one, we cannot but admire the mutual agreement of thoſe Authors with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the other Prophets. We cannot but be ſurpriſed to ſee ſuch an unanimous conſent among thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whether it be in the things they relate, or in in the deſign of their Exhortations, or laſtly, in the record they bear. Never was Author ſeen ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to himſelf, as thoſe Divine Authors are to one another in the Eſſentials of their Doctrine. Where can we find ſuch a Character of <hi>Sweetneſs, Gentleneſs,</hi> and <hi>Simplicity,</hi> ſo much <hi>Charity</hi> for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and <hi>Averſion</hi> to <hi>Vice,</hi> ſo many motives to <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and ſo great a deſire to glorify God? Where can we find ſuch a <hi>Loftineſs</hi> of thought, and yet ſuch a <hi>Simplicity</hi> of expreſſion, ſuch a <hi>mixture</hi> of joy and ſorrow, ſuch <hi>heroical confidence</hi> in a forlorn ſtate of Miſery, ſuch profound <hi>Humility,</hi> and ſuch <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>greatneſs</hi> of mind, which is the cauſe that their <hi>Morality</hi> is the fineſt that ever was, and their <hi>thoughts</hi> more elevated than thoſe of other men, their <hi>deſign</hi> the nobleſt that ever entred into the heart of man, that is, to gain all men unto God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ſelf intereſt, or refined Niceties of <hi>Policy,</hi> but only a fervent deſire to ſucceed in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry?</p>

                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:94927:59"/>
I know that this here is matter of <hi>Inward</hi> ſenſe, rather than Demonſtration, and that I ſhall never perſwade the Incredulous that they may diſcover in the New Teſtament that loftineſs of thought and that divine Majeſty, which I my ſelf perceive amidſt that ſeeming rough and unpleaſant Language, which is as it were the bark and outward ſhell of it: but yet for all their obſtinacy they cannot deny theſe four following Truths, I. That never any known Impoſtor left us ſuch excellent Books as the Apoſtles, no not even <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf, who might have eaſily borrowed their Notions, the better to diſguiſe his own. II. That it appears that their Writings are a thouſand times more free from all Paſſions and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Imperfections, than all the Books of the Wiſeſt men among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> where we ſee <hi>Pride</hi> as it were upon her Throne. III. That the Character of the New Teſtament is infinitely more excellent than that of the Writings of all the Fathers, who lived ſucceſſively from the Apoſtles down to us, wherein any one may eaſily obſerve a ſtrange af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, a particular vanity of ſhewing their parts and learning, and ſometimes much heat and paſſion; becauſe they were far from the perfection in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity which the Apoſtles had. IV. That the beſt ſorts of godly Books written amongſt the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> from the Apoſtles's time down to us, I mean thoſe Books that moſt eſtabliſh the peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of publick Society, and chiefly tend to the Glory of God, were written in imitation of the holy Scriptures, from which they had their materials to compoſe them with. This is what in my opinion is very ſure and certain.</p>
                  <p>And as certain it is, that if the Apoſtles were not divinely inſpired, they muſt neceſſarily be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, nay ſuch abominable men, as deſired only to diſhonour their Nation and to ſacrifice to a vain
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94927:59"/>
flattering Idea of Glory, the lives and fortunes of an infinite number of perſons whom they encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffer Martyrdom.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee whether we can perſwade our ſelves that the moſt excellent Books that were ever known, I mean thoſe Books that are moſt proper to inſpire us with <hi>piety,</hi> with the <hi>love</hi> of God, and our Neighbour, that are the ſource of the beſt matters that ever were written, and the original of the Piety and Vertue of all thoſe perſons who were converted by them, were only the invention of the moſt wicked men that ever were.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, ſince all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all Ages conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Book as Divine, and as the rule of their Faith, whereby they diſtinguiſh'd it from all other Books; it follows thence that all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were either deceived in the Eſſentials of it, and that their Faith was falſe, or elſe that Book muſt in reality be of a Divine Authority: For ſuch an Univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo conſtant, and ſo neceſſarily affixed to the end and deſign of Religion, can never impoſe upon us.</p>
                  <p>It has been the Wiſdom of <hi>Providence</hi> as we have already obſerved, to take care that this Book ſhould be left to us as entire as when it came out of the Apoſtles hands: and the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> who all aſſure us that it is of a Divine Authority, tell us only but what right Reaſon obliged them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and us as well as them. For the Word <hi>preached</hi> and the Word <hi>written</hi> by the Apoſtles, differ not eſſentially from one another; ſo that if the former be Divine, the latter muſt neceſſarily be ſo too. And who doubts but <hi>that</hi> Word muſt be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Divine, which God himſelf authoriſed by ſo many Miracles?</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome will reply, that it would be of a very dangerous Conſequence to reaſon often after this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94927:60"/>
manner; and that altho' a falſe <hi>Prophet</hi> ſhould work prodigious Miracles, yet we ought not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him upon a bare ſuppoſition that God never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts an Impoſtor with his infinite Power. But this I own and affirm alſo, that we ought ſtrictly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin both his Doctrine and Miracles, to find out by that compariſon the true Original of both. And therefore we have this advantage, that we not only find here ſuch <hi>miracles</hi> as excel all the power of Hell; ſuch as for example, the raiſing a man from the Dead; but that this Doctrine alſo viſibly bears all the Characters of one that proceeded from Heaven. Thoſe miracles on the one hand ſo great and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that the people cried out, <hi>ſurely this is the finger of God,</hi> take away all ſuſpicion of the falſity and pernicious conſequences of the Doctrine they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; becauſe the arm of the Lord is not uſually employed in favour of an Impoſture. And on the other hand, that Doctrine which is ſo holy, and ſo perfectly tends to the union and wellfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which is ſo worthy of the love of God to man, ſufficiently warrants us that the Miracles whereby it is confirmed, proceed not in the leaſt from the power of Darkneſs, as the Enemies of Chriſtianity ſeem to believe. Hell never concerns it ſelf either to unite or ſanctify mankind.</p>
                  <p>All the Apoſtles expreſly declare, that the word which they preached, proceeded not from themſelves, but God. <hi>But I certifie you Brethren,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſt. to the <hi>Galatians</hi> Chap. 1. v. 11. <hi>that the Goſpel which was preached of me, was not after man: for I neither received of man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were aſſembled together at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the firſt Council that ever was held, and wrote to ſome Chnrches concerning ſeveral queſtions that were then in Agitation, they made uſe of this manner of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94927:60"/>
ſpeaking, <hi>For it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us,</hi> Act. 15. 28.</p>
                  <p>It appears then that the Apoſtles ſpoke by the Order and Revelation of God, which was given ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways; <hi>viz.</hi> ſometimes by <hi>Viſion,</hi> as when St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw a certain veſſel deſcending from Heaven, as it had been a great ſheet knit by the four Corners, wherein were all kinds of unclean Beaſts; and he was commanded ſaying, <hi>Peter kill and eat,</hi> Act. 10. 13. on purpoſe to ſignify that he ought to preach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Certainly, if it be true, as it is, that God poured down his Spirit upon the Apoſtles on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> 'twas only that they might preach unto men by their Miniſtry, unleſs it be pretended that the Tongues of the Apoſtles which were exalted after a ſupernatural manner, ſo far as to ſpeak all ſorts of Languages, were to confine themſelves to that particular employ, and not to reveal unto men the will of God. But if we ought to look upon that word as <hi>Divine</hi> which thoſe Tongues have preached, we cannot but look upon thoſe Writings as <hi>Divine</hi> in which that Word it ſelf is contained.</p>
                  <p>I hope that whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly reflect on the Connexion of all theſe principles, will fully be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that their Union is not to be diſſolved. If there was ſuch a Book as the New Teſtament in the days of <hi>Clemens, Polycarp,</hi> and of the <hi>Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> as without diſpute there was, that Book could never have been forg'd. If the Book of the New Teſtament could not have been forg'd, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that certain publick matters of fact, which are inſerted in that Book as being publickly known by all the Chriſtians, are true. And if thoſe matters of fact are true, it can never be denied but that the Apoſtles received the Holy Ghoſt. If the Apoſtles did receive the Holy Ghoſt, certainly their Writings muſt be looked upon as Divine. I have made choice of theſe principles only among ſeveral others which I have eſtabliſhed; but leſt any one ſhould imagin that they ſubſiſt meerly by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, I deſire the Reader to remember that I have proved each of them apart by themſelves, after ſeveral different ways.</p>
                  <p>It is very true therefore that the New Teſtament, as well as our <hi>Religion,</hi> is divine: for theſe two Truths are properly one and the ſame: The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> can't be Divine, if the Word or the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94927:61"/>
Scripture which is the ruleof the Faith of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, be Humane; and the Scripture can never be Divine, unleſs the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> be of an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Original, and proceeded from God. But it is fit that we ſhould examin the Difficulties that are oppoſed againſt this grand principle.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Wherein we ſhall examin thoſe Difficulties which may probably be raiſed againſt the foregoing Truths.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>TRuth</hi> is an Enemy to all ſhifts and tricks: let us therefore briefly conſider what doubts we may poſſibly entertain in the foregoing Truths. Let us give full ſcope to our imagination to frame what ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions we can as to the perſons of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, their Miracles, the Reſurrection of our Lord, and the extraordinary and miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which were imparted to mankind by the hands of the Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And I. to begin with the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, there are ſome who believe that Jeſus Chriſt was an <hi>Eſſene,</hi> and that he borrowed from that Sect the purity of his Morals and the ſoundneſs of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. And indeed it appears from the Deſcription which <hi>Philo,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> gave us of that Sect, that the <hi>Eſſenes</hi> lived among themſelves in a perfect union, that they poſſeſſed all things in Common; that they looked upon one another as ſo many brethren, and that they had very rational and ſound Ideas of God and Religion. All this pretty well agrees with the Nature of Chiſtianity. Beſides it does not appear that Jeſus Chriſt ever oppoſed their Doctrine, when he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94927:62"/>
pronounced ſo many woes againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> And if it be true that Jeſus Chriſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed his Doctrine from that Sect, we ſhould have leſs Reaſon to be ſurpriſed at his extraordinary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Holineſs of life. But 'tis eaſy to refute this notion if we conſider that there was no ſuch Sect as that of the <hi>Eſſenes</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> which was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country of Jeſus <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that the <hi>Eſſenes</hi> avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all correſpondence with other men, as looking upon them as impure and prophane, and for that reaſon dwelt not in any great Cities: Whereas Jeſus Chriſt travers'd Towns and Villages, taught multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, Preached in the Synagogues, &amp;c. Beſides the <hi>Eſſenes</hi> abhorr'd Matrimony: whereas Jeſus Chriſt made choice of ſuch Diſciples as were Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and laſtly, that he had ſeveral Fiſhermen to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, but none of them were <hi>Eſſenes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But II. May we not think that Jeſus Chriſt ow'd his knowledge to his Education? But how could that be? For as much as he was bred up in the ſhop of a Carpenter, as his Enemies themſelves confeſs in their reproaches of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Some will object, that 'twas out of ſpite to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> and other Rulers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he firſt exclaimed ſo much againſt them, and after invented on purpoſe to thwart them a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quite oppoſite to theirs. But what had the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> to do with all thoſe Teachers, ſince he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor <hi>Levite,</hi> nor pretended to any ſuch dignities? What ſhould make him come in competition with them? Beſides it is not ſufficient to aſſert that Jeſus Chriſt ſeemed very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated againſt their Doctrine and Behaviour, it muſt alſo be conſidered, whether he had not a great deal of reaſon to be ſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. 'Tis objected that perhaps he was ambitious of being thought a <hi>Prophet;</hi> or it may be not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94927:62"/>
underſtanding certain Oracles, which ſeemed to determine at that time the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> he really thought himſelf to be that <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But nothing of this is true. For Jeſus Chriſt could not have thought himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> out of meer <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> nor have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make the World believe it out of <hi>malice</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</hi> We have no reaſon to believe the former, if we conſider his Morality and Doctrine; and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of life gives us no occaſion to imagin the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The incredulous will ſoon be reduced to an evident abſurdity, if they aſſert that Jeſus Chriſt was the moſt ignorant, or moſt wicked of men; the moſt ignorant, if he thought himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> without being really ſo; or the moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he endeavoured to make other men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, when he believed it not himſelf: becauſe one muſt be wilfully blind not to perceive that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> proceeds both from a very clear principle, and a good foundation too.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. But may we not ſay the ſame of <hi>Mahomet?</hi> The incredulous compare them often together. They pretend that Jeſus Chriſt and <hi>Mahomet</hi> might have been animated both with the ſame Spirit. But of all the ſhifts of the Incredulous this is certainly their weakeſt: and 'tis a plain demonſtration that they have no manner of Idea of the things they ſpeak of, when they inſiſt upon this compariſon.</p>
                  <p>For we can here produce ſeveral eſſential differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences betwixt Jeſus Chriſt and <hi>Mahomet. Mahomet</hi> never pretended to Eſtabliſh his Religion by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, although ſeveral have been imputed to him: Whereas Jeſus Chriſt deſired no belief but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the teſtimony of his extraordinary Miracles; being willing thereby to convince the eyes and ſenſes of his Diſciples by ſenſible matters of fact, and ſuch miracles as he gave them alſo power to work
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94927:63"/>
themſelves; when he ſent them forth to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and Miracles, at the ſame time he threatned them with Death and eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in caſe they ſhould endeavour to deceive any body with fictions, or even diſguiſe the Truth it ſelf. <hi>Mahomet</hi> left no ſuch prophecies behind him, as have been accompliſhed: whereas we have ſeveral of Jeſus Chriſt which have been clearly explained by their event. Neither the Books of the <hi>Old</hi> or New Teſtament bear the leaſt record of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> whereas the Prophets had foretold the coming of Jeſus Chriſt as of a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that was to unite the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to carry the Covenant of God unto the ends of the World. <hi>Mahomet</hi> eſtabliſhed himſelf in the World by <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence;</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt only by <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>ſufferings.</hi> The former was environ'd with Soldiers, the latter was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Martyrs. The one put men to Death, but the other received Death for our ſakes. <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met's</hi> ambition, who eſtabliſhed ſuch a flouriſhing Empire, was preſently ſeen in the ſucceſs he had in his undertaking. But Jeſus Chriſt was far from ſelf Intereſt or Ambition, ſince he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when they would have made him King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>his Kingdom was not of this World.</hi> Inſtead of encouraging the carnal prejudices of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he took care to undeceive them, and to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell all the Evils they were to expect. And tho' any ſhould preſume openly to diſpute all theſe matters of fact, ſtill they appear by the end and ſucceſs of the Goſpel, the deſign of which was to ſanctify the heart, and calm the diſorderly paſſions of the Soul. <hi>Mahomet</hi> invented ſuch a <hi>Religion</hi> which agreed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with corrupted Reaſon, and the looſe inordinate deſires of the heart. He made the ſcandal of the Croſs to give place to the magnificence and grandeur of the World; he took away the moſt ſpiritual and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94927:63"/>
difficult matters of <hi>Morality,</hi> to fill the minds of his Diſciples with carnal and ſenſual Ideas. But not ſo did our Saviour act, who propoſed his Croſs to the minds of men as an aſtoniſhing Paradox, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual cauſe of Mortification and Repentance. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> Eſtabliſhed his Religion by the help of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Darkneſs, by ſuppreſſing ſuch Books as might have enlightened mens Underſtandings, and by requiring a blind ſubmiſſion from them. Jeſus Chriſt on the contrary would not have them believe his Doctrine, but as they found it conformable to that of the Prophets, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for in them ye think ye have eternal life,</hi> John 5. 39. <hi>Mahomet</hi> eſtabliſhed himſelf in the World by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling and diſguiſing his thoughts: He promiſed in the beginning a toleration of all Religions; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it fair to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but afterwasds did his utmoſt endeavours to extirpate them utterly. But Jeſus Chriſt declared at firſt his intention and deſign which was to ſave mankind, and overthrow <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> it ſelf. Nor he, nor his Diſciples uſed any <hi>Policy</hi> or Circumvention in this reſpect. <hi>Mahomet</hi> died, but never roſe, nor pretended to riſe again from the dead, thereby to ſhew he was approved of God. Jeſus Chriſt died, but it was believed he roſe again from the dead, upon the teſtimony of thoſe who had ſeen him after his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and teſtified of the Truth of this matter of fact to all the World, at the expence of their lives, and effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their blood. <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Religion was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, maintained and ſupported by <hi>Policy,</hi> but that of Jeſus Chriſt was at firſt offenſive to all the Princes upon earth, and was eſtabliſhed in the World not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their endeavours to the contrary. <hi>Mahomets</hi>'s Religion appear'd at firſt view to be as it were the Triumph of Humane <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs;</hi> but the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt ſhew'd
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94927:64"/>
that of <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> in their full perfection, and <hi>Natural Religion</hi> in that proper purity and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity that was reſtored to it by Charity. <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> laid the foundation of a particular Monarchy, and eſtabliſhed ſuch Laws as, humanly ſpeaking, are ſerviceable only in thoſe places wherein he has ſettled his Dominion: but Jeſus Chriſt has given us new Principles of <hi>union</hi> and <hi>intelligence,</hi> very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the good of <hi>publick</hi> ſociety in general, and very fit to cement the union of all men together by making the ſpirit of <hi>Charity</hi> reign in the World. The coming of <hi>Mahomet</hi> did not ſanctify mankind: but that of Jeſus Chriſt was attended with an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Company of perſons, who all renounced the World, meerly by the Faith they had in him. 'Twas not <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt who exactly fulfilled the Oracles concerning the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe <hi>Mahomet</hi> derived all his knowledge of the true God, from Jeſus Chriſt, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed. Laſtly, Temporal Proſperity was the true Character of the Religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and it might be very well affirmed that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was a Man of God, if it were true that all thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the greateſt Proſperity in the World, that is, all Tyrants, wicked, and unjuſt men are the favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of God. But the Character of the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>patience, ſelf-denial, innocence</hi> and a <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of manners; and certainly he was approved of God, if God approves of vertuous, patient, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and charitable men. It concerns now the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous to anſwer all theſe differences, if they would have us allow of this Compariſon; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhall ever reject it, as being very ridiculous and extravagant.</p>

Then they object, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> might have healed two or three people either by chance, or by vertue of <hi>Second</hi> cauſes, and that that good ſucceſs might have got him afterwards the name of a <hi>Prophet</hi> through the ignorance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are wont to aſcribe to ſupernatural Cauſes every thing that is unknown to them. We anſwer that we have here a very great number of miracles, all of different kinds, evident and ſenſible miracles, in their Nature, unimitable and above all Impoſture. Such are the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the dead, healing the Blind, the Lame, and the ſick of the Palſy, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. They pretend that he might perhaps have ſuborned Witneſſes to teſtify ſome fabulous miracles. But how could this be? Since Jeſus Chriſt had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther money to give, nor dignities to promiſe; and as for cunning, Politick niceties, Riches and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, they were only amongſt the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> and Doctors of the Law, his implacable Enemies, who took all opportunities to prejudice him, becauſe he publickly cenſured their hypocriſy upon all occaſions.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. They object that Jeſus Chriſt was ſo prudent as to work his miracles only before three of his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Diſciples, <hi>viz. Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> Now (ſay they) who knows but that thoſe three Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94927:65"/>
to flatter the ambition of their Maſter, might have atteſted certain Miracles as true, which were not really ſo?</p>
                  <p>To remove this ſuſpicion, we need only reflect upon the many miracles Jeſus Chriſt wrought in the preſence of his other Diſciples. He raiſed from the dead the Son of the Widdow of <hi>Naim,</hi> as he was a carrying to be interr'd. He raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the grave in the ſight of ſeveral <hi>Jews,</hi> who were purpoſely come thither to comfort the Siſters of the Deceaſed Perſon. He tarried four days, that it might not be ſaid, he was not really dead. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Lazarus</hi> to converſe with his acquaintance after his Reſurrection, which gave occaſion to the <hi>Jews</hi> blinded with madneſs to conſpire together to ſend him to the grave again, whom the grave had juſt ſent them for their Converſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. But is it poſſible that ſuch great and ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralelled miracles as theſe, ſhould make ſo little impreſſion upon peoples minds? This Age is indeed a wicked and prejudiced age: But yet what a noiſe would the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of a dead man make now? How many would make it their buſineſs to be fully ſatisfied of the truth of ſuch a matter of fact? How few would doubt it, after having known the certain truth of it? To this I anſwer, that the greateſt part of thoſe who heard this Miracle, did not in the leaſt believe it. Some aſcribed it to the power of <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub;</hi> others to ſome other cauſe; ſome knew not what to think of it, and therefore refuſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into it; others verily believ'd that Jeſus Chriſt and <hi>Lazarus</hi> had agreed together thus to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the people, and this very likely was the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe who ſought after <hi>Lazarus</hi> to put him to death; Others, tho' very few, took occaſion from thence to glorify God. But leſt any man ſhould wonder at the little impreſſion this miracle made
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94927:65"/>
upon the prejudiced and ſuperſtitious minds of men, 'twill be ſufficient to make theſe two following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. Firſt, That there have been ſeveral <hi>Jews</hi> who freely acknowledged the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt, tho' they perſiſted in their incredulity; chuſing rather ſuperſtitiouſly to aſcribe them to a certain I know not what pronunciation of the word <hi>Jehovah,</hi> than to refer them totheir true cauſe; which ſhews that the evidence of Miracles is not always of it ſelf ſufficient to overcome the hardneſs of ſome mens minds when prepoſſeſs'd with prejudice. Secondly, That ſuperſtition it ſelf has been ſometimes carried on to that degree as to extinguiſh utterly all the lights of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and even to call in queſtion thoſe very objects that are preſent to the ſenſes, rather than be obliged to renounce its prejudices. But it is not neceſſary to inſiſt much upon this laſt reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>It ſufficiently appears from thence that there are ſuch people in the World, whoſe minds being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed, will either call in queſtion any palpable truths, or elſe aſcribe matters of fact truly miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſome fantaſtical and extravagant cauſes. But there are none that are willing to die in order to maintain that they were ſpectators of thoſe things which they had really never ſeen, eſpecially when they profeſs to believe that impoſture is a crime worthy of Death; and when they might be ſo eaſily found out by ſo great a number of witneſſes, it would argue meer folly for any to pretend to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon men in this reſpect. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors had credit and authority enough over the people, partly to ſtifle the knowledge they might have of thoſe matters of fact, or if that fail'd, at leaſt to give ſuch reaſons of them, as would certainly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the immoderate deſire the <hi>Jews</hi> had to ſee not a ſorrowful and contemptible, but a glorious and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94927:66"/>
triumphing <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But the Diſciples were too weak to endure the ſeverity of thoſe Torments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them, had they been meer Impoſtors; and were not ſurely ſo ſenſleſs as ever to think they might eaſily perſwade men to believe ſuch matters of fact as the Reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> For to endeavour to conceal a matter of fact of that Nature, one had need only of prejudice and a wicked inclination; but to have a deſign to make other men believe it when it was really falſe, one muſt be poſſeſs'd with an unaccountable and unheard of madneſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. But you will ſay, let the opinion the <hi>Jews</hi> had of the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt be what it will, ſtill is it poſſible they could have no better preſerved the memory of them; and that <hi>Joſephus</hi> for example, who carefully relates the leaſt ſort of Events, and forgets not to mention certain Seducers that had appeared in the World from time to time before him, ſhould not in the leaſt ſpeak of the Miracles of of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> It is ſuppoſed by ſome that that notable teſtimony which he bears of him, was a pious fraud of his, or a meer Invention of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages. We ſhall not enquire into the truth of that at preſent. We are willing to take things in the worſt ſenſe, and we have three ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to make this objection, concerning the ſilence of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in this reſpect. The firſt is, that thoſe who probably inſerted in the Writings of that Author that notable place which has given occaſion to the Criticiſm of the Learned, might for a continuation of their deſign, have blotted out every thing that <hi>Joſephus</hi> really tells us on this account; and which perhaps tho' leſs advantagious to our cauſe, is yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was held as one that wrought many Miracles. The ſecond, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> being a <hi>Phariſee</hi> might probably have concealed the wonders of the life of our Saviour, out of the hatred
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94927:66"/>
he bore to our Religion. And the laſt is, that as this man had endeavoured to inſinuate himſelf into <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s favour, by foretelling him that he ſhould be Emperour; and had aſcribed to him ſeveral prophecies of the <hi>Old</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joſeph. de bello Judaico. lib. 3. cap. 14. 7, 12.</note>
                     <hi>Teſtament,</hi> which promiſed that a King ſhould come from the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> it is highly probabable that this Author being a Courtier, would not out of complaiſance to <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian</hi> and his Children, mention the leaſt thing of a man, who had pretended he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and to whom other people aſcribed thoſe famous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, whereby he had endeavoured to ingratiate himſelf in that Emperours Eſteem. And certainly it is very unlikely to ſuppoſe that a man who had carefully related the leaſt Circumſtance of the life of <hi>Herod the Great,</hi> ſhould have forgot the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Children of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> if at the time he diſcovered the cauſe of that Murther, he had not been affraid to diſcover alſo the dread <hi>Herod</hi> had upon him at the birth of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion then currant among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be born in <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis however certain, that this Author could not have concealed any ſuch events as theſe, but only out of <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Policy.</hi> He could not have done it out of ignorance; and the Incredulous themſelves will not preſume to think that <hi>Joſephus</hi> was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant that Jeſus Chriſt had been put to death at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that he was accuſed there of ſeducing the people; that he had ſeveral Diſciples to attend him, whoſe number in his time increaſed yet daily; nay that there had been a very numerous Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> compoſed of perſons of that perſwaſion. And certainly there muſt have been <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all <hi>Judea,</hi> ſince there dwelt a very conſiderable number of them at <hi>Rome,</hi> under the Emperour

                     <hi>Claudius Ceſar,</hi> as it appears more at large by the Hiſtory of <hi>Suetonius.</hi> It muſt therefore be out of Policy that <hi>Joſephus</hi> made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: and we can never ſuſpect him of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had a deſign to conceal by his ſilence, thoſe Impoſtors which aroſe amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaks of all the reſt; nor to ſpare the ſhame and confuſion of his own Nation, becauſe he ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly made it his buſineſs to diſcover the fury and leudneſs of that people. Let any one throughly conſider all theſe things, and he will then neceſſarily confeſs that the ſilence of <hi>Joſephus</hi> which was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned meerly by Policy, cannot but be very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to our cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. But laſtly, 'Tis objected there is nothing more frequent than to ſee ſome men endeavouring to make others believe thoſe miracles as were never in being. It is very well known how ſtrangely people have always been infatuated in this reſpect, and what an eaſy matter it is to impoſe <note place="margin">Tacit. lib. 5. Hiſtor. cap. 13.</note>upon them. <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates that <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> being one day at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he healed two blind men; and that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact would have been altogether incredible, hadnot the whole Court been an eye-witneſs to it.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, that it is very likely <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was willing to be thought to have done ſome miracles, in reſpect of thoſe prophecies which ſeemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him the Empire of the World, according to the falſe application <hi>Joſephus</hi> had made of them to his perſon. He was at firſt well enough pleaſed to ſee that <hi>Jew</hi> flattering him by ſuch an agreeable predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but being ſometimes after come to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and perceiving that his concerns ſucceſsfully went on, he thought it behoved him to perſwade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that he was called to the Empire by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; and doubtleſs with that deſign he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94927:67"/>
two men that counterfeited blindneſs to be brought unto him, on purpoſe to work upon them a falſe Miracle. But giving this objection a greater latitude, I anſwer that there are no miracles whatever but what I verily believe to be true, and which appear to me paſt all contradiction, if they have thoſe ten Characters which any one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the Miracles of the Apoſtles. I. If they were as the former, foretold in the Ancient Oracles. II. If they are very frequent, very numerous, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and evident. III. If the Authors of them were a ſimple and diſintereſſed ſort of people, who in all appearance had neither malice enough to have a deſign to deceive, nor underſtanding enough to have the power to do it, nor boldneſs to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, nor credit to maintain it. IV. If thoſe Miracles are ſo try'd by the prudence and induſtry of the moſt skilful men in the World, that they not being able altogether to deny the truth of them, are obliged to refer them to ſeveral odd and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant cauſes. V. If there is an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Witneſſes who die, and rejoyce to die in the teſtimony not that they only heard of them, but that they both ſaw and work'd them themſelves. VI. If the end of thoſe Miracles is not to ſatisfy mens paſſions or looſe deſires, but to ſanctify their hearts and regulate their manners. VII. If thoſe perſons which both teſtify and admit of them, ſeem on the one hand to aim at nothing elſe but their own Salvation, and that of their brethren; and on the other if they are perſwaded that their Salvation is inconſiſtent with impoſture and deceit. VIII. If thoſe who teſtify them, proffer to do the like, if they pretend themſelves able to impart any miraculous gifts to others; and if by the help of that ſenſible means, and of that proof, which they call the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> they make greater progreſs
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94927:68"/>
than ever the moſt fortunate Conquerours did by the force of their arms. IX. If thoſe who refuſe to allow of all theſe miraculous matters of fact, muſt unavoidably fall into an infinite number of ſelf evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent contradictions, as for inſtance, to believe that the wiſeſt amongſt men are the moſt fooliſh, and the moſt conſtant the moſt deceitful. X. If all thoſe matters of fact are ſo ſtrictly united to one another, that it is impoſſible to own the one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſently granting the other too; and ſo inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably interwoven with ſome other undeniable matters of fact, that cannot be called in queſtion without utterly renouncing our <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And Laſtly, If they end in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of a man, who was vainly ſought for in his grave after his death, notwithſtanding his Sepulchre had been ſealed and ſurrounded with a watch; of ſuch a man whom above five hundred witneſſes affirm'd they had ſeen, and who converſed with his Diſciples forty days after his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as they unanimouſly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, notwithſtanding all the puniſhments inflicted on them for the ſame. The incredulous muſt either ſhew us to be deceived, in aſcribing all theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt, or elſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear making ſuch compariſons.</p>

And Laſtly, Why ſhould we rather believe the teſtimony of the Diſciples concerning their Maſter, than that of thoſe men whom the <hi>Jews</hi> employ'd to ſignify that <hi>Jeſus</hi> a <hi>Galilean</hi> was an Impoſtor, and that his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had taken away his Body by night from the Sepulchre wherein he had been laid. <hi>Juſtin</hi> is the man who ſpeaks of thoſe choſen by the Synagogue to ſpread abroad this report, in his Dialogue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tryphon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will be eaſie for us not only to anſwer all their objections, but even to draw from them ſeveral very conſiderable advantages to our Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>For as to the Firſt, We anſwer that beſides the twelve Diſciples, commonly called <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt had choſe to himſelf in the beginning, he alſo ſent ſeventy others, who were not only eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes to all his Actions, but alſo the very inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he made uſe of to advance his Kingdom: that the truth of his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was teſtify'd and ſeen by above five hundred brethren at once, and that the miraculous gifts which fell on the Diſciples after the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of their Maſter, and the Miracles which God wrought by their hands, had as many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as their were people that believed there preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, we anſwer, that the choice of ſuch vile contemptible inſtruments as God was pleaſed to make uſe of for the Execution of the greateſt and moſt noble deſign, is one of the moſt conſiderable proofs that every thing here was ſolely tranſacted
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94927:69"/>
by the finger of God. Had he choſe for his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the World, ſome would perhaps have aſcribed the wonders of <hi>Chriſtian Morality</hi> to <hi>Policy,</hi> and the deſign of keeping people in obedience, by obliging them to a charitable Union among themſelves. Had he choſe <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> ſome would have aſcribed their heroical ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial to the ſingularity and pride of their Sect, or to thoſe elevated thoughts which <hi>Philoſophy</hi> had inſpired them with. Had he choſe <hi>Orators,</hi> ſome would have thought that they might have ſeduced men by the charms of their <hi>Eloquence.</hi> Had he choſe very Powerful and Rich men, ſome would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the ſucceſs of their preaching to their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities. He choſe therefore mean and contemptible perſons, who had ever lived in great ſimplicity, and labour'd under an obſcure condition, to ſhew more clearly that the ſucceſs of the Goſpel was the work of God and not of Men.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to the third Objection we aſſert, that tho' Jeſus Chriſt was uſually attended with <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners;</hi> yet they were <hi>Sinners</hi> converted by the efficacy of his Doctrine, they were <hi>Publicans</hi> rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, whoſe teſtimony of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> was the more authentick, as it more plainly evinced that this Religion was the only one truly capable of ſanctifying Mankind. Certainly I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a more evident ſign of the Divinity of our Saviours <hi>Miſſion</hi> than to ſee that he acted with ſo much efficacy, that ſinful women came, and waſh'd his feet with repentant tears, and wiped them with their Hairs; that one word of his could draw <hi>Levi</hi> from the <hi>receit of Cuſtom,</hi> oblige <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> to follow him, to forſake their Nets, their Boat, and even their Father <hi>Zebedee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, if Jeſus Chriſt made his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples utterly renounce all worldly advantages,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94927:69"/>
'twas meerly by the hopes he gave them of a bleſſed and eternal life, and conſequently it was to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thus to renounce them. I grant it: but then I ſay this conſideration makes for us, and is more than ſufficient to give an invincible Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> For if the Diſciples did verily expect an everlaſting Life from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and if it was purely on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that intereſt, the greateſt indeed of all our Intereſts, and of that hope, far ſtronger than all their paſſions, that they ſuffered ſuch torments for the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> (as we muſt either believe it, or look upon the Diſciples as ſo many Fools or mad Men) I ſay if the Diſciples hoped for eternal life from him, it neceſſarily follows thence, that they ſincerely believed him to be what he profeſsd himſelf to be; ſince they could not expect eternal life from an Impoſtor. And if they believed his calling to be true, they likewiſe believed his <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> to be ſo too. And if they thought his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Reſurrection true, it follows thence that they were neceſſarily ſo; it being impoſſible that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould have deceived themſelves in certain matters of fact which required only ſeeing, hearing and feeling.</p>
                  <p>Let the Incredulous uſe what Shifts and Evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they pleaſe, I dare ſay they can bring nothing but abſurd impertinencies in anſwer to this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we look upon to have the force of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. If the Apoſtles expected everlaſting life from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it follows thence that they could not look upon him as an Impoſtor, nor abet his Impoſture, nor be Impoſtors themſelves, as they neceſſarily muſt have been, were not the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> infallibly true. Now 'tis moſt certain that the Diſciples did hope for everlaſting life from Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he never propoſed any other object
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94927:70"/>
to their Faith, he foretold them nothing but Croſſes and tribulations in this life, publickly declaring that <hi>his Kingdom was not of this World;</hi> beſides Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Reaſon taught them the very ſame thing; they themſelves declared in all their Epiſtles that they expected nothing but croſſes and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in this life, comparing it to a <hi>Warfare,</hi> a <hi>Wreſtling,</hi> the World to a <hi>Field of Battel;</hi> calling themſelves the <hi>Champions</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually rejoycing that they were to ſuffer in hopes of the Crown that was reſerv'd for them.</p>
                  <p>As to the Fourth Objection, we anſwer that we are willing to compare the Witneſſes of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue with thoſe Writings of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Synagogue teſtify'd that which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, that which they had not ſeen, and which they therefore could have no certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of. For who can believe the report of the Watch? If they really ſaw any one taking away the body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> why did they not prevent it? But if they did not ſee it, how can their Teſtimony be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid? But as for the Diſciples of the Lord, they teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd thoſe matters of fact which their Eyes were Witneſſes to. <hi>That which we have ſeen,</hi> ſay they, <hi>with our Eyes, which we have heard with our Ears, and our Hands have handled of the Word of Life, declare we unto you,</hi> 1 John 1. 1. The former Witneſſes were Soldiers, the latter Martyrs. The former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſwade men by force, the latter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them maugre all the violence offered to them. To be ſuch a witneſs as the Apoſtles were, there is need of Conſtancy and perſwaſion. To be ſuch a one as thoſe ſuborned by the Synagogue, there is need only of fury and violence. But was there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a one of either party that recanted his Opinion? Yes without doubt, and this conſideration alone is ſufficient to decide the Controverſy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:94927:70"/>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> a ſervant of the Synagogue going one day to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> not only to teſtify that Jeſus Chriſt had been a Seducer, but alſo to perſecute all thoſe that believed on him, was on a ſudden changed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Diſciple of him whom before he went about ſo furiouſly to perſecute. <hi>Judas</hi> on the contrary a Diſciple and Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, renounced his Maſter, and deliver'd him to the <hi>Jews</hi> who put him to Death. Here are two ſeveral witneſſes who ſeem to recant their opinion, but conſider the different end of their Recantation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> was a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> the Son of a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and conſequently a Member of a Sect particularly exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He had obtained letters from the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> or grand Councel at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the Synagogues of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to demand aſſiſtance from them againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that dwelt therein, whom he had purpoſed to himſelf to drag along to Priſon, and to put to Death, as he had done ſeveral others before. He was therefore on his journey, and drew nigh unto <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> he was upon the point of ſatisfying his rage and fury; but on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he is altogether changed. What was there that could have obliged this Witneſs thus to recant? What proffers were then made to him, or who was then in a condition to make him any? What unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected force ſo ſuddenly overthrew all the deſigns and prejudices of a man that was juſt going to ſhed the blood of <hi>Christians?</hi> He went about afterwards preaching that he had ſeen <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that a great light ſhone round about him, that the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven were revealed unto him. He affirmed that God had ſet him forth unto the World, and <hi>that he became a Spectacle unto Men and Angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 9.</p>
                  <p>If men will not credit his report, let them try him by torments, and ſee what effect they will have
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94927:71"/>
upon him. Let them load him with Chains, and caſt him into Priſon, let them expoſe him to Wild beaſts at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> let the Elements, Men, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils be all at once ſet againſt him; let them ſcourge him, drag him along, ſtone him, let them bring him from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> from <hi>Ceſarea</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and prolong his Afflictions, <hi>Saul</hi> the Witneſs of the Synagogue 'tis true recanted his opinion; but <hi>Paul</hi> the Witneſs of <hi>Jeſus</hi> will never recant his.</p>
                  <p>Having ſeen the ſtrange alteration which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Perſon of the Miniſter of the Synagogue, let us reflect a little on that which happened to the Perſon of the Apoſtle of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. Judas</hi> betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and received for his reward thirty pieces of Silver. But how comes it to paſs he was ſo much diſturbed after he had done it? The <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>People,</hi> the <hi>Doctors,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> all favoured his crime, and let him go unpuniſhed; yet the remorſe of his own Conſcience tormented him to that degree that he could not reſt any where; and at length not being able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Deſpair, he made away with himſelf: and the Wiſdom of God ſo ordered it, that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves preſerv'd the memory of that aſtoniſhing event, by buying with that mony a field which is ſince called <hi>Aceldama,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>the price of blood.</hi> What a ſtrange difference we find in theſe two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Saul? Judas</hi> killed himſelf in the midſt of his Proſperity; but <hi>Saul</hi> rejoyced in the midſt of his afflictions. <hi>Judas</hi> prevailed upon by the Synagogue could not be comforted by the ſame, but died in deſpair. <hi>Paul</hi> became the Diſciple and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to him the Croſs of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was matter of the greateſt joy. <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſays he Gal. 6. 14 <hi>that I ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, by whom the World is crucified unto me, and I unto the World.</hi> Will any one believe that <hi>Judas</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:94927:71"/>
was his own Executioner meerly out of remorſe for having betray'd an Impoſtor to the <hi>Jews?</hi> Or that St. <hi>Paul</hi> derived from the ſenſe of his infidelity, the courage he ſhewed in all his ſufferings. Certainly it may be very properly ſaid, that they were both the Martyrs of God, but only with this difference that <hi>Judas</hi> was ſo againſt his will, but <hi>Paul</hi> voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If the conſtancy of the one teſtify'd in behalf of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> the deſpair of the other was no ſmall honour to him. And the only difference is this, that <hi>Paul</hi> was properly a Martyr, but <hi>Judas</hi> in ſpite of himſelf a witneſs of the Truth of Religion.</p>

                  <p>OF all the Objects which the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> offers to our underſtanding, there is no one ſeems more to ſhock the Reaſon of a prejudiced and incredulous perſon, than the Death of the <hi>Meſſias. The Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was, according to the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an Apoſtle, <hi>a ſcandal to the Jew and a folly to the Greek.</hi> But in our opinion there is nothing bears more viſible characters of Greatneſs and Divinity than that does. The Incredulous tell us, that could we but rid our ſelves of all our prejudices, we ſhould be heartily aſhamed to entertain ſuch ſtrange Ideas of God. And we alſo tell them, that could they once but free themſelves of thoſe paſſions which darken their underſtanding, they would certainly admire with us the wonders of ſo Divine an object. Who then is in the wrong in this thing? That will
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94927:72"/>
beſt appear by the anſwers we ſhall make to their objections.</p>
                  <p>We find in the Perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> one who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to be ſeized upon, and was afterwards nailed on a Croſs, not having any one to deliver him from the power of his Enemies. This they object was a mark of his Weakneſs. For, ſay they, had he been <hi>the King of the Jews,</hi> why did he not <hi>come down from the Croſs,</hi> and all the World would have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on him? He died as one condemned by the grand Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which God himſelf had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. This was he as was found guilty. He was ſeized <hi>with ſorrowfulneſs even unto Death</hi> the day before his Paſſion, and cried out bitterly when he gave up the Ghoſt. This ſhews his wretched condition. He was made to ſuffer a puniſhment proper only for Slaves. It cannot therefore be doubted but that he died a moſt infamous Death. And who can imagin that <hi>Weakneſs, Guilt,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Condemnation, Wretchedneſs</hi> and <hi>Infamy</hi> ſhould be the true Characters of the Son of God? Thus the Incredulous argue. We anſwer that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſuffer'd by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Council of God; ſince the Scriptures fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that <hi>he was to be wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> that <hi>he was to make his Soul an offering for ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that <hi>he was to be cut off, but not for himſelf.</hi> And St. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> ſeeing him coming to him, at a time wherein it was very unlikely he ſhould ever ſuffer, called him <hi>the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World,</hi> John 1. 29. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſuffered voluntarily; he foretold all his own Sufferings to his Diſciples, inviting them <hi>to take up their Croſs and follow him.</hi> He told them that he had made choice of a Company of miſerable and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wretches in the World who were notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to overcome the World, and by their ſufferings eſtabliſh the Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth. He
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94927:72"/>
freely owned to them that <hi>he was not come to ſettle peace in the World, but the ſword,</hi> that God <hi>would ſmite the Shepherd, and that the Sheep ſhould be ſcattered,</hi> that <hi>they were to drink of the ſame cup with him, and be Baptiſed with his Baptiſm,</hi> that is, to taſte the bitter cup of his Afflictions, and be Baptiſed with him with a Baptiſm of Blood. He intermixed his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with theirs, that they might the better bear them in remembrance. If we ſhould in the leaſt doubt whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> foretold his ſufferings, we need only conſider the deſign of the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and the time wherein this Ceremony was inſtituted. For unleſs we ſhould call in queſtion the real inſtitution of that Sacrament, and ſo affirm that the Diſciples out of an unaccountable and fantaſtical Extravagance, pretended only that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had inſtituted that Ceremony, when there was no ſuch thing: it will appear that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> foreſaw his Death, that he prepared himſelf for it, and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he ſuffer'd it voluntarily for the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> which he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in cold Blood certifies us of all theſe things. But becauſe an involuntary Death would argue a certain kind of weakneſs, 'tis alſo moſt certain that nothing can better evince the ſtrength and courage of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> than that tho' he foreſaw the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of an infamous and painful Death, yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to it with ſuch a conſtant will and firm Reſolution, that by his example he ſhewed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, how he would have them imitate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate his ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was condemned to Death by a Nation ſeditiouſly ſtirred up againſt him, and by a <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin</hi> envious of his Glory: but he was juſtified by the Conſcience of <hi>Judas,</hi> whoſe remorſe for having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him, forced him to kill himſelf, and by the ſolemn declaration of <hi>Pilate,</hi> who waſhed his hands
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94927:73"/>
in the preſence of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſhew that he was <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the Blood of that juſt Perſon.</hi> He was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied too by the voice of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> who ſaw the prodigies his Death was attended withall, and ſoon after by the mouths even of thoſe who ſought his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and who being prick'd to the heart, cry'd out to the Apoſtles, <hi>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do,</hi> Act. 2. 37. And certainly 'tis a very great glory to our <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that the moſt guilty Conſcience, the moſt unjuſt judges, the moſt inſenſible and hardened ſort of Soldiers, and the moſt barbarous Murtherers ſhould even bare record of his Innocence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> ſuffered, but it was for our ſakes: he gave himſelf up to the ſorrow and anguiſh of Death, and <hi>made his life an offering for Sin.</hi> And if thoſe wounds are counted honourable which a Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ſighting in the preſence of his King, and if thoſe which a King receives for the ſafety of his Subjects are eſteemed yet far more glorious: what Glory then did <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſerve, who ſuffered in the preſence and by the will of his Father for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his People and Children, and who by his ſufferings eſtabliſhed ſuch an Empire which no power can diſſolve?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſuffered a puniſhment proper only to Slaves; but we are alſo very certain, that during the time of his ſufferings, he ſhewed himſelf to have a power over Nature her ſelf, ſince the Graves were opened at his Death, the Rocks rent, the Sun was darkened, and the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain: And it is impoſſible that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Lord ſhould have invented ſo ſenſible and ſignal matters of fact, againſt the freſh and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick knowledge which thoſe men that lived in their days had of it, without being guilty of ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance which is more than humane.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:94927:73"/>
But here we will ask the Incredulous in our turn, whether a voluntary Death, an innocence publickly own'd, the ſorrows and anguiſh which a man ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Charity to the World, the homages which even inſenſible Creatures paid to him whom men ſcorned and condemned, were not certain Characters worthy of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that had been promiſed us?</p>
                  <p>Indeed if you take away the proofs which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Son of God, you may then call his Croſs a ſcandal to him and the World, but whilſt thoſe proofs ſhall be left entire, his Croſs will ſerve the more to illuſtrate his Majeſty and Grandeur, and we ſhall not only then aſſert that it was a voluntary Death which he underwent, and a Death that was foretold us; but we ſhall alſo ſhew that it is as it were a looking-glaſs-like, wherein we may ſee at once all the vertues of man, and all the Attributes of God. There we may find the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> of a man, who ſuffered every thing from his equals, and from thoſe who ought to have been his Servants and Diſciples, the <hi>Charity</hi> of a man who pray'd for them that put him to Death; the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy</hi> of a juſt man, who bore the burden of the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of mankind; and the <hi>constancy</hi> of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man, who at once as it were wreſtled with the fury of men, and the Juſtice of God. There we may ſee the <hi>Masterpiece</hi> of Divine Wiſdom, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of our Enemies fruſtrated, and the deſigns of God triumphing over the vain opinions and projects of men; the <hi>propitiation</hi> of ſins made for us by the moſt dreadful parricide that was ever committed or conceived; the <hi>Synagogue</hi> buried in his grave whom they barbarouſly put to Death in defence of their priviledges; the <hi>Romans</hi> crowning a King with thorns who was to rule over all Nations, and putting a Reed inſtead of a Scepter into his hands, <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> ſhewing us in the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the true pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94927:74"/>
of mortification; <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> dying attended with almoſt infinite numbers of Martyrs, who were willing to die in imitation of him, who was Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the World only by his ſhame, who crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fleſh by the preaching of his Croſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured <hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> to the Souls of them that dyed by the Anguiſh of his Agony.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo ſee the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God clearly manifeſted in his Death. For what other Victim could have better evinced Gods hatred for Sin? What preſent could have been made unto men, that could have better diſcovered Gods love to them? The <hi>Incredulous</hi> therefore reproach us with the meanneſs of an object, wherein the vertues of men, and the attributes of God himſelf are ſhewn in their greateſt height and perfection.</p>
                  <p>But let him that any ways doubts, it, conſider the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which is as it were a key that opens all theſe Events to us. To dye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under the power of Death, is indeed an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mark of weakneſs and miſery: but to dye and yet overcome Death by riſing from the Grave, is the mark of a ſupernatural power and a divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Thus <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> deſcended into the lower parts of the Earth for no other end but to aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, as the Eye-witneſſes of that great and notable Event did plainly teſtify.</p>
                  <p>But the Incredulous will not believe their report, and they further pretend, that they can find in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory the example of a teſtimony very like that, which was nevertheleſs without contradiction repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Romulus.</hi>
                     </note>to be a meer Impoſture. We read ſay they, that after the Death of <hi>Romulus,</hi> there was a certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator, who having always lived in the repute of a very honeſt man, certified that <hi>Romulus</hi> was aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Heaven, where he was inſerted among the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94927:74"/>
Gods, and that this Monarch had appeared unto him, &amp;c. Is not this a matter of fact not unlike that which the Diſciples teſtify'd of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Univerſe?</p>
                  <p>'Tis very like it indeed, only it has theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing differences; there you read of a ſingle perſon teſtifying that he had ſeen <hi>Romulus</hi> aſcended into Heaven; but here you have a very great number of people who certifiy'd that they had ſeen <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> after his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> There it is pretended that a great and triumphant Monarch during the courſe of his life, was inſerted amongſt the Gods after his Death; (which agrees well enough with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions of the Vulgar) but here that a man died a Death proper only to Slaves; that he roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and aſcended into Heaven, which is a thing that could not eaſily enter of it ſelf into any mans mind. There a <hi>Senator</hi> made uſe of a lie to free the Senate from the accuſation of having murthered their King; but here we find men who expoſed themſelves to Death, and to torments, if it were poſſible more inſufferable than Death it ſelf, to bear witneſs of that they look'd upon as a Truth. There it appears that 'twas a cuning man who ſoftned a multitude enraged for the murther of their King, by impoſing upon their beleif: but here we have only ſimple and ignorant perſons, who by their teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony convinced even the moſt obſtinate amongſt the Learned, and engaged them alſo to ſuffer Martyrdom. There a ſingle perſon barely affirmed without any proof, that <hi>Romulus</hi> had appeared to him: here we have ſuch Witneſſes as convince us of the Truth of their Teſtimony by the moſt real and ſenſible proofs in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon them, and which they themſelves frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imparted to others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:94927:75"/>
But laſtly, it may be objected that we ſee now a days certain <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> pretending themſelves inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals to them as they ſay, both what they ſhould do and believe, whereas all men of ſenſe know very well they do but dream all this while; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too the Diſciples might have falſly pretended they had received the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. It will ſoon be ſeen how wretchedly fooliſh and trivial this ſame objection is, if it be only conſidered that tho theſe <hi>Enthuſiasts</hi> vainly boaſt of their being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired, yet they pretend not to confirm their Doctrine by working any Miracles, or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrange Languages, &amp;c. They think themſelves inſpired in reſpect of their Doctrine only; and ſince they commonly ſpeak in the ſtile of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they have continually before their eyes, we have no reaſon to wonder at their taking for an inſpiration a continual repetition of that they have ſo often read over. But the Apoſtles not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended themſelves inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, (that they might not advance any thing but what was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and conformable to the Holy Scriptures) but they affirmed alſo they had received ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and miraculous gifts, the truth of which they could at any time juſtify by their Works. And if you ſhould doubt it, you need only obſerve they did not prove the ſame by meer ſpeculations, but by calling to bear witneſs of what they ſaid, the ſenſes of thoſe they ſpoke to, nay the eyes of the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves both their Maſters and their Enemies too. <hi>He therefore being,</hi> ſay they, <hi>by the right hand of God exalted, has ſhed forth this which ye now ſee and hear,</hi> Acts 2. 33. If you ſhould doubt whether St. <hi>Peter</hi> really ſpoke juſt after this manner to the <hi>Jews;</hi> the multitude of thoſe Proſelytes converted by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Demonſtration, and a whole Church
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94927:75"/>
purely founded by the efficacy of the ſame, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently warrant the certainty of it. Should you ſuppoſe that the Diſciples deceived the multitude, we will only remind you that they had to deal with ſeveral learned and skillful Adverſaries, tho' they themſelves were but ſimple and ignorant People. If you ſhould imagin that the Vulgar delighted in ſuffering themſelves to be thus miſerably deluded, we will only put you in mind, that there could be no <hi>Faith</hi> more Grievous or terrible, according to the judgment of men, than that which they embraced when they turned <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> that it highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them throughly to examin ſuch matters of fact, the belief of which obliged them to ſuffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that thoſe of <hi>Berea</hi> who daily took care to compare the holy Scriptures, to know whether all things were really ſo as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had told them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would not have failed to conſult their eyes and ears, to be aſſured whether the Apoſtles had any reaſon to pretend they could do ſigns and wonders; this latter examination being more ſure and eaſy than the former; that 'twas not once or twice only St. <hi>Paul</hi> boaſted of having made himſelf known by many ſigns, miracles and wonders wrought by him in the preſence of thoſe he wrote his exhortations to; that every one of his Epiſtles is full of Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this kind, or of thoſe things viſibly relating thereunto; that he derived both his Arguments and the motives of his exhortations from that undeniably known effuſion of the ſupernatural graces of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. Certainly no man can imagin St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo ſenſeleſs as to write to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>Wherefore, Brethren, covet to prophecy, and forbid not to ſpeak with tongues,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 19. ſuppoſing thoſe gifts had not been actually viſible in the Church; nor would he have taken ſo much care to remedy thoſe diſorders which aroſe from the abuſe of thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94927:76"/>
gifts, as we have already obſerv'd he did. Neither would he have warned them that <hi>the end of Prophecying</hi> was to edifie the faithful, but that <hi>the gift of Tongues</hi> as being miraculous was to convince the Incredulous. Laſtly, he would never have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to correct the diſorders of men, who valued thoſe extraordinary Gifts more than <hi>Charity</hi> it ſelf, as we ſee he did when he obſerved, <hi>that whether there were prophecies, they ſhould fail, whether there were Languages, they ſhould ceaſe: but that Charity did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we may eaſily ſee by his words how fully he was perſwaded of theſe things. He had ſo great an admiration for ſo many miracles, ſigns, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works, which the Spirit of God wrought in the ſight of men; that he knew not well what ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able name to give to that Divine principle. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he called it <hi>The excellency of the power of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 7. ſometimes, <hi>the exceeding greatneſs of his power,</hi> Eph. 1. 19. ſometimes, <hi>the Excellency of the power of his might,</hi> Eph. 6. 10. All which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are to the full as Natural as they are ſtrong, and diſcover to us beyond all the arguments in the World the Idea St. <hi>Paul</hi> had of thoſe miraculous gifts, and conſequently that too which we our ſelves ought to have of them.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Natural Temper, Diſpoſitions, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the Diſciples, and what ſort of prejudices they were poſſeſſed with, when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> manifeſted himſelf to them.</head>
                  <p>WE cannot better diſcover what Impreſſion the matters of fact related in the Goſpel may have, or ought to have wrought upon the minds of the Diſciples, than by conſidering what ſort of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices they were till then poſſeſſed with. We ſhall therefore begin this third Section with the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
                  <p>Since the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were originally <hi>Jews,</hi> they muſt needs have been poſſeſt with theſe five following prejudices. I. They were fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be attended with temporal Proſperity. II. They imagined that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> would reſtore the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to its former Glory, and once more raiſe up the houſe of <hi>David</hi> out of that diſgrace,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94927:77"/>
and almoſt oblivion it had lain under, to its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Power and Majeſty. III. They believed their Law to be of an eternal duration. (Now by their Law I do not here underſtand the <hi>Moral</hi> Law only, but the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> one too, or rather the whole body of it in general, containing both the <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial</hi> Law.) IV. They eſteemed their Sacrifices to be the moſt ſacred and moſt inviolable Duty of their Religion, and they were far from imagining that thoſe Sacrifices enjoyned by their Law ſhould on a ſudden ceaſe, as ſoon as one Man was put to Death. V. And laſtly, they could not conſider the <hi>Gentiles</hi> but as an unclean and abominable ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in compariſon to themſelves. For beſides the ſin of Idolatry (which the <hi>Jews</hi> accounted ſo capital a crime as to deſerve that God ſhould for ever caſt them off who were guilty of it) the <hi>Heathens</hi> were variouſly polluted and defiled according to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the <hi>Jews</hi> had of their Law, ſince they uſed none of thoſe Ceremonies that were abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their external Sanctification, by avoiding all uncleanneſs and legal Impurities.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt prejudice, it can never be doubted but that the <hi>Jews</hi> expected a temporal Proſperity from their <hi>Meſſias.</hi> For beſides that the Prophets ſeem'd to have diſpoſed them thereto by ſo many excellent and noble Prophecies utter'd concerning him, who knows but that they might look upon <hi>Herod the great</hi> (tho born an <hi>Idumean)</hi> as the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> who was to come, being ſurpriſed at the noiſe of his Victories, the pomp of his Triumphs, and that conſtant Proſperity that continually follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Reign?</p>
                  <p>Nay it ſeems very probable, that <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf had a deſign to be taken for the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and therefore cauſed the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, on purpoſe to re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>build it after a more
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94927:77"/>
glorious and magnificent manner; ſince it was the received opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> of thoſe days that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to have been the glory of that Houſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the Predictions of the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>But whether there be or no any grounds for that conjecture, 'tis true at leaſt that his ſurpriſing victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and proſperity had made ſo great an impreſſion upon the minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of them imagined, that <hi>Herod</hi> was the <hi>Meſſias</hi> whom the Prophets had promiſed, and who was to raiſe their Nation to the height of Happineſs and Proſperity. For this opinion gave riſe to the Sect of the <hi>Herodians</hi> that is mentioned in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And we ought not to wonder at it, ſince the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart of man delights in nothing ſo much as worldly grandeur and temporal proſperity. Therein conſiſt the pleaſures of great as well as mean Perſons; and he that ſhall but conſult the Hiſtory of Mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will find that from the beginning of the World, thoſe Societies which were diſtinguiſhed from others by the ſplendor of honours, or enjoyment of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proſperity, ſtill prevailed over all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Second received opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> was, that their <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to reſtore the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to its former glory. For on one hand their <hi>Prophets</hi> had taught them that the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſhould reign, and <hi>endure as long as the Sun and Moon;</hi> And on the other they were ſenſible that the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> was partly extinguiſhed, and partly fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſgrace and humiliation. They expected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that he would reſtore it again. And altho' the people had for a long time been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by ſeveral Kings not deſcended from the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> yet they ſtill fed themſelves up with that imaginary hope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:94927:78"/>
But above, all the <hi>Jews</hi> were firmly perſwaded of the perpetual Duration of their Law, that is, that people ſhould continually come up from all parts of the World to worſhip in Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and offer up variety of ſacrifices in the Holy Land. 'Twas this Law they had heard ſo often mention'd in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, which their Parents, their Elders and their Teachers had ſo often entertained them with in their common diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>They heard every body ſpeak of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with a great deal of reſpect, and 'twas reputed a great oath among them to ſwear by the City of the great King. They conſidered the <hi>Levites</hi> as ſo many Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and the Prieſts as the Viſible Miniſters of an inviſible God that was pleaſed to dwell among them. They ſent yearly to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the tenth of their goods; and brought an infinite variety of victims to be there offered up to God. They thought they could neither be acceptable in the ſight of God nor man, unleſs they practiſed all the Cuſtoms their law preſcribed them, touching their purity and external ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>They had ſeen the greateſt ſeverities inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the infringers of that Law: and the four ſorts of puniſhments ordained by the Law againſt the Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it <hi>(viz.</hi> that they ſhould be ſtrangled, or cut off by the Sword, or Burnt, or ſtoned to Death, according to the enormity of their crime) were continually before their eyes, and almoſt daily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon thoſe that were guilty in breach of the Law; ſo that they could not but look upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the Law as ſacred and inviolable duties, they were obliged to perform. Now 'tis obvious to every one how great an impreſſion theſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt neceſſarily make upon the minds of the meaner ſort of people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:94927:78"/>
They were filled with the thoughts of their <hi>Feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivals</hi> and <hi>Solemnities,</hi> which were ſo very proper to fix and ſtay their minds by that great number both of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> they were attended with. Thrice every year they were enjoyned to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> during ſuch certain ſacred times, which they were obliged to obſerve with a particular devotion; and it was forbidden them to diſcourſe any thing elſe during the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> but of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Captivity which the antient <hi>Iſraelites</hi> endur'd in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 13. 8. Neither were they permitted to eat any thing for ſeven days together but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Bread, in token of that Bread of affliction which their Forefathers had eaten. They were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to kill as many Lambs as there were Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies dwelling in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in token of the antient paſſage of the deſtroying Angel over the Houſes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was to be commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with no leſs ſolemnity, at which time they were obliged to offer up to God the firſt fruits of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was a part of their Duty to obſerve yearly a ſolemn and general Faſt the tenth day of <hi>September,</hi> as alſo to reſt from all manner of Labour the firſt and laſt day of the Feaſt of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> as well as the day called <hi>Kipur,</hi> in which they were not ſuffered ſo much as to eat, or drink, or anoint, or waſh themſelves. They were obliged to dwell ſeven days together in Tents during the Feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> which Ceremony was particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to commemorate the abode of the antient <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now every one knows that the greater number of Feſtivals and Solemnities there is in any <hi>Religion,</hi> the more impreſſion they make upon the minds of the people, who are apt to think that Religion chiefly conſiſts in external Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:94927:79"/>
'Tis certain that the great number and variety of ſacrifices preſcribed in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and duly performed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> was capable enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this effect in the minds of the people. For they thoght every thing was to be offered to God. They offered him men, which was called <hi>Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> They offered him the fruits of the Earth, which was called <hi>Oblation.</hi> They offered him their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, which was termed <hi>Libation.</hi> They offered him Spices which were burnt in his preſence, and that was called <hi>Burning of Incenſe.</hi> Laſtly, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him four-footed Beaſts, which was more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> They offered him alſo Burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, and other ordinary Sacrifices. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Sin-offerings, and Peace-offerings. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſome ſet ſacrifices, and others accidental and occaſional. They offered two daily, one in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the other in the evening; as alſo an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary one every week, and another extraordinary one every month, and new ones on every ſolemn feaſt day. They offered them either for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, or for thoſe of private perſons in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. But on the day of the ſolemn expiation, they offered then two ſacrifices, the one which the High-Prieſt offered for himſelf and his whole Family at his own proper charge, and the other he offered at the charge of the people, for the ſins of the people. Then they choſe two he-Goats, one whereof was offered as a ſacrifice for ſin, and was burnt out of the Camp, or City, and the other was ſent into a deſart near a mountain called <hi>Hazazel,</hi> where it was caſt down head long. Which being done, the High-Prieſt cloathed in white Raiments, enter'd into the moſt holy place, holding a <hi>Cenſer</hi> in his hands full of hot burning Coals, on which he would ſprinkle all ſorts of ſpices, the ſmoak whereof made a kind of cloud, which covered the Mercy-ſeat all over, on which he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94927:79"/>
would then power the Blood of the he-Goat that had been ſlain in the <hi>Porch.</hi> This being done, the High-Prieſt pull'd off his ſacred Robes, and having put on again his uſual Garments, return'd back to his own Houſe, accompanied by all the people, who ended the day with feſtivals and rejoycings, becauſe the High-Prieſt was come out from the preſence of God ſafe and ſound. So great a number therefore and variety both of Ceremonies and Sacrifices, could not but naturally have a great power over the minds of thoſe, who from their infancy had had all thoſe objects continually before their eyes.</p>
                  <p>We ought to make the ſame judgment on their different kinds of purification. For as <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> only make us think Nudity a ſhameful and unbecoming ſtate for any man to be ſeen in; ſo <hi>Cuſtom, Education</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> which is often of more force than either, made them eſteem all thoſe unclean, who had contracted any <hi>legal</hi> impurities. The camp of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the deſart, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was divided in three parts: the firſt was the place or habitation of God himſelf, who dwelt either in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> or the <hi>Temple.</hi> The ſecond was that of the <hi>Levites,</hi> who dwelt round about the <hi>Sanctuary:</hi> and the third was that of the people, which was ſeparated from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by that of the <hi>Levites.</hi> In like manner they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed three ſorts of unclean perſons: The firſt ſort were only excluded from the Temple or Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place of God; ſuch were all thoſe who had touched any dead Carcaſs, or were uncircumciſed: The ſecond being look'd upon as more unclean than the firſt, were ſhut out both of the firſt and the ſecond habitation, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the Temple and the Habitation of the <hi>Levites,</hi> that is, they were entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded out of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> ſuch were all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after Child bearing, or all men and women that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94927:80"/>
had any natural or accidental impurities: Laſtly, the third, the moſt unclean of all were excluded out of thoſe three Habitations, and utterly ſequeſtred from the <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> of the people. Such were all <hi>Lepers</hi> who were not only looked upon as defiled, but alſo as perſons who might eaſily defile other people, and who to diſtinguiſh and make themſelves known in thoſe very places where they lived a part by themſelves, were obliged according to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Tradition to wear torn garments, to let their hairs grow, and walk about with their faces cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a vail, as if they were capable of defiling other men by their very looks, or as if other men were afraid to contaminate their eyes by looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as it appears by the alluſion of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to that cuſtom, in the prophecy contained in his 53. Chap. v. 3. <hi>We hid as it were our face from him,</hi> that is, as the Comment imports, <hi>as one hideth his face from a Leper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certain that ſo many cautions being required of them to avoid the contracting of any legal impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, to caſt out from among them the unclean perſons, to purify themſelves either by Waſhing, or Sacrifices, or the Aſhes of a red Cow; as alſo the prejudices which this Cuſtom ſupported by Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſtrictly enjoyn'd by the Law of God, ſo naturally ſuggeſted in their minds; I ſay it is certain that all theſe motives were the original cauſe of that invincible averſion the <hi>Jews</hi> had both for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were in divers reſpects very unclean in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to them, and for every new Religion that might either permit, or not at all inſiſt upon thoſe corporeal and external Impurities.</p>
                  <p>Add to this the profound reverence they had for the Temple, which the Antient <hi>Iſraelites</hi> us'd to call with ſuch tranſports of Admiration, <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord;</hi> The reſpect they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94927:80"/>
had for the <hi>Levites,</hi> to whom God had commited the care of the Temple, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. and the Prieſts in whomwas required ſo much purity, that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to perform their Sacerdotal office without having firſt waſhed their Hands and Feet, who were to bleſs the People, to burn Incenſe and offer the common and ordinary offerings, and who alſo were anointed as well as <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> to ſhew how accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they were in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Add alſo to this, the great care their Lawgiver had taken to engrave their Religion on their Walls, and even upon their Garments, which latter were to have the Law, or at leaſt the greateſt part of it, written upon them, as alſo the pious care that ſame Lawgiver had taken to ſanctify the Eſtates of the Rich, in teaching them how to conſecrate them to God, and to comfort the poor in their neceſſities, by enacting ſuch admirable Laws deſigned only for their Subſiſtence, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 7, 8, 24.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To all this you may yet further add thoſe wonderful Laws of <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> whereby their Lawgiver had ſo prudently determined what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhouldbe executed in the midſt of that people: thoſe Laws which ſeemed to be only the firſt and moſt juſt determinations of the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> and which may and ought to ſerve for an example to all <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Laws eſtabliſhed in the World.</p>
                  <p>Now from all this it neceſſarily follows; Firſt, That the Diſciples could not look upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Meſſias</hi> who was to come, and whom their Nation expected with ſo great impatience, without expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him a Temporal Happineſs and Proſperity. This plainly appears by the requeſt which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s Children made to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> when ſhe came to him, ſaying, <hi>Lord grant that theſe my two Sons may ſit, the one on the Right Hand, and the other on the Left in thy Kingdom, Mat.</hi> 20. 21. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94927:81"/>
therefore muſt neceſſarily be ſtrangely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hear that their Maſter was not come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but to ſerve, and give his Life as a Ranſom for many; that he ſhould be the greateſt in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom who was moſt humble; and that the greateſt was to be as the leaſt, and as one that ſerveth.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, how ſtrangely muſt their hopes be croſs'd to ſee that nothing but Miſery, Poverty and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, continually attended the profeſſion they had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, of following <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They muſt have certainly found ſomething or other in their Maſter, which recompens'd the loſs of that Temporal Proſperity they ſo eagerly thirſted after, and made them patiently endure all ſorts of Afflictions; and that recompence could be nothing elſe but the Doctrine or Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Yet 'twas not his Doctrine, becauſe they underſtood it not for along time, as is evident by ſo many vain, frivolous, abſurd and ridiculous queſtions that were offenſive, and ſavoured of little reſpect to their Maſter. Beſides, what was moſt holy and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to perſwade men to embrace his Doctrine, was that part of it which was moſt ſpiritual, and that part was hid from them, and they could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, becauſe their minds were filled only with groſs and carnal Ideas of the World, as it appears by their Diſcourſes to their Maſter, which they themſelves relate after ſo ſimple and ingenuous a manner. They muſt then neceſſarily have found in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> ſuch miracles as ſerved them inſtead of all their o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her deſires. And 'tis by them chiefly that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> proved the truth and Divinity of his Calling to them. He told them that the Father had not left him without a witneſs, but that <hi>the works which he did, teſtify'd that the Father had ſent him.</hi> And on another occaſion he ſolemnly declared that there was a greater witneſs than <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> adding
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94927:81"/>
that the works which the Father had given him to do, were thoſe that ſhould teſtify of him.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps it may here be objected, that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> could draw a great multitude after him, and be eſteemed a Prophet among the <hi>Jews,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wrought any Miracles, at leaſt none that we know of, or meet with in the Goſpel, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it's no wonder if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as well as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> drew a great number of Diſciples after him, not ſo much upon the account of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as his extraordinary Piety, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he made them of an Eternal Life. To this I anſwer Firſt, that tho' we read of no kind of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> wrought himſelf in the whole Courſe of his Life, or of his Miniſtry, yet it is ſufficient that his Birth was ſignalized by a very ſurpriſing Miracle, which was ſufficiently known by all his Nation, to make them expect great and wonderful matters from him. Secondly, I ſay that as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> wrought no Miracles, ſo neither was he looked upon as a Prophet that was to have done any. He was not that <hi>Meſſias</hi> of whom it had beeen foretold that he ſhould be <hi>the deſire of all Nations,</hi> that he ſhould be called the <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> of the World, at whoſe coming God would ſhake Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and the dry Land. He was no more than his <hi>forerunner: He was the voice of one crying in the Wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his Paths ſtraight, Matt.</hi> 3. 3. Thirdly, <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> declared only to them the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which could not but very much pleaſe the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which perfectly well agreed with their Hopes and Opinions. His Miniſtry had nothing but what was very grateful and pleaſant. And it was not requiſite he ſhould work any Miracles to exhort the <hi>Jews</hi> to receive the moſt wellcome tidings they could ever hear of. But it was not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94927:82"/>
ſo with <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> who was obliged to ſhew the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in his own Perſon, and him too ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that Idea they had framed to themſelves of him, even from their infancy. So that he could not chuſe but exaſperate them againſt him. And to this (if I may mention it by the way) we ought to refer the different ſucceſs of the Miniſtry of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the predictions of the prophets, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that <hi>John the Baptist</hi> ſhould reconcile the Hearts of the Parents to the Children, but on the contrary, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would be a ſtumbling block, and an offence to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo eagerly expected the coming of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they framed a very agreeable Idea of him to themſelves, as they do ſtill to this day. They inveſted him with all the Splendor and Glory they could poſſibly wiſh to themſelves. They painted him (if I may ſo ſpeak) in Colours ſuitable to their own Pride and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They expected they ſhould ſpeedily have <hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth for their <hi>nurſing Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> for their <hi>nurſing Mothers,</hi> nay they imagined no leſs than to have them immediately for <hi>Man Servants</hi> and <hi>Maid Servants.</hi> Theſe things they had been told of from their Infancy; and that Carnal and Temporal <hi>Meſſias</hi> they fancied, was as it were the Idol of their Hearts. Soon after <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World, who ſetting forth the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in ſuch terms as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> had made uſe of before him, publickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven was at Hand, Mat.</hi> 3 2 At the report of this agreeable voice, all the people ran in crouds to hear it from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from <hi>Decapolis,</hi> from <hi>Judea,</hi> from <hi>Galilee,</hi> and from the Cities beyond <hi>Jordain. John</hi> preached <hi>Repentance</hi> to them as a neceſſary preparation to become partakers
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94927:82"/>
of all the Benefits they were to expect under the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> and they willingly hearkened to his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He exhorted them to be reconciled to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſo to become Subjects of the ſame <hi>Heavenly</hi> King: they renounced then all their differences and quarrels, the dear expectation they had of their <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſtifling in their hearts all Paſſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments. But when <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> had as it were led them by the Hand to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, they were ſtrangely ſurpriſed to find in him nothing of what they expected. They found in him <hi>Poverty,</hi> where they thought to have found <hi>Riches, Shame</hi> and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> where they thought to have met no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but great Splendor and Temporal Glory. For this Reaſon therefore they rejected him with Horrour and Abomination; all their thoughts being on a ſudden changed into indignation and anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, in whom before they had fixed all their imaginary hopes.</p>
                  <p>But tho' the generality of his Nation caſt him off, there were yet a certain number of perſons who were willing to follow him; and that number daily increaſed in proportion as <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi>'s ſufferings and afflictions increaſed. There were at firſt but twelve whom he called to his Service. Then ſent he ſeventy others abroad, who were ſucceeded by a great may others after his Death. And their number further increaſing with the fury of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin,</hi> there were at length many ſeen who teſtify'd in behalf of that crucified man.</p>
                  <p>But how come thoſe Diſciples to follow a <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſo contrary to their firſt Ideas and receiv'd opinions? How is it poſſible they ſhould not have been diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at his Croſs, unleſs <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had promiſed them to do ſigns and wonders? How could they have been with him night and day for three Years and an half, without inquiring into that important matter of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94927:83"/>
fact, or knowing whether he were really able to do Miracles or not? Or how is it poſſible when they found their miſtake, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was but an ordinary ſort of a man, uncapable of working any ſigns or wonders, they ſhould not have forſaken him as a Whymſical Impoſtor? How could their minds be ſo ſuddenly changed, as to look on <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> and <hi>Meanneſs, Miſery</hi> and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> as upon the true and real Character of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they I ſay, whoſe minds <hi>Education</hi> had filled only with carnal Ideas of the flouriſhing Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as?</hi> But above all, how could they be preſent at the Crucifixion of their Maſter, without being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the laſt greateſt Conſternation and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
                  <p>So that the ſecond Conſequence which may very well be drawn from theſe principles already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, is that the Diſciples having always imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with their Fathers and Mothers, their Brothers and Siſters, their Teachers and Elders, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with their whole Nation, that their <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould have reſtored the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood thoſe words in a literal ſenſe, it is impoſſible but that they ſhould be extreamly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſee him wearing a Crown of Thorns upon his Head, when he was nailed on the Croſs, and a Reed inſtead of a Scepter in his Hand: Nay more than this, 'tis <hi>morally</hi> impoſſible but that this object muſt have rooted out of their Hearts all thoughts of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> and all pretenſions to <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and Temporal <hi>Proſperity,</hi> which their Blindneſs had cauſed them to conceive upon this mans ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; unleſs there had happened ſince his Death ſuch ſupernatural and extraordinary things, as were able to revive in their Heart ſuch great hopes as theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:94927:83"/>
Thirdly, We ſhall conclude from the Principles we have already eſtabliſhed, that the Diſciples as well as all other <hi>Jews,</hi> being as it were ty'd to their <hi>Religion</hi> by what they had <hi>Seen</hi> and <hi>Heard,</hi> by their <hi>Inclination</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> by their <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> by their <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Education,</hi> and by the <hi>Advantage</hi> wherewith they might well flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of being diſtinguiſhed from all other Nations of the World, and being further as it were wedded to it by that great number of Ceremonies and Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, the Juſtice and Holineſs of which they could no way doubt of, ſince they had been ſo exactly preſcribed them by the Law of God himſelf; it cannot be ſuppoſed but that they imagined their Law to be of an eternal Duration, and that being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly averſe to every new ſort of Worſhip which was contrary to that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> they could not have ſo ſuddenly altered their opinion, nor could there have happened ſo ſtrange a revolution in the Hearts and Minds of ſo many perſons united, and as it were link'd by ſo many reſpects to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> that in ſo ſmall a period of time the Souls of all thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have been ſo entirely changed, as that they ſhould begin to look upon the <hi>Jewiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> as upon a Diſpenſation granted with a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and which was to come to an end, and for the future be conſidered only as a thing altogether uſeleſs and out of Date.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs that this principle was not firſt of all approved of in the World without great conteſt and difficulty, and that there were for a while cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Judaiſing</hi> Chriſtians who taught others that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſtill in force, and that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, to joyn the Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with the Ceremonies of the Law: But then it is well known they were only either ſome of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94927:84"/>
Enemies who ſtarted theſe queſtions out of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſign to make a diviſion in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, or ſome <hi>Jews</hi> turned <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as yet very weak and not fully ſtrengthened in their belief, whoſe ſcrupulous <hi>Zeal</hi> and blind <hi>Superſtition</hi> cauſed all thoſe Controveſies. But however, 'tis evident that the true Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and eſpecially the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, were not long in an errour as to this point. They affirmed that men were juſtify'd only by the Faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> without the works of the Law. And 'tis manifeſt that in the firſt Council held at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Diſciples of our Lord aboliſhed the Cuſtoms and Rites of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt it is of no great moment, whether the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law or Religion of <hi>Moſes</hi> was aboliſhed, ten years ſooner or later. Still it is certain that it was ſometimes aboliſhed, or rather to ſpeak more exactly and truly, it was fulfilled by the Goſpel, and ſo the obſervation of it ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>Now I demand how it is poſſible that thoſe men who were ſo devoted and bigotted to that Law, who made it the object of their thoughts and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcourſe, ſhould ſo great a number of them, and in ſo ſhort a time, with one common conſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that Law which <hi>Piety</hi> made ſo venerable, and <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſo valuable in their Eſteem? Whereas ſo many ages elapſed before the coming of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> into the World could not wear out of their minds that profound eſteem and reſpect they had for that Law. For tho' they had often broke it in ſeveral reſpects, yet it may be ſaid in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half they almoſt always look'd upon it as inviolable. And can we ſuppoſe that ſo many ages as have paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> could not remove that perſwaſion ſo deeply rooted in their Mind, that their Law was to be eternal: and yet that a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94927:84"/>
few years ſhould perſwade that great multitude of Diſciples, converted by the preaching of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that all thoſe Rites and Ceremonies were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come invalid by the Death of a Man, whom the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> had condemned to be executed as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, without any extraordinary or ſupernatural accident intervening, which ſhould occaſion the framing to themſelves ſuch Ideas ſo particular, and ſo contrary to their firſt Prejudices?</p>
                  <p>Certainly we may very well affirm, that our Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Adverſaries have too great a value for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture and ignorance, when they imagin that an univerſal deluſion, and unanimous conſent to a Lye, could convert Nations, Sanctify Mankind, and ſpread the Knowledge of God throughout the World, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it was foretold by the Scriptures; or that a few ſimple and ignorant Fiſhermen, whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge extended no further than their Employment, ſhould diſcover the defects and imperfections of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, and introduce inſtead of it a <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> worſhip, as really more conformable to the Nature of God who is a Spirit, and more worthy of man who is a Spirit, and more worthy of man who is a Reaſonable Creature; that thoſe ſimple and ignorant men ſhould diſcover the Sacrifices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law to be only Types of the Death of a man, who was condemned to be executed as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; that they ſhould attribute this thought to <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and make him expreſs it only in theſe words, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World,</hi> John 1. 29. Words ſo full and comprehenſive, that they contain the whole ſum of <hi>Chriſtan Religion:</hi> And Laſtly, That they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Myſteries ſo very different from mens ordinary Thoughts and Conjectures, and ſo far above the Capacity of the moſt judicious and learned, that it may deſervedly be ſaid of them, <hi>that they are ſuch things which Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:94927:85"/>
                     <hi>has it enter'd into the Heart of Man to conceive them,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Experience</hi> tells us how difficult it is for perſons already advanced in years, to renounce the Common practices generally approved of in the World, eſpecially when authoriſed by <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Education.</hi> How hard would it be for us <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to live as the <hi>Jews?</hi> And yet it would be more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for them to live as we do. Becauſe we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their Cuſtoms as things very indifferent in themſelves, whereas they always look'd upon our Practices as ſcandalous and unlawful. How then was it that not only one or two <hi>Jews,</hi> but thouſands who had embraced Chriſtianity, no longer in the leaſt ſcrupled to converſe with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nay to to live with <hi>Heathens,</hi> who before were an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their eyes?</p>
                  <p>You will ſay this was not without many conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difficulties, and was the cauſe of ſeveral great Animoſities and Diſputes. I grant it; but yet it appears the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law was utterly aboliſhed preſently after the Death of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Apoſtles having determined that it had been accompliſhed in his Death, and that it was not Lawful to joyn the Carnal Ceremonies of the Law with the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual worſhip of the Goſpel. And I ſay, that had not the Apoſtles both teſtify'd the Miracles and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and wrought very great wonders themſelves, it was naturally impoſſible they ſhould have executed ſo great a deſign, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſo ſmall a time.</p>
                  <p>For certainly if we conſider the Diſciples as born <hi>Jews,</hi> they muſt neceſſarily have been very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to their own Law.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider them as poor and mean people, they could not but have been paſſionately fond of that Law which gave ſuch wonderful precepts for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94927:85"/>
the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and the relief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Poor.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider them as ſimple and ignorant men, they could not but have a blind love and obedience for their Law, as all ignorant People have for the external objects of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Should we conſider them as prepoſſeſſed with the uſual prejudices of their Nation, they muſt neceſſarily have expected a Glorious and Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who inſtead of aboliſhing the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould have eſtabliſhed it throughout the World.</p>
                  <p>Yet we need only conſider the event to clear the truth of this matter. We ſhall not inſiſt upon all the Reflections we might eaſily make hereupon; It's ſufficient to have taken notice of thoſe things by the by, becauſe they may ſerve in ſome meaſure to illuſtrate the particular examination we ſhall make of the Miracles of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>We have already conſidered them in general, ſufficiently to convince all reaſonable Perſons. But it may not be amiſs to inſiſt more particularly on them, that we may confound the Obſtinate and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous, and make them at leaſt truly ſenſible of their Errour, tho' perhaps we cannot reclaim them from it.</p>
                  <p>To do this better, we ſhall lay down four miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matters of fact, which ſhall be as ſo many cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Truth we enquire into, becauſe there are ſeveral lines and degrees of Evidence and Light which neceſſarily lead us to the Truth of each of theſe matters of fact, and then we ſhall joyn them all together, the better to form a full and perfect Demonſtration of them.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WE dare ſay that ſuch is the nature of theſe Miracles, that the compoſers of the Goſpel durſt not, could not, would not have forged them, had they been really falſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſay they durſt not, becauſe they could not but have been publickly known. To prove this I ſhall lay down four Examples of them, which are I. The Hiſtory of <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Father of <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> II. The Hiſtory of the Maſſacre of the young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> III. The miraculous feeding of ſeveral thouſands at ſeveral times in the Wilderneſs, with a few Loaves and ſome ſmall Fiſhes. IV. And Laſtly, the ſupernatural prodigies which happened at the death of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>As to the Firſt, we may obſerve that the Subject upon whom this great Miracle was wrought is a Prieſt; a Prieſt who daily performed the functions of his Miniſterial office, and was then actually burning Incenſe in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at a very remarkable time, during which the people who expected him, were very intent at their Prayers to God in the outward Part or Porch of the Temple, whilſt he himſelf was in the Holy Place.</p>
                  <p>Now tho' the Hiſtorian had obſerved only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Birth of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> that <hi>Zachari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife were far advanced in years, and that the latter till then was thought Barren, yet that event would have employed ſomething ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and ſurpriſing, that one might have been almoſt poſitive that the Evangeliſt durſt not have
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94927:86"/>
been ſo bold as to forge it, againſt the publick knowledge which all the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt then have had of it. How then durſt any one have affirmed that <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> wholly loſt the uſe of his Tongue whilſt he was in the Temple; that all the people were Eye-Witneſſes of it; and that he remained Speechleſs, till the time was come wherein he was obliged to give a name to that wonderful Child which God had given him in his old age, notwithſtanding the Barrenneſs of his Wife? Suppoſing the Goſpel wherein this matter of fact is related, was compoſed long after that Event: ſtill it is true that St. <hi>Luke</hi> compoſed his Goſpel before his Book of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and that he compoſed the Book of <hi>Acts</hi> ſomtime before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as we have in another place already obſerved, and as it is without doubt true. Then ſuppoſing alſo forty, fifty, or ſixty years, if you will, had paſt ſince all theſe things had happened, and before St. <hi>Luke</hi> compoſed his Goſpel; can forty, fifty, or ſixty years be ſufficient to perſwade ſeveral thouſands of people, nay all the Inhabitants of that great and flouriſhing City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they had ſeen either with their own eyes, or that their Forefathers had ſeen one of their Prieſts wholly deprived of the uſe of his tongue, becauſe he had ſeen a Viſion in the Holy Place, and yet that he recovered it preciſely and exactly at the time he was obliged to give a name to his Child?</p>
                  <p>Certainly, had none but <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Relations been acquainted with the Event of thoſe things, yet it would have argued raſhneſs in any man to invent any thing falſe concerning them. For what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance would it have been in any one to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to invent it, againſt the publick Knowledge of a whole and very numerous Nation, ſo ſolemnly aſſembled together, and ſo intent upon that Event,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94927:87"/>
nay ſo ſurpriſed at that prodigy, or if you will (according to the Incredulous) ſo fully ſatisfied that there was nothing in it but a vain <hi>Chimaera</hi> and deluſion. <hi>And the people,</hi> ſays the Hiſtorian, <hi>waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried ſo long in the Temple. And when he came out, he could not ſpeak unto them: and they perceived that he had ſeen a Viſion in the Temple: for he beckened unto them, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Speechleſs,</hi> Luke 1. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the manner in which</hi> Zacharias <hi>was healed is no leſs ſurpriſing.</hi> And it came to paſs, <hi>ſays the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt,</hi> that on the eighth day they came to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Child, and they called him Zachariah after the name of his Father. And his Mother anſwered and ſaid, not ſo, but he ſhall be called John. And they ſaid unto her, there is none of thy Kindred that is called by that name. And they made ſigns to his Father, how he would have him called. And he asked for a Writing Table, and wrote ſaying, his name is John. And they marvelled all. And his Mouth was opened immediately, and his Tongue looſed, and he ſpake, and praiſed God. And fear came on all that dwel't round about them: and all theſe ſayings were noiſed abroad through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Country of Judea, <hi>Luke 1. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it appears this Hiſtory conſiſts of two Parts, the firſt whereof was known to all the City of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and the other was ſpread abroad throughout all the Country of <hi>Judea,</hi> and certainly it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible any one ſhould have in the leaſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to impoſe upon the World in that Reſpect, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that double knowledge they muſt have had of that matter of fact.</p>
                  <p>For then the Evangeliſt would have taken away all poſſibility of belief from his Narration by the choice of thoſe Circumſtances he inſerted into his Hiſtory. Now it does not ſeem natural for an
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94927:87"/>
Author who wrote the Hiſtory of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Miracles, in a time wherein it was ſo ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and the followers of that Sect were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged and condemned to Death with ſo much Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in a time wherein as he himſelf makes the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> tell it to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking to him at the latter end of the Book of <hi>Acts</hi> Chap. 28. v. 22. <hi>For as concerning this Sect, we know that every where it is ſpoken againſt.</hi> I ſay it does not ſeem Natural that that ſame Author who knew it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay obſerved it himſelf, ſhould have publiſhed ſuch matters of fact, the falſity of which he would ſoon have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of by twenty thouſands of people, who muſt have been preſent in the Temple with <hi>Zachariah,</hi> or at leaſt heard it related by thoſe who were there preſent.</p>
                  <p>One of the moſt dangerous errors which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous plunge themſelves in, is that they imagin that the ſame diſtance of time which is between us and thoſe matters of fact related to us, is alſo to be found between thoſe very matters of fact them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thoſe who ſo related them. And they perceive not that whereas with reſpect to us 'tis many ages ago ſince all thoſe things came to paſs, yet 'twas but a little while ſince theſe things muſt neceſſarily have happened with reſpect to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples who publiſhed them to the World, either by their preaching or writings.</p>
                  <p>Now for St. <hi>Luke</hi> to have invented ſuch matters of fact, muſt either have argued in him a certain drolling Mirth and pleaſant Gayety of Spirit, in telling ſuch ſtories ſo gravely, or elſe he muſt have had but a very mean opinion of Mens ſenſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in his time, to think they could ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be deluded and impoſed upon.</p>
                  <p>The Hiſtory the Evangeliſts give us of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wiſe-Men of the <hi>East</hi> into the City of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94927:88"/>
                     <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of <hi>Herod</hi>'s ſuſpicious Concern, and the cruel cautions he uſed to ſecure his own Crown, by commanding all the Young Children that were in the City of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and in all the Coaſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be ſlain, from two years old and under, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time he had diligently enquired of the Wiſe-men, I ſay this Hiſtory is much of the ſame ſtamp with that we juſt now conſider'd.</p>
                  <p>Had the Evangeliſts only told us in general, that the <hi>Wiſe-men</hi> ſaw a Star in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which they took to be the Star that ſignified the Birth of the <hi>King of the Jews,</hi> that would have been ſomewhat more ſuſpicious. Had they told us only that thoſe <hi>Wiſe-men</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that would not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively have concluded much. But when they tell us that they came publickly to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not any way concealing themſelves, or the cauſe of their coming, and that the whole City was alarmed and concerned at it; Does it ſeem natural that a man ſhould fancy he could perſwade ſo great a City as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, that it had been diſturbed and ſurpriſed at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of Certain Wiſe-men, who were come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> That a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had propoſed to himſelf to relate certain Fables whom it concerned that they ſhould paſs for true and certain matters of fact, ſhould yet pick out ſuch circumſtances as thoſe were, to vent abroad to a Nation that knew ſo very well the falſhood of them? For if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who it was that related theſe things. 'Twas <hi>Matthew</hi> who was born a <hi>Jew.</hi> And who did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them to? Why to ſeveral thouſand <hi>Jews</hi> that had embraced <hi>Christianity,</hi> and who dwelling at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> knew full as well what had happened therein both in their days and in thoſe of their Fathers, as they know at <hi>Paris</hi> what was done in that City in the days of <hi>Cardinal Richelieu,</hi> or as they know at <hi>London</hi> every thing that happened in thoſe of <hi>Oliver</hi>

                     <hi>Cromwell;</hi> and at <hi>Stockolm</hi> in thoſe of <hi>Guſtavus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus:</hi> And now I pray conſider whether it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable any man could have made the like matters of fact believ'd in any of thoſe great Cities by ſuch a ſucceſsful forgery; or whether he could have gained over to his ſide ſeveral thouſands of people by the meer ſtrength of his Fictions.</p>
                  <p>But if I grant that the Evangeliſt had boldneſs enough expreſly to denote the coming of the <hi>Wiſe-men,</hi> and the impreſſion it made on all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againſt their publick knowledge, nay againſt the memory of thoſe things they had then freſh in their minds; at leaſt it can't be denied but that the conſequences of that coming, and the Dependencies of that firſt event are of ſuch a Nature and Character, as not poſſibly to have been forged or invented by the moſt bold faced and impudent Writer that ever was.</p>
                  <p>There are here two or three Circumſtances ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and inſeparably united one with the other, that it is impoſſible to grant one without granting the other too. No man can doubt of the coming of the Wiſe-men to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if he allows that this coming forced <hi>Herod</hi> to aſſemble the Grand Council of the <hi>Jews</hi> to know of them where the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be born: neither can he doubt of the anſwer that was made him by the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> if he owns that <hi>Herod</hi> ſent his men into <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to ſlay the young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that were there from two years old and under. So that if it can be made out that this laſt matter of fact was true, the other two will not need much proof.</p>
                  <p>Now I affirm that the Evangeliſt durſt not aſſert this laſt matter of fact, had it been utterly falſe. For what! Since the reign of <hi>Herod</hi> ſurnamed <hi>the Great</hi> was ſo well known, that the leaſt of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was publickly talk'd of; how could any one
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94927:89"/>
have preſumed to impute falſly to him a Maſſacre ſo notable and extraordinary as that muſt have been? The City of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> had not as yet been deſtroyed, when the Evangeliſt wrote thoſe things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſing the things falſe, there were ſo many Witneſſes of the Falſity, as there were Inhabitants yet living in that City. That City was not ſo far diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but that thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who dwelt in the latter might have very well known the certain Truth of them. Beſides, there was a very great Commerce between thoſe two Places; and the time from the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to that in which this Goſpel was compoſed, was not ſo long as to have given occaſion to ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable a Fiction. Suppoſe a Man in theſe latter Days ſhould take upon him to make us believe that one of the preſent Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> or if you will, of thoſe who reigned forty or fifty Years ago, cauſed two or three thouſand Children to be ſlain in their Cradle, that ſo he might involve in that Maſſacre the Ruin of a Child, whoſe Deſtiny he ſuſpected would prove fatal to him: Certainly it is not very probable we ſhould credit ſuch a Fable, or that any one durſt pretend to publiſh it; nay, had ſo much as the leaſt Thoughts of it. But then 'tis much more improbable, that any one ſhould endeavour to perſwade thoſe Men to the Belief of it who lived in that Kingdom, or in thoſe very Places where ſuch a thing was ſuppoſed to have happened.</p>
                  <p>But to come a little nearer to the Death of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ.</hi> The Evangeliſts repreſent him to us as having lived thirty Years obſcurely in the World. Now had it been their Deſign to put us off with Stories, they might have perſwaded us, that <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> during his abode here, had been often wrap'd up into Heaven, or tranſported into far
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94927:89"/>
Countries, where he had done many Signs and Wonders; nay they might have told us too, that for the ſpace of thirty Years he had continually wrought very ſenſible and wonderful Miracles in the midſt of the <hi>Jews:</hi> For it was as eaſy for them to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing as all the reſt. Yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Evangeliſts include all his Miracles in the three laſt Years of his Life: And what is the Reaſon of it? Becauſe they wrote nothing but Truth. But we ſhall not here inſiſt much upon this Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>What is moſt certain is, That the Evangeliſts having delivered in their Writings, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had done a great many Signs and Wonders before a great number of Witneſſes, and having ſet down the Time and Place when and where they were done, they muſt neceſſarily have been void of all Shame, as well as Reaſon, to relate ſuch things as theſe, if they were falſe. They tell us, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with a few Loaves and ſome ſmall Fiſhes, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly fed in the Wilderneſs, at one time, five thouſand; and at another, three thouſand men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Women and Children. Now I am at a ſtand to imagine how it can be thought natural for one Man to undertake to perſwade ſeveral thouſands, that they had been wonderfully fed, and not only to relate the bare matter of fact it ſelf, but alſo bring in <hi>Chriſt</hi> reproaching the Multitude, that they followed him not purely for the ſake of his Miracles, but the Loaves he fed them with; and then the Multitude excuſing themſelves, and ſaying, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had fed their Forefathers, and that he muſt alſo feed them, if he would have them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; as alſo <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> bidding them on this Occaſion to <hi>labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, Joh.</hi> 6. 27. and to that end promiſing to give them
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94927:90"/>
his Fleſh to eat, and his Blood to drink: All which Expreſſions are indeed very extraordinary in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſuch as no Man ever made uſe of before him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But there are matters of fact related in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel more extraordinary and ſurpriſing than theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is nothing ſo remarkable, and which ſtrikes us ſo much with Aſtoniſhment, as the Deſcription the Evangeliſts give us of the Prodigies that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Death of</hi> Christ: And behold, <hi>ſay they,</hi> the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened, and many bodies of ſaints which ſlept aroſe, and came out of the graves after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and went into the holy City, and appeared unto many, <hi>Matth. 27. 51, 52, 53.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhall not here inſiſt on each particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that attended this miraculous matter of fact; neither ſhall we nicely examine the <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of thoſe Saints whoſe Bodies came out of their Graves, and appeared unto many in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It will be ſufficient for us to conſider only thoſe Prodigies which drew the eyes of the whole World, and could not but univerſally cauſe a publick Conſternation, and make a fearful Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Minds of Men. Now I affirm, it cannot naturally enter, I ſhall not ſay into the Mind of a ſincere honeſt Man, but even into that of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, to imagine he could ever be capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others believe things ſo notoriouſly known, as thoſe we now have under Conſideration muſt have been, had they been falſe.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not many Years ago ſince a certain Man was Executed at <hi>Paris</hi> for calling himſelf the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who had a few Diſciples, and ſome Followers: but his Sect was ſoon buried, together with him, in his Grave. Now let us ſuppoſe, if you will, that his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94927:90"/>
Diſciples had preach'd after his Death, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a new Goſpel, filled only with the Doctrine and Precepts of that Man, who was thought by them to be no leſs than a divine Perſon: I ask then (whatſoever Extravagance you may ſuppoſe them to have been guilty of) whether you can conceive it could have entred into their Minds to perſwade the People of <hi>Paris,</hi> that the very Day on which that Man who called himſelf the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> died, the Church of <hi>Noſtre Dame</hi> was either thrown down or demoliſhed, that its Altars and Statues were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down; that there happened an Eclipſe of the Sun, the greateſt that ever was known, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a mighty <hi>Earthquake,</hi> that even the Rocks were rent; and that all theſe Wonders wrought ſo great an Impreſſion upon the Mind of a certain Captain that guarded the Body of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Perſon, that he believed in him? Doubtleſs theſe whimſical Men could not have taken a more effectual way, not only to hinder others from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their Report, but even to undeceive all thoſe who might till then have been led away by that pernicious Sect, than to inſert in the Goſpel they were to compoſe of the Doctrine of their Maſter, ſuch Circumſtances as would have contradicted the publick Knowledge and freſh Remembrance every body had of things ſo lately done, and to advance ſuch matters of fact as would immediately have been proved to be falſe by the <hi>publick</hi> Teſtimony every body could give of them. Now all this may be very well applied to the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For ſuppoſing thoſe Diſciples were very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, we cannot reaſonably aſcribe to them any other Deſign than that of deceiving Men, by making them receive <hi>Falſhood</hi> for <hi>Truth:</hi> And it is ſufficient if they had that Deſign, and were not wholly void of Reaſon, to make us think they could not have

Thoſe very <hi>Chriſtians</hi> then of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> ſaw all thoſe things which happened at the Death of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for they were the Men that had been converted by the preaching of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other Apoſtles; and who, being prick'd to the Heart, cried out, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Acts 2. 37. They had ſeen then that the Sun was not eclipſed, that the Rocks rent not, that there happened no Earthquake, no ſurpriſing and ſupernatural Prodigy at the Death of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And if they ſaw none of theſe things, they could not but look upon the Report of the Evangeliſts as a ſcandalous Lye and notorious Falſhood, deſign'd to ſeduce them from their rational Belief, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them out of their Senſes. But it is farther obſervable, that not one only, but three <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> have written theſe things; who, as appears evidently, did not compoſe their Goſpels together, but ſeparately, and at different times, and yet all agree in their Relation of that notable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And no doubt but they all agreed alſo in the Relation of it, when they preached the Goſpel by word of Mouth.</p>
                  <p>Who then can reaſonably believe, that when the Diſciples preach'd the Goſpel in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to eſtabliſh a <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> there, their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to perſwade the <hi>Jews</hi> that they muſt not believe their own Eyes? and that what they had
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94927:91"/>
ſeen, was not that thing which they had ſeen? Who can imagine that thoſe very <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves who were preſent and aſſiſted at the Death of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhould ſuffer themſelves inſenſibly to be perſwaded that that fabulous Recital was a very true Narration, and believe that really to have happened which they certainly knew never came to paſs? Who can even ſuppoſe that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> could fancy themſelves able to make the <hi>Jews</hi> look upon a crucified Man as the Object of their Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Worſhip, by propoſing to their Belief the moſt impudent and apparent Lyes that ever were invented ſince the Beginning of the World?</p>
                  <p>But it will concern us carefully to conſider the rending of the Vail of the Temple; for that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is ſo very ſingular, that it is ſufficient of it ſelf to ſtop the Mouths of our incredulous Adverſaries, who tho' they ſhould ſo inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wilfully delude themſelves, as to ſuppoſe, that the Day whereon <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> died there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by chance, or rather, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Courſe of <hi>ſecond</hi> Cauſes, a real Eclipſe, which had indeed ſeemed ſupernatural to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Vulgar, but had nothing ſupernatural in it ſelf; yet what can they ſay to the Vail of the Temple's being rent in twain from the Top to the Bottom? Could there be any natural Cauſe why it ſhould be rent preciſely and exactly at the time when <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> ſuffered Death? or could any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Darkneſs produce ſuch an Effect?</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome will object, that the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> were ſimple and ignorant People, and that nothing could be eaſier than to delude and impoſe upon them. I grant it. But then what great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was required to know preciſely whether all thoſe ſo ſenſible and ſo notable Prodigies had real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell out upon the Day of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:94927:92"/>
We have already ſhewn, that among the ſeveral Circumſtances of the Life and Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there were ſeveral which the Diſciples durſt not have invented or forged, had they not been really true.</p>
                  <p>We muſt add in the ſecond place, that there were a great number of other Circumſtances which the Diſciples could not have forged had they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd it. To ſay nothing of the great number of Lame People whom our Saviour cauſed to walk, of the Sick of the Palſy to whom he reſtored the Uſe of their Limbs, of the Deaf whom he cauſed to hear, and of many others diverſly affected with various Diſeaſes, whom he wonderfully healed to the great Amazement of whole Multitudes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, and cried out, ſaying, <hi>It was never ſo ſeen in Iſrael,</hi> Matth. 9. 33. I ſay, to paſs by all theſe Miracles, I ſhall inſiſt only upon the Dead he reſtored to Life.</p>
                  <p>To raiſe a Dead Man to Life again, is certainly the moſt ſurpriſing, and which in all Countries and all Ages has been always look'd upon as the moſt impoſſible thing the Mind of Man is capable of imagining. We read only an Example or two of it in the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and Men then had hardly any Notion of it. Beſides, to raiſe a Dead Man to Life is no doubtful Miracle, which may any way be reduced to <hi>natural</hi> Cauſes, but it muſt neceſſarily be granted, that nothing but a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> Power can effect it.</p>
                  <p>Yet it was by raiſing the Dead to Life again that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was willing to teſtify of himſelf. And the Evangeliſts could not have impoſed upon Men in that reſpect: 'Tis true, they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have deluded thoſe Men that lived in a Climate and a Time very diſtant from theirs; but they could not have deceived the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe things
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94927:92"/>
that had happened in their Days, and of which they were Eye-Witneſſes. This will appear more evidently, if we conſider that the Evangeliſts (as was ſaid before) did not write their Goſpels toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor aſſiſted one another in the Compoſure of them, and yet they agree in the Relation of almoſt the very ſame matters of fact, and the very ſame Miracles, not at all differing in the ſetting down the Times, Places, Perſons, Witneſſes, and all the Circumſtances of thoſe matters of fact which they teſtify and affirm. At <hi>Naim</hi> they tell us <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> raiſed a Man to Life again that was carrying away to be buried. He commanded the Bier to ſtop, and the Dead roſe up at that very inſtant. The Man that was raiſed was the Son of a Widow. The Daughter of one <hi>Jairus</hi> being dead, he went up into her Chamber, and with a Word reſtored her to Life again, notwithſtanding the Players up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Muſical Inſtruments, the Mourners, Attendants, and other ſorts of People, whoſe Buſineſs it was, according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Days, to look after the Obſequies of the Dead, had at firſt laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſcorn. Laſtly, He raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead in <hi>Bethany,</hi> before ſeveral <hi>Jews,</hi> and in the Preſence of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary, Lazarus</hi>'s Siſters. He raiſed him to Life again four Days after he had been dead, and when he began already to ſtink. Such are the Things which the <hi>Jews</hi> learn in a Book that was compoſed in their Days, and which gives them the Hiſtory of a Man whom they ſaw giving up the Ghoſt after he had been nailed on a Croſs, and of his Miracles alſo that he wrought in the midſt of them.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe matters of fact are, in my Opinion, ſo circumſtantially told, that one muſt preſently diſcover the Cheat, if there be any: for the Names both of the Places and the Perſons themſelves, are
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94927:93"/>
very exactly related. Every body knew too well, whereabouts lay the City of <hi>Naim:</hi> And the raiſing of a dead Man to Life, was too conſiderable an Event for any one to need any long Enquiry to be ſatisfied about it. <hi>Jairus</hi> was a Man very well known, and lived in a very good Repute: he had many Friends and Relations, ſo that nothing could be eaſier than to enquire whether his Daughter had really been raiſed from the Dead. <hi>Bethany</hi> was not above fifteen Furlongs diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> himſelf was an Inhabitant of <hi>Bethany.</hi> He was then living, or at leaſt his Siſters were; or if neither of them all were alive, yet there were ſtill a ſufficient number of <hi>Jews</hi> ſurviving, who had both ſeen and converſed with him after his <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had all theſe miraculous Reſurrections we have ſet down been falſe, 'tis certain the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors and Elders who took all the Care imaginable either to ſuborn falſe Witneſſes againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or corrupt one of his Diſciples, either to make him paſs for <hi>a Glutton and a Wine Bibber, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners,</hi> or for a <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> who caſt out Devils only by <hi>Beelzebub the Prince of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;</hi> I ſay, it is certain that theſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors could never have failed of preſently convincing thoſe Goſpels of Impoſture and Deceit, as ſoon as they ſhould have been publiſhed. For to do this, 'twas only requiſite they ſhould go out of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and viſit thoſe Places where thoſe pretended Miracles were ſuppoſed to have been effected; not but that there were too, in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Men of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> of <hi>Gadara,</hi> of <hi>Naim,</hi> of <hi>Bethany,</hi> of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and of other Places where Miracles were wrought, of whom they might have enquir'd the Certainty of them. But tho' the Hatred of the Enemies of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſhould not have been of it
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94927:93"/>
ſelf ſufficient to diſcover the Cheat, yet at leaſt thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Proſelytes</hi> who dwelt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and were Members of that flouriſhing Church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed there, muſt have had the Curioſity either to ſee thoſe very Men whom <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had raiſed to Life again, or at leaſt to ſee thoſe who had been Eye-Witneſſes to the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> or to ſpeak to their Relations and Friends, or to viſit thoſe Places where thoſe Matters were ſaid to have been brought to paſs. Accordingly the Goſpel tells us of a very great number of <hi>Jews</hi> who went to <hi>Bethany,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſee <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who had been raiſed from the Dead: Of which <hi>We</hi> have the leſs Reaſon to doubt, who ſince thoſe days have ſeen almoſt an infinite number of People undertake a Voyage into the Holy Land, not with a Curioſity to ſee Men that had been raiſed to Life again, or to hear whole Cities teſtify of that Event; but purely to viſit thoſe Places where all thoſe matters came to paſs, and to behold thoſe Mountains and Rocks which are thought to have been honoured with the Preſence of the Son of God. But Men went daily from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Bethany;</hi> ſo that every thing that was done in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany,</hi> was very well known at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Although therefore neither the <hi>Jews,</hi> the profeſt Enemies of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> zealous for the Honour of their Maſter, ſhould have taken no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of care to inſtruct themſelves in theſe things; yet ſince they were Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they muſt neceſſarily have very diſtinctly known the Miracles that <hi>Christ</hi> wrought in <hi>Bethany;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, they muſt have preſently rejected, as a manifeſt Forgery, the Hiſtory of the Reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> had it been utterly falſe.</p>
                  <p>And this Argument is ſo much the ſtronger and more convincing, ſince the Evangeliſts relate not only one or two Miracles of our Saviour's, but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94927:94"/>
their Goſpel is a continued Series of miraculous Circumſtances, or rather a Catalogue of the Sick that were healed, of the Blind reſtored to Sight, and of the Dead raiſed up to Life again. So that the very firſt Impreſſion which this Goſpel commonly makes upon Mens minds, is, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for the ſpace of three Years, or three Years and an half, as long as his <hi>Office</hi> laſted, wrought more ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Miracles than have been either ſeen or known ſince the Beginning of the World. And ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, is firmly to believe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> work'd thoſe Miracles which are ſo often and ſo circumſtantially repeated in it, and ſo inſeparable from the other Parts and Accidents of his Life. It muſt not then be affirmed, that the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> embraced Chriſtianity without enquiring in the leaſt into the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Contradiction. Neither muſt we ſay, that they believed thoſe Miracles without a due Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them. Such Things as theſe indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no very great Examination; but they could not avoid examining them had they endeavour'd it: for 'tis not wholly left to my Choice either to know or not to know the Things which are done in the Place which I inhabit: neither does it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon me to believe or not to believe certain matters of fact that are contradictory to publick Knowledge. And tho' a Man, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion or otherwiſe, ſhould endeavour to make me believe he had raiſed a dead Man to Life again in a Village a few Miles diſtant from the Place I dwell in, whom I might have both ſeen and known after his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> or if I had not ſeen him my ſelf, many others had both ſeen and known, and many went to ſee: I ſay, all this is no more left to my Choice to know or not to know, than it is left to my Choice to be Mad or in my Senſes.</p>
                  <p>

For the better apprehending the Strength of this Argument, I ſhall make this Suppoſition. What if we, being fully perſwaded that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did all thoſe Miracles the Goſpel relates, had gone up to the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the time of the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and reach'd thither juſt at the Evening of that Day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> on which St. <hi>Peter</hi> Converted ſo many People, by convincing them that he had received the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> I dare maintain firſt, that we could not have forborn examining ſuch Things which made ſo great a Noiſe; then ſecondly I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that however willing we might have been to delude and impoſe upon our ſelves, we could not have been ſo much as twenty four Hours at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> without knowing very diſtinctly the certain Truth of all thoſe matters of fact. It would have been no very great Trouble for us to have enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how <hi>Lazarus</hi> did, and his two Siſters <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha;</hi> and tho' by chance they might have been all three dead, to have deſired to ſpeak with their Friends and Relations, or with thoſe that had ſeen <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and eaten with him both before and after his Reſurrection. In like manner we might have eaſily ſpoken with the Friends and Relations of <hi>Jairus,</hi> and with thoſe too of other People whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> had healed, or raiſed from the Dead in the different Parts of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Galilee:</hi> and that was ſo much the more eaſy becauſe Commerce was much more ſtirring between the Metropolis of <hi>Judea</hi> and the other Cities of the Holy Land, than between the Metropolis and the other Cities of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; the <hi>Jews</hi> being wont to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at leaſt on every ſolemn Feaſt-day. Nay farther, we might have enquired about the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falſhood</hi> of thoſe wonderful Prodigies which, as the Goſpel tells us, attended the Death of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And ſince it was impoſſible that ſeveral thouſand Witneſſes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94927:95"/>
ſhould have been impoſed upon concerning ſo great a number of evident and ſenſible matters of fact, ſo in like manner it would have been abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould have become <hi>Chriſtians</hi> only for twenty four hours, after we had left <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thoſe matters of fact had been utterly falſe.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſhewn that the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were attended with ſuch wonderful Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as the Evangeliſts durſt not have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to invent had they been utterly falſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the Power to forge, or make one ſingle Perſon believe them, had they deſign'd to impoſe upon Mens Belief. There remains only for our full Conviction in this matter, to ſhew that they would not have forged them, had it been wholly left to their Choice.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here alledge that the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> according to the Recital of the Evangeliſts, were attended with ſuch Circumſtances, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrange Events, that it is inconceivable the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould take any Pleaſure in inventing them: ſuch is, for Example, the tempting of our Saviour; a ſtrange and moſt ſcandalous Paſſage indeed to all thoſe who are not fully acquainted with the true Myſtery of it, ſince it repreſents <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the hands of the Devil, who ſported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Weakneſs tho' he was not able to overcome his Virtue; one while placing him upon the <hi>Pinacle</hi> of the Temple, whence he adviſed him to caſt himſelf down, another while upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high Mountain, from whence he ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them. Now to ſee a Man in the hands of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> would be a Sight that would ſhock us, to ſee a juſt Man, would be an Object more terrible; but to ſee a <hi>Prophet</hi> himſelf, would be a Wonder that would create Horror in us. What muſt it be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94927:95"/>
then to ſee a Divine Perſon in his Clutches, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one that is both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> one that was called by way of Eminence, <hi>the Just, the Holy, the Man without Sin or Blemiſh, the greateſt of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine, <hi>the Son of God himſelf?</hi> He muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be much miſtaken, that can imagine that ſuch Thoughts as theſe could have naturally offered themſelves to any Man's Mind, much leſs to the Mind of Ignorant People, who judge of Things by the Prejudices they are generally poſſeſt with. 'Tis true indeed, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is repreſented to us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel as ſurrounded with Angels who miniſtred unto him after his Temptation; but yet that Circumſtance is ſo far from removing that which may ſeem offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſurpriſing in that Event, that it rather makes it the more ſtrange and incomprehenſible; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ill befitting a Man who was but juſt now in the Power of the Devil, and carried about by him wherever he pleaſed, as to be immediately after waited upon by Angels. Add to this, the uniting of ſo many mean Circumſtances with ſo many glorious ones that occur in his <hi>Nativity,</hi> in his <hi>Life,</hi> and in his <hi>Death,</hi> to inſtance in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> lying in a Manger, whilſt he was praiſed by the <hi>Hoſts of Heaven;</hi> his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not a <hi>Hole wherein</hi> to lay his Head, whilſt at the ſame time he commanded the Fiſhes of the Sea to bring him Mony to pay Tribute to thoſe who asked it of him; his ſhewing a great deal of <hi>Fear,</hi> nay even apparent <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> whilſt he ſhook the whole Frame of the World, and made the Earth tremble, and the Sky to become dark; his begging of his Father that the Cup of his Sufferings might paſs away from him, when at the ſame time he ſo well had prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for Death, as to have inſtituted a Sacrament for a Commemoration of it, unto the End of the World, his complaining that his heavenly Father had forſook him, whilſt he promiſed <hi>Heaven</hi> to a <hi>Thief</hi> that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94927:96"/>
him upon the Croſs. An hundred other myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Contrarieties there are, which Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence inſpired the Evangeliſts to write againſt their profeſt Opinions, againſt the Biaſs of their Paſſions, and their natural Ideas, that their Goſpel might have a more extraordinary and more divine Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are not the Circumſtances I mean, when I ſpeak of ſuch extraordinary ones in the Life of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Diſciples would not have forg'd if they could. By them I mean all the ſenſible and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miracles which <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf wrought, and his Diſciples have related to us; and theſe, I ſay, the Diſciples would not invent, had they been falſe; which I prove by theſe two invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that by their relating them, and above all, their mentioning both Places and Perſons as it appears they have done, they manifeſtly ingaged themſelves both to maintain and evince the Truth of them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they doubted not but that they ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to give an account of them, They who ſo very well kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w how difficult it had been for them to eſcape free when their Maſter himſelf was put to Death. They knew they ſhould be compelled to maintain what they had thus affirmed, and they knew alſo they could never be able to defend their Impoſture, if they ſhould by chance be confronted with the Witneſſes they mention'd. And all this is no very hard thing for any one to foreſee; a Man, tho' not over-wiſe, may eaſily preſage theſe Things, and it is ſufficient that he be in his Senſes to make him cautious of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſuch Matters as he thinks himſelf incapable to maintain, the Falſhood of which would be preſently diſcovered by the very Witneſſes he mentions, by the Places he ſets down, and the other Circumſtances of the matter of fact he thus expoſes to publick View.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:94927:96"/>
2. The Second Argument which proves that the Evangeliſts would never have forg'd the like matters of fact, ſuppoſing they had been altogether falſe, is, that by counterfeiting them, they neceſſarily render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves liable to be put to a great Confuſion, when they ſhould find themſelves obliged to perform the very ſame Miracles. For, beſides that it was very natural for any one to ſay to them thus; <hi>If it be true that your Maſter has wrought ſo many ſtrange Miracles, ſurely he has alſo given you Power to do the like your ſelves;</hi> it being well known that the firſt thing they taught was, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had ſent them abroad with Power to perform the very ſame Works he had done. 'Twas no time therefore to uſe Shifts, or ſtand doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhuffling, they were obliged either to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what they knew concerning the Miracles of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> or to perform the ſame themſelves. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, when he ſent them to preach in the different Parts of <hi>Judea,</hi> commanded them ſaying, <hi>Heal the Sick, cleanſe the Lepers, raiſe the Dead, caſt out Devils, freely you have received, freely give,</hi> Matth. 10. 8. And theſe are the Characters he gave of the calling of his Diſciples. <hi>And theſe Signs ſhall follow them that believe; in my Name ſhall they caſt out Devils, they ſhall ſpeak with new Tongues, they ſhall take up Serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurt them, they ſhall lay hands on the Sick, and they ſhall recover, &amp;c. And they went forth and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and comfirming the word with Signs,</hi> &amp;c. Mark 16. 17, 18, 20.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears they could not well relate what <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> had done, without at the ſame time publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they themſelves were obliged to perform for the further Confirmation of the Goſpel: ſo that they did not relate the leaſt Miracle, without at the ſame time affirming they were able to do the like. It muſt therefore certainly be one of theſe two things, either
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94927:97"/>
that thoſe Men had utterly loſt their Reaſon, or that they ſincerely believed the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had they thought them to be falſe, they would neither have engaged themſelves to maintain an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Fiction, by ſetting down ſo many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more than ſufficient to diſcover the real Truth of it; nor have rendred themſelves liable to Shame and Confuſion, by relating ſuch <hi>Miracles</hi> they were not able ſo much as to imitate, at that very time when they profeſſed themſelves abſolutely capable of doing every thing their Maſter himſelf had done.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears to us, that the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> are ſuch matters of fact which the Diſciples had neither the Boldneſs, the Power, nor the Will to counterfeit, ſuppoſing they never had been done. And I think this enough to convince us in this reſpect, and to make us look upon thoſe Miracles which have illuſtrated the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as a Center of Truth that will infallibly perſwade us of the Truth and the Divinity of the <hi>Chriſtanity</hi> we profeſs.</p>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a few Weeks after the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and at a time when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be eaſier than to enquire into the Truth of his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Evangeliſts unanimouſly tell us that he had ſeveral times foretold his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to his Diſciples: Nay 'tis obſervable, that thoſe very Predictions are oftentimes intermixed either with ſuch Circumſtances as do not eaſily of themſelves enter into any Man's Mind, or with thoſe which ſeem to have no manner of Relation one with another; which proves that they cannot be the imaginary Conceits of a pleaſant Fancy, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the Invention of Fables. It is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Evangeliſts ſhould have invented the Diſcourſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with St. <hi>Peter</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sufferings that ſhould certainly beſall him at his going up to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And it is worth taking notice of, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had but juſt made a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Confeſſion of what <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was, in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the other Diſciples, telling him, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt the Son of the living God;</hi> and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had crowned this admirable Confeſſion with that extraordinary Promiſe of his, <hi>Bleſſed art thou,</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:94927:98"/>
                     <hi>Simon Barjona. For fleſh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I ſay alſo unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 16. 17, 18. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after <hi>Chriſt</hi> foretold what Death he was to ſuffer from the <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Scribes;</hi> but added withal, he ſhould riſe again the third Day. Whereupon St. <hi>Peter</hi> rebuked him, and ſaid, <hi>Be it far from thee, O Lord: this ſhall not be unto thee.</hi> But <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> inſtead of approving of that ſeeming Concern and Affection his Diſciple had for him, ſeverely reproved his Indiſcretion in theſe words, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me for thou ſavoureſt not,</hi> &amp;c. This Hiſtory ſeems to be very natural and ſincere, and that mixture of Circumſtances which in all probability have no manner of relation with one another, could not of it ſelf eaſily enter in any Man's Mind. St. <hi>Peters</hi> Confeſſion was excellent, and the Promiſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> made him was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: Nay the very Expreſſion of it implied ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange and difficult. But above all, it ſeems at firſt view that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> too rigorouſly cenſures the great Zeal which <hi>Peter</hi> ſhewed for his Perſon, and it does not ſeem very natural that he who told him, <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon Barjona,</hi> and promiſed to make him a Pillar of his Church, ſhould tell him preſently after, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi> 'Tis plain, a Man muſt, in ſpite of himſelf, perceive that 'tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he force of Truth, and not the natural Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Circumſtances that obliged the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt to joyn them both together in one and the ſame Recital. And that which neceſſarily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions this Reflexion of ours is, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had really foretold his <hi>Death</hi> and his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> before ever he had ſuffered the one, or the other was brought to paſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:94927:98"/>
But what proves this better than any thing elſe, is, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> upon cooler Thoughts, and the very Day before his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> did ſuch a thing as had never been done before, and which doubtleſs never will be done again; and that is, he inſtituted a Memorial of that Death he was juſt upon the point of ſuffering: He foretold that he ſhould ſuffer Death from the <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Law: Nevertheleſs he might have eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it if he would by retiring into another place. But he chid, or rather ſtorm'd at the Indiſcretion of <hi>Peter,</hi> who would have diverted him from that Death; therefore he conſidered it as an Event that was to be attended with very happy and ſaving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences with reſpect to Mankind. And what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Conſequences could his <hi>Death</hi> have been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withal, unleſs it was to have been immediately followed by his <hi>Reſurrection?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He firſt inſtituted a Memorial of his Death, and then voluntarily ſuffered it: He commanded that it ſhould be commemorated, therefore he regarded it as an Event which was to be the Means of our Salvation. He foreſaw that it would be commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; he foreſaw then what would moſt infallibly come to paſs, and that too in a time when there was but little Appearance of its ever happening. He did not ſay, that they ſhould commemorate his Death only till he roſe again, but till his Second Coming. He foreſaw then, that he ſhould ſpeedily riſe again, and that after his Reſurrection he ſhould depart in order to return again at the End of the World.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, no reaſonable Man can imagine that the Evangeliſts had wholly invented the Account of the Inſtitution of the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> For there is a great deal of Difference between a <hi>Doctrine</hi> and a <hi>Practice.</hi> A Doctrine can hardly be forged, eſpecially becauſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94927:99"/>
it muſt be concerted by the Conſent of ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: But a ſenſible Practice, a thing in Uſe, and as it were a ſpeaking Doctrine, can much leſs be palm'd upon Mankind. And certainly 'twould be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt piece of Folly imaginable in any one, to think that a dozen poor Fiſhermen, aſtoniſhed and caſt down at the Death of their Maſter, and undeceived in the Opinion they had entertained that he was to have reſtored the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Perſons who knew not what things might come to paſs by their publiſhing the Doctrine of that crucified Man, that that they ſhould go and invent the Inſtitution of the Euchariſt with all the Circumſtances of it, and make <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> utter theſe Words, <hi>This is my body which is broken for you: this is the New Teſtament in my blood:</hi> Words that implied ſomething new and very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, which have given occaſion to ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, and are liable to ſuch different Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Words which S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Evangeliſts una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly ſet down, but without any mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, as appears by the little Variety there occurs in their Recital of them. I ſay, it would be very extravagant to imagine that the Diſciples had in the leaſt thought of inventing theſe Words, or that Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of the Euchariſt; ſo that we need not inſiſt longer on any farther Proofs of it. We have already touched upon it in another Place, and upon another Subject. The only Conſequence we ſhall draw from it here is, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw his Death, prepared himſelf for it, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it voluntarily. Whereupon I argue thus:</p>
                  <p>If he foreſaw that he ſhould die, and if he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offered himſelf up to Death, he then either foreſaw that he ſhould riſe again, or he did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee it. If he did not foreſee it, with what kind of hopes then did he comfort his Diſciples? What was it he promiſed them? Or what propoſed he to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94927:99"/>
himſelf by his Death? Why did he not ſhun it, as he might yet have done when he was at Supper with his Diſciples? What meant he by inſtituting a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of his Dead Body, if that Dead Body were always to abide under the power of Death, and rot away as it were in the Preſence of his Diſciples?</p>
                  <p>And if he thought he ſhould riſe again, as we may very reaſonably imagin he did, I ſay he himſelf could not have believed it, but only upon the Experience he had already made of that Power which had reſtored Sight to the Blind, Health to the Sick, and Life to the Dead. For he could not think his own Miracles falſe, and yet at the ſame time believe he ſhould riſe again from the Dead. If he thought he ſhould riſe again, he alſo thought his Miracles to be true. And if he believed his Miracles to be true, his Miracles muſt of neceſſity have been really ſo; becauſe they were of a Nature incapable of Illuſion and Deceit, at leaſt with reſpect to thoſe who wrought them. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> could never imagine that he had filled five thouſand Men at one time, three thouſand at another; that he had raiſed to Life the Widows Son of <hi>Naim;</hi> the daughter of <hi>Jairus,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> of <hi>Bethany;</hi> that he had made St. <hi>Peter</hi> walk upon the Sea, &amp;c. if all theſe things had not really been true.</p>
                  <p>No one ſurely can doubt but that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> if he conſiders that it was upon this Account only that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors appointed a Watch to guard his Sepulcher, and commanded the Stone of it to be ſealed. <hi>Sir, we remember,</hi> ſaid they to Pilate, <hi>that that Deceiver ſaid, while he was yet alive, after three days, I will riſe again. Command therefore that the ſepulchre be made ſure until the third day, leſt his Diſciples come by night, and ſteal him away, and ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, he is riſen from the Dead. ſo the laſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhall be worſe than the firſt. Pilate ſaid unto them, ye</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:94927:100"/>
                     <hi>have a watch, go your way, make it as ſure as you can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So they went and made the Sepulchre ſure, ſealing the ſtone, and ſetting a watch,</hi> Mat. 27. 63, 64, 65, 66. This is ſuch a matter of fact which the Diſciples could not, durſt not invent againſt the publick knowledge every body had of it, and which beſides agrees very well with the other Circumſtances of that Event. For how came that Report to be ſpread in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the Watch ſlept when the Diſciples took away the Body of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> had they not really ſet a Watch to guard his Sepulchre? And what neceſſity was there to appoint a Watch to guard it, had it not been to hinder the Diſciples from reporting abroad, that he was riſen from the Dead?</p>
                  <p>And if <hi>Chriſt</hi> really believed that he ſhould riſe again, he could not have believed it, but upon the Truth of his Miracles, neither could he have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Miracles to be true, had they been falſe. Thus it appears that the Connexion of all thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, if narrowly conſidered, forms as it were a kind of a moral Demonſtration, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but throughly convince any juſt and reaſonable Man.</p>
                  <p>But let us not ſlightly paſs over that matter of fact, but having ſeen what <hi>Chriſt</hi> thought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> let us next conſider the Opinion of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> concerning it, and the Report the Soldiers made that were appointed to guard this Sepulcher. For the Conſideration of thoſe Circumſtances may give us ſome light in the Diſcovery of that matter of fact, the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and the moſt eſſential that ever was, or ever ſhall be hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and generally every Member of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated by the very ſame Spirit that had induced them to put <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to Death, were in a great
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94927:100"/>
Apprehenſion leſt his Diſciples ſhould take away his Body, and afterwards report abroad that he was riſen from the Dead. We may judge how much they thought it for their Intereſt to prevent it, by the Attempts they had already made to put him to Death. And it is very probable, that ſince the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was to have been guarded but three days, they took all care imaginable before hand, for fear the Watch, thro negligence or otherwiſe, ſhould have ſuffered that Body to be taken away, which it ſo mightily behoved them to keep in their Cuſtody.</p>
                  <p>But let us conſider the Event of all this. The Soldiers that watch'd the Body could not hinder it from riſing out of it's Sepulcher. How ſo? Was it becauſe they were afraid? or were they bribed not to diſcover the Buſineſs? Had they been bribed, one might very well imagine it was not in behalf of the Diſciples, that they would run the hazard of loſing their Lives for their Negligence or Treachery. What then were they afraid? But how could the Watch prove ſo fearful, and the Diſciples on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſo couragious, as to attempt the taking away the dead Body of one from whom they had ſo lately fled while he was yet alive? Beſides, How could thoſe Soldiers have reported ſuch things as they did without manifeſtly contradicting themſelves? For if they were aſleep, how did they know that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had taken away his Body? But why did not the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> for their own Honour, and the Reſpect they bare to the Truth, put all thoſe Soldiers to the Rack? And if that Thought came not preſently into their Heads, is it not natural to think they would have done it, when they found awhile after, all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> inclinable to believe in that crucified man, and that about ſix thouſand Souls had already believed in him in one day, and that too
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94927:101"/>
but fifty days after his Death? Certainly the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that watch'd his Body were ſtill at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> And the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> had ſtill the ſame Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as before. It highly concerned them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Negligence of thoſe Soldiers, or make them confeſs the Secret of their Perfidy, and who it was that ſuborned them. I ſay, it highly concerned them to make that ſtrict Examination, both to juſtify their own Procedure, and prevent the utter Loſs of almoſt an infinite number of Perſons that had already ſided with the Diſciples of that pretended Impoſtor. But this is not all. When on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> that is, fifty days after the Death of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> the Apoſtles ſhewed themſelves in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to teſtify there that they had ſeen him riſen from the Dead, and that after he had ſeveral times appeared to them, and was gone up into Heaven, he had pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down upon them the miraculous and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, why did not the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> then, who was ſo highly concerned in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Authors of the taking away the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I ſay, why did they not ſeize upon the Apoſtles, and ſo make them confeſs how all things had happened? Why did they not confront them with the Watch? Why did they not caſt <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and thoſe Men in Priſon, till they had made them confeſs what was become of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as alſo every other Circumſtance of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture?</p>
                  <p>'Tis already very unlikely, that if the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had come by night, and had ſtolen his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy away, they durſt have ſhewed themſelves and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in publick, nay immediately confeſſed that they were his Diſciples. It is much more credible they would have hid themſelves after ſuch an Action; and that if they preach'd at all, it would have been to People more remote, and not in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94927:101"/>
very Place where thoſe things had happened, nor in the Preſence of that very <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> they were ſo much afraid of, and had ſo much offended.</p>
                  <p>Why then did not the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> take the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Methods made uſe of to diſcover Criminals? They were very ready by Threats, Torments, and Perſecutions, to oblige the Apoſtles not to preach up the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but they never accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them of having ſtolen away the Body of their Maſter whilſt the <hi>Watch</hi> ſlept. They durſt not enter upon that Examination; for they knew well enough what the Soldiers had told them, and 'twas that very thing which made them ſo apprehenſive.</p>
                  <p>We all know well enough how Men generally act upon the like Occaſions. Had the matter ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened as the Soldiers afterwards reported, thoſe very Soldiers would not have failed purſuing ſome one of the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> throughout the whole City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> on purpoſe to make him confeſs the plain truth by the many Torments they would have made him ſuffer; and the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> together with the other <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Law, would on their ſide have made ſuch an exact Enquiry into the matter, that they would have at laſt found either ſome Witneſſes, or ſome other Evidence, to prove the ſtealing away of that Body upon them. And that would have been no very hard task for them to perform; becauſe it had been done during the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of one of their Solemn Feaſt-days, when the People of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were never ſo intent upon any Spectacle, as they had been upon the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> when what had ſo lately happened to ſuch an extraordinary Man, had filled every body with Amazement: witneſs that which the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> makes a Diſciple utter on the way to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> as he was diſcourſing with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf not Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was him, <hi>Art thou only a ſtranger in Jeruſalem,</hi>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:94927:102"/>
                     <hi>and haſt not known the things which are eome to paſs there in theſe days?</hi> And ſince thoſe men who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Watch to guard the <hi>Sepulcher</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> had in all probability very expreſly charged them to take care leſt any of his Diſciples ſhould come by night and ſteal his Body out of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, it is repugnant to Reaſon, and contrary to all outward Appearance, to ſuppoſe that the ſecond night after the Soldiers were placed there, they ſhould fall into ſo deep a ſleep, as that the Diſciples ſhould be bold enough to hazard the taking away of this Body, or be able to roll the Stone away from the Sepulchre, and break the Seal; that they ſhould have <hi>Time</hi> enough, <hi>Leiſure, Freedom,</hi> and ſo little <hi>Fear</hi> as to untye and take away the linnen Cloaths wherein he was wrapped up, and the Napkin that was about his Face: For the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> unanimouſly relate that they found the Sepulchre in that ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Yet theſe are not the ſtrongeſt Arguments that may be brought to evince the Truth of that matter of fact. We muſt alſo paſs on from the Conſideration of the Soldiers that watched the Body, to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves. Had they teſtify'd falſly that they had ſeen <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> riſen from the Dead, it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a mutual Agreement, or without one. Now it cannot be without a mutual Agreement; for an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> that is not ſupported by an unanimous Conſent, muſt neceſſarily fall of it ſelf to the ground, and it would have unavoidably ſo happen'd, while one would have affirm'd that <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> was riſen from the Dead, another that he was not at all riſen; one would have ſaid that he appeared unto many, and another that he appeared to one only; another, that he appeared to no Body; one would have related the matter one way, another another way, and in fine, the moſt honeſt and ſincere would have frankly confeſs'd that there was nothing at all in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:94927:102"/>
But if they unanimouſly agreed to contrive this Impoſture, there muſt have been then ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who agreed together conſtantly and unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to relate a matter of fact, which they knew to be utterly falſe. Now that's a thing altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe it is inconceivable, that a man ſhould willingly expoſe himſelf to all ſorts of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and even to Death itſelf, on purpoſe to teſtify a matter of fact which he knew very well to be utterly falſe. 2. That tho' there ſhould have been, by an unheard of Prodigy, one ſingle Perſon of that mind, yet it is the height of <hi>Extravagance,</hi> to imagine that there were a very great number of Perſons that took on a ſudden that dangerous and fatal Reſolution, eſpecially ſuch as had behaved themſelves before after a manner quite oppoſite to that, and ſhewed not only a great deal of Caution, but Fearfulneſs in ſeveral other Occaſions. 3. That tho a very great number of People ſhould have agreed together to bear Witneſs to a <hi>Falſity,</hi> yet it could never be thought ſo of thoſe who looked upon <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Perfidy</hi> as Sins that were altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their Salvation; neither could it be thought of thoſe, who if they allow'd the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be a meer Fiction, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low alſo that they had followed a <hi>Phantom,</hi> a <hi>Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> imaginary <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and if they own'd that they had follow'd a Phantom, they muſt likewiſe confeſs their own mutual Extravagance. 4. That this mutual Agreement could never have been ſo carried on, but that ſome of them, to avoid Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would have diſcovered the Intrigue to the <hi>Jews</hi> with all its Circumſtances, it being moſt certain, that ſince <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had been ſo very baſely betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Life-time, it is more probable he would be ſo ſerved after his Death: For they might indeed
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94927:103"/>
have expected ſome Reward from him when living, but they could hope for nothing from him after his Death, but <hi>Miſery</hi> and <hi>Torments, Shame</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>Remorſes,</hi> for having followed a deceitful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor. 5. And laſtly, 'Tis not to be queſtion'd, but that the very ſame Principles which had diſſolv'd their mutual <hi>Fidelity,</hi> would more probably break off their mutual <hi>Treachery.</hi> And ſince the Love and Affection they had had for their Maſter, ſupported by a ſtrong Perſwaſion on their ſide that he was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> had not been capable to maintain and keep up that mutual Fidelity, which made them ſay not very long before, <hi>Let us go there alſo, that we may die with him,</hi> John 11. 16. ſo that they fled, and wholly left him to the Power of his Enemies, can we reaſonably ſuppoſe that having been unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Opinion they had entertained of their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they ſhould yet notwithſtanding their Shame, Fear, and dejected Condition, preſently after unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agree to maintain and affirm a moſt horrid Lye, on purpoſe to blemiſh their Nation, by laying an imaginary Crime to their charge, and maintain it too to that degree that not one of them ſhould <hi>recant,</hi> or contradict himſelf, but all of them unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſuffer the ſevereſt Torments, only to affirm that they had ſeen what they had really never ſeen?</p>
                  <p>'Tis yet further obſervable, that this was not a mutual Agreement carried on between twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles only, but alſo between all the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in general, who made up a very conſiderable number. For <hi>Jeſus,</hi> after his Reſurrection, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one while to ſome Women, whom he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tell his Brethren that he was a going before them into <hi>Galilee,</hi> another while to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, and then after to the Twelve. One while he went out to find them as they were a fiſhing upon the Sea, and bleſs their Toil with a conſiderable Draught of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94927:103"/>
Fiſhes; Another while he was in the midſt of them, when they had met together to pray to God. Some time he ſat at Table, and eat and drank with them; At another time he gave them ſeveral Inſtructions, and reminded them of thoſe things he had taught them before his Death. At one time he manifeſted himſelf to above 500 Diſciples, at another he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed an unbelieving Diſciple by making him feel his Hands and his Feet, ſaying, <hi>Reach hither thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, behold my hands, &amp;c. and be not faithleſs but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi> John 20. 27. One while he appeared to two Diſciples as they were a going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, and expounded the Scriptures to them by the way; At another time he aſſembled his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples together, and commanded them <hi>to teach all Nations, baptiſing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may not be amiſs to reflect a little upon that vaſt Multidude of Diſciples who teſtify'd they had ſeen <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> after his Reſurrection. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome where in his Epiſtles, affirms, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> appeared to above five hundred Brethren at once; and adds, that the greateſt part of them were yet alive, but ſome were fallen aſleep. Now 'tis moſt certain, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not, durſt not, could not ſpeak after that manner, had there not been a great number of Diſciples ſtill living, who teſtify'd that they had ſeen <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I would fain know, whether it be poſſible for ſo great a number of perſons unanimouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſuch an intolerable Impoſture as that muſt needs have been, were there nothing of Truth in what they advanc'd. Truly it ſeems to me to be a thing not poſſible for a man to imagine, much leſs to put in Execution.</p>
                  <p>A Man muſt do Violence to himſelf barely in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that ſo many Diſciples ſhould falſly affirm
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94927:104"/>
that they had ſeen <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> after his <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> For one muſt thence ſuppoſe, that that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons were not really Men; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had been during the reſt of their Lives, they had put off their <hi>Humanity</hi> immediately after the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They were indeed Men till that time; and their Behaviour pretty well evinces that their Sentiments were ſuch as ſelf-love and ſelf-preſervation general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpire us withal: for they expected and were in hopes of ſomething. They followed none other but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they expected from him what gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all the <hi>Jews</hi> expected from their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ideas they had form'd themſelves of him. They were afraid of Death: They dreaded the Fury of the <hi>Sanhedrin:</hi> They flattered themſelves with the Hopes of ſeeing themſelves reſtored to their former Glory: They begg'd of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to deliver them out of approaching Dangers, if at any time they were in hazard of their Lives, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to any Tempeſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the Death of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> they ſeem'd to have put off their Humanity; Their Minds and Hearts were not diſpoſed like thoſe of other Men. They neither hoped for, or expected any thing. For indeed what ſhould they hope or expect from the Profeſſion they made of being Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> if they knew that he was not riſen at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe? What could they hope for, if he who had promiſed them Eternal Life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed himſelf to be <hi>the Reſurrection and the Life,</hi> was to be for ever ſubject to the Power of Death? <hi>Before</hi> while they truſted in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> they were afraid: <hi>Now</hi> when they truſted no more in him, their Fear vaniſhed. Since they could not expect any thing from another Life, they were reſolved not to be any way concern'd for this, but to mind
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94927:104"/>
only a Future State. What is the meaning of this prepoſterous Change? <hi>Formerly</hi> they thought they ſhould do God great ſervice, in ſuffering for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake, whom they ſuppoſed to have been their <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias;</hi> and yet they were then <hi>faint-hearted</hi> and <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> but <hi>now</hi> that they were aſſured they did God no manner of ſervice by adhering to the Goſpel; but rather blemiſh their own Reputation by maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cheat, they became on a ſudden <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>couragious, undaunted</hi> in the greateſt Dangers, and <hi>invincible</hi> in the midſt of the moſt violent Trials. Who can comprehend all this?</p>
                  <p>Certainly, if we have but the leaſt <hi>Common Senſe</hi> we cannot but perceive that a Cheat in ſo evident and ſenſible a matter of fact as that muſt have been, could not be unanimouſly carried on by ſo many thouſands of People. For ſuppoſing one Man was dipoſed to <hi>Lye,</hi> who knows but another would be as inclinable to tell the Truth; eſpecially ſince there was nothing to be got by Lying, but <hi>Priſons, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and Death itſelf, whereas telling the <hi>Truth</hi> would have gained them <hi>Credit, Friends,</hi> and <hi>Eſtates,</hi> by pleaſing thoſe in whoſe Power it was to diſpoſe of <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of State. And had any one of them imagined that ſome of the reſt would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict him or themſelves, he would have been for that very Reaſon incapable of agreeing with them to carry on that Cheat; Now it is naturally impoſſible but that this Thought muſt have offered it ſelf to the Mind of every one of them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuch a mutual Compact or Agreement was abſolutely impoſſible, unleſs it ſo happen'd that that whole Multitude had ſuddenly been bewitch'd and infatuated by the ſame kind of Folly, and that too at one and the ſame time, as ſoon as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had given up the Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>However they muſt have been void of all <hi>Self-Love,</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:94927:105"/>
and that natural <hi>Affection</hi> Men uſually bear to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nay they muſt have been altogether <hi>inſenſible</hi> of the cruel Stripes they underwent, and the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherewith they were almoſt overwhelmed; and that Inſenſibility and Extravagance muſt not only have been an ordinary one, or of a ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, but of the longeſt Duration, and ſtrongeſt Force that ever was known.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is a third Center of Truth, which we ought to have continually before our eyes, in order to conſider the Arguments it contains for the Truth of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> was preceded by ſeveral Apparitions of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and followed by an extraordinary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifeſted to all the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo that it ſeems to want no Illuſtration.</p>
                  <p>It rather proves it ſelf, and that too by its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Characters: For it is a thing unheard of, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons ſhould agree to teſtify after that manner ſo ſignal an Impoſture as that muſt have been, had not the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> been a real Event. But let us throughly conſider all the Circumſtances of it.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> juſtified the wonderful Paſſages of his Death, ſo likewiſe does his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> juſtify thoſe of his Reſurrection: For tho' one ſhould ſuſpect that the Eyes of the Diſciples might by chance have been ſuddenly dazzled, and ſo they thought they had ſeen what they in reality
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94927:105"/>
never ſaw, yet they had time enough to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of this dazzling Amazement; for it was forty days after <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was riſen from the Dead before his <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> Had it been a Spirit that appeared to them, and frightned them, yet had they time enough to come to themſelves again, and know certainly that the Spirit they ſaw was not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Maſter. For they ſaw him and heard him: They handled him, they eat and drank with him. Had it been thro' the obſcurity of a darkſome Night that they had imagined they had ſeen ſome Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of their Maſter, inſtead of a true and full ſight of him, they could not long continue in their Error: But it was in full day that they ſaw the Stone rolled away from the Sepulcher: 'Twas in full bright day that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo often manifeſted himſelf to them, and diſcourſed with them, and afterwards aſcended into heaven before their eyes.</p>
                  <p>Had the force of their Deſires, their Fears, or Affections, diſturbed their Senſes, we ſhould have leſs Reaſon to wonder at it, tho even in that caſe the thing would ſeem altogether unaccountable, it being <hi>morally</hi> impoſſible that the Senſes of ſo many People ſhould all at once be ſo confined to one wonderful Object, and ſo diſturbed at the ſame time. But they had time enough to get out of their Confuſion and Aſtoniſhment; and their Minds were very ſedate and at eaſe when <hi>Chriſt</hi> made them Eye-Witneſſes of his glorious <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> In a word, had it been a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and ſilent Interview, we might have much more Reaſon to doubt; but <hi>Christ</hi> appeared to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with a particular Deſign to diſcourſe with them. He gave them ſeveral Inſtructions; he forbad them to depart from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> until they had received the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. He made them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Promiſes, and ſuch ſurpriſing ones, that they are fit only for a God to make, and a God
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94927:106"/>
to perform: for he promiſed that he would be with them even unto the End of the World. He inſtituted two Sacraments; he commanded them <hi>to baptiſe all Nations in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as well as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate his Death in the <hi>Paſſover.</hi> Nor was that all. He had many long and coherent Diſcourſes with them. He ſpoke to them, and they anſwered him. They were at firſt incredulous; but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them of the Truth of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Scruples and their Infidelity. He rebuked them ſeveral times for their little Faith; at leaſt they tell us ſo. The Evangeliſts relate what <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to <hi>Thomas,</hi> and what Anſwer <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> made: And both their ſpeeches were too ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing to be ſo ſoon forgotten. <hi>Thomas</hi> being ſtruck at the Wonders of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> was the firſt that gave <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Name which he was not wont to bear in the Stage of his Humiliation, calling him, <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> John 20. 28.</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples asked him, Whether he would at that time reſtore the Kingdom unto <hi>Iſrael:</hi> but he anſwer'd them, that it was not for them to know the Times and Seaſons which the Father only had in his power. Laſtly, The Evangeliſts give us no leſs the Hiſtory of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> riſen from the Dead, than that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> living and converſing before his Death among the <hi>Jews:</hi> and we affirm, we have as much reaſon to believe one as the other. For indeed, Why do we believe there was ever any ſuch Perſon as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> We believe it certainly, becauſe it is, in humane ſpeaking, morally impoſſible that ſo many Perſons ſhould unanimouſly tell us they had ſeen him, that they diſcours'd, eat and drank with him, nay ſaw him ſuffer Death at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> I ſay, they would never have told us all this, ſuppoſing, there were nothing at all in it. But then ought not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94927:106"/>
that ſame Reaſon to perſwade us likewiſe that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> both lived and convers'd forty days with his Diſciples, ſince ſo many Perſons ſaw him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, eat, and drank with him, ſaw him preſent in the midſt of their Aſſemblies, nay touched and handled him?</p>
                  <p>But (perhaps ſome will object) were that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, Why then was there in thoſe days ſo many Perſons that refuſed to believe the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Why it is no hard matter to find the reaſon of this; 'twas becauſe if they had once acknowledged the Truth of the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> they were obliged to die Martyrs for that Truth; and no doubt Men were as worldly-minded in thoſe days as they are now.</p>
                  <p>So that methinks it appears hitherto very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were neither capable of deceiving themſelves, nor of being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by others, as to the Truth of the matters of fact they teſtifyed. It is a very difficult matter (I had almoſt ſaid impoſſible) that they ſhould have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves in the Miracles of <hi>Christ</hi> which they relate, becauſe they ſo exactly ſet down the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> the <hi>Names, Places,</hi> and the <hi>Perſons</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nay, they pretend they themſelves were ſent by their Maſter into all the Parts of <hi>Judea,</hi> to work there the very ſame Miracles they atteſted. But tho' they ſhould have deceived themſelves in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet they could not poſſibly deceive themſelves in his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> For they knew well enough what a dead Body and a living Man was, they could eaſily diſtinguiſh between them; and thoſe things are of ſuch a nature as not to be capable of <hi>Illuſion</hi> or <hi>deceit.</hi> Yet tho' we ſhould ſupoſe that the diſciples had been deceived in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet they could not have been impoſed upon in the laſt miraculous Event of his <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> It
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94927:107"/>
could never come to paſs, that after having ſeen a Spirit, they ſhould yet converſe with him forty days; that <hi>that</hi> Spirit ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be handled, that he ſhould give them Inſtructions, make them ſeveral Promiſes, and afterwards be caught up into Heaven in their Sight, they all the while look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, and adoring him as he was aſcending into Heaven, and underſtanding diſtinctly the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Angels which promiſed them, that <hi>he ſhould ſo come again in like manner, as they had ſeen him go up into Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would be to no purpoſe here to alledge with <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> That the Evangeliſts have not exactly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed all the Circumſtances of the Event they relate, and that had they taken ſpecial care to do it, it would perhaps ſo happen that the Circumſtances which they thought ſit to conceal, would make us comprehend, that thoſe which they have related proceeded from <hi>Natural</hi> Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſes: For, I deſire to know what can be more expreſly declared, or more often repeated in the Goſpel, than the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ</hi> into Heaven? And how can any Man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably imagin, that it was natural, and according to the regular Courſe of <hi>ſecond</hi> Cauſes, to ſee a Man that had been crucified, and laid in a Sepulcher where a Watch was appointed to guard him, riſe out of that Sepulcher again, appear alive to ſeveral Men that touched and handled him, and afterwards aſcend into Heaven in their ſight?</p>
                  <p>Certainly that very <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but convince the moſt ſuſpicious and ſcrupulous Perſon, that it was an Event purely divine and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural: For otherwiſe, our Incredulous Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries might imagin (ſince they are everlaſtingly raiſing Doubts) that the Body of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> might have been taken down from the Croſs before the Breath was gone out of it; that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:94927:107"/>
who was his Diſciple, tho he durſt not own it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, might have dreſs'd his Body, and recover'd him out of his Swoon by the ſtrength of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he gave him; that he might have laid another counterfeit Dead-body in his place, and buried it; and that afterwards <hi>Jeſ. Chriſt</hi> might have privately ſhewed himſelf to his Diſciples, not daring to appear in publick for fear of falling a ſecond time into the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſuffering a true and real Death, inſtead of that imaginary one he had ſuffered before.</p>
                  <p>But this Fiction is abſurd and incredible, and that for ſeveral Reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts relate, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had his Side pierced with the Lance of a Soldier, which thing alone was enough to give him his Death. Secondly, It is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to think that the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrin,</hi> who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him to die, nay who had taken ſuch care to ſet a Watch over his Sepulcher, ſhould yet ſuffer his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be taken down from the Croſs before the Breath was gone out of it. Laſtly, becauſe it can never be ſuppoſed that a Man who hung ſeveral Hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on a Croſs, ſhould yet eſcape Death, and ſhew himſelf not long after ſafe and ſound to his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>But that which will immediately remove all theſe Doubts, is, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> not only roſe from the Dead, but alſo aſcended into Heaven in the ſight of his Diſciples. And this is ſo ſenſible and evident a matter of fact, that they could never have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>So that it may very well be affirmed, that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon that Important Inquiry, whether the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples deſigned to impoſe upon us, by relating to us a falſe Event, which they did not believe themſelves. Now if we can clearly prove the contrary, we ſhall invincibly demonſtrate the certain Truth of our Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:94927:108"/>
Let us therefore in order to it, cloſely ſtick to the Examination of that matter of fact, the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and the moſt important that ever was, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſcover whether it be poſſible we ſhould have been impoſed upon by thoſe Men, which could not deceive themſelves.</p>
                  <p>If we would ſuppoſe that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> deceived us in their relation of a fictitious Event, we muſt alſo neceſſarily ſuppoſe theſe three things. 1. That their Illuſion or Impoſture muſt be a thing that was poſſible to be put in Execution. 2. That it muſt be of ſome Uſe or other to them. 3. That it muſt be ſuch as Men, and only Men make uſe of. Now it is certain, that their pretended Illuſion here in queſtion, could not have any of theſe three Qualities. 1. It could not have been poſſible, becauſe it muſt have been agreed upon by many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who all knew the bare Truth of the matter of fact it ſelf. 2. It would have been of no uſe, for what could thoſe Men propoſe to themſelves in inventing ſuch a Fiction? 3. It could not be ſuch as Men uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrive, becauſe from the Beginning of the World till now, we never heard of any Man that invented Lyes, on purpoſe to have the pleaſure of being han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſcourged, burnt, or executed upon a Scaffold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, I'll grant you if you will, that <hi>Peter</hi> with ſome other Diſciples might have taken away the Body of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> out of the Sepulcher, either by tricking the Watch, or taking the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their ſleeping; or laſtly, by bribing them with Mony: I'll grant you too, if you will, they might have eaſily perſwaded the whole Company of Diſciples, who were too credulous and too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſwallowing of Novelties, that <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> had appeared to them indeed, and that he was riſen from the Dead; I'll grant you likewiſe, that the other Diſciples might have imagined thereupon
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94927:108"/>
they had ſeen ſome Viſions, or thought they had ſeen him in ſeveral Places and on ſeveral Occaſions: but then I ask, How they could have all agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether concerning the truth of his <hi>Aſcenſion?</hi> By what Charm or Cunning could <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles have made them ſee that which they never ſaw or heard a Man ſpeak, whom they really never heard? By what Machine could they have cauſed the Clouds to deſcend? Or by what ſort of Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could they have produced two Men in white Raiments, telling them, <hi>Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into Heaven? This ſame Jeſus which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ye have ſeen him go up into Heaven,</hi> Acts 1. 11. By what ſecret Power could they have ſo deeply imprinted in the Minds of the Diſciples, the <hi>Words</hi> which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpoke to them after his <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> the <hi>Reproaches</hi> he made them of their <hi>Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> his <hi>Promiſe</hi> of ſending the Holy Ghoſt to them, his forbidding them to depart from the City of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the Command he gave them to Baptiſe all Nations in the Name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt; I ſay how could they have done all this, if all theſe things were but the witty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of their Imagination and Fancy?</p>
                  <p>Certainly tho St. <hi>Peter</hi> or ſome other Diſciple of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhould have formed to himſelf the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Plan of ſo Signal a Cheat, and tho he ſhould have ſet down in writing all the Articles one by one, which he was obliged to make other Men believe againſt the plain Truth, yet he could never have been ſo bold as to propoſe any ſuch thing to thoſe Men, who were prepoſſeſſed with the Opinion that <hi>Lying</hi> was a great Sin, but <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> on the contrary, a great Vertue. Nay, it is even impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould ever come into his Head, to frame ſo Signal an Impoſture upon ſo ſad and ſorrowful an
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94927:109"/>
Event as the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Neither does it appear that his Mind or his Thoughts were any ways bent upon any ſuch Deſign. And tho he ſhould have been induced out of a Spirit of <hi>Revenge,</hi> to invent ſuch a Lye to diſcredit the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> yet it can't be ſuppoſed he ſhould have been ſo very ſilly, as to imagin that the reſt of the Diſciples would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to that Impoſture, or be willing to maintain it at any rate whatever, out of meer Complaiſance to him.</p>
                  <p>Such is the Nature of Mankind, ſuch the Frame and Temper of their Hearts, that they will admit of no <hi>Falſity,</hi> unleſs covered with a ſpecious ſhew of <hi>Truth.</hi> So that when any thing is ſo evidently falſe that every Body muſt neceſſarily be ſenſible of it, we have no Thoughts of attempting to make others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; as for inſtance, it will never come into my Head to make other Men believe that I have Wings, and that I fly, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We might here repeat what has been ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> either the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples looked upon <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> before his Death as the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or elſe they did not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as ſuch. If they conſidered him as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they then believed his Words, and thought that he would truly riſe again; and if they did expect that he would truly riſe again, they conſequently believed he would come himſelf out of his Grave, and ſo it was not at all neceſſary they ſhould ſteal his Body away. And if they did not conſider him as the promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> whilſt he was alive, it muſt follow from thence, that they were Seducers and Impoſtors even before the Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now how can any one conceive that thoſe Seducers ſhould not have been terrified at the Puniſhment inflicted on their Maſter, or that ſuch a terrible Example of the moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Juſtice deſign'd too for them, ſhould not
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94927:109"/>
put an end to their frontleſs Impudence? Above all, How can it be ſuppoſed that thoſe wicked and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſciples durſt have propoſed to the other Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who were really Sincere and True, to joyn with them, and ſo teſtify that they had ſeen <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> aſcending into Heaven?</p>
                  <p>Truly I don't ſee what any Man can alledge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one of theſe two things, either that they were all ſincere and honeſt Men, or that ſome of them were honeſt, and the reſt Cheats. If they were all ſincere and honeſt Men, as their Manners, their Diſcourſe, their Conduct, and a thouſand other Characters of them evidently ſhew, then is it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible that any ſuch Cheat could have been carried on amongſt them. But if they were all a pack of cheating treacherous Impoſtors, then it was the firſt time that ever a Society of cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfidious Rogues was erected, who ſeemed to have had no other Deſign than to ſanctify Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>But what Man, be his Thoughts never ſo <hi>confus'd</hi> and <hi>irregular,</hi> be his Reaſon never ſo <hi>corrupt,</hi> can yet imagin that ſo many mean-ſpirited, ſimple and humble Men as the Diſciples were, ſhould immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely become the moſt Lying notorious Cheats, out of no other Deſign then to involve themſelves in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? If ſome of them were falſe and others ſincere, and if the latter were at all impoſed upon by the former, which is the moſt our Incredulous Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can imagin; yet even then I aſſert, that ſuch a Cheat could not have been carried on by them. For ſuppoſing <hi>Peter</hi> never ſo ſmooth and Eloquent, never ſo <hi>adroit</hi> at Diſſembling and Inſinuation, yet how could he poſſibly perſwade ſo great a number of Perſons to believe againſt their Senſes, that they had ſeen that which they really never ſaw, or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that which they had never handled; that <hi>Jeſus</hi>

                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> after having given them many Precepts and large Inſtructions, which he left very deeply imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Minds, aſcended into Heaven in their <hi>ſight?</hi> But ſhould I grant he might have perſwaded them of the Truth of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> yet how is it poſſible he could perſwade them of the Truth of his <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had St. <hi>Peter</hi> but ſo much as propoſed it to them whom he deſigned to delude, it would have been for that very Reaſon impoſſible but that they ſhould have found out his Deſign to cheat them. But he would not ſure preſume to propoſe to them the joint Contrivance of ſuch a fabulous Story, nor would he have found (tho he had been bold enough to have propoſed it) any that would have aſſiſted him in ſo ſenſleſs a Deſign, much leſs maintain'd his Extravagance, and leaſt of all expoſed themſelves to a thouſand Torments on purpoſe to maintain it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, I obſerved that ſuch an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture would have been of no manner of uſe to them. It is enough to have proved that it was impoſſible to be put in Execution to ſatisfie any reaſonable Man how needleſs and uſeleſs it would be to advance it. 'Tis true, there have been in all Ages and Countries ſuch Men as would have been very willing, for their own Advantage, to make others believe improbable Stories and Fictions, had the thing been but practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable: but becauſe they could not effect it without ſuch a mutual Concert among ſeveral Perſons to maintain it, as is altogether impoſſible, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reaſon it never came into their Minds upon ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and cooler Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>It would, no doubt, be of very ſingular Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to thoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> who ſo earneſtly deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves an extraordinary Reſpect and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from their Subjects, and for that Reaſon very ſeldom appear in publick, and hardly ever ſhew

themſelves to their Poople; I ſay, it would be of great Advantage to them, if they could but once perſwade their People that they were of a Divine Race, and came down from Heaven: but becauſe they judge ſuch a Deſign impracticable, they reckon it a thing altogether uſeleſs and needleſs ever to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it.</p>
                  <p>Certainly we may as well affirm that the Deſign of making other Men believe the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> againſt the real truth of the thing, and inward ſenſe of their own Conſciences, would have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as uſeleſs and needleſs; becauſe it does not in the leaſt appear that the Diſciples could propoſe to themſelves any reaſonable Deſign in maintaining ſuch an incredible Story.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay it was a thing not only wholly uſeleſs, but as we obſerv'd in the third place, ſuch a one as Men dont uſually Deſign, or contrive. It could not enter into any one Man's mind, much leſs into that of ſo many different men at once, to fancy that they could perſwade other Men to credit ſuch an impudent Lye as that muſt have been, or to dare undertake to make others believe it, to think in the leaſt that they could ſucceed in ſo ſtrange a Deſign, or that others would have acted in it jointly with them, to imagin that they could be able to endure the moſt rigorous Torments, and the ſevereſt and moſt cruel Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or that the Cheat which they unanimouſly had agreed on, would have been both believed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of throughout the World; nay what is more, that Men ſhould repent and become <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> out of a Reſpect and Reverence they bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this we may add, that conſidering this Deſign of theirs another way, it is not, cannot be ſuch a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94927:112"/>
one as any Man would conceive or endeavour to put in Practice. It is abſolutely impoſſible to find any Man ſo much an Enemy to himſelf, as willingly to loſe his <hi>Quiet,</hi> his <hi>Liberty, Friends, Relations</hi> and all his <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> only to aſſert and defend a Lye, that muſt unavoidably be attended by ſuch fatal and ſorrowful Conſequences. For <hi>Nature</hi> is not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Grief and Pain. As ſhe is expoſed to Griefs and Sufferings, ſo when ſhe ſuffers 'tis with Reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Complaints, Sighs, and Tears. She cannot accuſtom her ſelf to bear ſlightly <hi>Contempt</hi> or <hi>Infamy.</hi> Nothing diſturbs and exaſperates her more, nothing makes her more impatient than <hi>Mortifications</hi> and <hi>Diſgraces.</hi> How then is it poſſible ſo great a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of People ſhould on a ſudden renounce all thoſe inviolable Sentiments of Nature which no Violence can root out, on purpoſe to maintain that they had ſeen a thing, which they really never ſaw? This is a Conſideration that cannot be too often repeated.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is ſuch a Deſign as is not in the nature of Man to conceive. For, to maintain an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture with ſuch <hi>Conſtancy</hi> as the Diſciples did, is ſuch a piece of extraordinary Courage as is above the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Power of Man. An Impoſtor that thinks and knows himſelf to be one, whoſe Mind tells him that he acts contrary to his <hi>Natural Sentiments,</hi> cannot go long undiſcover'd. He is ſeiz'd with Remorſe, and his Conſcience is awakened. He trembles and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily diſcovers himſelf to the World upon the leaſt danger he meets with. He is ready to confeſs the whole Cheat, as ſoon as he is brought before his Judges, and is frighted with the Puniſhments of a ſecular Power; and he never fails of betraying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, either by confeſſing the whole Buſineſs, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what he has advanced after ſo weak and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a manner, that he will not be long, (if but cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urg'd to it) before he diſcovers the whole Truth.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94927:112"/>
For ſuch is the uſual Temper of Men upon ſuch an Occaſion. And if a ſingle Perſon that ſhould not act thus in this reſpect, would be looked upon as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Prodigy, how much more ſhall an infinite number of People be looked upon as ſuch? Who can imagin that ſo many Perſons ſhould either on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den renounce their humane Nature, or be of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent make from all other Men ſince the Beginning of the World; For my part, I cannot conceive how it ſhould be, and therefore look upon this as a moſt ſenſible and evident Truth. But we muſt yet carry on this Conviction further, by following thoſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which it has pleaſed God in his Wiſdom to put into our Mind upon this Subject.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>This Demonſtration of the truth of</hi> Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>has three different Degrees of Evidence, which alſo conſiſt in the three Parts of the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles. The firſt whereof is this;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> did ſuch Actions as cannot but be ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and miraculous; ſuch are, for inſtance, the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead which we have been Eye-witneſſes of. <hi>The ſecond is,</hi> We, even we our ſelves, have received
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94927:113"/>
the Power to work Signs and Wonders, and ſuch as are equal to thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, as he foretold and declared it ſeveral times unto us. <hi>The third is,</hi> We have not only the power to do thoſe Miracles, but can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo impart it to others: and thoſe we ſhall hereafter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert will know themſelves to be the true Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, in that they ſhall work Signs like unto ours, and to thoſe which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf wrought.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Degree of this Evidence muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convince us. For it is a very convincing Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration indeed, to have preſent to one's Eyes, nay in ones own Diſpoſal and Power, the Witneſſes of the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſuch Eye-witneſſes too, that both heard what he ſaid, ſaw every thing he did, familiarly converſed with him, and often queſtion'd him concerning the Difficulties that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to their Mind; and laſtly, ſuch Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes who all unanimouſly depoſed the very ſame matter of fact, and boldly maintain'd it even in the midſt of the moſt cruel Torments; And yet ſuch Witneſſes as theſe had thoſe who were firſt convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith.</p>
                  <p>But it is a thing yet ſomewhat more perſwaſive to hear thoſe Men affirm, that they had not only ſeen the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but that they themſelves were able to work the ſame Miracles. Certainly, of all the Witneſſes in the World, thoſe are ſooneſt to be received and believ'd, who proffer to ſhew you the very Things they teſtify.</p>
                  <p>But what ſeems to me to be the laſt Degree of Evidence, and the cleareſt Demonſtration, is, that thoſe very Witneſſes undertook to convince Men of thoſe matters which they affirmed to be true, not only by relating thoſe Miracles which they ſaw <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ</hi> do, not only by profering to do the like themſelves, but alſo by promiſing to enable thoſe People (who ſhould believe their Words) to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94927:113"/>
the very ſame things: For they imparted the extraordinary and miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt to their Proſelytes, as it appears by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Centurion Cornelius.</hi> And thoſe Gifts became afterwards ſo frequent and viſible, that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> would have bought them for Mony: They were ſo very remarkable, that they made great and publick Impreſſions on the Minds of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Jews,</hi> who were already converted to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of our Lord, and praiſed God for his having alſo viſited the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Laſtly, the Goſpel which thoſe Diſciples preached, tells us that ſuch ſhould be the Signs that followed the true Diſciples of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> namely, <hi>that they ſhould heal the Sick,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Certainly how ſtrong ſoever the obſtinacy and prejudices of the <hi>Incredulous</hi> may be, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any longer hold out againſt the powerful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of that threefold Truth. It is impoſſible that the Diſciples ſhould bear witneſs to the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> if they had not been true; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we ſuppoſe they would have had the <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Power,</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> to do it. It is impoſſible they ſhould have contrived together ſuch an unparallel'd Impoſture, by agreeing among themſelves to preach the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of which they were never Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>But it is extravagant to imagin that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> boaſted they were able to do Miracles, meerly to have other Men believe thoſe of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and it argues yet a greater Extravagance, to ſuppoſe they promiſed all thoſe they ſhould convert to him, to make them able to work the very ſame Miracles they atteſted.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we are to conſider two things in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> made to the Apoſtles on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt: viz.</hi> the <hi>Symbol</hi> or <hi>Token</hi> of the Preſence of the Holy Ghoſt, and the <hi>Effects</hi> or <hi>Gifts</hi> of the ſaid Holy
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94927:114"/>
Ghoſt. And it is not eaſie to imagin how the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples could be deceived in either reſpect: I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, however, for once to ſuppoſe that they might have been deceived in thoſe external and corporeal Symbols; that they might fancy they heard a <hi>mighty ruſhing Wind,</hi> of which there was really no noiſe; that their Eyes being dazzled they might have taken that for Fire which was not Fire; yet this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would certainly be a little too extravagant. For tho the Apoſtles, by reaſon of ſome Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Organs, or ſome outward Illuſion, may have fancy'd that they ſaw Fire where no Fire was, yet it is a very difficult matter for a wandring Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination (as they muſt be ſuppoſed to have had then according to this Notion) to have joyn'd Fire and a Sound together; and much more difficult alſo to have perceiv'd that Fire in a form which was moſt agreeable to their <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> and that muſt have been a very fortuitous Chance indeed, that could thus modify that Fire, and make it appear as <hi>Cloven Tongues like as of Fire,</hi> which ſat on each of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples when they were aſſembled together. Beſides, it would be very ſtrange they ſhould be all of them liable to the ſame Deluſion. But what then? ſtill this Suppoſition is too extravagant. Is it ſo? If you will, we'll ſuppoſe it true. But then tell us, how we ſhall expreſs the wonderful Effects of that Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thoſe durable and laſting Effects which were ſtill extant, tho' the Wind had ceaſed blowing, tho' that Sound which had filled the whole Houſe was no longer to be heard, and tho' that Fire and thoſe Tongues had vaniſhed away.</p>
                  <p>For certainly 'twas never intended thoſe ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Effects ſhould be concealed. The Apoſtles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſpoke all ſorts of Languages, and that too before all Nations of the World. They convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one while ſix thouſand People, at another three
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94927:114"/>
thouſand by one ſingle Sermon, and only ſpeaking this to their Auditors, <hi>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this, which ye now ſee and hear,</hi> Acts. 2. 33.</p>
                  <p>We'll grant, if you will, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did no manner of Miracles; It will produce no great Conſequence, ſo long as it appears that the Apoſtles did ſeveral: Nay, they choſe for that very end, the Sick that were moſt known. They took a lame Perſon, for inſtance, that was publickly known to all the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for ſuch a one, to make him walk and leap before all the People of that great and flouriſhing City.</p>
                  <p>'Twould have been a ſtrange thing indeed, if the Apoſtles had attempted to ſhew falſe Miracles to thoſe People that were ten thouſand times more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and refined than themſelves: But it would be yet far more ſtrange, that after having preached a falſe <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of their Maſter, they ſhould have undertook to prove it by working a falſe Miracle, which muſt neceſſarily have been immediately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</p>
                  <p>But I'll grant, if you will, that they might have been ſo extravagant, as to undertake it, and that the <hi>Jews</hi> whoſe chief Intereſt it was to diſcover their Cheats and Artifices, might have been ſo far void of <hi>Common ſenſe</hi> as not to make the leaſt Inquiry into it, or Examination about it. But what then will you ſay to this, which in my Opinion may ſerve for an invincible Demonſtration; namely, that the Apoſtles not only pretended themſelves able to work Miracles, but alſo to give their Diſciples Power to do the ſame?</p>
                  <p>Did any one ever hear of a Society form'd by the preaching of certain Impoſtors, who gave this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Truth of their preaching, that they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94927:115"/>
would impart to others the Power of working the ſame Miracles with themſelves, who confer'd mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts upon thoſe they baptiſed, but miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gifts ſo evident and ſo ſenſible, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could not doubt but that they had truly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them; nor they on whom they were confer'd form any lawful or reaſonable Objection againſt them?</p>
                  <p>This Conſideration is ſo much the more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, becauſe thoſe Gifts we here ſpeak of were dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and permanent, at leaſt, during the Infancy or firſt Age of the Church. I confeſs indeed, that the Holy Ghoſt foretold that <hi>Prophecy</hi> ſhould vaniſh away, and the <hi>Gifts of Tongues</hi> ſhould ceaſe; which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Reaſon to prevent our wondering at the Ceſſation of thoſe Gifts in our days. There were none but <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> that were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to all Ages. But I am alſo certain, that the miraculous Gifts laſted as long as the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nay they were yet extant long after their days, till God himſelf had ſettled Chriſtian Churches in all Parts of the World, the Scaffolds having been only taken down, when the Building was finiſhed. And this no Man of ſenſe can reaſonably doubt of, eſpecially when he ſees that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allude to this Matter of fact, after ſo ſimple and ſo natural a Manner. The Gift of Tongues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and all other miraculous Gifts, were durable and permanent in reſpect of thoſe they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon. The Father was ſeen to diſcourſe about them with his Son, and the Son with his Father. And it gave Occaſion to the <hi>Jews</hi> who wondered that the Holy Ghoſt was alſo imparted to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to giorify God for it.</p>
                  <p>But I am willing ſome Men ſhould make the moſt violent Supoſitions they can; at leaſt, they will not refuſe to allow that the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who pretended to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94927:115"/>
impart the Holy Ghoſt to other men by the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their hands, and who proffered to make it deſcend upon their Proſelytes by baptiſing them; who went about preaching every where that the Time was come, wherein according to the Prophecy of <hi>Joel,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt was to be poured upon all Fleſh; and who in their Goſpels and Hiſtories they compoſed of the Life of their Maſter, affirm'd upon ſerious Reflection, that, <hi>theſe ſigns ſhould follow them that believed,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, it is to be preſumed they will not refuſe to allow, that thoſe Men ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they had received, and were able to impart the Holy Ghoſt to others. Perhaps it was their Miſtake, if you will have it ſo; but that is not the thing I now contend about. Whether they were miſtaken indeed, or not, ſtill it is evident, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had ſincerely believed that Miſtake, or that profeſs'd Opinion, they durſt never have made ſuch Promiſes: 'Tis plain enough, that a Man who did not think within himſelf that he had received the Miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, would never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to impart them to others.</p>
                  <p>Now I would deſire the Reader carefully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this laſt Principle, it being neceſſary to give an invincible Demonſtration of the Truth of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. In a word, if the Apoſtles ſincerely believed they could ſpeak all ſorts of Languages, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the extraordinary and miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, I affirm, that it was abſolutely impoſſible they ſhould have been Deceivers as to the other matters of fact: For it is impoſſible they ſhould believe they had received thoſe miraculous Gifts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they alſo believ'd the <hi>Miracles, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> to be true; and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould have believed the Miracles, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Aſcenſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be true, if all thoſe Events had not been true indeed; becauſe,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94927:116"/>
as we have already plainly made it appear, it is not poſſible that thoſe matters of fact ſhould have been capable of Illuſion and Deceit.</p>

                  <p>SHould we conſider all thoſe Events in general, we might form an invincible Demonſtration of them, by ſuppoſing the three following Principles, which in my Opinion will hereafter appear to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evidently proved.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that the Apoſtles, and the reſt of the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did really teſtify his <hi>Miracles, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion,</hi> and the pouring out the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt on the Apoſtles. The ſecond, that they ſincerely believed what they ſo teſtified. And the third, that they having firmly believed that <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> wrought many wonderful Miracles, that he was riſen from the Dead, aſcended into Heaven, and had poured out his Spirit upon all his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of all which Events, they were Eye-Witneſſes, it muſt neceſſarily follow from thence that all thoſe things were certainly true.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Principles is undeniable in it ſelf. For it appears that theſe four Events were the whole ſubject Matter of the preaching of the Holy Apoſtles; which too is plain, becauſe they themſelves tell it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir Writings, or rather becauſe their Writing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> any thing elſe in all their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94927:116"/>
but of thoſe four wonderful Events, in thoſe Epiſtles they wrote to whole Societies, who ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved them as Writings of the greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; becauſe there is no fragment, page, or ſcarce a line in all thoſe Writings, but what either relates thoſe matters of fact, or evidently ſuppoſes them; becauſe there can be no <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> eſtabliſhed in the World without this Foundation; becauſe they have been confirmed to us by Perſons who lived ſince the Bleſſed Apoſtles, and diſcourſed familiarly with them; becauſe the publication of thoſe things was the cauſe of the eſtabliſhing very numerous Churches almoſt every where in the days of the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; becauſe <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Common ſenſe</hi> ſufficiently aſſure us, that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> could never have believed in a crucified Man as ſuch, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time alſo taught that he was riſen from the Dead; becauſe the Faithful only believe the laſt Reſurrection, upon their certain hope and ſtrong perſwaſion that they are to be made like unto the glorious Body of their Divine Redeemer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is manifeſt that the Authors of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> copy'd not one anothers Writings, and yet unanimouſly agree in the relation of thoſe four ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Events, as being the very eſſentials of their Doctrine; becauſe the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> would not have ſanctified themſelves, nor utterly renounced the enticing charms of the World, but that they truſted wholly in a Man that was riſen from the Dead, and aſcended into Heaven; becauſe the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and moſt inſolent Enemies of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> never entertained the leaſt ſcruple in that reſpect, nor preſumed to deny but that <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples boldly teſtify'd of him that he was riſen from the Dead, and aſcended into Heaven; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> always acknowledged this to be the teſtimony of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and laſtly, becauſe the union of all thoſe and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94927:117"/>
many other Circumſtances we have already handled, render the thing itſelf wholly undeniable and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the higheſt degree: ſo that it is almoſt to no purpoſe to inſiſt any longer on the proof of the firſt Principle.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is no leſs certain than the firſt. For 'tis evident that the Apoſtles ſincerely believed that whatever they related was moſt certainly true; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe things they deliver'd to us in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, were the Motives and Incitements they had to their Vertue, ſelf denial, and patience ſo often tried in the dangers they underwent; becauſe they made ſuch ſimple and natural alluſions to them, that it is abſolutely impoſſible, one ſhould not perceive their being truly perſwaded of the truth of them, in ſo much that they were convinced of the future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of their condition, mauger all the reaſons they might have to think it ſhould be Miſerable and Sorrowful; becauſe 'twas this very perſwaſion which gave them the Courage they had to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the greateſt Dangers, and undergo the moſt ſevere trials; becauſe they rejoyced with one another in that they were thought worthy of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lives and whatever elſe was deareſt to them, for the defence of ſo good a Cauſe, tho they muſt needs have very well known the cheat they had forg'd among themſelves, if what they ſaid was not certainly true; and above all, becauſe they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhew very ſenſible and miraculous proofs of the matters of fact which they had delivered.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the laſt of theſe Principles is ſtill (if I may ſo ſpeak) more evident than either of the former. For it is impoſſible that the Diſciples of our Lord ſhould have been deceived, 1. in ſuch evident mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, the Truth of which they might ſo eaſily have been aſſured of by <hi>ſenſible</hi> Experience; 2. in ſo great a number of matters of fact, ſo different from
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94927:117"/>
one another by their Circumſtances; and 3. in ſuch matters of fact that were ſo link'd and united one with another, that whoſoever grants but one, muſt neceſſarily grant the truth of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>And now let the Reader but throughly conſider all theſe things within himſelf, and I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded he can never doubt of any of theſe three Principles. For he cannot ſo much as deny one of them without an extraordinary reluctance in his mind, which will force back the truth upon him. Should he ſay that the Apoſtles never preached the <hi>Miracles, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor the pouring out the Holy Ghoſt on the Apoſtles themſelves, 'twould be as great a falſehood as if he ſhould ſay, that there were never any ſuch Men as the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or that they were not the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor preached that Men muſt neceſſarily believe on him; and it is moſt certain that he will preſently reject all theſe propoſitions, as being abſurdly falſe and extravagant in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſhould he ſay that the Apoſtles did not ſincerely believe the Miracles, Reſurrection, Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor the Effuſion of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, 'tis as much as if he ſhould affirm they did not pretend to work any Miracles, ſpeak ſtrange Languages, or think themſelves capable of Imparting thoſe gifts to other Men: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as much as if he ſhould advance, that the Apoſtles wrote none of all thoſe Epiſtles that were aſcribed to them; that they preach'd not publickly at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> nor ſettled any Church therein, or taught Men that they ſhould ſtedfaſtly believe in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſhould he ſay that the Apoſtles ſincerely believed all theſe things, but yet that none of them were true, 'tis as much as if he aſſerted that they had neither <hi>Eyes, Ears,</hi> nor <hi>Memory;</hi> and that ſeveral
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94927:118"/>
thouſands of People were all deprived of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by the ſame kind of bewitching folly, ſo that thoſe who embraced the Doctrine which they taught, muſt at the ſame time preciſely and neceſſarily have loſt their Reaſon; and yet 'tis evident that folly is the only Principle that makes us lead good lives, and ſanctifies the corrupt Affections of Men.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, that by conſidering the union of all theſe Circumſtances together, there ariſes from them ſuch a <hi>Moral</hi> Demonſtration, as is worth all other <hi>Mathematical</hi> Demonſtrations in the World. But to be as brief as poſſible, I ſay that this Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration after all, conſiſts in the two following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. As thus the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſincerely believed his <hi>Miracles, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion,</hi> and the <hi>Effuſion</hi> of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows therefore, that theſe four Events are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true. The Conſequence of this argument is evident, becauſe theſe are matters of fact that were altogether incapable of Illuſion or Deceit, and in which it was abſolutely impoſſible they ſhould have been deceived. For tho the Diſciples might have been decieved in one ſingle Miracles, yet how could they be deceived in ſeveral Miracles at once? Tho it were poſſible they might have been deceived in the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet they could not be deceived in his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> Tho' they might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved in his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> yet they could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſo many ſenſible Marks which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave them of his Preſence after he was riſen from the Dead; and above all, in his <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> Tho' they might have been deceived even in his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> yet they could not be deceived in the <hi>Effuſion</hi> of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they had a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Experience of that laſt Miracle. They knew whether it was true or not, there had appeared to them <hi>Cloven Tongues like as of fire;</hi> but ſtill they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94927:118"/>
knew yet much better, whether they had really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Gift of Tongues, which were repreſented to them by that external Symbol: the Holy Ghoſt having particularly choſen that Gift above all others on purpoſe to make it the more remarkable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of all ſorts of Gifts, this is certainly the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable, and the leaſt capable of Error and Illuſion.</p>
                  <p>For pray how is it poſſible, I ſhould perſwade my ſelf that I can ſpeak the <hi>Perſian, Chineſe,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, or that I underſtand all thoſe Languages when they are ſpoken to me, had I no ſuch Gift of Tongues? And if it be ſo rare a thing to ſee one ſingle Man poſſeſſed with that fooliſh kind of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to imagin ſuch a thing, it is moſt certainly impoſſible that a great number of Perſons ſhould fancy that they on a ſudden ſpoke all ſorts of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in the World, when there was no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>It muſt then neceſſarily be granted, that tho' the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> might perhaps have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon in all the other matters of fact, yet they could not be deluded in this. For a Man cannot be ignorant whether or no he ſpeaks thoſe Languages which were before wholly unknown to him, much leſs can 2 Men be ſo, much leſs again 12, and much leſs ſtill 70, and ſince every one of theſe Perſons muſt neceſſarily know what paſſes within himſelf, it is impoſſible they ſhould all believe they had received the Gift of Tongues, when there was no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>The Conſequence therefore of our Argument is moſt certain, moſt evident and undeniable, if ever any thing was ſo; and the Principle of it will appear to be ſo likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſincerely believed his <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion,</hi> and the <hi>Effuſion</hi> of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. If you would be more fully convinced of this, 'tis but reading the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> over from one end to the other: There you will
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94927:119"/>
find that <hi>Sincerity</hi> and that full <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> in their diſintereſſed Self-denial, which ſprung from the Knowledge they had that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as their only trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, was aſcended into Heaven; there you will ſee their <hi>Joyfulneſs</hi> in Afflictions ariſing purely from the Teſtimony they bore to the Truth; their <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> wholly inconſiſtent with the Character of Impoſtors; their <hi>Humility, Purity, Patience,</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Zeal,</hi> and that fervent <hi>deſire</hi> they had to Kindle all thoſe Vertues in the Souls of others: theſe being two undeniable matters, firſt that the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhewed themſelves to have the moſt <hi>natural ſentiments</hi> of Piety and Vertue imaginable; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> can never proceed from Impoſture and Deceit. There you will alſo find the plain Honeſty of the Diſciples, and the Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Perſwaſion in the ſtyle of their Diſcourſe. For if it be true, that Languages expreſs the Genius and Manners of the People; it may be very well affirmed, that the Language of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples fully expreſſes the Miracles of the Goſpel by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Energy, which diſtinguiſhes the ſtyle of thoſe Authors not only from that of all other Men, but alſo from that of the Law. You will meet with the ſame Sincerity even in that great number of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and difficult Texts which the Evangeliſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: For on one hand it is impoſſible that they ſhould counterfeit or invent thoſe Precepts, or thoſe difficult and obſcure Sayings which they make <hi>Chriſt</hi> utter to the People, and on the other it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that thoſe difficult and obſcure Texts almoſt always include ſome miraculous matter of fact, or at leaſt ſome Alluſion to thoſe ſupernatural Miracles. Firſt then, I ſay, that the Evangeliſts invented not thoſe obſcure and difficult Sayings they make <hi>Chriſt</hi> utter, which are truly very numerous: For how ſhould thoſe poor Fiſhermen have been induſtrious
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94927:119"/>
enough to forge and invent ſuch Things which all the Doctors as have lived theſe ſixteen hundred years down to us, were hardly able either to underſtand themſelves, or make other Men comprehend?</p>
                  <p>Beſides it is certain that thoſe obſcure and difficult ſayings, either contain the Hiſtory of thoſe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matters of fact we are now ſpeaking of, or elſe include ſuch plain and natural Alluſions to them, that it is eaſie for any one to perceive that he that relates thoſe Texts, both ſuppoſes that thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact were certainly true, and publickly known to the World. Thus for inſtance, why did our Lord ſay that <hi>there was not a greater Prophet than John the Baptiſt born of a Woman?</hi> 'Twas not ſurely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Miracles, for he did none: Neither was it becauſe of his extraordinary Piety. For <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> called the <hi>meekeſt of Men,</hi> was without doubt in that equal to him. 'Twas then becauſe of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he enjoyed both in Seeing and Hearing the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But how comes our Saviour to add that <hi>the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven was greater than him.</hi> Muſt we underſtand by <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that Kingdom of which <hi>John</hi> himſelf ſaid, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand?</hi> Was it not rather becauſe <hi>John</hi> ſaw none of all the Wonders of that Kingdom which the leaſt of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples had ſeen? Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the reaſon that our Saviour told them, <hi>Bleſſed are your Eyes, for they ſee, and your Ears, for they hear. For verily I ſay unto you, that many Prophets and righteous Men have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them; and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</hi> Matth. 13. 16, 17. Now all this evidently ſuppoſes the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all the other marvellous Events which ſerve for a Confirmation of our holy Religion.</p>
                  <p>What he alſo ſaid himſelf concerning Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is altogether ſtrange and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94927:120"/>
very ſurpriſing. Nay the very name he gave to that ſin implies ſomething in itſelf Singular and Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. For no body before him ever expreſſed himſelf after this manner. Men were not ignorant that ſinning againſt God was a very great Crime, but they had no Knowledge of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, much leſs were they ſatisfied if there was any harm in Blaſpheming againſt him. This unuſual Language neceſſarily proceeded from a new <hi>Revelation,</hi> and from new and different objects not ſeen or heard of before. For the <hi>Jews</hi> knew not what the Holy Ghoſt was (if we take that word in the Senſe of the Evangeliſts.) Nay there were ſome of them who tho converted to the Gopſel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet ſtill were ignorant of the true meaning of that Expreſſion. In the mean while if we will but conſult the Writings of the New Teſtament, and therein the Goſpels, the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Holy Apoſtles, and the Epiſtles of thoſe great and extraordinary Men, they will preſently inform us that by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> muſt be underſtood in moſt of thoſe places, the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and miraculous Gifts of the Holy Spirit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the Men of thoſe days; and that to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme againſt him, is downright Blaſphemy againſt that Divine and Glorious Principle of all things, which was, the cauſe of all the Perfections and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and gave ſuch Power unto Men.</p>
                  <p>So that there is firſt in that Text ſuch an obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as proves that the Evangeliſts could not have thought of inventing it, had not <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly utter'd theſe very words; and ſecondly, it unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably ſuppoſes the miraculous matters of fact, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were wont to aſcribe to the Power of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi> wherein indeed Chiefly conſiſted the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>In like manner this Text, <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit,</hi> John 3. 5. implies a very
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94927:120"/>
puzling Difficulty; becauſe it was not uſual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for Men to expreſs themſelves after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is a very difficult matter indeed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true meaning of that Text, but it is yet far more difficult to invent it; and all the Doctors in the World might put their Heads together, and yet never be able to invent the like Text. Above all it was not natural for the <hi>Jews</hi> to invent any ſuch thing, becauſe they had no ſuch objects amongſt them as could fill up their Minds with any ſuch Ideas. When we ſuppoſe the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit confer'd upon <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples, we may then eaſily comprehend the true meaning of that myſterious but very remarkable Expreſſion. We might alſo add to this Text, that other which mentions the <hi>Baptiſm of the Holy Ghost and of fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner it pleaſed God in his Wiſdom that they who related to us the Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> ſhould tell us alſo ſome things which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at firſt view eaſily comprehend (tho they have a true and reaſonable meaning) on purpoſe to make us underſtand that as it was impoſſible thoſe obſcure and difficult ſayings aſcribed to him by them ſhould come of themſelves into their thoughts, had not he really ſpoke them, ſo conſequently it can never be ſuppoſed that thoſe Men ſhould have forg'd the Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection, or their Diſcourſes with him after he was riſen from the Dead, as for inſtance, theſe Words which he ſpake to <hi>Mary, touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father, John</hi> 20. 17. We could make almoſt an infinite number of ſuch Remarks as theſe, which tho' they cannot come up to an evident Demonſtration, yet are very proper to make us ſenſible of the Truth of thoſe matters of fact we are now ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p>The Sincerity of the Diſciples will further appear by the great number of Circumſtances with which
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94927:121"/>
their Narrative is fill'd, ſome whereof are ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that they can't eaſily enter into any Man's Mind, and others ſo unbecoming their Maſter, or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>dvantageous to themſelves, that there is not the leaſt Probability they could have any Deſire to forge them; others are ſo inſeparably united with thoſe Events which muſt neceſſarily have been well known, that they durſt not ſo much as think of forging them againſt the publick Knowledge every body muſt have had of them, as we have already proved at large.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, 'tis not our preſent Deſign to inſiſt purely upon probable Reaſons, tho' never ſo proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſufficient of themſelves, to form a true and perfect Demonſtration when joyned together. I therefore proceed to that which is in itſelf wholly Demonſtrative.</p>
                  <p>Now the whole Demonſtration of the Truth of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> depends upon this Argument; namely, that the Apoſtles and Diſciples of <hi>Christ</hi> ſincerely believed his <hi>Miracles, Reſurrection, Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and the <hi>Effuſion</hi> of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; whence it follows, that all thoſe matters of fact are moſt certainly true.</p>
                  <p>We have already given an invincible proof of the Conſequence of this Argument, by ſhewing that it was impoſſible the Diſciples ſhould have been impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon in all theſe matters of fact; that tho' they might have been deceived in the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet they could not be impoſed upon in his <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> that tho' they ſhould have been impoſed upon in his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> yet they could not be deceived in his <hi>Aſcenſion;</hi> and that tho' they ſhould have been deceived in his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> yet they could not be ſo too in the <hi>miraculous Gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, which are matters of fact that they knew by <hi>inward</hi> ſenſe, and continual Experience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:94927:121"/>
I prove alſo the Principle of this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſincerely believed all thoſe matters of fact by the ſame Gradation. I ſay then, that the Diſciples could not impoſe upon Men as to the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not only becauſe they aſſerted them at the Expence of their own Quiet, of their deareſt Blood, and even of their Lives, but alſo becauſe they mention'd the Places, the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Time when they were done, and generally all the Circumſtances abſolutely neceſſary to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Truth, and render the Deſign of impoſing upon Mankind altogether impoſſible, and beſides that, they confirmed thoſe Miracles by others full as great if not greater than they were, which they pretended to do even in the ſight of thoſe to whom they preached the Goſpel, not only telling them, <hi>That which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our Eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, of the word of life declare we unto you,</hi> 1 John 1. 1. (alluding thereby to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s having deliver'd himſelf to be touched and handled by his Diſciples after his <hi>Reſurrection)</hi> but alſo adding theſe Words in another place, <hi>Therefore he hath ſhed forth this which ye now ſee and hear:</hi> there being this further very remarkable in thoſe Expreſſions; namely, that they pretended that the Holy Ghoſt deſcended not in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon them till after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Glorification. For they make this Truth one of the chief Articles of their Goſpel, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified,</hi> John 7. 39. Thus it appears what it was they underſtood by the Holy Ghoſt, not the Grace of God only which they had already received when <hi>Christ</hi> was yet with them, not a few of the miraculous Gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, for they had partly received them when they were ſent into the different Parts of <hi>Judea</hi> to preach the Goſpel and work Miracles in the Name
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94927:122"/>
of their Maſter, but alſo that extraordinary and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Effuſion of the miraculous Gifts which they received on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> For as they were then obliged to ſpeak to all ſorts of Nations, ſo they received the gift of ſpeaking divers Tongues, and were baptiſed and fill'd with that Spirit which they had received but in part before. And this they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>receiving the effect of the Promiſe,</hi> which every one of the Evangeliſts alſo termed, <hi>Baptiſing with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But tho' it were not poſſible for us to prove that the Diſciples ſincerely believed <hi>Chriſt's Miracles,</hi> yet it muſt be granted, that they ſincerely believed his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> it being impoſſible that they ſhould either unanimouſly agree to teſtify the ſame, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the ſevere Trials they were forced to undergo in a time they muſt otherwiſe have been ſo much dejected, or that they could be able to maintain that Cheat with ſo much Conſtancy as they did. And the ſame thing I alſo affirm of his glorious <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, tho' the Sincerity of the Diſciples might be juſtly ſuſpected in both theſe two laſt Events, yet it can never be call'd in queſtion concerning the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt: For, if <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples were not truly ſincere, then they neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily knew themſelves to be Deceivers, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not able to work any Miracles, or ſpeak all ſorts of Languages: And if ſo, they could not have boaſted that they were able to do both, and make this an Eſſential Article of their Goſpel. Nay they could not ſo much as have any Thoughts of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. And were they (as ſome pretend) perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they could perform no Miracles, nor ſpeak any Language but their own; tis impoſſible that they ſhould yet declare that God had ſent them to work Miracles, and preach to all Nations in the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94927:122"/>
World in their reſpective Tongues. 'Tis yet ſtill more impoſſible they ſhould promiſe to enable their Proſelytes to perform the ſame Miracles, and ſpeak all ſorts of Languages, ſo that they themſelves and thoſe to whom they ſpoke, ſhould equally be ſenſible of it at the ſame time: For, if the Diſciples knew by Experience they could ſpeak no Language but their own, they would eaſily know by the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that their Proſelytes would ſoon perceive how falſly they had promiſed them the Gift of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Languages.</p>
                  <p>And tho' one ſingle Diſciple of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould have been ſo fooliſh and ſtupid as not to perceive it, yet it cannot be that all of them together ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with the ſame kind of ſtupidity.</p>
                  <p>Should we ſuppoſe that all the Diſciples had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to perſwade their Proſelytes, that they had confer'd upon them the Gift of Tongues, yet we can't ſuppoſe that thoſe Proſelytes would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it againſt their continual Experience to the contrary: For, if the Diſciples knew by Experience, they could ſpeak no Language but their own, by the ſame Experience their Proſelytes would have known that they had not received the Gift of Tongues. And though one ſingle Perſon might have fancy'd he had received it (which is yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in it ſelf) yet a whole Multitude could never be perſwaded of it; and it is ſtill much more impoſſible that this pretended Illuſion ſhould have grown ſo univerſal and durable, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> not only ſuppoſed but found it ſettled in the World, and undertook to reform the Diſorders which aroſe in ſeveral particular Churches concerning the Uſe of the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Spirit. And tho' <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples might have promiſed out of a particular Deſign of their own, to impart theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts, which they were ſenſible they had not,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94927:123"/>
and make other Men ſpeak ſuch Languages, as they neither underſtood, nor ſpoke themſelves; and tho' a Multidude of Proſelytes and Diſciples might have perſwaded themſelves againſt their own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and inward Senſe, that they underſtood thoſe things which they underſtood not, or ſpoke thoſe Languages which they really ſpoke no more than they did before their calling; yet it is ſtill impoſſible that thoſe miraculous Gifts, ſuppoſing them to exiſt only in the imaginary conceit of the one and of the other, ſhould have ſuch an effect as any way to move the ſight of the Spectators, or make the <hi>Jews</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in that they had ſeen his Spirit deſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But granting all this poſſible, tho' this Illuſion ſhould have taken place with reſpect to the Gift of ſpeaking divers Tongues, yet men could not be deceiv'd in the Gift of interpreting them, and much leſs in all the other Gifts of the holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Add to this the conſideration of the <hi>Patience</hi> of the Diſciples, of their Holineſs of Life, their <hi>Charity,</hi> their <hi>Zeal,</hi> their unaffected way of expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their <hi>Self-denial, Sincerity</hi> and plain <hi>Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Methinks all theſe Characters put together, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and evidently convince us, that the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were plain, honeſt, ſincere Men, that had not in the leaſt any Deſign to impoſe upon us; ſo that this Truth needs no further Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>It may not however be amiſs, to remove ſome few ſmall Difficulties which may ſeem to oppoſe what has been ſaid concerning theſe miraculous matters of fact.</p>
                  <p>The firſt difficulty is to know how the Enemies of the Goſpel could be able to extinguiſh the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſo many extraordinary and miraculous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, which ſeemed ſufficient to convert all Mankind, or at leaſt thoſe Countreys where all thoſe things came to paſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:94927:123"/>
I anſwer, firſt, thoſe matters of fact were not in the leaſt ſtifled or concealed. They were ſo far from it, that they converted an infinite number both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that too in a very ſhort time. Secondly, there were ſeveral <hi>external</hi> Cauſes which very much contributed towards the weakning the Impreſſion they would otherwiſe have made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind. For firſt, the <hi>Elders</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> endeavour'd as much as they could to perſwade the People, that all thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> were nothing but the product of ſome <hi>Magick</hi> Power, or a kind of compact with the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe that were in Power were ſo much exaſperated againſt the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever reſolved to embrace his Doctrine, muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately prepare himſelf to be caſt into a Dungeon, or executed upon a ſcaffold. Nay, to undergo if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, any thing more ſorrowful and fatal than this. And becauſe nothing makes a greater Impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men than to ſee Puniſhments inflicted on others, all Parents ſtrictly charged their Children not to hold any Converſation with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> leaſt they ſhould ſee them end their days in the midſt of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Nay they were very cautious and ſtrict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in avoiding their Society: which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that keeping ſuch an extraordinary diſtance from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they ſhut their Eyes and ſtopped their Ears that they might not hear their Words, nor ſee the Miracles which they perform'd.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Doctrine of the Apoſtles was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Opinion the <hi>Jews</hi> had been prepoſſeſſed with, that they could not but hate and avoid it. For the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> became a ſcandal to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and was treated as a folly by the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Christian Religion</hi> putting an end to the bondage of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> then could not be converted to <hi>Chriſtanity,</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:94927:124"/>
without utterly renouncing what he always eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inviolable; nor could a <hi>Heathen</hi> believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> without looking upon that as profane, which he thought before moſt ſacred. Hence it is that the holy Scripture ſpeaks to us of the effects of the Goſpel attended with the power of the Holy Ghoſt, as of the <hi>Creation of new Heavens, and of a new Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we add to this, the extraordinary care the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Prieſts, and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of both Nations took to ſmother the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and the Weakneſſes and Paſſions of Men, who were unable to ſuſtain ſo much as the Idea of the torments that were invented, on purpoſe to hinder the progreſs of <hi>Chriſtanity:</hi> I ſay if we conſider this, we ſhall have no Reaſon to be any longer aſtoniſh'd at that which at firſt view ſo much ſurpriſed us.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, it may be asked why the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> among the <hi>Heathens</hi> never mention'd any thing of thoſe mighty Wonders of the Goſpel, which yet deſerved to have the moſt conſiderable place amongſt the many other Events they have ſo carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, That this Conſideration proves nothing againſt the truth of thoſe Matters of fact we have ſo firmly eſtabliſhed. Firſt, becauſe it is needleſs and extravagant to draw any further Conſequences from a Principle which proves more than enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. 'Tis true, the <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers ſay little or nothing concerning <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for they hardly knew his Name. <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſpeaks of him after this manner, <hi>Judaei tumultuati ſunt Creſto impulſore.</hi> But what then? Does it follow that becauſe <hi>Suetonius</hi> hardly knew the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that there was no ſuch Perſon as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or that he was not really cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Christus?</hi> The <hi>Heathen</hi> Authors you ſee relate not how ſeveral Chriſtian Churches were in a ſmall
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94927:124"/>
time ſettled at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> at <hi>Smirna,</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> &amp;c. But muſt it follow from thence, that there was no ſuch thing? Certainly if any matters of fact were true, this was undoubtedly true. I grant indeed, that the <hi>Miracles, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were all matters of fact that might be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, yet we may at leaſt affirm that the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe <hi>Christian</hi> Churches, compoſed of ſuch Men as believed all thoſe things, was a thing not to be doubted of. This was a matter of fact very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and remarkable. Yet it was not in the leaſt mention'd by the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of that Age, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Objection goes too far, it proves too much, and ſo conſequently proves nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, that the <hi>Historians</hi> of thoſe Times have ſo ignorantly treated of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Affairs, that we need not wonder they appear ſo little inſtructed in the Knowledge of what concerned the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom they ſuppoſed to have been a Sect belonging to the <hi>Jews.</hi> For if it appears that the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> thoſe Authors compoſed of them agrees not very well with the Goſpel of the Apoſtles, 'tis but comparing it with that of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and we may clearly ſee that it agrees no better with one than with the other.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Heathen</hi> Authors conſider'd the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion</hi> as a kind of <hi>Magick,</hi> and a deteſtable <hi>Superſtition,</hi> which aimed at the total Deſtruction of Mankind. It is certain that ſome Men earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make it paſs for ſuch, among thoſe who lived both in the Time of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and long after them; and it was very dangerous to give it any other Name. The World was divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Friends and Enemies of <hi>Chriſtanity:</hi> Thoſe who were the Friends of it, profeſſed it, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd not only by word of Mouth, but in Writing, what they knew concerning the Wonders of it. As
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94927:125"/>
for its Enemies, they neither had the <hi>Boldneſs, Power,</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> to write ofit as the former had done: They would not do it, leſt they ſhould wrong their own Cauſe, and diſhonour their own <hi>Religion:</hi> And they could not do it, becauſe they themſelves were not ſo well acquainted with the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Chriſtanity,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always been afraid to converſe with the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and eſteemed the Belief of thoſe Men a very ſorrowful and dangerous Perſuaſion; ſince by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their Religion, they were ſure of getting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Torments, and Death it ſelf. Laſtly, they durſt not preſume to write things as they really were, tho' they had been never ſo well acquainted with them; becauſe their own Writings would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of having embraced <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> a Crime which was ſo ſeverely puniſh'd in thoſe days, that it would unavoidably have brought upon them certain Death and Ruin, or at leaſt, after their Death, Shame and Infamy upon their Families.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, it may be asked why the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who had Power to heal the Sick, and raiſe the Dead, did not raiſe all the Dead to Life again, nor heal all the ſick that were in <hi>Judea,</hi> becauſe then all the World would have been forced in ſpite of themſelves to believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We anſwer, That this Queſtion is much like what the Murtherers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſaid to him upon the Croſs, <hi>He ſaved others, let him ſave himſelf, let him come down from the Croſs and we will believe in him.</hi> Nay it is all one as if a Man ſhould ſay, <hi>If there be a God, why does he not ſhew and manifeſt himſelf after a ſenſible manner, by ſpeaking to men immediately from the higheſt Heavens? and then they would all be forced in ſpite of themſelves to acknowledge him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But God does not deſire us to acknowledge him againſt our own Inclinations; and conſequently, he is not obliged to manifeſt himſelf as we in our extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94927:125"/>
Deſires would have him, but as it ſeemeth beſt to his infinite Wiſdom. Had <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> raiſed all the Dead they found to Life again, we ſhould then, contrary to the Deſign of the Almighty, have had no other Faith but what depended entirely upon our Senſes. It is enongh that they healed almoſt an infinite number of Sick People, and raiſed not only one, but ſeveral Dead Men to Life: So much indeed was abſolutely neceſſary to confirm the Truth of their Calling. Becauſe they were not only to make Men believe in a crucified Saviour, and adore him as <hi>the Son of God,</hi> but alſo to oblige them, for the Confirmation of their Faith, to undergo Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. More than this would have been but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, becauſe they were not obliged to alter the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Faith, but only to perfect it, not to make Men believe againſt their own Inclinations, but conformably to the Lights of their own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>But tho' I ſhould grant all theſe Difficulties to be greater than they really are; yet we ought to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Opinions by ſome Arguments drawn from matters of fact, and not on the contrary, regulate the Arguments drawn from matters of fact by any ſpeculative Opinions. And this is ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Maxim, that it holds good in all reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Many Difficulties aroſe at firſt about the Belief of the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> Some pretended that ſuch an Opinion was contrary to <hi>Reaſon;</hi> others affirmed, it could never be reconciled to the Principles of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> And both Parties raiſed ſeveral notable Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it. But as ſoon as the thing was evidently proved from undeniable matter of fact, all their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and Difficulties were turned into Ridicule.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have pretended to prove by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that <hi>Motion</hi> is impoſſible: But ſince we have daily Experience that there is ſuch a thing as
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94927:126"/>
                     <hi>Motion,</hi> we let theſe Philoſophers talk on, and chuſe rather to believe our own Senſes.</p>
                  <p>And I dare affirm (without begging any Excuſe for the Boldneſs of my Aſſertion) that there never were, nor never will be any matters of fact, againſt which we might not raiſe ſeveral plauſible Objections and conſiderable Difficulties that are meerly ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Some are daily raiſed againſt the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, againſt the Attraction of the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> with Iron, the Source or Head of the River <hi>Nile,</hi> againſt <hi>Comets</hi> and <hi>Meteors,</hi> nay even againſt the peopling of the World, and the Propagation of Mankind. We readily grant the Incredulous, that ſeveral conſiderable Difficulties may be raiſed againſt the Myſteries of <hi>Religion,</hi> as we ſee there are no leſs conſiderable ones daily raiſed even againſt the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and ſecret Operations of <hi>Nature.</hi> But I ſtill affirm, that we muſt renounce the Evidence of <hi>Senſe,</hi> if we prefer any Difficulties of meer <hi>Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> before thoſe Arguments which are taken from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable matters of fact.</p>
                  <p>Tho' we ſhould argue only upon the Nature of Things, and the Principles of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> it would appear, if we compare the Obſcurities which cauſe thoſe Difficulties, with the Evidences which clear them, that the latter would gain more upon our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief than the former; and this Truth we think we have ſufficiently proved in our firſt Part of this Work. But tho' we ſhould meet with nothing elſe but Difficulties in thoſe natural Principles, without any Lights at all to clear them, yet ought we to baniſh all Scruples and Doubts that ariſe meerly from <hi>Speculation,</hi> the better to embrace the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which proceeds from the Arguments drawn from undeniable matters of fact, unleſs we have a mind to be guilty of an Abſurdity not to be met with; which is wholly contrary to <hi>common ſenſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:94927:126"/>
But having thus evinced the Truth of the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of our <hi>Religion,</hi> namely, thoſe matters of fact contained in the Writings of the Apoſtles; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only, that we make Men further ſenſible of them, by laying down a few ſhort Remarks which we ſhall make on ſeveral places of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> whoſe whole Purport ſhall be either to perſwade us that the Apoſtles did really teach all theſe matters of fact, or aſſure us that they ſincerely believed the things which they declared, or elſe to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they could not have been impoſed upon in thoſe matters of fact. For from thoſe three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is formed the Demonſtration of the Truth of the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>

                        <hi>Now when Jeſus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, behold there came Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>In thoſe days came John the Baptiſt. <hi>In this Chapter</hi> John <hi>foretells the Deſtruction of the</hi> Jews <hi>in theſe Words,</hi> O generation of Vipers, who has warned you to fly from the wrath to come? and now alſo the ax is laid to the root of the Tree: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the fire, &amp;c. <hi>He foretells alſo the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, in theſe words,</hi> I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, &amp;c.

                     <p>Theſe three matters of fact have a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the Principles of our <hi>Religion,</hi> if they be true, as they will evidently appear to be to all who ſhall ſeriouſly conſider and reflect upon them. 'Twould be to no purpoſe to ſuſpect the Evangeliſt of having forged that prediction of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which he makes <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe that Goſpel was compiled long before that Event.</p>

He would be very extravagant that ſhould believe, that the Apoſtles led an ill courſe of Life, and plunged themſelves in all ſorts of lewd Debaucheries. Their Words, their Actions convince us of the contrary. Yet it may be ſaid that they were Villains indeed, if what they preached was falſe: But if they were downright plain honeſt Men, as their ſpeech neceſſarily evinces to us, then was their preaching alſo neceſſarily true.</p>

                           <hi>And without controverſy great is the mystery of Godlineſs; God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, believed on in the World, received up into glory.</hi> This myſtery can't be invented only by Humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, for ſeveral Reaſons. 1. Becauſe it is ſo great and ſublime, that Men tho never ſo learned and quick ſighted in other things, yet would never have been able to find it out of themſelves, barely by the Scrutinies of their Reaſon. 2. Becauſe they were only poor Fiſhermen that preached it. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſo ſublime and magnificent Object proceeds, if I may ſo ſpeak, from the Death and Sufferings of a Man, who was condemned and puniſhed with the moſt rigorous Puniſhments that could be thought of. For twas only after the Paſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the Diſciples went about preaching every where the wonderful works of God. 4. And laſtly, becauſe the contemplation of it depends upon <hi>Experience</hi> it ſelf; and altho this myſtery appears at firſt view infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exalted above the reach of our capacity, yet it muſt have been both ſeen and touched by the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. They certainly ſaw <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>beheld his glory as the Glory of the only Son of God, full of Grace and Truth.</hi> They ſaw with their Eyes that Fleſh in which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreally dwelt an intire fulneſs of the glorious God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:94927:154"/>
They were fully convinced of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary excellence of his Myſteries and the perfection of his Holineſs. They themſelves received the Gifts of that ſame Spirit in which God himſelf was juſtified. They ſaw Angels aſcending and deſcending to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto him. They preached it themſelves to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſo compelled the World to believe in him by their Patience and Preaching, which was continually attended with the Demonſtration of that Spirit and the Evidence of thoſe Miracles performed by them in the Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Laſtly he aſcended into Heaven in their ſight.

                  <p>HItherto we have inſiſted as it were upon the Shell and Bark of Religion; we have examined the proofs taken from matters of fact, being the firſt that offered themſelves to our mind: It ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now Expedient we ſhould diſcover as it were the <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and ſo proceed to thoſe other proofs drawn from the Nature of it, and that by ſhewing the truth of it by it's Beauties and proper Excellencies. But becauſe this is too copious a Subject for us who ſtudy Brevity, we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reduce what we have to ſay into as ſmall a Compaſs as we can; and ſince we cannot allow our Reflexions their due and proper Extent, to give at leaſt ſome Plan or Draught of the ſame, as ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that defect.</p>
                  <p>And tho the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> may be conſidered under ſeveral different Faces, becauſe in this reſpect 'tis like unto its Object, which has no Bounds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it's Extent; yet methinks we may give an Idea juſt and adequate enough to our preſent deſign, by conſidering it in eleven different Draughts or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures. I. In the Multitude of Teſtimonies given in favour of it; which we ſhall touch upon curſorily,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94927:156"/>
becauſe we have already partly examined them all II. In its eſſential <hi>oppoſition</hi> to all falſe Religions that ever were. III. In it's Effects, which can only juſtly be referred to a Divine and Supernatural Cauſe. IV. In the <hi>Purity</hi> of its end. V. In it's <hi>Suitableneſs</hi> to the Heart of Man, which it undertakes to reform. VI. In the <hi>Relation</hi> it has to the Glory of God, which it ſhould advance. VII.

                  <p>THough Teſtimonies be ſomewhat foreign and exterior to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may ſeem improper to diſcover the Perfection of it: Yet it will appear they do diſcover it, if we but carefully unite them together, and ſo conſider well their joynt union and agreement.</p>
                  <p>We can't but have a very great Idea of a <hi>Religion</hi> which the Wiſdom of God has been pleas'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm unto us by Nine ſeveral Teſtimonies, each where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would have been ſingly ſufficient to diſcover the Truth of it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is that of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who all teſtified of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by a long and continued ſeries of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94927:157"/>
                     <hi>Prophecies,</hi> ſome far plainer than the reſt; for ſome of the Prophets ſaw almoſt as clear in the Night (as I may ſo ſpeak) of ſhadows and figurative Types, as we can in the Day, of their exact accompliſhment, as has been already ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is that of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> ſo much the more certain becauſe it was foretold in the <hi>old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Diſciples continually refer'd the <hi>Jews</hi> to that Teſtimony; ſo much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, becauſe we can't ſuſpect <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> of having been guilty of any baſe complacency towards the <hi>Jews,</hi> or mean deſigns for his own Intereſt; The Wiſdom of God having been pleas'd to ſet him above ſuch Suſpicions, by the Auſterity of his Manners and his unuſual way of living, ſet down in the Goſpel with ſuch a ſtrange and particular Deſcription.</p>
                  <p>The third is that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> thoſe witneſſes, whoſe <hi>Conſtancy</hi> was tried by the ſevereſt Puniſhments inflicted upon them; yet they boldly reſiſted the Violence offered them by ſo many Torments they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd, Torments ſufficient to extort even from the greateſt Malefactors a confeſſion of their Crimes: Yet here is the difference between Them and common Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; that the latter are compell'd unwillingly to undergo the Torture, but the Diſciples of our Lord rejoyc'd in being thought worthy to ſuffer. Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors indeed know certainly they ſhall be executed, if they confeſs the Truth; but the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have had much more reaſon to fear Death, had they diſguiſed the Truth by any cloſe Deceit.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Teſtimony is that of the three Perſons which bare record in Heaven, the Father when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in <hi>Jordan,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> was <hi>his well beloved Son, in whom he was well pleaſed;</hi> and in another place, <hi>I have glorified him, and will glorifie him again:</hi> The Son, when he teſtified of himſelf by his <hi>Miracles:</hi> And the Holy Ghoſt, when he confirmed the Teſtimony of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:94927:157"/>
Son by the Effuſion of his extraordinary and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gifts upon the Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is that of the Conſcience of Men, which acknowledges freely that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our Fears, comfort us in our Afflictions, humble our Minds in the midſt of <hi>plenty,</hi> and ſtrengthen them in <hi>poverty;</hi> in a word, ſanctifie us by delivering us from our ſins; and ſo conſequently ſupply all our wants and neceſſities.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth is that ev'n of the Enemies of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> who have been forced to ſpeak favourably on our ſide. The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> have teſtified in our behalf, the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> and the convincing force of <hi>Truth</hi> having obliged them tacitly to own that Truth, againſt which they had declared themſelves ſuch inveterate and implacable Enemies. The ancient <hi>Jews</hi> believed that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <note place="margin">Gem. tract. San. Cap. 11.</note>

                     <hi>whom they hid their faces as from a Leper,</hi> was the true <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Nay, they are forced to have recourſe to the extravagant Fiction of a double <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and ev'n by that they pay a kind of homage to the Truth. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was ſhortly to appear in the World, as is evident by the diſcourſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with the Woman of <hi>Samaria.</hi> And this the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of, that ſome of them choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to own <hi>Herod the Great</hi> for the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> tho an <hi>Idumaean</hi> and wicked Prince, than renounce an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they were prepoſſeſs'd with, and which was ſo deeply rooted in their Minds. Others led away by the ſame Opinion, caſt their Eyes upon one <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:94927:158"/>

                  <p>But what ſhall we ſay of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who not being able to deny <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Miracles, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to refer them, ſome to a <hi>Magick</hi> Power, and others to a certain I know not what myſterious Pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word <hi>Jehovah.</hi> So ſtrange a thing it is that ev'n the very Enemies of our Religion ſhould thus teſtify of it, and yet ſcarce perceive it.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh <hi>Teſtimony</hi> is that of ſeveral ſtrange Events, which the Wiſdom of God ſo ordered that they firmly eſtabliſh the Truth of <hi>Christianity.</hi> Of theſe there are ſeveral very remarkable; but it ſhall ſuffice at preſent to mention Three only, which among the reſt deſerve a particular Conſideration; the Firſt is, the Deſtruction of the four <hi>Monarchies,</hi> which had ſorely afflicted and haraſs'd God's People, at the end of which the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Heaven was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:94927:159"/>
to be eſtabliſhed; the Second, the entire Deſtruction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Government, and the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Devaſtation of the holy Land, an Effect of the divine Wrath pour'd out upon that Nation; the Third and laſt, the Settlement of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, or the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> attended with ſo many Circumſtances as plainly ſhew that nothing but the hand of God could perfect ſo great a Work.</p>
                  <p>The Eighth is that Teſtimony given of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the Revelation of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And the Ninth that which is given of him by <hi>Natural Religion:</hi> But of theſe two Teſtimonies we ſhall not ſpeak at preſent, for as much as we deſign to end this Work with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Conſideration of them.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, 'tis plain the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> muſt be true, becauſe it was confirmed by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſo many authentick Perſons which can't be ſuſpected of Deceit: And it would be extravagantly ridiculous to imagine, that the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſhould have ſo clear an inſight into Futurity, meerly to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and authorize a Fiction; that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> having been at firſt taken by the <hi>Jews</hi> for the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſhould renounce the Honour which that Title would have conferred upon him, only out of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Complaiſance</hi> to an Impoſtor; that the <hi>Apostles</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Diſciples</hi> ſhould ſo readily ſacrifice their Eſtates, Reputation, Repoſe, and Life it ſelf to a Perſon they knew to be a falſe <hi>Christ;</hi> that the Heavens ſhould countenance a Flam and a Lye by working ſuch ſignal and ſenſible Miracles; that the Heart of Man ſhould have found every thing that can ſupply it's Wants and Neceſſities in a meer Cheat; that ev'n the Enemies of our Religion ſhould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and approve of our falſe Prejudices; that all Events ſhould ſo exactly coincide with an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impoſture; and that the Revelation of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Natural Religion</hi> ſhould thus teſtify ſo palpable a Fiction.</p>

To this we may add the Neceſſity and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> ſince the Wiſdom of God leads us to it by ſo many different ways; as alſo the admirable Perfection and Tranſcendency of it, ſince in a manner Heaven and Earth, the Time paſt and preſent, Events ordinary and natural, as well as thoſe ſupernatural and miraculous, ſince the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> who were altogether unknown to one another, have agreed unanimouſly to reveal it, and propoſe it to us as an Object for it's tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellency worthy of our greateſt Admiration.</p>

                  <p>ALL theſe Truths will more evidently appear, if we conſider the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in it's Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all other Religions.

along.

But certainly 'tis not Proſperity or Adverſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſimply conſidered, but Proſperity or Adverſity as foretold by God or his Prophets that is a certain Character of true Religion: And when we affirm that ſeveral extraordinary Events bear witneſs to the Truth of <hi>Christianity,</hi> we mean only thoſe Events which had been foretold by the Prophets; as for inſtance, the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian Church.

Religions that may deceive, but none but the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> that can truly ſatisfy Mankind.

                  <p>We need no deep ſearch, no great ſagacity or penetration of Mind to diſcover this Truth: For it is manifeſt that the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is not deſign'd for the ſatisfaction of the carnal and worldly Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of Men, as that of the preſent <hi>Jews,</hi> who aſpire only after temporal Proſperity and worldy Pomps: Nor is it a Monſtrous medly, like that of the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> made up of a ridiculous mixture of the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. Nor is it impious and cruel, like that of the <hi>Gnosticks;</hi> nor has it any of the Faults or extravagant Superſtitions of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion. But ſince we have not leiſure to oppoſe it particularly to all the Errors of other Religions, we muſt be contented to ſhew in this Compariſon, the advantages the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> has above all the reſt, by laying down the following Rules:</p>

Other Religions, as being principally of human Invention and Inſtitution, were formed by degrees from the different Imaginations of ſeveral Perſons who ſucceſſively made ſuch Additions or Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as they thought convenient.

                  <p>The Reaſon why Men uſually refer thus every thing to their Senſes, is becauſe a Worſhip that is corporeal and ſenſual is far more eaſie: It is much eaſier for a Man to take the Sun for a God, than to be continually taken up in ſeeking after a God that is inviſible; to ſolemnize Games and Feſtivals in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a pretended Deity, than to renounce himſelf for the ſake of a true one: 'Tis much eaſier for him to faſt, than to renounce his Vices; to ſing ſpiritual Songs, or bow to a Statue, than forgive his Enemies. It appears then, that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> bears a more excellent Character, in that it gives us for the Object of our Worſhip, not a God under an human Shape, but a God that is a Spirit, in that it teaches us to honour him, not with a carnal, but a Spiritual Worſhip. And this <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf has very elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told us in theſe Words, <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> John 4. 24. Who could fill his Mind with ſuch ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Notions? And how comes it that he ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſets down in that ſhort Precept the Genius of true <hi>Religion,</hi> of which Men before were wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant?</p>

It may be ſaid of all other Religions, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that they induce us to look after the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Profits of the World in the Worſhip of God; whereas the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> makes us glorify God by renouncing the World. Thus the <hi>Heathens</hi> deſigning rather to pleaſe themſelves than their Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, introduced into Religion whatever could any ways flatter and divert them. And the <hi>Mahumatan</hi> Religion not being Incumbred with many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, at leaſt affixes temporal Advantages to the Practice of its Worſhip; as if the Pleaſures of the World were to be the future Reward of Religion: But certainly both of them are much miſtaken; for the <hi>Heathens</hi> ſhould have known that the Worſhip of God conſiſted not in diverting and pleaſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> ſhould not have been ignorant, that ſince temporal and worldly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages were inſufficient in themſelves to ſatisfy the boundleſs Deſires of Man's Heart, they could not come in Competition with thoſe Benefits which true Religion had peculiarly deſigned for him. But both theſe follow'd the Motions of <hi>Self-love,</hi> which being naturally held in ſuſpenſe between the World and Religion, imagins that nothing can be more pleaſant than to unite them both, thinking thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile its Inclination and Duty, conſecrate it's Pleaſures, and put no difference between Conſcience and Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>But the firſt Rule of true Religion teaches us, that that mutual Agreement is impoſſible; or, to uſe it's own Words, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi> are incompatible one with the other; that we muſt either glorify God at the expence of worldly Pleaſures, or poſſeſs the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the World with the Loſs of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And this certainly ſhews the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to have a Divine Character.</p>

Other Religions made us depend upon thoſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which were given us to command; and ſaucily pretend a Power over that ſupream Being upon whom we ought wholly to depend.

But 'tis no wonder that Men ſhould be ſo impious, as to deſire to become Gods, ſince they were ſo baſe as to forget that they were Men; and yet how ill their Pride became them when they diſdain'd not to ſubmit to the four-footed Beaſts, to the Fowls of the Air, the creeping Animals and Plants of the Earth, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproaches them, and how baſely ſuperſtitious were they, in that they were not content to Deify themſelves, but would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Deify their own Vices and Imperfections?

Laſtly, Other falſe Religions were the irregular confus'd Productions of the politeſt and ableſt Men of thoſe Times; whereas the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is a wonderful Compoſition, which ſeems wholly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the moſt Simple and Ignorant ſort of People. The <hi>Heathens</hi> have often condemned the extravagant Notions the vulgar People had framed to themſelves of the Deity; they have blamed the barbarous <hi>Cruelty</hi> of thoſe Sacrifices which were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Gods in ſo many places, and the <hi>impurity</hi> of their Myſteries, the <hi>Falſhood</hi> of their Oracles, and the <hi>Vanity and Childiſhneſs</hi> of their Ceremonies. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays in ſome part of his Works, that two <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs</hi> could not look one another in the Face with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Laughter. And nothing can be more extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant than the Divinity of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who held that there are <hi>Inviſible Eternal Spirits,</hi> who mixing one with the other produc'd others. We all know that when Philoſophers took upon them to treat of <hi>Religion,</hi> they always exceeded one another in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no one, I dare ſay, is ſtill to learn what are thoſe Viſions and fabulous Stories with which the <hi>Rabbins</hi> filled their Traditions, the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of which would be very curious indeed, were it not ſo extreamly long. And tho we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own but that the <hi>Heathens,</hi> the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> &amp;c. made ſeveral wonderful Diſcoveries in Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: Yet it will appear that a long ſucceſſion of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry underſtanding Men among<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them were guilty of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94927:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many repeated Extravagancies in this reſpect, and that by a Prodigy not to be parallelled, did not the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> offer ſuch another, by ſhewing us a Company of Wiſe and Learned Men in ſuch Ignorant Perſons as the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly 'tis a ſtrange thing to ſee the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Men become the moſt ſtupid, and the moſt ignorant prove the moſt underſtanding in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Religion.</hi> 'Tis a true ſign that God deſign'd to confound the underſtanding of the VViſe, and a proof that their Religion was form'd rather accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the corrupt deſires of their Hearts, than the dictates of their Underſtanding. For had it been according to their Underſtanding, it would have been more reaſonable in proportion to the VViſdom and Knowledge of the Authors of it. But becauſe it was made to ſooth their corrupt Deſires and flatter their Paſſions, it is as extravagant and irregular as thoſe Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>And now let us put together all theſe Characters, and ask the Incredulous, whether they can be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant as to aſcribe to an Impoſtor a <hi>Religion</hi> ſo perfect in it's Original, that nothing could ever ſince be ſuperadded to it, but what neceſſarily leſſens the Perfection of it; a <hi>Religion</hi> that propoſes it's Myſteries with ſuch Authority and Boldneſs, that brings Men from <hi>Senſual</hi> Objects to <hi>Spiritual</hi> ones, that extirpates <hi>Corruption,</hi> reſtores the Principles of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs</hi> that were imprinted on our Souls; that teaches us to glorify God without any regard had to <hi>Self-love</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> to exalt God and humble our ſelves; to ſubmit our ſelves to his VVill, who is above us all, and to raiſe our ſelves above thoſe <hi>Beings</hi> that he has put in ſubjection under us; a <hi>Religion</hi> that is contrary to <hi>Policy,</hi> and yet more averſe to <hi>Corruption;</hi> that aſtoniſhes our <hi>Reaſon</hi> and yet gives us the peace of a good Conſcience; and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94927:166"/>
in a word, is as delightful to the one, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the other.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> then has all theſe Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as it certainly has, we cannot doubt but that it is directly as to theſe Qualifications oppoſite to all other <hi>Religions.</hi> And if it be thus oppoſite to all other <hi>Religions,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily have a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple oppoſite to them: So that as all other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons peculiarly belong to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertains to the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and as the former are the Products of the corrupt Deſires and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men, ſo the latter muſt have for it's Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the God of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Purity.</hi>

                  <p>WE may diſtinguiſh Four ſeveral kinds of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in which the Efficacy of Religion may be acknowledg'd, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a <hi>Natural,</hi> a <hi>Political,</hi> a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> and a <hi>Religious</hi> Society.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, the Society of <hi>Nature</hi> is innocent and equitable in it ſelf; but it cannot ſtand out a Trial with Men's irregular and diſorder'd Paſſions. Men will indeed be united among themſelves as long as they are concern'd only in indifferent matters; but <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> ſoon diſunites them: And therefore there is ſomething wanting to eſtabliſh and confirm it. As for the Society of <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> it is eſſentially ſinful; and therefore Self-intereſt, and Men's Deſires and Paſſions that form it, are either to be remov'd or regulated. A <hi>Political</hi> Society is ſoon violated by Law-ſuits, Wars, and Diſſentions; all which are occaſion'd too by the Paſſions. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port therefore and maintain it, ſuch Principles of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:94927:166"/>
                     <hi>Fidelity</hi> are to be eſtabliſh'd, as ſhall remain inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: All which is beſt done in a Society of <hi>Religion,</hi> the moſt perfect of them all, and as it were a Prop to the reſt: This Society muſt be firmly oppos'd to all accidental Revolutions, muſt unite thoſe Perſons together, whom the diſtance of Time and Place, and the diſparity of Intereſt would otherwiſe have for ever divided.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> reſtores the Society of <hi>Nature:</hi> For by uniting Men ſo ſtrictly in the Bond of <hi>Charity,</hi> it farther ſtrengthens that natural Love which we call <hi>Humanity.</hi> It deſtroys too the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> becauſe it extirpates ſuch inordinate Deſires as are not true Principles of <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> one among another. It alſo ſtrengthens <hi>Civil</hi> Society, by commanding us to obey our Superiours, and teaching us <hi>to render unto Ceſar, the things that are Ceſars, and unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> Laſtly, it eſtabliſhes ſuch a Society, as reſtores the Equality of Nature among us; and whereas there was in the World till the coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a Society of Men externally indeed united by the Bond of Civil Laws, Government, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Proximity of Blood, but internally divided by their irregular Paſſions, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhews us a Society of Men externally divided by the diſtance of Time and Place, and the diſparity of their Conditions, but internally united by the Bonds of the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> the ſame <hi>Hope,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Charity.</hi>

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:94927:167"/>
they were not of them; beſides, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> on all occaſions makes the very ſame Diſtinction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to own them for his Diſciples that ſhould be wholly taken up with the advantages of the World, and giving this Mark and Character of thoſe whom he owned for his, <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice; and the World hates them, becauſe they are not of the World,</hi> Joh. 17. 14. I ſay, beſides all this we have this Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that we can produce a Society of holy Men, that yielded not to any Powers of the World, but withſtood the moſt rigorous Trials of Perſecutions, and renounced the enticing Charms of the World, the better to adhere to the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> A <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> victorious in Temptations, that overcame Vices, and deluded the indefatigable Endeavours of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; a <hi>Society</hi> compoſed of <hi>Mortal</hi> Men, yet not to be exſtinguiſhed by Death; that was ſubject to the Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi> yet encourag'd with motives Super-natural; that converſed in the World, yet deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed it; that was diſperſed in ſeveral different Times and Places, yet always united in the ſame Thoughts and Opinions; that was continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack't by different Paſſions, yet conſtantly ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: In a word, a <hi>Society</hi> that ſtill flouriſh'd in the midſt of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> increas'd the more, as often as it was defeated, and rais'd it ſelf out of it's own ruins. Certainly he muſt have read but little of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that is unacquainted with all theſe Truths, and he muſt be wilfully blind, and purpoſely impoſe upon himſelf, that acknowledges not the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of <hi>Religion</hi> in all thoſe wonderful Effects.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis properly in that <hi>Society</hi> of holy Men, or in the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf, that we ought to ſeek for the Fruits of Religion, for there we ſhall find the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thoſe ancient <hi>Prophecies,</hi> which promiſed to ſhew us <hi>the Sheep feeding with the Bear, and the Leopard with the Lamb,</hi> &amp;c.

could not be left in the midſt of it's Enemies without working ſeveral Wonders among them, which even thoſe Infidels were ſenſible of; ſo the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> cannot continue in the World, without producing ſuch remarkable Effects in it, which the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous themſelves cannot call in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>For let them tell us, if they can, how came the Oracles of the <hi>Heathens</hi> to be immediately ſilenced when the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> firſt preach'd the Myſteries of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and by what Power the Sound of thoſe Men being gone to the end of the World, made thoſe Oracles eternally ceaſe, which had ſo long foretold things to come, and ſo forc'd the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh</hi> Writers, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and others, to inquire into the Cauſe of that ſo ſudden and ſo unexpected Silence? For to object with <hi>Julian,</hi> that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Oracles have been alſo ſilenced, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes nothing; becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> foretold that the Gift of <hi>Prophecy</hi> ſhould ceaſe: But how appears it, that the Oracles among the <hi>Heathens</hi> declar'd they ſhould one day be ſilenced? The Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>Prophecies,</hi> being an everlaſting Proof of the Truth of our Religion, ſerves us inſtead of Perpetual Oracles: But what Accompliſhment of Prophecies confirms the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion?</p>
                  <p>No leſs wonderful an Effect of our Religion, was the abundance of <hi>Revelation</hi> which brought ſo many Superſtitious and Idolatrous Nations to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>true</hi> God. Hence came the World to be fill'd with Wiſdom by the preaching of ignorant Perſons, and the meaneſt <hi>Servants</hi> to have more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and rational Ideas of the Deity, than the moſt quick Clear-ſighted <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and that too by the Propoſal of ſuch a Doctrin as ſeems indeed to the Fleſh an Object of Scandal and Horror.</p>
                  <p>We cannot deny but that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> has the advantage of all others for having utterly
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:94927:168"/>
aboliſhed all thoſe Sacrifices wherein they offered the Blood of Men: Neither can we doubt but that this cruel and bloody <hi>Superſtition</hi> was ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in the World, ſince we find that the Holy Scripture reproaches the <hi>Jews,</hi> for having ſacrificed their Children to <hi>Moloch;</hi> and that <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> tells us in his Commentaries, that it was an ancient Cuſtom among the <hi>Gauls</hi> to offer Human Victims to their pretended Deities.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs indeed, the <hi>Romans</hi> had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſuch a barbarous and cruel Superſtition; but then I queſtion whether they did not ſtill retain ſome Spice of it in thoſe Spectacles they exhibited to the People, wherein they were extreamly pleaſed to ſee the Blood of their <hi>Gladiatours</hi> run down, who killed one another meerly to make them Sport: A Sacrifice ſo much the more impious, becauſe dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated rather to the unlawful pleaſure of Men, than the Honour of thoſe <hi>Beings</hi> they look't upon as Gods. And what but the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> could have aboliſhed all thoſe bloody Spectacles and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Divertiſements?</p>
                  <p>We have juſt reaſon to be ſurprized to think how licentiouſly that abominable Sin, uſually puniſh'd by God and Man with Fire, reign'd heretofore in the World; and we cannot without horror and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement reflect, how that the love of both Sexes ſeem'd equally grown common to Men; and that ancient Authors freely ſpeak of that kind of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery which our own Writers dare not ſo much as mention, leſt they defile their Writings. <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> is repreſented to us by ſome of them as being deeply ſmitten with the Beauty of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> (whoſe Panegyrick well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd thirty Years labour) ſtrangely blemiſhed his Reputation by that monſtrous Lechery: Which pretty well ſhews the juſt Grounds for St. <hi>Paul's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:94927:168"/>
to the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who ſays, that <hi>becauſe when they had known God, they glorified him not as God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo gave them up unto vile Affections,</hi> Rom. 1. 21. And indeed it was no inconſiderable ſervice the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> did Men, in partly aboliſhing and diſgracing ſo much that kind of deteſtable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, that we look upon thoſe to be no leſs than abominable Monſters, that ſeem any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> thoſe two Virtues ſo Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and neceſſary to Men, were ſo utterly unknown formerly, that their Names were ſcarce known in all the <hi>Pagan</hi> World. To what then do we owe the knowledge and Eſteem we have of thoſe two ſo excellent Virtues, but to the <hi>Religion</hi> we profeſs? Laſtly, 'twas by the means of this Religion that the Creature was again call'd a Creature, and God again called by his own Name, <hi>Jehovah.</hi> 'Twas this Religion that took away from <hi>Vice</hi> the name of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and reclaimed <hi>Virtue</hi> from the ſcandal of paſſing for <hi>Vice;</hi> reſtored right <hi>Reaſon</hi> to it's former Privileges, enlightned the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified their irregular and diſorderly Paſſions, and confounded their <hi>Avarice.</hi> And ſurely by all theſe divine effects you muſt neceſſarily perceive and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Divinity of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>

                  <p>IF the Effects of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> are truly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Characters of it, we may alſo affirm that it's End is truly anſwerable to it's Effects, it being manifeſt, there never was any ſo uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, ſo pure, ſo extraordinary, and ſo perfect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:94927:169"/>
For we cannot but acknowledge that it is the main End and Deſign of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> to check and mortify Men's irregular Paſſions, and reſtore the Principles of Righteouſneſs and Uprightneſs in them, which their Corruption had as it were Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd.</p>
                  <p>And it cannot be ſuppos'd this was the intention of the <hi>Devil,</hi> whom we conceive to be as a Spirit naturally averſe to the Good of Mankind; nor that of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> that aim at nothing elſe but to ſatisfy their Luſts; nor that of <hi>Nature,</hi> which is eaſily perſwaded, being byaſſed by the Pleaſures which <hi>Vice</hi> gives her a Proſpect of; nor that of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,</hi> which tends only to the reſtraining the Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of all external Crimes, in as much as they violate and invert the Order of publick <hi>Society,</hi> but looks indifferently upon all Crimes that reſpect the Soul. Neither can it be the ſcope and deſign of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which is eaſily corrupted by <hi>Avarice;</hi> nor even that of <hi>Pride,</hi> which is mortified much more than all the other Paſſions by this Doctrin, unknown to the Fleſh, and inſufferable to <hi>Nature.</hi> Who then is it that concerns himſelf ſo much with <hi>Pride</hi> as to take away it's <hi>Errors,</hi> it's <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> it's <hi>chimerical</hi> Perfections; <hi>Preferences, Hypocriſy</hi> and <hi>Affectations,</hi> and all this only by a ſerious Conſideration of the divine Nature? Who takes upon him to deprive <hi>Self-love</hi> of it's <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of it's unlawful Pleaſures, and in a word, all human Paſſions of their Diſorders and Irregularities? What can ſuch a Deſign mean? And how could this Thought of ſanctifying Mankind enter of it ſelf into any Man's Mind?</p>
                  <p>We may juſtly therefore aſcribe this End and Deſign to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion:</hi> For it is certain it contains neither <hi>Exhortation</hi> nor <hi>Precept, Promiſe</hi> nor <hi>Threat, Hiſtory</hi> nor <hi>Prophecy,</hi> but what directly aims at
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:94927:169"/>
that very End. The Holy Scripture is not of the Nature of thoſe Books, that contain nothing but vain <hi>Speculations,</hi> or curious Enquiries; all thoſe of that kind were brought to the <hi>Apostles</hi> to be burnt, who returned no other Anſwer to thoſe that asked them, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> But this, <hi>Repent ye.</hi> They plainly declared that the Deſign of the Goſpel was to free Men from the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of their Sins; and their Example ſhews us as much. For what other Deſign could they have had in renouncing every thing, and enduring all Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, but to perſwade other Men they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this preſent World? Beſides, whether they ſpeak, or write, they don't run out into vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts and Diſputes, the ordinary product of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mankind; but come immediately to their purpoſe, and inſiſt only on what is material and eſſential to it. Every particular in their Diſcourſes and Writings is <hi>practical</hi> and relating to the Perfection of <hi>Morality;</hi> ſo much they deſpiſe the Fineneſs of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and Subtilty of Human <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and propoſe only to themſelves the edification of Men. <hi>Theſe things write I unto you,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that ye Sin not,</hi> 1 John. 2. 1. But ſuppoſing them ſuch Deceivers as the Incredulous imagin; what was it to them whether we Sinned, or not? What injury would it have been to the Son of a <hi>Carpenter,</hi> tho the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> were diſſembling <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and diſhonour'd the Deity by their Traditions, and tho there had been Tables of Money-changers in the Court of the Temple? What was it to him, whether Sinners repented of their Sins, or not? Whether Men were <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Merciful,</hi> or thought they could appeaſe God only with vain Offerings? Whether the City that kill'd the <hi>Prophets,</hi> knew <hi>the things that belong'd to her Peace,</hi> or not? What could move him to ſhed Tears in ſuch abundance at the thoughts of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94927:170"/>
the approaching Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> A ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and effectual Proof indeed of his being very much concern'd for her Salvation. What would it have ſignified to a few poor deluded Wretches, whether the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had the Knowledge of the <hi>true</hi> God, or not? To a Company of falſe Witneſſes, whether Men were Cheats or Liars? To perſons o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and had in abomination every where, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men truly loved one another, or not? To the Victims of publick Hatred, whether Men were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God or not? To ſuch afflicted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate Wretches, whether other Men were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made ſenſible of a Divine Comfort, and of <hi>the Peace of God which paſſeth all understanding?</hi> Who can imagin that thoſe Men deſigned to be wicked, only to make us become honeſt? To deceive all Mankind on purpoſe to eſtabliſh a ſacred and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Law of <hi>Fidelity?</hi> To become the Enemies of their own Nation, to make us be in <hi>Charity</hi> with all Mankind? In a word, to eſtabliſh a Religion in the World that tends wholly to the Sanctification of Mankind, by the moſt ſignal Impoſture, and moſt heinous Crime that Men could be guilty of?</p>
                  <p>'Twould be <hi>strange,</hi> if ſuch wicked and deceitful Men, as the Incredulous imagin the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to have been, ſhould have the leaſt Thoughts of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying others: And 'twould be yet more <hi>ſurprizing</hi> if that Thought ſhould be ſo fixed in their Minds, as to become a full and perfect deſign of venturing and loſing all, to compaſs it. Nay, 'twould be next to a <hi>Miracle,</hi> if that Deſign ſhould be put in execution; and yet more, 'twould be an unheard of <hi>Prodigy,</hi> if a continual ſucceſſion of People ſhould adhere to the ſame Principles, and continue in the ſame diſpoſition of Mind againſt their own Intereſt, and in ſpite of the ſevereſt Perſecutions. Certainly we may confidently ſay, that Impoſture and Deceit
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94927:170"/>
never had ſuch a deſign, or, the like ſucceſs. For tho' <hi>ſelf-love</hi> may have hitherto made uſe of <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Falſhood</hi> to effect its own Deſires, without any regard had to <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> ſo indiſpenſably due to our Neighbour; it was yet never known, nor ever will be, that <hi>Charity</hi> made uſe of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and Deceit to bring about its Deſigns for the good of others, without the leaſt conſideration of its own Intereſt and Deſires. And to inſiſt further upon it, would be to endeavour to add <hi>Light</hi> to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and prove a thing that is already as clear as Noon-day.</p>

                     <hi>V. Portraiture of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as it is Conſidered in it's <hi>Suitableneſs</hi> to the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mankind.</head>
                  <p>WE cannot ſeriouſly reflect upon our ſelves, without immediately diſcovering our own <hi>Weakneſs, Miſery,</hi> and <hi>Corruption:</hi> Neither can we look upon the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> without acknowledging that it was peculiarly deſigned to free us from thoſe three Imperfections inherent in our Nature.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Corruption</hi> of Man, it may be ſaid that it was the only thing in the World that Men moſt knew, and yet at the ſame time were moſt ignorant of: For the effects of it were palpable and evident to the Senſes. It was eaſily believed, that Men were very wicked and corrupt, when it was ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen that they committed ſo many enormous Crimes: But Men were ſtill ignorant that there was a general Depravation from Nature in the Heart of every Man, that diſpos'd him to the ſtrangeſt Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities; and it has ſo happened that Men have made no great Reflexion upon the Nature of that Original Depravation ſo incident to Mankind,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94927:171"/>
that it continually attends them from the Cradle to the Grave. They only concern'd themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what was external, without ſearching into the bottom of their Hearts and Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> gives us in that reſpect all neceſſary light: It teaches us that we are <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi> and that that Corruption proceeds from our ſelves: It ſhews us the extent of it, and confirms what the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> taught us, <hi>That all fleſh had corrupted his way,</hi> Gen. 6. 12. It ſhews us that that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption makes us ſubject to the Curſe of God, and that <hi>we are by nature the children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. It aſſures us that that Original Corruption has ſuch power over Man's Heart, that it moves all the Faculties of his Soul, ſo that <hi>every imagination of the heart of man is only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. Laſtly, It ſhews us how impoſſible it is for Man ever to recover himſelf of that Malady ſo inveterate and deeply rooted within him; and that by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him to us as one that is <hi>lame,</hi> that has a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> that is <hi>dead</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Life, Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> all which Truths we know too well by Reaſon and Experience.</p>
                  <p>How comes it then that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> teacheth us ſuch things as were ſo generally unknown to Mankind? Above all, how comes it to ſhew us ſo diſtinctly the true Principle of our own Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Who taught the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> that <hi>Self-love</hi> is the true Source and Original of all our Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? And why does he make Man to become an Enemy to himſelf?</p>
                  <p>Yet the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> not only teaches us to <hi>know</hi> Man, and thoroughly to ſearch into all his Frailties, but alſo that alone furniſhes us with ſuch Remedies, as can cure all his Weakneſſes and Imperfections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:94927:171"/>
For we can't ſee that any thing elſe can do it. Not <hi>Education,</hi> which is as often <hi>evil</hi> as <hi>good;</hi> not the <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> whoſe buſineſs is only to regulate outward actions; Nor the <hi>Law</hi> in general, which inſtead of removing, rather increaſes this Original Corruption, being in that reſpect like a <hi>Bank</hi> which cauſes the Flood to ſwell; Not the <hi>Decorum</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among Men, which uſually varies according to the diverſity of Countries; Nor the Reſpect we commonly have for our ſelves, a thing too thin and <hi>metaphyſical</hi> not to ſubmit to the <hi>Senſe</hi> of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; Not <hi>Reaſon</hi> it ſelf, which the Paſſions ſo eaſily corrupt; Nor the Example of <hi>Men,</hi> who commonly lead a very irregular life; Not worldly <hi>Honour,</hi> which regards only external Pomp and Grandeur; nor Laſtly, <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which wants motives ſufficient to effect it: or if it has any, it derives them all from our own <hi>Pride.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Muſt we then have recourſe to the <hi>Virtues</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion in the World? we may eaſily perceive that they are only <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> differently manag'd according to the various Turns and Affairs, ſince they have no other Motives but what they have from the World.</p>
                  <p>The Falſhood of Human <hi>Virtues</hi> is a thing not to be diſputed. We all know that <hi>Self-denial</hi> is only a piece of nice delicate Intereſt; <hi>Liberality,</hi> a meer Trade of <hi>Pride,</hi> which values no Gifts, provided it have the Glory of being liberal; <hi>Modeſty,</hi> the Art of concealing our <hi>Vanity; Civility,</hi> but an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Preference of other Men before our ſelves, to conceal how much we really value our ſelves above all the world; <hi>Baſhfulneſs,</hi> but an affected Silence in thoſe things which our <hi>Luſts</hi> make us think of with pleaſure, the <hi>deſire</hi> of obliging other Men, but a <hi>ſecret</hi> deſire of obliging our ſelves by getting them to befriend us another time; juſt as <hi>Impatience</hi>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:94927:172"/>
to acquit our ſelves of an Obligation, is but a <hi>Shamefacedneſs</hi> for having been too long behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others for ſome Favour received. So that all theſe Virtues in general are ſo many Guards <hi>Self-love</hi> makes uſe of to prevent our darling and ſecret <hi>Vices</hi> from appearing outwardly. What Remedy then can be brought for the Irregularities of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, the pernicious Poyſon of which ſecretly inſinuates it ſelf ev'n into our Virtuousactions? And who can cure ſuch a Diſtemper, when the Remedies applied to it are rather a Diſeaſe than a Cure?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Experience</hi> ſhews us, that by effectually reſiſting one Vice, we often confirm and eſtabliſh another. Would you deſtroy <hi>Avarice?</hi> you muſt attack it by ſuch Arguments as neceſſarily flatter <hi>Pride.</hi> And is <hi>Pride</hi> to be overcome? it muſt be impugn'd by ſuch Motives as encourage <hi>Avarice.</hi> In vain ſhall you ſtrip <hi>Self-love</hi> of all it's pleaſing Objects and Allurements; ſtill it will endeavour to ſecure it ſelf either by contemning the Goods of <hi>Fortune,</hi> or by ſhewing it's Moderation in patiently enduring Diſgraces. <hi>Self-love</hi> when ſeated on the Throne, makes <hi>Tyrants;</hi> when reduc'd to Want and Poverty, it makes <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who deſpiſe every thing they can't enjoy. It oft indeed changes it's Object, but not it's Diſpoſition. It's <hi>Pride</hi> (as I may ſay) out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives its own Death, and not being able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it's periſhing it would ſeem to look pleaſantly upon its Downfal, and as it were triumph in it's own Ruin. Who then can give this <hi>Hydra</hi> it's Deaths wound, when the lopping off one Head, ſerves only to give riſe to another?</p>
                  <p>It is certain therefore that nothing can remedy this <hi>Corruption,</hi> unleſs it be more <hi>conſtant</hi> than the Principles of <hi>Education,</hi> more <hi>infallible</hi> than the Rules of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Civility,</hi> more <hi>holy</hi> than the Civil Laws, which require only an outward Purity,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:94927:172"/>
and conſult the exterior Good of publick Society? more <hi>powerful</hi> than all worldly Honour which regards only Pomp and Renown; more <hi>Effectual</hi> than all worldly Motives, which are unable to ſubvert thoſe Paſſions, the Vanity of which they flatter; more <hi>ſtrong</hi> than a vain and fruitleſs <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which pretends to free <hi>Man</hi> from his Miſery by annihilating him, and has no other Motives but what proceed from the greateſt of our Imperfections, our <hi>Pride.</hi> The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> alone has all theſe Advantages, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is alone ſuitable to the Neceſſities of Man.</p>
                  <p>It is that which purifies the very Bottom of our Conſciences, by ſhewing us that it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to cleanſe the Outſide of the Cup and the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It reforms our Principles, by making a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Intereſt give place to an Eternal one, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing the deſire of an <hi>imaginary</hi> by the hopes of a <hi>real</hi> Immortality. It propoſes to us an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Rule and a true Model of Perfection to go by. It informs us that we have both a Judge and a Witneſs of all our actions, who diſcovers us, tho' in the Dark, and cover'd as it were with a Cloud; whoſe piercing Eye ſees through all our Pretences and Diſguiſes, who forces us to know our ſelves, to combat and mortify our Deſires; and that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are ſeen or not ſeen, whether the World approves or condemns our Actions; God being Eſſentially independent from all <hi>outward</hi> Objects, and not limited by any exteriour Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>And indeed what but ſuch an infinite Deity could have ſupplied us with ſuch a Remedy, ſo effectual, and ſo ſuitable to all our Wants and Neceſſities? For <hi>Miſery</hi> and <hi>Wretchedneſs</hi> are the portion of our <hi>Corruption;</hi> and he that cannot ſhake off the latter, will certainly always be ſubject to the two former.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it ſufficient to ſay that <hi>Man</hi> is miſerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We may add that he is in ſome meaſure the very
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:94927:173"/>
Center of Miſery. We ſee that whilſt all other Animals peaceably enjoy thoſe good things <hi>Nature</hi> has allotted them, Men ſeem to be in ſome reſpect mark'd out for Miſery by the hand of Divine Juſtice; they are equally diſſatisfied as well with what they poſſeſs, as what they poſſeſs not: They are terrified with the <hi>Idea</hi> they have of Death; tormented with the conſideration of <hi>Futurity;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted that they are unable to fix Time, which bears them away with it as it rolls on; Miſerable for what they know, or rather for not knowing more; mortified and diſappointed in their Deſires, tormented with Remorſes, affronted and injured by their Fellow-Creatures, and harraſs'd by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Inquietudes of their Heart: In a word, they enjoy Peace and Tranquility no longer than they can deceive themſelves with a Scene of <hi>imaginary</hi> Bliſs, and frame to themſelves falſe Ideas of their preſent Condition.</p>
                  <p>And this deſire of impoſing thus upon our ſelves, in fancying our Happineſs greater than it is, makes us vainly imagin we ſhould be leſs miſerable, if we were in the condition of thoſe that are far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us. But <hi>Experience</hi> ſoon undeceives us, and ſhews that the diſtant Proſpect of Honour and Riches gives more pleaſure and delight than a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er poſſeſſion of them; and that the Hope of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them makes us more truly happy, than their Fruition; which excellently ſhews us the <hi>Emptineſs</hi> and <hi>Inſufficiency</hi> of all ſuch temporal Advantages.</p>
                  <p>Nor do we think it enough to deceive our ſelves in reſpect of our Condition, but endeavour alſo to deceive others by making them entertain a vaſt Idea of our Merit, or our Happineſs; and through a certain <hi>Weakneſs</hi> to be pitied, we afterwards make uſe of that <hi>Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> we have acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally and unawares extorted from others, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:94927:173"/>
more effectually upon our ſelves, and enlarge that <hi>Chimerical</hi> Idea of our own Perfection, which <hi>Self-love</hi> entertains in our Breaſts with ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and ſatisfaction. Who then can direct our Minds, or clear our Undeſtanding in this inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable and continued Maze of Illuſions and Errors, the falſe Principles of a falſe Satisfaction? And who can find Remedy for ſo great a Miſery? Since bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring us acquainted with it, would ſerve only to increaſe it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> then having the Character of performing all this, is certainly a Religion truly Divine; and is it not ſtrange that it ſhould make Man happy by teaching him how to know Himſelf, and to remove his Miſery by ſhaking off his <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> eſpecially when that Ignorance is the cauſe of his Tranquility and Satisfaction? Yet we ought not to wonder at it, ſince Religion gives us a new Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of things, and much different from what we ever had before. It makes us patiently endure Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, by diſcovering to us the Cauſe and Deſign of them. It comforts us in all our ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Diſgraces, by aſſuring us that nothing can come to paſs without the Diſpenſation of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, who turns all things to our advantage: It humbles us in Proſperity, and ſupports us in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: It eaſes the Troubles of our Heart, by calming our Paſſions: It ſtrengthens us againſt the Fear of Death, by teaching us to conſider it as a Paſſage to a far better Life: It comforts our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences by it's Promiſes: It continually attends us in all Times, in all Places; and in all Dangers, ſtrengthens us; in our Solitude hinders us from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into deep Melancholy and Sorrow, when we conſider our ſelves, and what ſhall be our <hi>future</hi> State; and Laſtly, comforts and chears us upon our Death-bed, where alone it ſerves us indeed inſtead
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94927:174"/>
of all things, when the Charms of <hi>Self-love</hi> are at an end, and the Scene of the World begins for ever to vaniſh out of our ſight. And truly we muſt be wilfully blind, if we perceive not the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Religion, which at once ſhews us ſo well our own Miſery, and gives us ſuch excellent Remedies for all the Imperfections of our Nature.</p>
                  <p>Nor does it leſs enlighten our Underſtanding in reſpect of our Wretchedneſs, another Conſequence of our Corruption. For is not Man ſtrangely wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contemptible, when in his own natural State, he neither knows what he himſelf is, nor what he ſhould be, but is continually taken up with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns unworthy his Nature; full of Projects and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but of a Moment's concern; unable to bear long the conſideration of himſelf, and incapable of living without the help of Others?</p>
                  <p>Yet to ſpeak the Truth, it muſt be confeſs'd that there are ſuch <hi>Sentiments</hi> implanted in Man that plainly diſcover ſome Greatneſs in him, even through his <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthineſs.</hi> His Mind indeed is often taken up with the meaneſt Objects; yet can't be ſatisfied with the conſideration of the greateſt: He cannot ſubſiſt without other Men's help; yet endeavours to be eſteem'd by all, deſiring to diffuſe himſelf every where by a ſort of <hi>Immenſity,</hi> which he derives only from the Author of his Being. He is buried as it were in the Cares of this Life; yet ſince he finds every thing in it diſproportionable to his Nature, his Thoughts aſpire to <hi>Eternity;</hi> and tho perhaps he is ignorant of any <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> one, he frames at leaſt an <hi>imaginary</hi> one to himſelf, and would feign out-live his Days in ſpite of Death, by immortalizing himſelf in the remembrance of Men. Who then can reconcile Man to Himſelf? How come ſuch lofty Sentiments to be joyned with ſo much Wretchedneſs and Miſery? Or why ſhould a
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:94927:174"/>
Being ſo <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> have ſuch great and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Notions?</p>
                  <p>If we conſult the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> we ſhall ſoon be ſatisfied in this Point. For the firſt Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it will ſolve all the ſeeming Riddles. It will teach us that Man conſiſts of two Parts, <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> whoſe qualities and parts are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: The Body makes him a Member of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> World, from whence he derives his Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Miſery: In his <hi>Soul</hi> he bears the Image of God, which is the Foundation of his real Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>If the Mind be ſubject to <hi>Matter,</hi> we ſee only his Imperfections, and find nothing but a <hi>Senſitive</hi> Man in him; but if the Body be wholly ſubject to the Soul, then only the Greatneſs and Glory of the Soul appears; and we find a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Man in him. Whatever therefore may be ſaid concerning the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of Man, becomes an incredible Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox if applied to his outward and carnal part: And whatever may be ſaid concerning his Imperfection and Unworthineſs, will be utterly falſe if applied to him as a <hi>Being</hi> glorious and purely <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in our preſent State the Soul and Body are in a continual War: Sometimes the <hi>Excellence</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of Man's <hi>Nature,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthineſs</hi> of it appears, according as the <hi>Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> are predominant and this ſerves for a certain Rule to judge of Mans Perfection or Imperfection, that every thing is great and noble in him, that brings the Fleſh in ſubjection to the Spirit; and every thing ſeems vile and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that baſely brings the Spirit in ſubjection to the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>For what ſort of Greatneſs can we find in the latter? and wherein conſiſts the <hi>Excellence</hi> of his outward qualifications, by which alone he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:94927:175"/>
to procure the Eſteem of other Men? Not in the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of his Original, for that brings him but the nearer to his primitive Nothing, or to the Clay out of which he was firſt formed. He betrays his weak Judgment in eſteeming ſo much the Original of his <hi>Body,</hi> and not regarding that of his <hi>Soul.</hi> As for the Goods of <hi>Fortune,</hi> they ſwell his Heart with <hi>Pride,</hi> and therefore he values himſelf more for what he enjoys, than for what he really is. Suppoſe him a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> or if you pleaſe, <hi>Lord of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe;</hi> But alas that can be of no great continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. His <hi>Reaſon</hi> indeed exalts him far above all other Creatures; but even that <hi>Reaſon</hi> is a Slave to his <hi>Scnſes;</hi> his <hi>Paſſions</hi> deject rather than elevate him: <hi>Ambition</hi> is a Weakneſs which makes him unable to rule his Deſires; <hi>Pride</hi> an Imperfection, which ſo poſſeſſes his Mind that he cannot paſs by the leaſt Affront to his Reputation; <hi>Avarice</hi> a baſe fear of future want, a limited Conſideration of <hi>Self-love,</hi> that forgets it ſelf, to think better upon what is leaſt valuable in its condition; The <hi>Punctilios</hi> of Honour, a vain Imperfection, that makes an Idol of it ſelf; That <hi>Valour</hi> which affronts Death, nothing but a Mans ſtrangely forgetting himſelf, and being inſenſible of the Dangers that ſurround him: And Laſtly, all the <hi>Paſſions</hi> but ſo many Deviations from the End we ought to purſue; ſo many Diſorders and Irregularities of the <hi>Soul,</hi> as appears fully by what we have ſaid elſewhere concerning the End for which Man was orginally deſigned.</p>
                  <p>And tho' theſe be all <hi>Moral</hi> Truths, they are not the leſs certain. Experience confirms them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

miſerable a Creature was not deſigned for ſuch a glorious End as we imagin.</p>
                  <p>But let them only conſider how truly great <hi>Man</hi> is, when he ſubmits the Luſts of the Fleſh to the Rule of the Spirit, and they'll be aſham'd of their falſe Opinions: They'll find him indeed a <hi>Being</hi> that had a Beginning, but yet one that glories in God as the Author of it: They'll find him an <hi>Atom</hi> that raiſes it's ſelf above all other Creatures, by running back to it's firſt Author, and paying him Homage for it's Unworthineſs: A <hi>Worm</hi> that has the Honour of referring it's ſelf to the Glory of God, to which alſo all other <hi>Beings</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, but without knowing it. They'll find him a <hi>Being</hi> that is indeed Mortal, carries it's Hopes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Death: A Being that is finite; yet it's Deſires and Intentions are unlimited: A ſmall <hi>quantity</hi> of Earth will cover his Body, yet nothing but <hi>Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> will ſatisfy his Soul: He poſſeſſes all things, for he calls himſelf the Son of him that created all things: He is not to be rank'd among thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which grow proud by promotion, or cannot be <hi>humble</hi> without debaſing themſelves. He is <hi>great,</hi> but not <hi>proud,</hi> becauſe he knows his Natural Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and he is humble, but not baſe, becauſe he is ſenſible of his true Greatneſs and Worth. He has made ſuch a <hi>Covenant</hi> with his God, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Body is not able to diſſolve. Tho' he conqers not Kingdoms, nor razes Cities, yet he is able to overcome thoſe Paſſions which have produced the like effects. He ſacrifices to God thoſe very Paſſions to which Men heretofore ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed all their Poſſeſſions: He eſteems not a Crown, and the higheſt Dignities are of no Value in his Thoughts: He quits a Throne to equal himſelf to Shepherds, and tho' but a Shepherd he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as great as the moſt powerful Monarch. What
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:94927:176"/>
the World admires, is but a Dream to him. Tho he enjoys the greateſt Titles, yet has he the ſame humble Thoughts of himſelf. Should the World afflict him on every ſide, it cannot leſſen his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf. He raiſes himſelf above what he ſees to humble himſelf in the ſight of God, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible: He poſſeſſes <hi>Eternity,</hi> tho he exiſts in Time: He is a Child of God, tho he lives amongſt Men: He is ſenſible of his Exaltation above all other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but he is truly Great in his own <hi>Humility.</hi> Thus the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> not only ſhews us Man's Excellence, but is alſo the Cauſe of it, by making the meaneſt part of our Nature ſubſervient to the nobler. He therefore that utterly renounces all Religion, loſes the perfection of his Nature; and the leſs he believes, the more he debaſes himſelf below other Creatures.</p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> alone that ſhews us the Cure as well as the Diſeaſe; that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces our hidden <hi>Virtues</hi> and unmasks our <hi>Vices;</hi> that diſcovers to us our Miſery, and frees us from it; that puts an end to all the Wretchedneſs of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by making us truly ſenſible of it; that makes us great by making us humble; that fits it ſelf to all the Conditions of Life, and ſatisfies all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of our Hearts. In a word, it is the <hi>Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that ſanctifies us, exalts us, and compleats all our Wiſhes; and tho <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> ſhould joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to contrive a more excellent one, and more ſuitable to our Wants and Neceſſities than this, 'tis certain they could never accompliſh their Deſign.</p>

                     <hi>VI Portraiture of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as it is conſider'd in the <hi>Relation</hi> it bears to the <hi>Glory</hi> of God.</head>
                  <p>IT is with the Deity as with the Sun, which being bright in it ſelf, diffuſes abroad it's Glory by it's Beams, and imprints upon the Clouds, or Waters, an imperfect Image of it ſelf; which Image tho it wants the full Splendor of it's Original, is yet <hi>pure, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and <hi>adorn'd</hi> with ſufficient Brightneſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                  <p>The Deity has an eſſential Glory, conſiſting in it's ſupereminent Virtues and infinite Perfections, to which nothing can be ſuperadded; and the Brightneſs of it is more than Man can bear. This Glory ſtreaming from the eternal Author of All things, diffuſes it ſelf abroad in all his Works, and forms out of the bright Efflux of thoſe Beams which ſtrike by reflexion upon us, and are united into the Heart of Man, an Image of that refulgent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Sun; which Image tho it has not all it's full, perfect, and dazling Splendor, is yet <hi>pure, bright, lively</hi> and <hi>tranſcendent.</hi> And this Glory is what we call the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> eaſily prov'd to be ſo, in that it refers it ſelf ſolely to the Glory of God, and is as it were a lively Image and Tranſcript of His Perfection, and Our Duty.</p>
                  <p>This Religion is alone capable of undeceiving Man, by removing thoſe falſe Notions, they had ſo long entertain'd of the Deity. This alone diſcovers the true Nature of God, removes all <hi>Symbols, Types, Shadows, material</hi> and <hi>ſenſible</hi> Appearances, under which he was Worſhip'd; all which were more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to diſguiſe, than diſcover the true Nature of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:94927:177"/>
the Deity. It gives us ſome inſight into that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by aſſuring us that God is <hi>inviſible;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves him from our <hi>Senſes,</hi> to make him the Object of our <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis this Religion alone that diſcovers that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſel of God, ſo full of Mercy and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, <hi>that he ſent his Son into the World, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> 'Tis this alone that glorifies God in his Attributes, and ſhews diſtinctly their infinite Perfection. By this alone we are taught that God governs all things by his Providence; that he makes Evil it ſelf inſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It teaches, us not only that we are bound to Worſhip God and ſerve him, but aſſures us alſo that this was the End of our Creation. It teaches us to ask of him, above all things, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Glory, and to begin our Petitions with this Form, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name; Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come; Thy Will be done.</hi> It requires of us that we ſhould glorify him, not only with our Lips, or barely by our ſpiritual Songs, but with all our Thoughts, Words, and Works. It ſhews us, that there is no <hi>Creature</hi> but what is under his Providence; no Sin but what may fall under his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> no Sinner but what may experience his <hi>Mercy;</hi> no motion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to <hi>

                  <p>It diſcovers to us ſuch <hi>Miracles</hi> as glorify his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power, ſuch <hi>Events</hi> as clearly manifeſt the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Providence, ſuch <hi>Benefits</hi> as evince his Goodneſs and Mercy; and it allows all his Divine
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:94927:177"/>
Attributes (a thing before unknown to Man) their juſt Extent, that is, an Extent without Limits. Now from whence can proceed thoſe Ideas we have of the <hi>Eternity</hi> of God, of his <hi>Immenſity, Omnipotence,</hi> his <hi>infinite</hi> Knowledge, and <hi>Immutability,</hi> &amp;c. but from this Divine Religion?</p>
                  <p>No other Religion could at once elevate both God and Man. It ſhews us how admirably Man is united to God, and God to Man. It alone induces us to ſubmit our Will to God, to acquieſce without any murmuring to the Decrees of his Providence, and to direct all our Deſires and Affections to him as our <hi>ſupream</hi> Good. Men indeed heretofore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to honour their Deities by Offering Beaſts as a Sacrifice: But was it ever known before, that they were to glorify God by the Sacrifice of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? And what other Religion but this, could incite Men to Offer ſuch a Sacrifice, in which there ſeems to be ſo much Pain and Reluctance?</p>
                  <p>Certainly, unleſs we wilfully blind our Selves, 'tis a thing incredible that we ſhould not perceive; that the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is as it were a pure and ſpiritual Communion between the Perfections and Attributes of God, which make Man ſenſible of their effects; and the <hi>inward ſenſe</hi> of Man's Heart, which glorifies God. Neither <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> Neither the <hi>World, Nature,</hi> or <hi>Education,</hi> were forcible enough to produce ſo great and ſublime an Effect; and this can be the Work of none but him, who perfectly knew the agreement of all things, and was certain that our Hearts were wholly made for the Glory of God, and that the Sentiments of his Glory were to be imprinted in our Hearts only by the help of Religion.</p>

                  <head>VII Portraiture of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>as it is conſidered in its</hi> Morality.</head>
                  <p>WEre we never ſo little acquainted with what paſſes within us, we ſhould not only find that the two principal Faculties of our Soul, the <hi>Senſitive,</hi> and <hi>Intellectual</hi> Apetite by conſent alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deceive one another; but we ſhould alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it is almoſt impoſſible to undertake to rectify the one, without increaſing the Diſorders of the other.</p>
                  <p>If by the Knowledge of thoſe things we were before ignorant of, we remove the Darkneſs of our Underſtanding, we uſually then grow proud of our Learning: And if we ſatisfy our Deſires by ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Paſſions, we often cheriſh the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principles of Errour and Prejudice that obſcure the Light of the Underſtanding. And 'tis a Truth but too well experienced, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which enlightens the Underſtanding, often corrupts the Heart; and a Sin indulg'd in, which ſatisfies the Heart corrupts the Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>And this is the cauſe of the ill Succeſs thoſe Men have met with, who endeavour'd to regulate the Deſires of <hi>Man.</hi> For ſome obſerv'd not the Dictates of Right Reaſon, in being too indulgent to their Paſſions, as the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who making Pleaſure the only End of Man, debaſe him to a Brute to render him more happy. Others were puff'd up with a kind of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Pride in aſcribing the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of too many things to their Reaſon; ſuch were the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who forgot that they were Men, becauſe they had ſuch a deep penetration of Mind, and attempted to exalt Man above himſelf, by infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating him with the Conceits of his own Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:94927:178"/>
But God, who knows beſt what Remedies are moſt proper for us, has given us a Religion which ſatisfies the <hi>Heart,</hi> without corrupting the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> and enlarges the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> without corrupting the <hi>Heart;</hi> and that becauſe it ſatisfies, and yet mortifies; it enlightens, and yet confounds the Underſtanding. If to the Underſtanding ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral great and ſublime Truths are revealed, it has not therefore any pretence to exalt it ſelf; becauſe it knows that Knowledge to be above its Capacity, and ows it only to <hi>Revelation.</hi> If the Heart finds the Objects of <hi>Religion</hi> anſwerable to it's infinite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, it has no reaſon to be puffed up by them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Objects deſtroy its darling Paſſions and vitious Inclinations. So that the only means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, and at the ſame time humble our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, was to intermix ſome Obſcurity with the Light of Revelation; and the only way to ſatisfy the Heart, and prevent its being puffed up, was to qualify ſome ſorrowful and mortifying Duties with the extraordinary Promiſes of the Goſpel. Thus the Severity of Chriſtian <hi>Morality,</hi> and the Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its Myſteries are two different means which God has made uſe of to enlighten the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without puffing up the Heart, and to ſatisfy the Deſires of the Heart without flatering thoſe Paſſions which corrupt the Underſtanding. Which manifeſtly ſhews, that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> has not only the Divine Stamp upon it, ſince it contains the true manner of reforming and regulating the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of Mans Heart; but alſo that the Severity of the <hi>Chriſtian Morality,</hi> and the Difficulty of its <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,</hi> which ſhock the Incredulous moſt in the Principles of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> were purpoſely made uſe of by God in his eternal Wiſdom, as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means to ſanctify Mankind, which is the grand Deſign of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>

We have then here the Two moſt eſſential and moſt important parts of our Religion, Its <hi>Morality,</hi> and <hi>Myſteries:</hi> The latter are neceſſary in reſpect of Faith, and the former is the Rule of thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which God is pleaſed we ſhall perform, as a Means to attain Everlaſting Life. It would be ſuperfluous to lay down here at large, what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin or Precepts are contained in the Goſpel, becauſe it has pleaſed God that we cannot pretend any Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of them; and beſides, 'tis the Truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in general we are now treating of; we are oblig'd to ſpeak here only of <hi>Chriſtian Morality,</hi> and the Doctrin of Faith in general.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Morality</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> it has ſo many remarkable Characters, that it is impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon any of them, without immediatly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging its Divinity.</p>
                  <p>For, I. 'Tis it ſeems a Paradox to the <hi>Senſes,</hi> to the <hi>Heart,</hi> to the <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of Man. It was never before heard of or known, that a Man muſt <hi>take up his Croſs,</hi> and think thoſe <hi>Bleſſed that are poor in Spirit;</hi> that <hi>mourn, and are perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake;</hi> that we muſt <hi>love our Enemies,</hi> and <hi>pray for them that ſhall revile and perſecute us;</hi> that we muſt not only comfort our ſelves in the midſt of our Afflictions and Croſſes, but alſo <hi>rejoyce</hi> for being thus afflicted, and eſteem our Happineſs and Glory the greater, as our Sufferings are increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Men, I ſay, had never ſuch Thoughts before; and the Puradoxes of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> are nothing to theſe; for here we find, to our great ſurprize, that a few poor Fiſhermen, ruſtick in their Speech, preach ſuch Maxims abroad as are as far above the ordinary Capacity of the Underſtanding, as they are contrary to the Affections and Inclinations of the Heart.</p>

II. 'Tis obſervable, that <hi>Chriſtian Morality</hi> ſeems to be a very ſad and mortifying thing. For it curbs and reſtrains all our Paſſions: <hi>Self-love</hi> repines at it: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oluptuouſneſs</hi> can't endure it. <hi>Pride</hi> is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled and mortified by it; and thoſe who ſeem to allow of it moſt, cannot but privately hate it, when ever their Hearts are engaged in any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It has been often obſerv'd, that there have been <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all Ages, who attempted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſenſe of it, by putting ſuch Gloſſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations upon it as were more conformable to their Inclinations, than to the Truth it ſelf; and by endeavouring to extirpate it at leaſt indirectly, when they durſt not attempt it in a more open man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But let no man imagin that this <hi>Morality</hi> was offered to the World under any Diſguiſe. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who among ſo many other wonderful Characters of his Calling, has a very remarkable one, and that is, never to flatter the looſe Inclinations of Men, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares, that whoſoever will be thought his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, muſt <hi>pluck out his Eyes,</hi> and <hi>cut off his Hands;</hi> muſt <hi>hate himſelf, deny himſelf,</hi> nay even <hi>hate his own Soul,</hi> &amp;c. Expreſſions which explain one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and certify us that the Pains and Torments the obſervers of his <hi>Morality</hi> muſt undergo, are like unto thoſe which Men endure when they cut off their Arms, or pluck out their Eyes, or are in a manner ſeparated from Themſelves. There is nothing in all this, like the cunning Addreſs and ſubtle Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of Men in the World, when they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to eſtabliſh new Doctrins; and it evidently appears that <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone is a Teacher come from God.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The better to comprehend this, it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that all the Principles of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon <hi>Humility</hi> as their chief Foundation. For if we pretend to the qualification of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:94927:180"/>
we muſt be <hi>meek, ſingle in heart, poor in Spirit, weary and heavy laden, little in our own Conceits, Lambs, little Children</hi> in Innocence and want of Malice, and Servants of other Men. <hi>Chriſt</hi> has u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited two different qualities, before not eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable, the Humility of the Heart, and the Light of the Underſtanding, charging us to <hi>be wiſe as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and harmleſs as Doves.</hi> 'Tis manifeſt this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was neceſſary for the true Sanctification of Mankind, a Secret indeed Men had not yet been able to find out. There have been ſome who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken their Intereſt, and have been either burnt, or had their Arms and Hands cut off, who durſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter Death it ſelf ſupported by <hi>Pride</hi> and a <hi>vain</hi> hope of Glory, which they prefer'd before all things: But it was never known that Men had ſo little <hi>Self-love,</hi> as to ſacrifice their Lives, unleſs at the ſame time they could make their Name immortal: Such a Miracle is only to be produced by the <hi>Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. After what has been ſaid, we ſhall have leſs Reaſon to wonder that this <hi>Morality</hi> roots up every Vice, ſince all Vices proceed either from <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oluptuouſneſs.</hi> This <hi>Morality</hi> then, which ſubverts the former by the ſevere Mortifications of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and deſtroys the latter by the Ideas it gives us of the Greatneſs and Perfection of God, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to our Wretchedneſs and Miſery; I ſay this <hi>Morality</hi> contains every thing abſolutely neceſſary to extirpate our Vices in their firſt Riſe, and ſtifle them even in their Birth. We may alſo affirm, that it comprehends all in one word; and that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by giving this Command, <hi>thou ſhalt not Covet,</hi> its full extent, and ſo carefully enjoyning the Purity of the Heart and Conſcience, in oppoſition to the falſe Gloſs and Interpretation of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who neglected the Inſide, and took care
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:94927:180"/>
only to keep the Outſide clean; has eſtabliſhed the true Principle of our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were before acquainted with, and none put themſelves to any great trouble or enquiry to find out.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. And this is another divine Character of the <hi>Chriſtian Morality,</hi> that in two words it eſtabliſhes the Principle of all Chriſtian Virtues. A little knowledge of Mans Heart will teach us that <hi>Self-love</hi> aſcribes every thing to it ſelf, and prefers us before God, to whoſe Glory all our Actions ſhould tend as to their common Center. It ſacrifices every thing to it ſelf: It deſires every thing, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led aſtray by its own Inclinations ſeeks even thoſe things that are contrary to its own good: All its Motions are but ſo many Mediums to this End; ſo many eager Wiſhes for what is not its own; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tranſports for Glory, or Pleaſure, its greateſt Object; ſo many ſecret Steps to attain them, or ſo many Hypocritical Self-denials, whoſe chief End is to carry that by ſurprize which they ſeemingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe. Whether the Body wallows in <hi>voluptuouſneſs,</hi> or whether there is ſuch a falſe pleaſure in <hi>Pride,</hi> as obſcures the Light of the Underſtanding, and caſts a Miſt before the Soul; whether <hi>Intereſt</hi> makes us ſteal, or <hi>Hipocriſy</hi> teaches us to over reach People, or <hi>Ambition</hi> makes us attempt to gain what is not our own; Give things what Name you pleaſe, both Virtues and Vices in the Hearts of Worldly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, are but ſo many Means which <hi>Self-love</hi> makes them interchangably uſe to carry on their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. What then is to be done to reform theſe Irregularities, and eſtabliſh a Principle of Virtue as true and equitable as Self-love, the Spring of them, is impure and corrupt? Oblige Men only to love God above all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:94927:181"/>
For as the Preference of our Selves before God is as it were the Source and Spring of all Vices; ſo without doubt the Preference of God before our Selves will give life and riſe to all other <hi>Virtues.</hi> The Love of God will reform all the Irregularities of Self-love, which will be no more culpable in aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing to it ſelf, when we ſhall dedicate and give up our Selves, our Thoughts and Actions to God. <hi>Self-love</hi> will no longer be blindly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of its true Intereſt, which conſiſts in carefully pleaſing him, from whom we have received all things. A Man can't love God, without delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reflect upon him, nor reflect upon him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humbling himſelf before him. He that loves God, will certainly raiſe himſelf above his Paſſions, diſdain to indulge every vitious Inclination of his Heart, and by living conformably to the Divine Will in all <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> endeavour to be like that perfect Deity, whoſe bright Image he bears. Thus we ſee what ſolid Virtues proceed from the love of God. But how comes it that <hi>Chriſt</hi> made ſo happy a Choice, and had ſo good Succeſs, in eſtabliſhing the Foundation of his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. To be ſatified in this, and be aſſured of his Succeſs, we need only follow the Notions his Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity gives us of Virtue, to attain to the true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Happineſs. Men had too long in vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the happy conjunction of two things, which Nature and Reaſon tell us ought to have been joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together: And becauſe they had no ſolid Virtue, therefore had they no real Felicity. Their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was anſwerable to their imaginary Virtues; and as thoſe Virtues were but a Compound of Pride, ſo their Felicity was but a falſe vain Joy, pleaſing yet empty, overcoming and deluding the Senſes, but not ſatisfying the Mind. And this <hi>Brutus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:94927:181"/>
freely owned at his Death. But the Satisfaction we reap from the Chriſtian Morality is excellently ſuited to the Solidity of thoſe Virtues it preſcribes, and the Spirit of Holineſs is the Eſſential Principle of our Felicity. In following the way to Virtue, which <hi>Christ</hi> has ſet down, we follow alſo that which leads us to Happineſs. If we take away Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, we cut off a fruitful Source of Miſery, and remove an infinite number of Cares and Troubles which tend to that as to their Center. If we love God as we ought, we ſhall take as much pleaſure in the Advancement of his Glory, in the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his infinite Perfections and Felicity, as if we poſſeſſed them all our ſelves. We ſhall delight as much in the Contemplation of the Beauty and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the World, as a Son in the ſight of the Greatneſs and noble Magnificence of his Father's Poſſeſſions. The Glory of God will then be our Glory; his Advantages will ſeem to be ours; and by making him the fole Object of our Love, we ſhall at laſt be made partakers of his infinite Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Reaſon and Experience teach us that theſe are moſt undeniable Truths.</p>
                  <p>For ſince Experience aſſures us, that he who loves any Object, derives his Satisfaction from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; a Man muſt doubtleſs neceſſarily be happy in loving God, ſince he finds in that ſingle Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject every thing that is capable of ſupplying his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. He lives ſecurely, becauſe he relies upon God: He fears not the loſs of any thing, knowing that every thing paſſes away; but that God alone remains always the ſame. The conſideration of <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity</hi> diſturbs him not in the leaſt, becauſe God abideth for ever. He delights in <hi>Solitarineſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has thereby the greater opportunity to entertain himſelf with God. He is not dejected with <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Deſpair</hi> at any Afflictions, looking upon
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:94927:182"/>
them as ſo many fatherly Chaſtiſements, or Trials of his <hi>Patience,</hi> which all conduce to his Welfare and Preſervation: He is certain that he ſhall poſſeſs <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Immortality,</hi> becauſe he knows that all thoſe things are eminently in God. Turn the Matter which way you pleaſe, it is impoſſible for us to love God, without being intirely pleaſed and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with him; which we cannot be, without a full and entire Satisfaction, ſuch a one as thoſe Men have, who think they want for nothing, and that they have found comprehended in one Object what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they could deſire.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore certain, that the Idea of our Duty leads us to the very Principle of Happineſs; a clear Demonſtration of the Juſtneſs of that Duty, and an undeniable Proof that the <hi>Morality</hi> which ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends it to our practice and obſervance, muſt neceſſarily be pure, ſound and true.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. But 'tis not ſufficient that the Meaſure of Virtue, which <hi>Christ</hi> preſcribes us as the Foundation of the Law and the Goſpel, ſhould be the Meaſure of the particular Happineſs of every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; it farther eſtabliſhes the Proſperity and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of publick Society; and by a happy Privilege it has above all other Virtues, it cauſes the publick Good to concur with the Advancement of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and the private with that of the publick. For inſtance, what will follow from the practice of Charity, which enjoyns us to love God with all our Heart, and with all our Mind, and our Neighbour as our Selves? The Reſult of it will be, that every Man's Intereſt ſhall be the ſame; that there ſhall reign no Hatred or Animoſities, no Jealouſy or Competition amongſt them; that every Man will thank God for the Bleſſings that others have received at his hands; that <hi>Charity</hi> will make every thing our own; that we ſhall be happy in other Men's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:94927:182"/>
as a Son in the Proſperity of his Father, and a Father in that of his Son; that a publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety will make but one Family more cloſely united, ſince <hi>Charity</hi> can make thoſe things equal that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Paſſions had before diſtinguiſh'd, and much the happier, ſince the Happineſs of one ſingle Perſon ſhall be enjoy'd by all, and the Happineſs of all by each ſingle Perſon.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſy to foreſee what Objections our Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Adverſaries will make. They will ſay, that <hi>Chriſtian Morality</hi> is undoubtedly a very fine Idea of true Perfection; but very unprofitable; ſince it is ſo far raiſed above our ordinary Strength and Capacity. The Anſwer to this Objection depends upon thoſe Reflections we ſhall continue to make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Characters of this Morality.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. We therefore aſſert, that altho by reaſon of the continual Warfare betwixt the Fleſh and the Spirit, we cannot obſerve this <hi>Chriſtian Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in its full Perfection, and conſequently cannot be ſenſible of the advantages which accrue to us from it in their utmoſt extent, it is enough if by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it according to our preſent condition, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us a thouſand advantageous Effects, which clearly demonſtrate, that it is not a <hi>meer</hi> Idea: And this is ſuch an undeniable Truth as is daily confirmed by <hi>Experience;</hi> ſo true it is that the ſtrict obſervance of this Divine Morality tends to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Welfare, that Parents themſelves wiſh it to their Children; Husbands to their Wives, and Wives to their Husbands; Servants to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Maſters to their Servants; Princes to their Subjects, and Subjects to their Princes; Creditors to their Debtors, and Debtors to their Creditors, as the Principle of <hi>Fidelity, Love, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Virtue,</hi> and even of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:94927:183"/>
Self-love indeed looks upon it as a meer Idea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when it commands it to ſhake off its evil Inclinations, and thinks it ſelf not able to obſerve it ſtrictly; but ſtill it thinks it very juſt, reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and perfect, when there is occaſion to reform other men's Imperfections and Vices; and it is well pleaſed to ſee (if it be not extreamly degenerated into the worſt Irregularities) that that Bridle ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently curbs, at leaſt in other Men, their Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence and unruly Paſſions, whoſe End is only to confound, ruin and violate all things.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. But that which wholly ſecures <hi>Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> from the Reproach it might be charged with in this reſpect, is that it is it ſelf either endowed with ſuch Strength as muſt neceſſarily exalt the Souls of Men, or contains ſuch Objects, which together with the efficacy of that Spirit which continually attends them, outweigh the moſt ſenſible Objects, and that paſſionate Inclination we all have for the World. <hi>Philoſophers</hi> indeed may be very juſtly charged with this Reproach, namely, that their <hi>Morality</hi> is meer <hi>Speculation,</hi> becauſe their excellent Maxims have no Motives powerful enough to ſupport them. They tell us, 'tis true, that we muſt overcome our Selves, and renounce our evil Deſires; but if once they are asked the reaſon of it, they are much perplexed how to ſolve the Query. It cannot be denied, but that their Morality is very Excellent; but the Motives that induce Men to obſerve it, are weak; and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Renown acquired in practiſing that Virtue they ſo ſtrictly recommend, as alſo the Title of <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> and that abundance of Vanity always concomitant with it, are very weak Inducements to conſtrain the Heart of Man to deprive it ſelf of its darling beloved Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>But it is not ſo with the Morality of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is wonderfully ſupported by the Motives it lays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:94927:183"/>
us. Every thing is coherent in it, and all the Parts proportionable. It requires our Obſervance of many hard and mortifying Duties. It curbs the Affections of the Heart, and mortifies the Fleſh. But ſince that cannot be done without great Difficulty and more than ordinary Endeavours, it promiſes us a magnificent and glorious Reward. The Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Promiſe is ſupported by many terrible Threatnings, and both theſe Objects are confirmed by ſuch Favours, as are very proper to gain our Affections.</p>
                  <p>The Bleſſings are a ſure Token of the Truth of the Promiſes; and the Truth of theſe makes us believe that of the Threatnings. I grant, the Promiſes of a bleſſed Life and Immortality, which we find in the Goſpel, are very great and glorious; but ſtill not greater than that which <hi>Jeſus</hi> made to Two of his Diſciples, when he called them unto him, ſaying, <hi>Come after me, and I will make you Fiſhers of Men.</hi> There was leſs probability that a few poor ignorant Fiſhermen ſhould have been able to catch in their Nets, the <hi>Doctrin, Authority,</hi> Wit and <hi>Eloquence</hi> of Men, than that we ſhould ſee God after Death.</p>
                  <p>The Truth of his Promiſes cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that of his Threatnings; and 'tis evident, when he promiſes that <hi>the pure in Heart</hi> ſhall ſee him, he threatens alſo to exclude thoſe that are not ſo, from the <hi>beatific</hi> Viſion.</p>
                  <p>Let not Men therefore ſlatter themſelves; let them ſhake off their Unbelief of the ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that attend the wicked after this Life. Their Reaſon will tell them, that God can do no leſs than baniſh thoſe his Preſence, who have perſiſted in a wilful deſign of offending him by their Sins, and that ſuch a Baniſhment is attended with the greateſt of all Miſeries, and that is, <hi>eternal Death.</hi> The <hi>Stings</hi> of Conſcience convince us of this, and the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:94927:184"/>
Promiſes of God inform us of it. His <hi>Juſtice</hi> points it out to us: His <hi>Law</hi> teaches it, and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it. The very <hi>Nature</hi> of things will not ſuffer us to doubt it, ſince God cannot direct Man to the true end of his <hi>Creation,</hi> without revealing himſelf to him; and he cannot reveal himſelf to him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making his Will known to him according as he pleaſes; nor can he make his Will known to him, without giving him a Law; nor give him a Law, without annexing to it ſuch Motives as muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promiſes, or Threatnings deeply engraven'd in the Conſcience, if they accompany the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but deliver'd in writing if they follow the written Law; nor can he make ſuch Promiſes or Threatnings unto Men, without being punctual in the accompliſhment of them. And can we have any greater Certainty than that which is ſo viſibly founded upon the Veracity of God, and the Nature of things themſelves?</p>
                  <p>There is nothing therefore capable to free Man from this Neceſſity, and it is to no purpoſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Meanneſs and Wretchedneſs; for that Circumſtance rather aggravates the Crime, than excuſes it, it being impudent beyond all pardon for a Traytour to plead Innocence, becauſe he is a <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi> and not a <hi>Lord.</hi> It will be alſo in vain to lay the Fault upon the evil Temperament of Body and Mind. For if either ſubmits to thoſe Reaſons which you have for committing no indecent action before a Sovereign, and if that and all its Paſſions are calm, when you fall into any Danger, or expect Sentence of Death; there is the ſame Reaſon that the Preſence, the Will, and Judgments of God ſhould have the ſame effect upon it. Nor will <hi>Ignorance</hi> be any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. It would indeed juſtifie you (if it were not only a bare pretence) as it does Brutes, Children and Ideots. But what Man knows not his Duty?
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:94927:184"/>
'Tis alſo in vain to rely on the Mercy of God; for that extends not to impenitent Sinners; and the Almighty ſaves only thoſe that deſire and endeavour to be ſaved. Laſtly, 'Tis meer folly to aſſert that eternal Puniſhments are diſproportionable to the weakneſs of our Nature. For is not God himſelf eternal, whom you have offended? And is not your Soul alſo eternal that has Sinned againſt him? Self-love however blinded thinks not life eternal a thing diſagreeable, and imagins nothing in it diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to our Condition. But 'tis ſhock'd at the Thoughts of everlaſting Pains, and therefore willing to believe them improbable Dreams and Whimſies. But why it does ſo, is hard to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, unleſs we ſuppoſe its deſign to be at any rate to impoſe upon it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while ſince you can neither deſtroy the <hi>Eternity</hi> of God, or the <hi>Soul,</hi> which Reaſon it ſelf forces you to acknowledge, you muſt either ſuppoſe that the Soul is to dwell eternally with God, or that it muſt be eternally baniſhed from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; that is, that it muſt live, or die eternally. For to live with God is to enjoy the greateſt Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Happineſs, and to be baniſhed his Preſence, is certainly the greateſt Miſery that can be thought of. As ſoon as we know the Exiſtence of God, that the Soul has no Parts, and that 'tis incapable of any Diſſolution; that its Nature, altogether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that of Matter, cannot be buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ruins of the Body, it is then very hard for us to oppoſe the Doctrin, which the Goſpel teaches us concerning the State of the Soul after Death. Nay, we are ſo far from impugning of it, that there is even a Neceſſity incumbent upon us readily to embrace the ſame. For if the Souls of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, together with thoſe of the Good, are equally to be baniſhed the Preſence of God, then Reaſon, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:94927:185"/>
and all our other Knowledge impoſe upon us, in giving us Hope of a future Reward. And if the Souls both of the Wicked and the Good are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy alike the Preſence of Almighty God, then too thoſe very Principles delude us, in making us dread his pretended Judgments; and ſo Gods Juſtice and Veracity, together with all our other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are at an end. To avoid therefore falling into ſuch an impious Aſſertion, we muſt own, that the Souls of the Good are to dwell for ever with God; but that contrariwiſe, thoſe of the Wicked are to be baniſhed his Preſence, and in owning this we affirmthe only thing in the World that is moſt agreeable to all our Knowledge, and moſt viſibly flows from the nature of things themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Bleſſings of God excellently anſwer his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Promiſes, and the formidable Severity of his Puniſhments. All the Creatures of this <hi>viſible</hi> World conſpire together to do us good: And beſides all the temporal Bleſſings daily conferr'd upon us, beſides the whole Earths being repleniſhed with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God; the Hearts of Men are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, their Souls comforted, the Goſpel preached throughout the whole World, <hi>the Son of God died for our Offences, and was raiſed for our Juſtification;</hi> our crucified Saviour came out of the Grave to bring us Peace from God, and ſeal the Truth of his Goſpel by his frequent Apparitions after his Death; there was a viſible and frequent Effuſion of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt upon Men, a multitude of Martyrs ſent from God to reclaim the World by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and Converſation, from Vice and Idolatrous Superſtition; all theſe things, I ſay, are ſuch Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings as are wonderfully ſuitable to the Promiſes and Threatnings of God, and fully convince us that the Chriſtian Morality has as many Objects to exalt and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:94927:185"/>

But to prove that this <hi>Morality</hi> is not a meer Idea of Perfection, God in is Wiſdom was pleaſed not only to have it ſet down in the Book of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> but alſo to have it lively Painted firſt in the Life of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and afterwards in the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians.</hi> Theſe Men are not ſuch Teachers, as might deſervedly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of ſpeaking well but doing ill, as it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected formerly to <hi>Seneca,</hi> who compoſed very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Diſcourſes concerning Poverty, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Goods of Fortune, when he himſelf was richer than the wealthieſt Citizen of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe on the contrary confirm'd by their practice what they taught. And by extirpating their evil Deſires, form'd ſuch a Society as is conformable to that we have had above but a faint Proſpect of, when we laid down the Idea of Man's Duty. They ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly renounced thoſe Paſſions which put a Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt them and other Men.

They ſold their Poſſeſſions to eaſe the Wants and Neceſſities of thoſe that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Adverſity: They rejoyced for having been thought worthy to ſuffer for the Name of God: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing conduced to their Happineſs, even Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions themſelves: They prayed for thoſe that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefully us'd them; and as <hi>Charity,</hi> and not Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, was the Rule of their Affections, ſo all the Motions of their Heart tended to one, as to the ſame Center, to the Glory of God, and the good of their Neighbours; which gave the Scripture occaſion to ſay, <hi>that they were but one Heart and one Soul.</hi>

                     <hi>VIII.</hi> Portraiture of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as it is conſider'd in its <hi>Myſteries.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Myſteries God has revealed unto us in his Word, are like the cloudy Pillar which led the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Wilderneſs. For like that, they are clear on one ſide, but dark and obſcure on the other.</p>
                  <p>If we contemplate them on the brighter ſide, they appear great, ſublime, and conformable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, worthy of God, and cloſely united to the moſt inviolable Principles both of our Heart and Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Their Greatneſs and Sublimity cauſed ſuch an Admiration in thoſe Perſons, who had the Honour to divulge them to the World, as they could not poſſibly conceal. For ſometimes they are forced to declare that <hi>they are things which Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9. An Expreſſion which is as natural as full of Energy, and clearly demonſtrates what great Ideas they had of them. Another while they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves after this manner, <hi>and without controverſy, great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs: God was manifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. And again, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 3. they call them <hi>the Treaſures of Wiſdom,</hi> and ſeem to be continually at a loſs to find out Expreſſions worthy the Majeſty of them.</p>

                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:94927:186"/>
And theſe Objects are infinitely raiſed above our Senſes, ſcarce ſeem to have any probability, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together repugnant to the Ideas of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and carnal Notions of the <hi>Jews;</hi> are above any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of Men, and conſequently Objects worthy of God himſelf. For they glorify him after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner; and clearly reveal unto us his Greatneſs and Majeſty, either in the Gifts he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers upon Men, or the Sublimity of thoſe Duties he preſcribes them to follow, or the Excellency of the Reward he propoſes to them, or the uſe of thoſe means whereby he leads them to it. Compare the Notions of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> with thoſe of other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and you'll be convinc'd of this Truth. But 'tis not ſufficient that thoſe Myſteries ſeem to us far above the Capacity of Men, who could never have invented them, and worthy the Majeſty of God, who alone was able to reveal them to us. We may alſo further add, that the Principles of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Natural Religion</hi> exactly fall in with them.</p>
                  <p>For they are not like the idle Tales and Fictions of the <hi>Poets,</hi> which the Heart of Man formerly ſo eagerly embraced, when at the ſame time their Reaſon condemned them for it. The <hi>Creation</hi> of Heaven and Earth by an Almighty Being, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> of the World by a Mediatour, the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Communion</hi> of Saints, the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Dead, the <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of Sins and <hi>life Everlaſting,</hi> are all Objects equally reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſublime and full of Majeſty, and the Denial of them will take away the improvement of the Light of Reaſon by the cleareſt Revelation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the very Nature of the <hi>Supream Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What would become then of the Wiſdom of God? Would it ſuffer Men to be wholly taken up by ſuch ends as are contrary to the deſign of their Creation? Would God permit Irregularities and Confuſions to
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:94927:187"/>
reign in publick Societies, and never compoſe them; whilſt at the ſame time he eſtabliſhes a firm Union, and as it were a Society amongſt irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? If ſo, what would then ſignify thoſe Principles of <hi>Morality,</hi> and that <hi>natural Law</hi> which he has written in our Hearts? Wherefore ſhould he make ſo many things for the good and preſervation of Man, that were not the End he was deſigned for? What would become of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God? And what would be the Truth of the <hi>inward</hi> ſenſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? What would be the Puniſhment reſerved for the Wicked, and the Reward which attends the Juſt? What would become of our Soul, ſince <hi>Reaſon</hi> has taught us, that the <hi>thinking</hi> Principle within us, is diſtinct from <hi>Matter,</hi> and that the Soul depends not upon any Diſſolution of the Parts of Matter? Whence is it that this <hi>Soul</hi> has Notions of its Immortality? What uſe would there be of <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Juſtice?</hi> Why might not Men rather give themſelves up to <hi>Vice,</hi> which would then be wholly preferrable before <hi>Virtue?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who then will refuſe to acknowledge ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to be in themſelves lawful and reaſonable, without which there is nothing but Confuſion and Diſorder in <hi>publick</hi> Society, Darkneſs and Incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the Mind; nothing but <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the Conſcience and natural Law of Reaſon; nothing but <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> in the practice of Virtue; and if things are ſo, then alſo the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God are at an end, thoſe excellent Attributes which had ſo clearly proved to us the Truth of his Exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are not the Speculations of contemplative Men, or the Niceties of <hi>School-men;</hi> but certain Truths that ſlow from the nature of things, and in an excellent manner agree with the <hi>ultimate</hi> End of Man. But how clear ſoever the one ſide of theſe
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:94927:187"/>
Myſteries may be, they are very obſcure on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; not that they have, or can contain any thing that is repugnant to ſound and unprejudiced Reaſon; but 'tis becauſe they cannot be fathomed by our ſhallow Underſtanding, and that tis neither ſecure nor allowable, or even poſſible for any man to ſearch into the Depth of them.</p>
                  <p>Now, tho' it be not abſolutely neceſſary for us to enquire, why God was pleaſed not to explicate all Difficulties in his Myſteries, and tho' it be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent only to alledge that ſuch was his Will and the Decrees of his Wiſdom, yet we muſt not neglect to illuſtrate and interpret them as far as <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> will permit.</p>
                  <p>Every body knows the Difference between <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Faith. Sight</hi> admits of no Difficulty; but <hi>Faith</hi> is intermixed both with Light and Darkneſs; both their Objects being very different from one another. For we do not ſee what we believe, and properly ſpeaking, we do not believe that which we ſee.</p>
                  <p>To ſee, is to perceive by ones ſelf; but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is to perceive by another Mans Eyes. <hi>Sight</hi> is twofold, that of the <hi>Senſe,</hi> which perceives thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects only that are ſuitable to its nature; and that of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding,</hi> when it judges of the nature of things by its own proper Light. <hi>Faith</hi> alſo is twofold, <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi> The firſt, is that Perſuaſion we have of ſacred Myſteries, grounded upon the Teſtimony of Men; and the other, that which is eſtabliſhed upon the Teſtimony of God. So that after what has been thus premiſed, 'tis an eaſy matter to underſtand the meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, who tells us, that the Will of God is that <hi>we ſhould walk by faith and not by ſight,</hi> that is, we muſt lay aſide our Reaſon, and follow only the Light of <hi>Revelation,</hi> and receive thoſe Truths which promiſe us Salvation on the Teſtimony of God alone.</p>

                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:94927:188"/>
Nevertheleſs, 'tis eaſy to perceive how great a Repugnance we have to it, in as much as the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God in not giving us Myſteries without Difficulties, reſtrains the roving Speculations of our Minds. It humbles the proud <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Man, and robs him of the Priviledge of a full Inſight into matters, which yet infinitely concern him. When we ſhould renounce the World, which is preſent to our Eyes, we would fain ſee thoſe Objects <hi>Religion</hi> has put in the other Scale to overbalance it; but tis not the Pleaſure of God we ſhould, and we muſt reſt content to believe thoſe Objects which make us thus renounce that which we actually ſee. And ſhould they be never ſo agreeable to the Principles of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe,</hi> yet <hi>Faith,</hi> and not <hi>Reaſon</hi> ought chiefly to induce us to receive them. Now the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that ſets the Heart at variance with the <hi>Law</hi> that impoſes on it the neceſſity of acting after that manner, the ſame Principle, I ſay, makes <hi>Reaſon</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Revelation,</hi> which lays upon it an invincible Neceſſity of believing what it cannot comprehend.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain however, that this Command of God is very conformable to the nature of things, very ſuitable to our preſent Condition, neceſſary to our Sanctification, and uſeful for the advancement of Gods Glory. We muſt not think it ſtrange that the Diſpenſation of <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould preceed that of Sight, ſince we daily obſerve <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to preceed <hi>Light,</hi> by a natural Order, and that we are <hi>Children</hi> before we come to be <hi>Men.</hi> Both Experience and Reaſon tell us, that our Knowledge is very imperfect in this Life, wherein the <hi>Soul</hi> is as it were preſſed down by the Clog of the Body, that we may walk more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by the help of the Light of <hi>Nature.</hi> And thoſe <hi>Heathens</hi> who attempted to go beyoud it, wandred blindly about, and loſt their Way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:94927:188"/>
There are two ſorts of Irregularities in Man, which produce all his other Diſorders, <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oluptuouſneſs.</hi> The latter of which ſprings up in the moſt inferiour part of the Soul, and is chiefly produced by the Senſes: But Pride is properly a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Mind. As therefore there has not been found hitherto a better Remedy againſt Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, than that of afflicting the Senſes, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them thoſe Pleaſures they ſo earneſtly thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo it does not appear there has been as yet a better means thought of, to remove the <hi>Pride</hi> of the Mind, than to humble it, by reſtraining thoſe <hi>Speculations</hi> of Knowledge, which puff it up beyond meaſure, and mortify it by requiring it to ſacrifice all its weak Conjectures and vain Reaſonings to <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed this Sacrifice of our ſelves is deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to God, ſince there is as much Reaſon for ſubmitting our <hi>Will</hi>by our Obedience to his Laws, as there is for ſubjecting our <hi>Mind</hi> to him by Faith. For by the former of theſe acts, we own him for our Lord that has a Right to command us; and by the latter, we readily confeſs his <hi>Veracity,</hi> and that we need not fear being impoſed upon, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe things he commands us to obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Thus Man, who had loſt himſelf in his Deſire of infinite Knowledge, is bound in ſome meaſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate his Crime in not deſiring to know any thing by himſelf. He had attempted to get as clear a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things as God himſelf; But <hi>now</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to know any thing but from God.</p>
                  <p>He was blind whilſt he walked in the Light of Nature, but now he muſt ſee clear in the Darkneſs of the Diſpenſation of Faith. <hi>For after that, in the Wiſdom of God, the World by Wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:94927:189"/>
'Tis certain, ſhould God familiarly and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reveal himſelf unto Men by ſenſible and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Miracles, we ſhould then walk by <hi>Sight</hi> and not by <hi>Faith;</hi> and 'tis true alſo, that if the Objects of <hi>Revelation</hi> were not in ſome ſort obſcure, there would be no Endeavours, no Difficulty, no Sacrifice of Reaſon made to believe them.</p>
                  <p>The Difficulties that Myſteries are attended with, have almoſt the ſame Influence over our <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as Afflictions have upon our <hi>Heart:</hi> For as theſe bring the latter in ſubjection, ſo the others ſerve to try the Conſtancy of the former. And ſince God Almighty was pleaſed to encreaſe our <hi>Patience</hi> by two different ſorts of Sufferings, the one, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inflicts immediately upon us; and the other he permits worldly minded and ſinful Men to inflict upon us; ſo in like manner he was pleaſed to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our <hi>Faith</hi> by two different ſorts of Difficulties, ſome whereof ſpring immediately from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and others proceed from the very <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> of Men.</p>
                  <p>For we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt that Obſcurity with reſpect to the Myſteries which proceed from <hi>God,</hi> and that which proceeds from the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Men. The firſt is either <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as all thoſe Difficulties which ariſe from the eſſential Diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between infinite Objects, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Revelation,</hi> and a finite Underſtanding, like ours; or elſe <hi>voluntary,</hi> and ſo enter into the very Plan and Deſign of Religion it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And theſe again may be diſtinguiſhed according to that Diverſity which in our manner of conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, we are obliged to ſuppoſe in the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of God himſelf; There being ſome which proceed from the Council of his <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> others from that of his <hi>Justice;</hi> others from that of his <hi>Majeſty;</hi> and laſtly, from that of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi>

Thus Divine Wiſdom was pleaſed to intermix ſome ſort of Darkneſs amidſt the moſt expreſs <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> we have, leſt that too clear an Evidence of them, ſhould deſtroy their Event. To this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo muſt we refer all thoſe <hi>Shadows, Types, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical</hi> Repreſentations, that mixture of ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with ſpiritual Benefits, that of the State of the Church with the State of <hi>Iſrael according to the fleſh;</hi> and generally all thoſe other means, which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt made uſe of, partly to cover thoſe Events he has declared to Men many Ages before their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion.</p>
                  <p>God drew a Veil over the moſt eſſential Truths of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the Soul, the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Mankind, &amp;c. that a diſtinct <hi>Revelation</hi> from all theſe Objects, might be an undeniable Character of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and that his Diſciples might boldly affirm, that <hi>Life</hi> was manifeſted in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>Grace</hi> had appeared unto all Men. <hi>For no Man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him,</hi> John 1. 18. To this Wiſdom of God alſo muſt be referred that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Holy Ghoſt, in inſpiring the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> thereby to reveal a better life to them, and make them cry out upon their Death-beds, <hi>Lord I have waited for thy Salvation;</hi> but withal giving them but a faint Proſpect of that Object, by ſuch obſcure Thoughts and dark Notions as they were not able of themſelves to ſolve; deferring to give a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge of his Myſteries till that Time which he had ſet apart for the fulfilling of his Oracles, and the Manifeſtation of him, that was to be the Author and End of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> For this cauſe therefore there is hardly mention made of any thing elſe in the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Promiſes and Threatnings; and hence it was

that <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> himſelf, when diſputing againſt the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> proved the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the dead but by Conſequence only.</p>
                  <p>Divine Wiſdom was alſo pleaſed that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould be born in Obſcurity and Humiliation, that thoſe mean outward Appearances being offenſive to the prejudice of carnal and worldly minded <hi>Jews,</hi> they might as it were by chance give occaſion to the execution of thoſe things, which the Council of God had determined. And this is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſes of his <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Humiliation;</hi> of the <hi>Meanneſs</hi> of his <hi>Birth,</hi> and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthineſs</hi> of his firſt Profeſſion; the <hi>choice</hi> of his Diſciples, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Juſtice of God acting in concert with his Wiſdom, obliges him to ſpeak to all prophane Contemners of his Myſteries in an <hi>obſcure</hi> Language, and ſo as it were to conceal thoſe Pearls from them, leſt like unclean Beaſts they ſhould trample them under their Feet. And this may very well ſerve for a Reaſon of the denial which <hi>Chriſt</hi> formerly made to the Unbelievers of thoſe Times, of ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing his Power among them, and of the great care he often took to conceal his <hi>Miracles</hi> from them. For this cauſe therefore ſpoke he ſometimes in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables to Strangers; but he always very clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt himſelf to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> giving them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning of thoſe <hi>Parables,</hi> and telling them, that as for them they had the Priviledge of ſeeing all things openly.</p>
                  <p>Neither does his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſuffer him to reveal himſelf as familiarly to the <hi>ſinful</hi> Man, as he would to the <hi>innocent.</hi> This we ought not to wonder at, ſince Men themſelves are wont ſo to deal with one another. There is nothing more common than for Great Men to baniſh their Preſence thoſe who have incurr'd their Diſpleaſure. To think it then ſtrange if God conceals himſelf from a Sinner, would be to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:94927:191"/>
entertain a more unworthy Idea of his Majeſty, than that of an Earthly Monarch. This was the Reaſon why God took ſuch care to conceal himſelf, even when he deſign'd to manifeſt his Glory. And for this Cauſe he ſhewed himſelf only in <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Dreams,</hi> or when hidden in the <hi>Cloud</hi> and <hi>Ark,</hi> or covered with ſome other <hi>Veil.</hi> On this account alſo he was wont to baniſh from his Preſence all thoſe as were defiled in their Bodies, and order the Prieſts of the Sanctuary to purifie themſelves. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded too the People to waſh their Garments, when he gave them notice, that within three Days he would come down to them; nothing but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and corporeal Purity being ſufficient to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify thoſe that were to approach the Deity manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted under corporeal Symbols. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> fulfilling in the Spirit every thing hidden in the Letter of the Law, teaches us that thoſe only ſhall ſee God, who ſhall be found <hi>pure in Heart;</hi> ſo that we have no reaſon to wonder, if when Man, by reaſon of his Guilt hides himſelf from God, the Almighty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the Influence of his Glorious Majeſty from Man.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows <hi>Revelation</hi> with ſome ſort of Darkneſs, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our Faith and keep up our Minds in Vigour, which alſo would grow ſluggiſh, if not ſtirred up by ſuch Difficulties as are proper to Myſteries; as alſo to humble our proud and haughty Reaſon, which is immediately puffed up with its own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; to make us ſubmit our Underſtandings to him, ſince we ought to believe any Truths, tho in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, if he reveals them; as alſo to ſway our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> which ought readily to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any ſorrowful and mortifying Objects that he is pleaſed to offer them; to ſtrip our <hi>Pride</hi> of all its Pretences, and to diſpoſe our Minds that we muſt
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:94927:192"/>
neceſſarily acknowledge every Benefit we enjoy, ſprings from him; and that too ſo much the more, becauſe we thereby attain to life Eternal by ſuch means and objects as are above our Capacity to comprehend: So neceſſary is it that it ſhould appear that our Sufficiency is of God, and that <hi>the Goſpel is the Power of God unto Salvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. To this Principle we owe the choice of thoſe perſons which God has made uſe of to preach the Goſpel; the nature of thoſe ſeeming Paradoxes he commanded them to publiſh, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Light of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> the Silence of the Holy Ghoſt in thoſe things which a few Words from him would have rendred plain, and eaſy to our Underſtandings.</p>
                  <p>But God is not content to exerciſe our <hi>Faith</hi> by thoſe Obſcurities we find diſperſed throughout the Divine <hi>Revelations;</hi> he further permits, <hi>Hereſies, Schiſms,</hi> and <hi>Errours,</hi> nay <hi>Superſtition</hi> it ſelf to reign among us, that <hi>thoſe who are approved may be made manifeſt.</hi> Thus we may ſay he ſuffers all <hi>Egypt</hi> to be covered with Darkneſs, the more eminently to diſcover his wonderful Protection, in bleſſing at the ſame time the Land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> with the Light of his Truth; that is, by giving us a Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo bright an Evidence, as carnal and worldly minded Men can never comprehend, becauſe their Reaſon is eclipſed by <hi>Senſuality,</hi> and the Corruption of their Hearts produces thoſe thick Clouds that hide the Truth from their ſight. God, 'tis true, enlightens the Minds of Men; but Men wilfully blind themſelves. He permits it ſhould be ſo to confound their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and demonſtrate to us that he is the Father of Light. But let us now enquire into the Principles of that Obſcurity which ſolely ſprings from Men.</p>

And I. So groſs are all the Prejudices of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that there is no body ſo void of ſhame as to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them openly. Yet 'tis certain, they are very prevalent in the Hearts of moſt Men, who ſtick not to ſay, <hi>I never ſaw the like; I could willingly believe it, if I ſhould but ſee it. Who ever ſaw dead Men riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from their graves? And who ever aſcended into Heaven, or went down into the Pit?</hi> All which Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are manifeſtly abſurd. For can there be any greater Folly in a Man, than to refuſe to believe that which he does not ſee, when theſe Objects of his <hi>Faith</hi> could have no Exiſtence, were they not <hi>inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> Did any one ever ſee the Time paſt long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he liv'd, or the future long after his Death? Did he ever ſee his own <hi>Soul,</hi> the <hi>Deity,</hi> &amp;c. For 'tis nothing elſe but the Time paſt and the future, the Objects and Intereſts of the Soul, together with the Benefits of God, which <hi>Faith</hi> offers to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. We are accuſtomed by <hi>Education</hi> not to believe any thing that happens not in the ordinary courſe of <hi>Nature.</hi> We confine our ſelves as it were to a Circle of Objects, which we willingly admit of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they contain nothing that is repugnant to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> or <hi>Probability:</hi> So that the Cuſtom we have of refuſing to give our Aſſent to all other things, reaching even unto matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> inevitably caſts us into <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> and Incredulity. Yet ſhould we but throughly conſider thoſe Objects which fall under common Experience, they would certainly appear as ſurpriſing and incomprehenſible as thoſe of Religion. If you think it ſtrange that the <hi>Soul</hi> ſhould outlive the Ruins of the <hi>Body,</hi> you muſt be much more ſurpriſed to ſee it ſo cloſely united to a ſubject ſo different from its Perfection. 'Tis the Union of the Soul with the Body, and not its Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution we ought to admire. Endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

if you can the ſtrict Alliance there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a thing that is extended, that takes up Space, that is confined to certain Limits, that acts upon Subjects preſent only and neareſt to it; and a thing that has neither <hi>figure</hi> nor <hi>extenſion, colour, fluidity,</hi> or <hi>ſolidity,</hi> which in ſome ſenſe is every where, and yet has no Parts to take up any Space; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon the Time paſt, and the future; upon it ſelf, and its manner of acting in ſuch a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, as muſt neceſſarily perſwade us maugre all our Reluctancies and Doubts, that we have a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>Immaterial</hi> Subſtance within us.</p>
                  <p>If you are amazed when you are taught that there is a Maker and Preſerver of all things; you ought rather to be ſurpriſed to think you have lived ſo long in the World, without putting theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to your ſelf, <hi>To what End was I made?

                  </p>
                  <p>The Thoughts of a future Judgment, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver notion you may have of its Accompliſhment, ought not in the leaſt to ſtartle you, who ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wonder at the long Forbearance of God, who permits all things, that he may one day judge all things. That <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Diſorder</hi> that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in publick Society, might raiſe Scruples in you, were it not bounded by ſuch an Event, as will clearly juſtify the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God. To follow the Opinion of <hi>Incredulous</hi> Men, one would ſay that there is nothing extraordinary o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the World; whereas we cannot behold any thing that is not ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. But all our Incredulity ariſes principally from our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and it is their greateſt Intereſt to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in us an Averſion for <hi>Religion,</hi> and in order to that make us inclinable to receive thoſe Doubts which favour their Pretences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:94927:193"/>
And this is that which gives riſe to all ſorts of Difficulties. Men are incredulous, meerly becauſe they will be ſo; and they will be ſo, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns their Paſſions to have it ſo. Hence it is that every thing concurrs by accident towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſo miſerable an End; ſo <hi>Sciences, Eloquence, Policy,</hi> &amp;c. create Doubts and Difficulties in us, not of themſelves, but through our ill management of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Pride,</hi> of all the Paſſions the moſt dangerous and moſt inveterate, ſuffers us not to remain in ſuch a due diſpoſition of Mind as God requires we ſhould have, in order to receive his <hi>Revelation.</hi> Now this Diſpoſition is twofold. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> It conſiſts in our readily receiving all revealed Truths; and 2<hi>ly,</hi> in receiving them altho they are far above our Capacity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, without endeavouring to dive too far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Depth of the Council of God.</p>
                  <p>To have then a right Belief, we muſt not only be perſwaded of the Certainty of all revealed <hi>Truths;</hi> we muſt alſo learn how to be ſatisfied with the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of thoſe things it has pleaſed God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from us. We muſt be always ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our Ignorance, and that we do not clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what yet we ſincerely believe. We muſt humbly cloſe our Eyes before the dark ſide of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, as well as gladly open them to behold the bright one. 'Tis our Incredulity which makes us reject thoſe Truths we ought to acknowledge at firſt ſight, and the irregular Curioſity of the Mind prevents our paying our profound Reverence, to thoſe ſacred Obſcurities wherein they are invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>Now from this Principle we may very reaſonably conclude, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That nothing could argue more Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance and Impiety, than the project of ſeveral Doctors, who tho famous upon other Accounts for
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:94927:194"/>
their Learning and great Inſight into things, yet have endeavoured to make as it were a <hi>New System</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> by removing all the Difficulties of it, and oftentimes cutting thoſe Knots aſunder, which they were not able to untie. And this ſhews, that they were ignorant, how that the dark Myſteries of Religion, either follow the Nature of things, or elſe proceed from the external <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> of God, in deſigning to give us ſuch a Religion as ſhould not be free from ſuch dark Myſteries, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves give us to underſtand, when they tell us that the Will of God was <hi>to bring to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the underſtanding of the prudent;</hi> and when they cry out, <hi>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi> Rom. 11. 33. Secondly, We may infer from thence, That hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Curioſity that has ſo much increaſed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Theological</hi> Queſtions, is one of the greateſt Obſtacles which <hi>Faith</hi> is with much ſtrugling to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                  <p>For we are not content to have a bare Knowledge of things; we yet endeavour to ſearch into the <hi>Manner</hi> how things are done; whereas 'tis the <hi>Manner</hi> how they are done which God is pleaſed to conceal from us; and 'tis the dark ſide we ought to look upon with profound Reverence.</p>
                  <p>It was ſufficient for us to know that we were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corrupt from our Cradles, and that nothing but the <hi>Grace</hi> of God is capable to deliver us from that wretched State we are in. But we were not wife enough to fix our Enquiries there: We further had a mind to know how Sin entred into the World; what Springs of our Soul were firſt of all put out of order by it, and how it was tranſmitted to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Holy Ghoſt is as the Wind, <hi>the Sound whereof we hear, but cannot tell whence it cometh, and</hi>
                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:94927:194"/>
                     <hi>whither it goeth.</hi> Nevertheleſs, ſo impertinent is the Curioſity of Men, as to attempt diving into his manner of acting. They pretend by ſuch and ſuch Deciſions to limit the Degrees of his operation and retrench whatſoever they pleaſe. They continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe ſuch Diſtinctions as are altogether obſcure and barbarous in compariſon of the Scripture, as <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> Grace, <hi>Conſequent, Sufficient, Efficacious, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, Particular, mediate,</hi> and <hi>immediate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Grace; all which Diſtinctions they ſeem indeed to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, as ſo many deviations and ſhifts on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be exempted from owning, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all our Endeavours, <hi>it is God which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. And tho 'tis certain we are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the manner of his Operation, yet can any thing be more juſt and reaſonable than ſuch a free and ingenuous Confeſſion? And does it not very far exceed all the <hi>Speculations</hi> of School-men, who are themſelves confounded, and fall from one Depth into another, whilſt they pretend to ſearch into thoſe Myſteries God has concealed from them?</p>
                  <p>But the Misfortune which reſults from all this, is, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> having prodigiouſly ſwell'd up their Syſtem of Divinity by theſe and other like Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations (whoſe End is to dive into the <hi>Manner</hi> how thoſe things are done which God has revealed to us,) thereby give Riſe to the moſt conſiderable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Incredulous Adverſaries, who heap up all thoſe humane Speculations together, the better to impugn the Foundations of <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, or elſe raſhly conclude from thoſe vain Diſputes of humane Curioſity, that Religion has nothing of Certainty or Solidity in it. But we ſhall eaſily confute both the Errour and Injuſtice of thoſe Un believers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> is aſſaulted by two ſorts of Enemies. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> The <hi>Incredulous,</hi> who impugn it on that ſide on which it
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:94927:195"/>
is moſt clear and evident; and 2<hi>ly.</hi> The <hi>Inconſiderate</hi> and <hi>Curious,</hi> who have no regard to its ſacred Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity; ſo that we have here thoſe who deny all things, and thoſe who will know all things. You will do well to ſhew thoſe curious inconſiderate Men that they are miſtaken; and think not that their being convinc'd of the Uſeleſſneſs of their nice Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions can do any prejudice at all to Religion; becauſe an unſeaſonable Curioſity is no leſs contrary to the Genius of <hi>Religion</hi> and the Nature of Faith, than <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> and Incredulity.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. This Curioſity is inſeparably attended with <hi>Raſhneſs;</hi> and it is impoſſible to expreſs into what ſtrange Exceſſes both of them have inſenſibly brought Men. To confirm this, we ſhall only ſet down one neceſſary Example, and that is, of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Incarnation,</hi> one of the moſt profound and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Myſteries of our Religion. In this, <hi>Curioſity</hi> has induced Men to exceed the Bounds of <hi>Revelation,</hi> and <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> has obliged them not to believe it.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture teaches us, that there is but one God, and one Mediatour. It aſſures us alſo, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is God, that <hi>he thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</hi> that he made the World, Time, and all things therein. It aſcribes to him all the Attributes, the Works and the Names of the Deity, his <hi>Power,</hi> his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> his <hi>Eternity, Immenſity,</hi> &amp;c. It further aſſures us, that the Holy Ghoſt is God. It aſſerts that thoſe Three are One. It commands <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. It ſpeaks of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt as of Three Perſons. And why ſhould we not reſt ſatisfied with this?</p>
                  <p>'Tis becauſe the Pride of Men thinks fit it ſhould be otherwiſe. <hi>I do not know,</hi> or <hi>I do not understand</hi> are Confeſſions ſo terrible to them, that there is nothing they won't invent to avoid them. They
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:94927:195"/>
are deſirous to know how three <hi>Perſons</hi> can ſubſiſt in one and the ſame <hi>Eſſence.</hi> They tell us of <hi>Modes,</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> of <hi>modal</hi> and <hi>formal</hi> Diſtinctions, of <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>relative</hi> Entities, &amp;c. They aſſert that the divine <hi>Intellect</hi> produced the <hi>Word,</hi> and that the Holy Ghoſt is the <hi>uncreated</hi> production of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Will,</hi> and a thouſand other things of this kind, which if certain, at leaſt are not revealed. And why all theſe Diſtinctions and Subtilties? Unleſs they would make us comprehend a Myſtery God is reſolved ſhall remain the incomprehenſible Object of our Faith.</p>
                  <p>Others, diſpleaſed with thoſe <hi>Scholaſtick</hi> Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are ſo impious as to attempt to deſtroy that <hi>Myſtery</hi> which they cannot conceive, either by utterly rejecting thoſe places of Scripture which mention it; or if they receive them, by putting ſuch a forced In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation upon them, that the Holy Ghoſt muſt needs have had a deſign to deceive us, if he meant what ſuch Teachers would have him. Thus for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, this place of Scriptnre, <hi>Before Abraham was I am,</hi> ſignifies, according to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> before the <hi>Prophecy</hi> contained in the Name of <hi>Abraham</hi> was fulfilled, and before he became the Father of all Nations, I am. So they ſay this Text, <hi>Glorify me with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was,</hi> John 17. 5. imports as much as, Glorify me with the Glory thou hadſt reſolved to honour me with. And this other; <hi>The ſame was in the beginnning and all things were made by him,</hi> that is (as they interpret it) he was before the time of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and by him all things were done in the Church.</p>
                  <p>But to what end do they invent thoſe Niceties ſo contrary to the Goſpel Simplicity and Truth? 'Tis doubtleſs on purpoſe to make void the effect of thoſe ſacred Obſcurities, which God has diſperſed throughout his <hi>Myſteries,</hi> and to ſave thoſe by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:94927:196"/>
Wiſdom, whom God deſigned to bleſs with Life eternal through <hi>the Fooliſhneſs of preaching,</hi> as Men firſt called it.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. We may add <hi>Superſtition</hi> to this irregular Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and raſhneſs of the Mind, which ariſes by little and little from the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> endeavouring to hide themſelves, or avoid by vain Pretexts the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and ſhift off the ſevere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of <hi>Chriſtian Morality;</hi> and to that end they employ Man in ſome unprofitable bodily Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, or elſe wholly fix his Mind upon ſome carnal Worſhip. <hi>Superſtition</hi> is no ſooner thus inſenſibly formed, but it thruſts it ſelf into Credit, and as it were claims a privilege of Freedom in Religion; So that the moſt prodigious Whymſies and Imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the former, are confuſedly hudled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the moſt ſacred Myſteries of the latter; and then there are no Abſurdities ſo extravagant that human Paſſions ſuggeſt, but what the Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous immediately take hold on as Inſtruments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they attack the Foundations of Religion, which is in ſome reſpect as it were infected with them. And ſuch is the Folly of Men, that they will needs ſave all, or loſe all. For if you go about to deſtroy <hi>Superſtition,</hi> you are then immediately condemned for being an Enemy to <hi>Christianity:</hi> And if you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to maintain the Glory and Holineſs of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> Men expect you ſhould too in ſome manner defend the abſurd Extravagances of <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our Deſign of writing in behalf of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> in general, ſuffers us not to make any Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this at preſent. It is enough if the Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we advance be certainly true, as will fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Examples as may be ſought of it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and which 'tis no difficult matter for any Man to find out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:94927:196"/>
We ſhall therefore reſt contented to aſſert in that reſpect, that the Multiplicity of Sects which ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably divide the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church amongſt Men, and on whoſe Account the Name of our common Lord and Maſter is ſo frequently Blaſphemed among Infidels, ſolely ſprings from theſe Three Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> An <hi>irregular</hi> Curioſity, a <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> of the Mind, and <hi>Superſtition;</hi> and theſe Three Principles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves proceed from a more antient Original, which is the Diſorder and Irregularity of our Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>Now to demand why God permits ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sects and different Religions to reign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, is juſt as if one ſhould ask, why God ſuffers Wicked Men to live in the World? For he that permits the Licentiouſneſs of the Paſſions, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuffers the natural Effects and infallible Conſequences of them.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. This being granted, we cannot doubt but that <hi>Philoſophy</hi> it ſelf is another Source of inevitable Difficulties, when joyned to <hi>Religion.</hi> Their Ends are ſo different, that they may juſtly be allowed to be oppoſite. For 1. The main Deſign of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is to gratify the vain Curioſity of Men; whereas <hi>Religion</hi> deſigns only to mortify it. 2. The one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to find out the Nature of things, the other profeſſes an utter Ignorance of them. 3. That ſwells up the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man, by encreaſing his Knowledge; This humbles it, by requiring him to ſubmit his <hi>Reaſon</hi> to his <hi>Faith.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Philoſophy</hi> endeavours to comprehend all things; whereas one of the moſt eſſential parts of <hi>Religion</hi> conſiſts in hmbly acknowledging that we comprehend nothing at all of the hidden Myſteries of <hi>Nature,</hi> much leſs of thoſe of <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore hence it is that <hi>Philoſophy</hi> ſeldom agrees with <hi>Religion,</hi> nor <hi>Religion</hi> with <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Thus <hi>Copernicus</hi> and <hi>Deſcartes</hi> doubtleſs were not
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:94927:197"/>
well pleaſed with the Deſcriptions the Author of <hi>Geneſis</hi> gives us of the Creation of the World; of the Two great Luminaries of Heaven; of the Miracle of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> who ſtopt the Courſe of the Sun, of the <hi>third Heaven</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of; of the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and the <hi>New Earth,</hi> which ſacred Authors make us expect; of the Conflagration of the Heavens, the Diſſolution of the Elements, and the putting out the Light of the Stars; all which Signs are to preceed the great and wonderful Day of Judgment; I ſay ſuch <hi>Philoſophers</hi> as theſe would perhaps cry out, that theſe Objects had no relation to their Ideas of <hi>Aſtronomy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But certainly there is no reaſon to wonder at it. For thoſe Holy Writers intended to ſpeak in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the People, and not in that of the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</hi> They had a mind to ſanctify Mankind, and not to explain the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was highly neceſſary they ſhould accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date their Expreſſions to the Vulgar Notions. Nay, the Holy Ghoſt was pleaſed they ſhould uſe no other, that ſo his Myſteries being repreſented under thoſe Vulgar Ideas, might be ſuitable to every ones Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, at leaſt in the manner of their <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſince they could not be ſo in their own <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor ought we to think this Conduct of his, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary or unuſual. For thus the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God acted when it was to repreſent to the Ancient <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> the Wonders of the Goſpel Diſpenſation. And it made uſe of Expreſſions borrowed from Cuſtoms and Practices generally received amongſt Men. It ſays, that <hi>all Nations ſhall go up to Mount Sion;</hi> that <hi>there ſhall be an Altar in the midst of the Land of Egypt;</hi> that <hi>in every place Incenſe ſhall be offered unto God, and a pure Offering;</hi> that <hi>the Tabernacle of God ſhall be with the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. But if it be asked then, why the Prophets foretold the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:94927:197"/>
this familiar way? 'Twas becauſe thoſe were the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People, and that it was neceſſary they ſhould uſe only Expreſſions known and familiar to the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, ſince <hi>Revelation</hi> it ſelf would have become unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible without that condeſcending Goodneſs of God, who is wont to accomodate himſelf to the Capacity of every Man, without Exception.</p>
                  <p>For ſuppoſing that God had deferr'd his <hi>Revealing</hi> to us the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Creation of the World, the <hi>Miracle</hi> of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Glory which the bleſſed enjoy in the other World, the <hi>Judgment</hi> to come, &amp;c. till all Men had been made to underſtand by the Principles of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that the <hi>Stars</hi> are bigger than the <hi>Moon;</hi> that 'tis the Earth, and not the Sun which moves; that the Heavens are nothing but <hi>liquid Spaces</hi> of an <hi>Infinite Extenſion;</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> is ſo eſſentially bright, that he cannot loſe his Brightneſs without an immediate Annihilation of his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> &amp;c. Heavens! where ſhould we be, and what would become of us, if all Men muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily firſt become <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> before they can learn to fear God?</p>
                  <p>But the Wiſdom of God is ſo wonderful, in that he not only accomodates Himſelf to the Notions of every Man that he may render Himſelf intelligible to all; but alſo in that he has at the ſame time tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en care we ſhould not be deceived, in urging too far the <hi>literal</hi> Senſe of all thoſe vulgar Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Thus for inſtance, nothing can be more inſipid than the ridiculous Jeſts of our Incredulous Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries touching thoſe Deſcriptions which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives us of <hi>Hell-fire.</hi> And certainly, they do but Expoſe themſelves as often as they pretend to mock and deſpiſe <hi>Religion.</hi> For he that will truly conſider what Holy Writ tells us in that reſpect, will certainly find that it puts ſeveral different Images together, to repreſent to us by known and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:94927:198"/>
familiar Ideas an Object altogether unknown, and ſet before us by all thoſe different Images, ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as one ſingle Idea was wholly unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. Thus for that end it borroweth the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone</hi> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the ſore Affliction of the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Judgments which God himſelf diſplayed over the Nations in the Valley of <hi>Joſaphat,</hi> the terrible Darkneſs ſpread over all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whilſt at the ſame time the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> freely enjoy'd the the Light of God in the Land of <hi>Goſhen;</hi> the <hi>unquenchable Fire</hi> and the Worm of the Valley of the Children of <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> which dieth not, &amp;c. the weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Teeth of thoſe Children ſacrificed to <hi>Moloch,</hi> who for that End were thrown alive into the Arms of that burning Statue.</p>
                  <p>Now 'twould be full as reaſonable to carry on the ſenſe of ſome of theſe Ideas too far, as to raiſe any Difficulties upon the Notions of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Celeſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. all which Notions are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſigned to repreſent to us the Bliſs that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Faithful. And theſe Ideas would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely falſe and contradictory, if underſtood in a literal Senſe; becauſe 'tis certain that Paradiſe can never be taken for the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> for the Boſom of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence therefore it plainly appears by the Variety of all thoſe Images, that they can never be taken in a ſtrict and literal Senſe; and that the Nature of the Object repreſented to us after ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways, was too great and ſublime to be deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Men by any one ſingle Idea of this Kind.</p>
                  <p>And indeed according to this Notion 'tis an eaſy matter to anſwer a certain Objection raiſed about a future Judgment, which at firſt may ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what conſiderable, and to carry in it ſome intricate
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:94927:198"/>
Difficulty. Some hold, that the Deſcription which Holy Writ gives us of the Day of Judgment, when it tells us that the Son of God is to be preceeded by his Holy Angels; that he will place Men, ſome on his right Hand, and others on his left, &amp;c. I ſay, they affirm that this Deſcription neither agrees with the Idea which we already have of the Nature of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> nor with that we ſhould entertain of ſo great and ſignal an <hi>Event.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To anſwer this Objection, we are only to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Object from the manner after which it is repreſented to us. The firſt indeed is very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, great, and ſublime, worthy to take up our Thoughts, and able to move our Hearts. And we have already ſufficiently evinced its Conformity to our Reaſon in ſhewing that we either muſt deny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evidence to be in the light of Reaſon, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things themſelves, or elſe acknowledge a future Judgment. And what can be greater than an Object which juſtifies the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and all his other <hi>Attributes,</hi> and brings all Men under his ſtrict Examination, all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all the Thoughts of the Underſtanding, and all the Motions of the Heart? And this Object is that alone as is real and immutable.</p>
                  <p>As for the manner that is propoſed to us of its Accompliſhment, 'twould never ſuit with our weak Knowledge, were it altogether as ſublime as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it ſelf; and we ſhould be ſo far from compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending any thing in the nature of it, that it would certainly dazzle our ſhallow Reaſon, if God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly repreſent it to us as it is in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Chriſt</hi> has ſufficiently ſhewed us we muſt not puſh too far the ſignification of any of thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Images, in that he uſes ſuch a multitude and variety of others to repreſent that Judgment to us. For ſometimes he deſcribes it by the Parable of the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:94927:199"/>
                     <hi>groom</hi> and the <hi>Virgins;</hi> then again by the juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Lord paſt upon all his Servants, whom he had in his abſence intruſted with his Talents. One while he repreſents the Judge of all the World as a <hi>Shepherd</hi> ſelecting his Sheep from the He-goats, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time he deſcribes him under the Image of an Houſholder, plucking up the Tares and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding it from the Wheat, that he might burn the former, but gather the latter into his Barn. In a word, he compares him to a glorious and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Monarch, who is preceeded by ſeveral Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels, or Meſſengers, ſounding the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet before him. Now all theſe Deſcriptions would certainly be of no uſe, were they to be taken in a ſtrict and literal Senſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Judgment muſt neceſſarily be made of the Hiſtory of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which tho it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears never ſo reaſonable and circumſtantially told, yet for all that is but a Parable in the Opinion of all the ſenſible part of the World, and would ſeem abſurd if it were underſtood in a literal Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Let not then <hi>Philoſophy</hi> any longer be offended at any of the Scripture Phraſes, or its figurative Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: Let it not object, that a <hi>material</hi> Fire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called cannot burn up our Souls; that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have no Mouths to ſound Trumpets; that the Valley of <hi>Joſaphat</hi> is too little to contain all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, &amp;c. Theſe are ſuch trivial Difficulties as can't puzzle thoſe who are never ſo little acquainted with the Language of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is certain that the Mixture Men have made of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> has been conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prejudicial to our Faith. For firſt, <hi>Philoſophy</hi> as it were heaping up one Speculation upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tells us, that there is an <hi>infinite</hi> Extenſion of Matter; that there are other Globes inhabited and peopled, other Worlds framed of the Concourſe of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:94927:199"/>
                     <hi>Atoms;</hi> that there are certain invio Iable Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that there is an <hi>Eternity</hi> of Matter, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Imaginations of this kind, as have not the leaſt relation with the Principles of <hi>Religion.</hi> And thereupon the Paſſions which are upon the watch to catch and embrace every thing that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours their ſeveral pretences in reſiſting Faith, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe the ſmalleſt Conjectures, and give ſuch weight and credit to thoſe things, which otherwiſe would certainly paſs for meer Extravagancies. And thus it happens, that the Scruples of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> are changed into Certainties, through our unreaſonable deſire of changing Certainties of <hi>Religion</hi> into Doubts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Philoſophy</hi> creates in us an Habit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to judge of every thing by our ſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; a Diſpoſition indeed abſolutely contrary to the Nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> which requires of us a Belief purely grounded on the Teſtimony of God. But Men are ſo far from relying upon it, that they are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally asking Demonſtrations of us, and thoſe too they would have to be <hi>Geometrical</hi> ones, that is, ſo clear and evident, as to be free from all perplexing Obſcurity. Theſe Men make large Pretenſions and Demands; and ſure it is that we have ſufficient Demonſtrations, but they are all Demonſtrations of Faith, and there can be no <hi>Faith</hi> but what has ſome Obſcurity as well as Light.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another very dangerous Effect of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> is that it changes Religion from <hi>Practice</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Speculation.</hi> For the nicer and ſublimer our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries are into the Nature of Myſteries, the more we neglect the Body of Religion, which is eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practical. <hi>Religion</hi> appears not then to us in its uſual Brightneſs and Majeſty. And the more we purſue it by nice Speculations, the farther it gets out of our reach. Experience teaches us, that the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:94927:200"/>
Progreſs we make in reaſoning, ſets us at a greater Diſtance from the true Center of <hi>Religion,</hi> which is <hi>Piety;</hi> and that the more <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> it is, the leſs able it is to ſatisfy our Mind, but rather raiſes Scruples in the Underſtanding. Whereas on the contrary the more we practiſe <hi>Religion,</hi> the better we are acquainted with it, becauſe we grow then ſenſible of its divine <hi>Efficacy</hi> by our own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and are made to believe the true value of it by the Impreſſions it leaves in our Hearts. Had <hi>Religion</hi> indeed been purely deſign'd to teach us how to <hi>Philoſophize</hi> and argue about the Nature of things, it would have been ſufficient to take the Meaſure of it from a <hi>Speculative</hi> Knowledge of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But ſince it was given us to ſanctify our Hearts, it is but reaſonable that <hi>Contemplation</hi> ſhould yield to <hi>Practice,</hi> and the <hi>inward</hi> ſenſe we have of its Divine Efficacy.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Policy</hi> is yet a far greater Enemy to <hi>Religion</hi> than <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Not but that it often happily makes uſe of Religion to keep Men within the Bounds of their Duty; but it pretends to have a Right of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over it. It would have Religion ſubmit to its Orders, whereas <hi>Religion</hi> ſubmits only to the Orders of God. <hi>Policy</hi> generally looks upon the greateſt part of Men as no better than Slaves to thoſe that are in power; but <hi>Religion</hi> in ſpite of <hi>Policy</hi> makes all Men equal, and effectually removes all thoſe Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which humane Paſſions had put between them. <hi>Policy</hi> according to the Prejudices of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> acts as if the Lives of the meaner ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were of no more value than thoſe of Brutes. But <hi>Religion</hi> aſſures us, that the Soul of a <hi>Peaſant</hi> is as dear and precious to God as that of a <hi>Monarch.</hi> What! Says the Ambitious Man, muſt all People become my Equals and Companions? Yes certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, replies <hi>Religion,</hi> and far happier than thou art
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:94927:200"/>
like to be, unleſs thou repenteſt. A great and mighty Character indeed, which truly convinces us that it ſolely ſprings from God, <hi>who is no reſpecter of Perſons;</hi> and not from Men, who give and receive Praiſe and Honour from one another.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Politicians</hi> uſually argue thus. Religion, ſay they, is very uſeful to us to keep Men within the Bounds of their Duty, and bring them under Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Sovereign and the Laws of the State. It follows therefore, that Religion was deſigned for no other End. But this does not follow.</p>
                  <p>And to comprehend that Religion was deſigned for a ſublimer and nobler End, they ought chiefly to conſider, that 'tis no leſs repugnant to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Princes, than the Rebellion of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that it relates not to the Welfare of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate State; but eſſentially tends to promote Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Nations and Kingdoms, and perfect that Union and Society which ought to reign amongſt Men; that it deſpiſes all Prohibitions, <hi>Politick</hi> Laws, and even the ſecular Power when it endeavours to conſtrain it; that all the <hi>Roman</hi> Policy tho' armed with the ſevereſt and moſt cruel Puniſhments that could be thought of, was not powerful enough to ſtop its wonderful Effects; that by teaching Men to deſpiſe Death, and hope for a better Life after this, it puts them above the reach as well of the Promiſes as Threats of Policy; and that by ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying both their Hearts and Conſciences, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that Effect in them, which <hi>Policy</hi> never durſt ſo much as attempt.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. In like manner, <hi>Rhetorick</hi> has been prejudicial to Religion, through the ill uſe Men have made of it. The Objects of the Goſpel, as they were at firſt offered to Men, without any Oſtentation of Wit and Learning, ſtruck their Minds with ſuch Surprize and Admiration, as moved their Hearts,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:94927:201"/>
and made them wholly renounce their deareſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and darling Sins. This was the only <hi>Eloquence</hi> uſed in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times. But the Church after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards unfortunately taking in the filly Vanities of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> the Myſteries of the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came then either Matters of <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Diſputes, or ſubjects of Eloquence; and becauſe this laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its Original from <hi>Poetry,</hi> whoſe grand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation ſolely conſiſts in Fiction, things came to be either diſguiſed and varniſhed, or heightned and exaggerated; and from thence proceed all your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyricks, Funeral Orations, &amp;c. and all thoſe Paradoxes and falſe Tenets ſet off with glittering Reaſons and pompous Language, which in time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſo many monſtrous Opinions. But this we ought the leſs to wonder at, ſince <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and all the charming Expreſſions of humane Invention, are no leſs repugnant to <hi>Religion</hi> than we have ſhew'd <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> to be. For if it becomes not Men to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to comprehend by the help of Philoſophy thoſe Myſteries which God himſelf is pleaſed ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main incomprehenſible, it certainly as ill becomes them to attempt to ſet off with falſe Ornaments of humane Eloquence, thoſe Objects which the Wiſdom of God deſign'd ſhould be adapted to every Mans Capacity, by the ſimple manner after which he was pleaſed to propoſe them.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Laſtly, Even <hi>Grammar,</hi> when differently mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged according to the Paſſions and evil Deſigns of Men, mav ſerve to darken and perplex Religion. This gives occaſion to ſome Mens Complaints, that the <hi>Jewiſh Grammar</hi> is uncertain; that the pointing of it is dubious; that there are ſeveral various Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> that we are ignorant who it was that collected the Books of Scripture, and compoſed the Catalogue of thoſe Books which are to be held <hi>Canonical;</hi> that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:94927:201"/>
when quoting the Prophecies in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, altogether make uſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and are not very exact in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing all the Words of thoſe Texts they mention; that there are many obſcure and imperfect places in them for want of Expreſſions to fill up the Senſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis certain, that this <hi>grammatical</hi> Exactneſs, or rather <hi>Superſtition,</hi> is not very agreeable to our <hi>Faith.</hi> This a certain Author has very well hinted at, when he ſays, <hi>Scriptura non amat nimium diligentes.</hi> And the Reaſons that may be alledged for it are, 1. Becauſe the Objects of the Goſpel are of too great and important concern for the Wiſdom of God to ſuffer them to depend upon the inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Niceties of <hi>Grammar.</hi> If Men dont uſually enquire whether a King's Laws are ſet forth in ſuch words as are altogether in uſe, or whether there be any Tranſpoſitions and Parentheſes, in them; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Rules of <hi>Grammar</hi> are duly obſerved, or who it was that drew them up; if it be enough that we know them to be really the Laws of ſuch a Prince, and that they are clear enough to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by all; I ſay, if thoſe conſiderations are ſufficient to incline us to a due Obſervance of them, I do not ſee how any one can reaſonably raiſe all theſe Difficulties, againſt the Books of Scripture, which have that peculiar Advantage over the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Princes, that the very ſame things are often and often repeated in them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly need no Grammatical alteration.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if the Eſſentials and Subſtance of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion depended upon any ſuch external Alterations, it would follow from thence, that no Man could be a <hi>Christian,</hi> without being firſt a <hi>Critick;</hi> and that he muſt be a perfect Maſter of Languages, before he could be allowed to ſtudy the Means of Salvation;
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:94927:202"/>
and conſequently, that we could make no further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in <hi>Religion,</hi> than we had well employed our Time in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> which certainly is a thing contrary to the Deſign of God, who is pleaſed to call all ſorts of Men to the Knowledge of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>To this we might alſo add, that if Mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was affixed purely to the Order and Diſpoſition of Words and Syllables, they would pay a Reverence to Words and Syllables inſtead of Myſteries; and thus we ſhould inevitably fall into all the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of the ſuperſtitious <hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſe you had lived in the Time of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and had diſtinctly heard them one after another preaching the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, tho' each of them expreſſing himſelf after his particular way, 'tis certain you would never have made your Salvation depend upon their different manner of expreſſing their Thoughts, but upon thoſe Objects they would have unanimouſly laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; and had you been never ſo little moved at thoſe excellent things which they preached and repeated ſeveral ways, it may well be preſumed you would not have cavilled about a few equivocal Words as perhaps eſcaped them, or the Method and Order of their Diſcourſe, or any other inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Trifles of this Kind. Now the <hi>written</hi> Word is of the very ſame Nature with that which they preached, and conſequently we cannot chuſe but paſs the ſame Judgment upon it. For thoſe good and holy Men who ſpoke <hi>as the Spirit gave them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance,</hi> that is, with all Simplicity as was neceſſary for the Accompliſhment of the Deſign of God, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined not in the leaſt that thoſe who were to come after them would be ſo nice in their Judgments, or raiſe any ſuch Scruples againſt their ſo very ſimple and natural Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:94927:202"/>
It is our chiefeſt Concern to regard the <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Eſſential</hi> part of their preaching, and that is God's Deſign, to ſave Mankind by the Death of his Son. To this every thing relates, and it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Three other very great and important Objects, the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> atteſted by the Apoſtles themſelves; the <hi>Completion</hi> of all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> contained in the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt; all which things the Apoſtles ſaw, and clearly and diſtinctly taught Men, and at laſt digeſted in Writing, directed by the Wiſdom of God, when the whole Earth ſeemed full of Aſtoniſhment at the ſight of the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts God poured down upon Men, at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of ſo many Prophecies in the Perſon of <hi>Christ,</hi> and at the ſufferings and Trials of the Witneſſes of God.</p>
                  <p>And this is the main Subſtance of the Writings of the Apoſtles, as well as of their Preaching. And Divine Providence was pleaſed that all thoſe things ſhould be digeſted in Writing, in a time when they could not poſſibly be forged or altered; that they ſhould be received and approved of in all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Societies of the World; that they ſhould be firſt diſperſed every where by an infinite number of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies and Tranſlations of them, then afterwards quoted by almoſt an infinite number of Doctors, carefully preſerved almoſt every where, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried generally into thoſe places whence Perſecution had baniſhed and removed the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Nay, God has pleaſed that thoſe Writers ſhould all conſpire to teach us the ſame things, tho each expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after his own particular way; that the manner of their Compoſitions ſhould be the ſame with that of their Speaking; that they ſhould exactly follow in all their Quotations the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation which was known of the People, and not puzzle the Faith
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:94927:203"/>
of the ſimple and ignorant by any critical Remarks, which were things beneath thoſe Men who had both ſeen and handled <hi>the Word of Life,</hi> had declared the wonderful Works of God, and received the Gift of Tongues, that they might be clearly underſtood by all Men. It was alſo neceſſary, that thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Writers ſhould inſiſt rather upon the things themſelves, that they delivered, than the ordering of their Words, that ſo they might keep up the great Character of their <hi>Office,</hi> and we might learn from thence to regard rather the <hi>Senſe</hi> of what they have written, than the <hi>accuracy</hi> of their Expreſſions. They have ſufficiently expounded all the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Truths of <hi>Religion,</hi> which tho not very many, are yet repeated almoſt in every Page of their Writings. They left to their Diſciples the Care of collecting their Writings, and ſetting together thoſe Canonical Books, which contain all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Salvation: Not that that Collection has all the Writings of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but it contains certain Truths often and often repeated by them ſufficient to promote the Sanctification of Mankind. As for the various Readings, they are ſo few and ſo inconſiderable in themſelves, that they alter not in the leaſt the Senſe of theſe Books, ſo far are they from changing the unalterable Subſtance of <hi>Religion,</hi> in as much as there is no part of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Writings to which it is not inſeparably united, and almoſt every where repeated.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Objections about the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Grammar, and Authority of the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> were all true as is objected, which yet is dubious, it ought not to diſturb us, ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the reſt of his Apoſtles have ſo fully confirmed thoſe Books. Thoſe little and inconſiderable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are far from being prejudicial to our <hi>Faith,</hi> ſince 'tis enough to know that the Scripture is the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:94927:203"/>
Word of God, as we perceive by the Marks and Characters of it. 'Tis enough to be certain that it is impoſſible that either through the Faults of the Tranſcribers, or Negligence of Men, or the want of Exactneſs found in the Tranſlations; or laſtly, through the Multitude of <hi>equivocal</hi> Terms, it ſhould ever want thoſe important Precepts and evident Truths which are neceſſary for our Salvation and Sanctification, and of which 'tis as it were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Repetition: For otherwiſe God muſt either have deceived us, or his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> have been deceived, in being wanting in the preſervation of ſuch Means, as it purely deſign'd to maintain and keep up the Faith of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>However it be, 'tis not our preſent Deſign to blame in the leaſt, either the Care which ſome take to inſtruct themſelves in the Criticiſms of the Holy Scripture, or the Reſpect they have for its Expreſſions, which are indeed worthy to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before all others. God forbid we ſhould ever entertain any ſuch impious and fooliſh Thoughts: We therefore here intend only to aſſert Two things; 1<hi>ſt.</hi> that all thoſe ſmall Difficulties the <hi>Criticks</hi> raiſe againſt them, ought not to be looked upon as any way ſufficient to ſhake the Foundations of our Faith, the Wiſdom of God having wonderfully provided, that our <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould be eſtabliſhed without Reſpect had to thoſe Difficulties. The ſecond is, that thoſe very Difficulties are not only of excellent uſe to humble our Minds, but alſo neceſſary to keep us from the Superſtition of inſiſting only upon a liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Signification, and from that Folly which we may call the <hi>Adoration</hi> of Words.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore grant, that all things, our <hi>Senſes, Education,</hi> the <hi>Curioſity</hi> of the Mind, <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, Philoſophy, Policy, Humane Eloquence,</hi> and <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> are as ſo many Inſtruments which our Paſſions
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:94927:204"/>
employ to make void that Submiſſion which our Faith owes to God; that through the ill uſe we put them to, they are converted into ſo many different ways of ſhaking off that Divine Obedience; and that the Speculations which ſpring from all theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, aim at nothing elſe but the weakning our Faith, juſt as the looſe and remiſs Maxims of ſome <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> tend to the Deſtruction of <hi>Morality;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as difficult for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> to believe, as for our <hi>Heart</hi> to mortifie it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, it may reaſonably be affirmed; 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That this Submiſſion of our ſelves to God, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary; and that unleſs we pay it him by readily receiving the Principles of his <hi>Religion,</hi> we muſt inevitably yield it up to <hi>Matter,</hi> and ſo give up our ſelves to the moſt wretched and impious Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and horrid Darkneſs of Underſtanding; it being moſt certain, that we ſhall no better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, what <hi>Eternity, Infinity, Extenſion,</hi> the manner and neceſſity of the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of Matter is, than we already know what paſſes within God. 2<hi>ly.</hi> That our Heart is diſpoſed to ſuch a ſubmiſſion of Mind in thoſe things which relate to our civil and natural Concern. And if it be certain that we do not defer to receive Nouriſhment, till we are fully inſtructed after what manner Nutrition is made within us, and if we are eaſily induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive the Attraction of the <hi>Magnetick</hi> Stone, tho we are ignorant of the manner of that Operation, why ſhould we not in like manner as eaſily beleive My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, tho we are not able to dive into the manner of them? 3<hi>dly.</hi> This Submiſſion to God is ſo very reaſonable, that none but a Man utterly void of Senſe, can be ſo ſtupid as not to perceive it. For till we are endowed with an infinite Underſtanding, we ſhall never be able to know but one ſide of things, and conſequently we muſt neceſſarily be for ever
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94927:204"/>
ignorant of the other. 4<hi>thly.</hi> It is very juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable, if ever any thing was ſo; and it aims at nothing but ſhewing us our Ignorance, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to us that being liable to be deceived, we ought carefully to follow <hi>Revelation</hi> as a true and faithful Guide. We ſhould certainly be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, proudly to deny our own Ignorance, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly ſuſpect that God could deceive us, when his Deſign is to reveal his Majeſty to us.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. But what is chiefly to be obſerved for the Honour of our <hi>Religion,</hi> what ſhews the Characters of its <hi>Divinity,</hi> and forces us to acknowledge them, is that it teaches us that to ſee clear into matters of Religion; we ought not to rely upon the Light of our Underſtanding, and that we muſt lay aſide the Evidence of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> if we would be free from Errours in point of Faith.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a wonderful Effect of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that it renders us happy, by inducing us to renounce our ſelves; and no leſs admirable that it enlightens our Minds by obliging us to renounce our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>To look boldly and ſtedfaſtly upon <hi>Myſteries</hi> is the way to be blind; whereas we ſhall eaſily perceive the Light of God ſhining about us, if we do but humbly caſt down our Eyes. We ſhall be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently learned if we reſt ſatisfied with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what God has been pleaſed to reveal unto us: And nothing more betrays an Univerſal Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance than an inſignificant Deſire to be ignorant of nothing. In other Sciences a Man's Skill is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by his Knowledge; but in that of <hi>Salvation,</hi> he is beſt inſtructed who is moſt humble; he who has the leaſt Pride has the moſt underſtanding. And the proof of it is eaſy. We have already ſeen that the nice Speculations of Reaſon about Myſteries do but more perplex and darken what was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94927:205"/>
Let us now ſee how much the ſubmitting our Reaſon to Faith makes us have a clearer Inſight into thoſe Myſteries, or at leaſt how much it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our being confounded by them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, that by continuing in ſuch a ſtate of <hi>Humility,</hi> whatſoever Difficulties may ariſe, they will not have force enough to diſcompoſe our Minds. We ſhall not be ſurpriſed that we are not able to comprehend the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, or his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Knowing, loving</hi> and <hi>acting;</hi> or his <hi>Eternity, Immenſity,</hi> &amp;c. but we ſhall rather be raviſhed with Admiration to think that we that are no better than <hi>Worms</hi> or <hi>Atoms,</hi> are yet thought worthy to know him, and raiſed to that pitch of Glory, as to have ſome Proſpect, tho but a faint one of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Works and infinite Perfections.</p>
                  <p>Neither ſhall we have any reaſon to be offended becauſe, God formerly abandon'd the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and caſts away other Nations which ſtill abide in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Ignorance and Darkneſs; tho perhaps there is nothing in Nature ſo difficult, or incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Conduct of God. But we ſhall rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon our Selves, and endeavour to ſearch into the Knowledge of our own Nature. And upon ſuch a conſideration we ſhall find our ſelves buried and ſwallowed up, if I may ſo ſpeak, in ſome Corner of this vaſt Univerſe, and that too in ſuch a Time or conjuncture as is a meer Point, in compariſon of that almoſt infinite <hi>Duration</hi> of Time which has elapſed, and that <hi>Eternity</hi> which is ſtill to paſs away. We ſhall only perceive a few Years and a few Nations, which we aſcribe to Providence as its Object; as if that which preſides over the whole Creation were to be bounded by a few Ages or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But weak and fooliſh Creatures that we are, we perceive not that infinite Succeſſion of Objects which take their Turn, and move on according to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94927:205"/>
the Decree of eternal Wiſdom; we perceive not the ſtrict union of this World with that which is to come, or the ſhare thoſe Nations (whoſe Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we ſo much deplore) have in that continued Chain of Events; nor the Rights which Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice has over them, or at leaſt we have but a faint and imperfect Knowledge of them: We conſider not that a thouſand Years are as one Day, and one Day as a thouſand Years; one Nation as an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Nations, and an hundred Nations as one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his ſight, who is able to create an infinite number of them out of Nothing, as he did us. And in this we may be compared to thoſe, who lying in the bottom of a Well, would fain ſee the whole Extent of the Heavens.</p>
                  <p>Were we truly ſenſible of our wretched Nature, we ſhould not be ſo curious or inconſiderate, but rather dread the Fate of thoſe Men who were ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from above, for having looked into the Ark of God. We ſhould find out the Falſity of thoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which are the products of a raſh Curioſity; and whilſt we limited our Enquiries by Revelation, we ſhould eaſily diſcern thoſe that went beyond it. We ſhould diſtinguiſh <hi>Religion</hi> which mortiſies us, from <hi>Superſtition</hi> which flatters and agreeably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes us; and however <hi>Policy</hi> in the height of its Pride might rank us among Creatures not much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to Brutes, we ſhould not ceaſe to think our ſelves the Children of God. No Charms of <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> ſhould impoſe upon our Belief; no idle Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties of <hi>Grammar</hi> perplex that Faith which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Objects of the Goſpel, which are indeed too manifeſt in their Nature, too often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and cloſely united to the Principles of Common Senſe; too well confirmed and atteſted by their Events; too worthy of God himſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce too much to our Sanctification to be ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:94927:206"/>
in queſtion. In a word, we ſhould then ſhake off our Incredulity, when we removed that which excited within us a ſecret Propenſion to it.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore certain, that God has covered the Myſteries of Religion with a ſacred Darkneſs, and has even permitted Men to make them yet more obſcure by their vain Speculations. But what at once gives us Wonder and Conſolation, is that the deepeſt Philoſophers and moſt curious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers ſee not always cleareſt into the matters of Religion; but thoſe only who make leaſt uſe of the force of their Reaſon, and forbear to enquire nicely into thoſe things which it becomes them humbly to believe. This ſeems to be the Opinion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who ſaid to his Father, <hi>I thank thee O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou hast hid theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and haſt reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them unto Babes,</hi> Mat. 5. 11.</p>
                  <p>And here indeed we cannot but tremble with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Admiration, when we joyn this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Divinity of our Religion to the reſt. Hence it is that we muſt renounce our ſelves, and beg of Almighty God that he would enlighten our Underſtanding, when we perceive that ſuch a ſublime and elevated Science, which offers ſuch noble and magnificent Objects to our Conſideration, is yet conceived by thoſe only that are <hi>pure in Heart.</hi> Here then ought we to cry out, what a Divine Religion is this! Which at once enlightens and humbles us, which amazes, and yet clears our Underſtanding; which leads us to ſaving Knowledge by the free and ready confeſſion of our own Ignorance; and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the Imperfections of our Underſtanding by making it ſubmit to Faith. <hi>Where is the Wiſe? Where is the Diſputer of this World?</hi>

                     <hi>IX</hi> Portraiture of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> or, the Conformity of its <hi>Myſteries</hi> to the Lights of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HAving look'd into the Original of all our falſe Prejudices, 'tis now no difficult matter to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh <hi>Religion</hi> from <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> from <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Without ſuch a Diſtinction we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably fall into the greateſt Difficulties; and by it 'tis eaſy to demonſtrate, that <hi>Religion</hi> contains no greater Difficulties than even <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Doctrin of <hi>Predestination,</hi> of Grace and <hi>Original Sin,</hi> are ſuch unfathomable Depths as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify at firſt view the Mind of him that endeavours to reconcile them to the Light of Nature, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I already hear a Multitude of Doctors crying out againſt me, that I ought not to preſume to dive into thebottom of thoſe profound Myſteries, which confound their Reaſon, the more attentively they conſider and reflect upon them.</p>
                  <p>But I beg leave of thoſe worthy Men, to tell them, that all thoſe matters would ſeem to them leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than they do, were they leſs <hi>Philoſophers</hi> than they are. And I would have them always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reaſon, Divinity</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> are eſſentially diſtinct one from the other, in as much as the former barely perceives the Object it ſelf, without endeavouring to ſearch into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, and conſiſts in that Submiſſion which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents its further Enquiries, Pride and Raſhneſs being contrary to it; whereas the latter continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to know both the things and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them, together with the <hi>Phyſical</hi> Cauſes of them, having no greater Enemy than <hi>Ignorance,</hi> to oppoſe its Progreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:94927:207"/>
Accordingly a <hi>Divine</hi> ought only to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſuch thing as <hi>Grace, Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Original Sin,</hi> &amp;c. But a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied-with a bare Knowledge of it, will yet further enquire, what is the order of the immutable Decrees of God, after what manner <hi>Grace</hi> determines our <hi>Free Will,</hi> and by what means <hi>Original Sin</hi> was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the firſt Man to his Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles, who were the trueſt, and indeed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divines, that confined themſelves within the due Limits of Divinity, have very largely inſtructed us in all thoſe Objects, by fully demonſtrating the truth and neceſſity of them; yet have not let fall the leaſt Word that could give us an Inſight into the manner of them. But the ſucceeding <hi>Chriſtians</hi> applying themſelves to the ſtudy of the <hi>Platonic</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Philoſophy, really thought the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Salvation a <hi>Science</hi> as well as the reſt, and thereupon framed to themſelves many fruitleſs and unprofitable <hi>Speculative Systems,</hi> which in many places were repugnant to Piety, and perplex'd our Divine Religion with ſeveral humane Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>It would be injurious to imagin, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his large Diſcourſe about the Doctrin of <hi>Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> aimed at nothing elſe but to gratify the vain Curioſity of thoſe he addreſs'd himſelf to. All that he there ſays, tho' ſeemingly <hi>Speculative,</hi> is in reality <hi>Practical.</hi> The Queſtion was, Whether the Diſtinction that was between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gtntiles</hi> was not wholly taken away; and if ſo, whether the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not to make up one and the ſame Body with the beliving <hi>Jews?</hi> Thoſe of the Circumciſion being accuſtomed to look upon the <hi>Heathens</hi> as a People that were curſed, could not eaſily imagin that they ſhould ever enjoy the ſame Privileges with them. But St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                     <pb n="401" facs="tcp:94927:207"/>
endeavours to confute this Prejudice of theirs; and to that purpoſe he ſhews them, that God is the God of all Men; that he ſuffered that all Men ſhould Sin, that he might thereby extend his Grace to all; that the Choice he made of the <hi>Jews</hi> for his peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was a free and liberal Election; that 'twas by by Faith alone, and not by Works that the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> were acceptable to him; that his Mercies were not entailed upon the Poſterity of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs; that the Circumciſion of the Fleſh was not the reaſon of their Acceptance with God; that the Law of it ſelf could not have that effect; that it was not for the Good Works of <hi>Jacob</hi> that his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity was preferred before that of <hi>Eſau;</hi> for whilſt the Children were yet in their Mothers Womb, and had done neither Good nor Evil, it was told <hi>Rebekah,</hi> conſulting the Divine Oracle about them, <hi>that the Elder ſhould ſerve the Younger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Reflections to be made upon this Doctrin of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are theſe, 1. That the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity there was then to treat of thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the urgent occaſion that obliged the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to ſpeak of them is now wholly at an end; for there's none among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that either calls or ought to call in Queſtion the Election of thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> who ſincerely believed the Goſpel: So that if we happen now adays to be ingaged in any eager Diſputes about thoſe matters, 'tis meerly out of a Principle of Vanity, or Obſtinacy, or a raſh and impious Curioſity. Every thing was <hi>practical</hi> in St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe of Predeſtination, whereas thoſe are wholly <hi>Speculative</hi> that are in theſe latter Days compoſed about it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had no other Deſign but to create Peace and Charity between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by ſhewing them that they were both the Object of the Divine Election: But now this Doctrin is changed into <hi>Speculation</hi> and <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:94927:208"/>
and has no other uſe but to create Scandalous Diviſions in <hi>Christian</hi> Societies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The beſt and ſureſt Method in this Caſe is to imitate the Modeſty of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who barely aſſerted the thing, taking great care not to ſearch into the manner of it. He only ſpoke of Election in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And when his curious and impertinent Reaſon went about to examine the performance of it, he only cryed out; <hi>O the Depth of the Riches!</hi> &amp;c. It muſt be confeſſed St. <hi>Paul</hi> had as much Wit as any modern Divines can pretend to, and ſo could have framed as probable Syſtems of the Conſent and Harmony of the Decrees of God, or have found out either in the ill uſe we make of our <hi>Free Will;</hi> or in the Springs of our Soul, wherewith to ſolve theſe Difficulties. Yet he never attempted it. And the reaſon was, he was a true <hi>Divine,</hi> and not a meer <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and knew very well that the moſt eſſential part of Faith conſiſts in humbly caſting down our Eyes before the dark ſide of the Myſtery.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But becauſe we are allowed to conceive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters after our own way, and that it would otherwiſe be utterly impoſſible for us to ſpeak of them, ſo may we alſo diſtinguiſh the ſeveral Decrees of God; We may conceive them depending upon, and ſubordinate one to another; but ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Truth of this Principle, <hi>Deus non vult hoc propter hoc, ſed vult hoc eſſe propter hoc,</hi> yet we ſhould appear no more reaſonable for urging againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the Difficulties which ariſe from this Order of the Decrees of God, than if a Man ſhould pretend to raiſe very ſerious Objections againſt the Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we conceive between the Hands and Feet and Eyes of God. For as we ſhould readily anſwer the the latter, that he did not do well in urging too far thoſe figurative and humane ways of ſpeaking; ſo ſhould we tell the former, that there being no real
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:94927:208"/>
dependence or diſtinction in the Decrees of God, he need not be perplexed at thoſe Difficulties that ſeem to take their riſe from it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the mean while I grant it ought to be our chiefeſt Concern to range thoſe Decrees in an order moſt conformable to our own Reaſon, and moſt worthy the Majeſty of God. Being therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to conceive God under the notion of a Man, it is but reaſonable we ſhould conceive him under the notion of a <hi>Wiſe and Prudent</hi> one. It muſt be confeſſed that there can be no greater Extravagance than that of thoſe <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Divines, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo fierce a War about the manner of conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Order of the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God. The Apoſtles themſelves never argued about them. They were neither <hi>Supralapſarians,</hi> nor <hi>

The ſame that is common to all thoſe ſeveral ſorts of Divines; that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our Catechiſms; which does not require we ſhould go through a Courſe of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can underſtand its Precepts; that which teaches us purely the Thing it ſelf, and not the Manner after which it is brought to paſs; that, in ſhort, which procures Peace and good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and not that which is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Cauſe of all their Diſſentions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There are Two things to be conſidered in the Doctrin of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> as it is offered to us by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> The Expreſſion, and the Thing it ſelf. The Expreſſion indeed may ſometimes ſeem to us ſtrange and unuſual, becauſe we are not very well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> the Apoſtles were often wont to uſe in their Diſcourſes. Thus for inſtance, this Expreſſion <hi>God hardeneth,</hi> which ſeems to denote a
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:94927:209"/>
poſitive act unworthy of God, ſignifies only, that God does not uſe to take away the hardneſs of Heart. As for the Thing it ſelf, there are two ſeveral E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, a <hi>general,</hi> and a <hi>particular</hi> Election, both which may well be ſuppoſed to be ſpoken of in the 9<hi>th. Chap.</hi> of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the general Election of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation St. <hi>Paul</hi> undertakes to ſhew that it did not depend upon any external Cauſes, but that it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſole Will and good Pleaſure of God. He tells us, it was not on the account of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of <hi>Jacob,</hi> (as the <hi>Jews</hi> imagined) that <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had been preferred before the Poſterity of <hi>Edom,</hi> ſince long before the Children had done either Good or Evil. <hi>Rebekah</hi> was told that ſhe carried two great Nations in her Womb, meaning her two Sons, and that <hi>the Elder ſhould ſerve the Younger.</hi> And that the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſpeaks in this place of a general Election of the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is eaſy to perceive from this Text of <hi>Malachi,</hi> Chap. 1. v. 2, 3. which he quotes as follows, <hi>I have loved you, ſaith the Lord; yet ye ſay, wherein haſt thou loved us? Was not Eſau Jacob's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? ſaith the Lord: Yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Eſau, and laid his Mountains and his Heritage Waſte, for the Dragons of the Wilderneſs. Whereas Edom ſaith, we are impoveriſhed, but we will return,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis paſt all diſpute that <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeaks here of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from whence we cannot but conclude, that 'tis alſo the intent of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak of their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the 9<hi>th.</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which exactly agrees with the precedent and following Words. For in the foregoing Verſes he ſhews us, that in order to be admitted into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> 'tis not ſufficient to be of the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham according to the Fleſh,</hi> but 'tis further requiſite we ſhould be ſo by Faith, beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe it was ſaid, <hi>in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd that <hi>Iſaac was the Son of the Promiſe.</hi> And in
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:94927:209"/>
the following Verſes, the Apoſtle introduces <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaking after this manner, <hi>I will call them my people which were not my people; and her beloved which was not beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed but that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks alſo of the Election of private perſons, and makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in thoſe excellent words of the foregoing Chapter, where he ſays, <hi>whom he did foreknow, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did predeſtinate to be conformed, &amp;c. Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified,</hi> &amp;c. and a little further he adds, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect,</hi> &amp;c. Now 'tis obſervable, that this continued Chain of Benefits does not make make any Order in the Decree it ſelf, but in its execution. So that the Sum of all that may be gathered from theſe Words, is to this effect, that God predeſtinates us, and that having predeſtinated us, he calls us, he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us, and he glorifies us; all which thus far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no conſiderable Difficulty.</p>
                  <p>Let us not then carry our Enquiries higher than that Apoſtle did his; and ſince he never argued <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically</hi> concerning the Order of the Decrees of God, let us lay aſide all thoſe unprofitable Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which will vaniſh of themſelves, when we have ſuppoſed the Simplicity of the Divine Nature; or if we muſt needs <hi>Philoſophize</hi> upon it, let us at leaſt ſeparate our <hi>Philoſophy</hi> from our <hi>Faith,</hi> and make a Difference betwixt our own Reaſoning, and the Notions of the Holy Ghoſt; let us not vainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend barely about the manner of conceiving the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things.</p>
                  <p>Were there are a right underſtanding amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to make that happy Diſtinction between <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Divinity,</hi> which we require of them, by keeping themſelves within the Bounds of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <pb n="406" facs="tcp:94927:210"/>
which barely informs us of the nature of the thing, and rejecting in matters of Religion all <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> which endeavours to dive into the manner of it, it would be the ſureſt method to extinguiſh all thoſe Sects which rage among us, and reſtore all things to the <hi>primitive</hi> Unity and Simplicity of the Apoſtolical Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrin of <hi>Predestination</hi> would then be no longer a confuſed Heap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Darkneſs, Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and endleſs Difficulties, as it is now adays, through the fault and neglect of Men; 'Twould then appear to us more conformable to Reaſon to hold Predeſtination than otherwiſe. For if there be a God, he cannot but foreſee what will become of Men, and that they will fall into Miſery and Sin. And if ſome of them be ſaved, 'twould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſurd to think that God deſigned them not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And this Doctrin of Predeſtination, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Speculations of <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and vain inquiries of humane Curioſity, is wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in theſe two Propoſitions; God foreſees the Sin and Miſery of Mankind, and ſome part of them he deſigned to Save, according to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>thoſe whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> &amp;c. Now can any thing be more reaſonable than theſe two Principles are?</p>
                  <p>For if a wiſe Man can be ſaid to foreſee the Time to come by the Rules of his Prudence and Conduct, would it not be below the Majeſty of God, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him ignorant of Futurity, who was the Author of Time? Is it poſſible he would not as yet be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Salvation of Mankind? And can it be ſuppoſed that Man ſhould be ſaved as it were by an unforeſeen Chance, againſt his Will? What would become of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> if what he did, proceeded not from the Deſign he had to ſave us? Could he
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:94927:210"/>
have ſent his Son into the World, and yet deny Salvation to thoſe who were to be born after the coming of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There occurs in all this but one Difficulty, which is the ſame that St. <hi>Paul</hi> urged to himſelf, when he ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt ſay then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath reſiſted his Will?</hi> Are we guilty then, will the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſay, becauſe we were not ſooner partakers of his Light? Or how can I be ſaved, the <hi>Reprobate</hi> will cry out, ſince God did not predeſtinate me to Salvation? To this we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, We muſt not call in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> to our aſſiſtance to avoid this Difficulty, which is common to all <hi>Syſtems,</hi> and in ſome becomes greater. St. <hi>Paul</hi> went no further than this; let us in imitation of him ſtop there alſo: Let the Bounds of <hi>Revelation,</hi> be thoſe alſo of our vain Curioſity. The greater skill <hi>Philoſophy</hi> affords us to ſolve this Objection, the further it removes us from the Truth, which ſeemed wholly impenetrable to a Writer far more learned than us, and who was forced to cry out when he reflected upon it, <hi>O the Depth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſy to ſhew that this is a common Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. We cannot own the <hi>Existence</hi> of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſcribing to him a Fore-knowledge of the Time to come; and it is certainly true, that to explicate the Divine <hi>Preſcience,</hi> will produce in us the ſame intricate Doubts, as <hi>Predeſtination;</hi> ſo that both of them being infallibly true, 'tis utterly impoſſible to go againſt either of them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis further evident, that this Difficulty is no leſs conſiderable in natural things, than it is in thoſe that concern Religion. For if God can foreſee the Time to come, he muſt of neceſſity have foreſeen and ſet Bounds to our Lives; which if true, we may eat, or not eat, we may preſerve, or not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Selves, it being all one; ſince we cannot
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:94927:211"/>
exceed, or come ſhort of thoſe Limits which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has preſcribed us.</p>
                  <p>Whence I conclude, That the Doctrin of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination contains two ſorts of Difficulties; the firſt, which ſpring from the too refined Notions of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which ought not to perplex our Minds; for we are not obliged to anſwer them: The ſecond, which are natural, and common to all the Affairs of Life, ſo ſoon as you have laid down this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, That there is a God who made us, and that he can foreſee that which will certainly come to paſs. For if we are taught both by Experience and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that God hath a knowledge of <hi>Futurity,</hi> and that he hath foreſeen and foretold it upon many Occaſions, as it appears by the fulfilling of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, 'tis evident from thence, that both Experience and Reaſon perſwade us to receive the moſt difficult things, or rather the only Difficulty that is implied in the Doctrin of <hi>Predeſtination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame might eaſily be proved in <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> if we diſtinguiſh between the manner and the thing it ſelf: It is true, we are Originally defiled with Sin, <hi>having been ſhapen in iniquity, and conceived in Sin,</hi> and <hi>being by nature Children of Wrath.</hi> The Holy Scripture informs us of the thing it ſelf, becauſe abſolutely neceſſary to our Humility and Sanctification. 'Twas unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to know the manner of it, ſince it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for a Man to know how he fell into a Pit; his buſineſs then being to find the means how to get out of it. And therefore the Holy Scripture is ſilent as to the manner in which <hi>Original Sin</hi> was tranſmitted to us, that is, as to the <hi>Phyſical</hi> manner of its infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Race of Mankind. All the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which Divines generally Start, are meerly <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical,</hi> containing ſuch Difficulties as we are not obliged to anſwer. If we diſtinctly underſtood the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:94927:211"/>
union of our Soul and Body, we might very clearly explain that incomprehenſible Tranſmiſſion of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin; but ſince our Learning can never arrive to that Height, we have great Reaſon to diſtruſt our <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> but be it as it well, the Difficulties proceeding from our vain Curioſity ought not to be taken for the Effects of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> are here in a perfect union, by keeping themſelves within their due Bounds. <hi>Faith</hi> teaches us the thing it ſelf, and <hi>Reaſon</hi> aſſents to it. <hi>Reaſon</hi> comprehends not the manner of it, and <hi>Faith</hi> ſuppoſes it incomprehenſible.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Reaſon</hi> could deny that Men were from their Cradles inclinable to Evil, it would be contrary to <hi>Faith,</hi> which teaches us that Principle. And if <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould flatter us with the hopes of freeing that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from all the Difficulties occuring to thoſe who endeavour to ſearch into the bottom and manner of it, it would be alſo contrary to Reaſon, which knows Faith wholly incapable of ſuch an attempt. But ſince it is not ſo, nothing hinders but that we acknowledge the agreement between Faith and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſame proportion there is between <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> is alſo betwixt <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Senſe:</hi> And as <hi>Faith</hi> is above Reaſon, ſo is Reaſon above <hi>Senſe.</hi> 'Tis an undeniable Truth, that <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver oppoſe one another, altho one of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties cannot comprehend the manner of thoſe things which the other does. Thus for inſtance, <hi>Senſe</hi> teſtifies that there is an <hi>ebbing</hi> and <hi>flowing</hi> of the Sea; and <hi>Reaſon</hi> which is truly convinced by this Teſtimony, together with the unanimous Conſent of Men, agrees to the Truth of it, tho wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of its <hi>Phyſical Cauſe:</hi> If Senſe could certify that this <hi>Phenomenon</hi> could be perfectly known, it would be contrary to Reaſon, which ſcarce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:94927:212"/>
it at all; and if Reaſon abſolutely denied there were any ſuch <hi>Phenomenon,</hi> it would be alſo contrary to Senſe, ſince all unanimouſly teſtify there is ſuch a thing. But Senſe certifies the Exiſtence of that <hi>Phenomenon,</hi> and Reaſon is truly perſwaded that it is ſo. Reaſon thinks it a very hard matter to underſtand, and Senſe affirms not the contrary; <hi>Reaſon</hi> therefore and <hi>Senſe</hi> perfectly well agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſuch is likewiſe the joint Agreement of Faith and Reaſon in the greateſt Myſteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe are Difficulties indeed worthy to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, which <hi>Philoſophy</hi> ſo confidently ſtarts up in matters of <hi>Divinity.</hi> There are many things in Nature, whoſe Exiſtence we readily own, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, tho inconſiderable in it ſelf, the manner of which we can comprehend; and yet it never came into any Man's Mind, that had but common Senſe, to call them in queſtion. If then we ſhew our ſelves ſo very reaſonable in <hi>Natural</hi> things, why ſhould we prove ſo ſenſeleſs in matters of <hi>Religion?</hi> In common things our Underſtanding acts naturally, but in Religion 'tis deluded by the Paſſions which continually ſeek how to ſuggeſt to it new occaſions of Doubting.</p>
                  <p>We may paſs the ſame Judgment upon matters of <hi>Grace.</hi> Do but diſtinguiſh <hi>Philoſophy</hi> from <hi>Divinity,</hi> and you will avoid thereby an infinite number of Difficulties; it being certain that for the moſt part they proceed, either from the eager deſire we have to underſtand what is altogether incomprehenſible, or from the Speculations we have already made upon that we could not comprehend. Now to know the Injuſtice of Men in this, we need but obſerve that moſt of them being fully perſwaded, that God preſerves us, nouriſhes, and ſupports us by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Concurrence, without which the Meat we
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:94927:212"/>
eat, and the Care we have of our Preſervation would ſtand us in no ſtead, and by which we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Subſiſt; yet we never heard that any one did ſeriouſly conclude from thence, that we ought wholly to lay aſide the Care of our own Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſolely rely on the Concurrence of God. We never ſaw any one ſo ſenſleſs as to perplex himſelf with theſe ſorts of needleſs Queſtions; <hi>If it can be ſaid, that I nouriſh my ſelf by taking thoſe Aliments as are abſolutely requiſite for my Preſervation, how can it be reaſonably affirmed that God nouriſhes, or preſerves me? Or if it be God as nouriſhes me, how do I lie under an Obligation of doing it my ſelf?</hi> I ſay, we never heard any of thoſe Difficulties objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Natural</hi> things; whereas it appears they are continually ſtarted in matters of <hi>Religion.</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there are as good Grounds for them in the one as the other; becauſe they conſiſt in the Dependence we have upon the Deity, either in our being <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> already, or <hi>being born again,</hi> or becoming <hi>new Creatures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Nature,</hi> we all know we ſubſiſt only by the Concurrence of God, without inquiring into the manner of it. But in <hi>Religion</hi> we are not content to know that we are Regenerated by <hi>Grace;</hi> we further deſire to ſearch into the manner of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and our principal care is how to find it out; ſo that thoſe very Difficulties which could not perplex Men in matters of Eating and Drinking, ſeem terrible and frightful to them, when 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite they ſhould lead a good Life. If you would know the reaſon of it, you muſt conſult the Heart of Man. 'Twill be ſufficient for us if we Act with as much reaſon in Religion as we do in civil Life.</p>
                  <p>If we conſult the pureſt Lights of Reaſon, it will inform us that 'tis as neceſſary the <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:94927:213"/>
ſhould have its Dependence upon God, as that the Creature ſhould depend upon him; becauſe God himſelf is as well the Author of the one as of the other; and as our Bodies have neither <hi>Life, Motion</hi> nor <hi>Being</hi> but from him, ſo our Souls have no <hi>Faculties, Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Affections,</hi> but what they derive from thence. Every Being comes from him, and nothing but what is defective can have any other Principle.</p>
                  <p>The thing it ſelf then is very certain, I mean that there is ſuch a <hi>Grace</hi> to which we muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily refer all the good that is within us, and that belongs to <hi>Divinity.</hi> But the manner of its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, the degree of virtue it diſplays over us, the manner in which it determines our <hi>Free-will,</hi> its minuteſt Conjunctures, &amp;c. may be hidden My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries belonging to the conſideration of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> but not in the leaſt prejudicial to our Faith, which conſiſts in an humble Submiſſion, as well as in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and can as readily profeſs its utter Ignorance of a hidden Myſtery, as it gladly perceives it when revealed.</p>
                  <p>I queſtion, whether <hi>Divines</hi> have obſerved, that when the Apoſtles are pleaſed to point out to us what is moſt eminent in Myſteries, they neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Order of the Decrees of God, nor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Tranſmiſſion of Original Sin, whereby the Wickedneſs of the Firſt Man was conveyed down to us; nor why <hi>Grace</hi> ſeems incompatible with <hi>Free-will:</hi> Whence proceeds this, if not from their Ignorance of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and want of vain Curioſity, which by their own Example they deſigned to teach us to avoid?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What is then, according to them, the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſs? This is it,</hi> God was manifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, believed on in the World, preached unto the Gentiles, received up into Glory, <hi>Tim. 3. 16.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:94927:213"/>
The <hi>Incarnation</hi> which is expreſſed in theſe Words, <hi>God was manifest in the Fleſh,</hi> is a great and ſublime Myſtery; but if we lay aſide our Prejudices, we ſhall find it conformable to our Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For it muſt be firſt of all granted, that in this Covenant, the Almighty debaſes not himſelf in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of thoſe with whom he makes it, as we ſee in diſhonourable Treaties, where a King is upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual terms with his Subjects. This is a Covenant wherein God unites himſelf to the Creature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminiſhing his Greatneſs and Glory, and where the Creature unites it ſelf to God without loſing its due ſenſe of Humility. The Sun unites himſelf with the Cloud where it imprints its Brightneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Eclipſe; and why ſhould not God unite himſelf with an innocent Nature, without leſſening his real Worth and Dignity?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have an excellent Repreſentation of this Truth, in the Union of our Soul and Body, where two Subſtances diſtinct in the higheſt degree are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited together, without having any natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt them. What has the Soul to do with the Body? And how can there be any Affinity betwixt things of ſo different a Nature? It may perhaps be anſwered, that there is a greater Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity betwixt the <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, than the Soul and the Body. I agree, that the Diſpari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is infinitely greater; but the Diverſity is ſtill the ſame; and there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an Union which carries a mutual dependence along with it, ſuch as that of our Soul and Body, and an Union, which contains the dependence only on the one part, ſuch as that which is betwixt the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Nature. And what is moſt ſurpriſing, in the former of thoſe two Unions, is to ſee that the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is ſo noble a Being, ſhould be ſo cloſely faſtened and united to <hi>Matter,</hi>
                     <pb n="414" facs="tcp:94927:214"/>
and even depend upon it in all its Operations. Now 'tis not ſo with the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And it can never be ſaid, that the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> depends on the <hi>Humane;</hi> but contrariwiſe, 'tis the <hi>Humane</hi> Nature which depends on the <hi>Divine.</hi> In this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion God remains the ſame as before, <hi>All-perfect, All-mighty, All-full, Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immutable;</hi> but Man is changed, and ſanctified, and exalted by it. What Inconveniency then can there reſult from it? As it is ſurpriſing to ſee a moſt noble <hi>Being</hi> ſubject to a leſs perfect <hi>Being;</hi> ſo it is natural for a leſs perfect Being to be ſubject to one more Noble. Now the latter of theſe the Myſtery of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrates; and the Union of the Soul with the Body diſcovers the former. It follows hence therefore, that the Union of the Soul with the Body is in ſome ſenſe very extraordinary, and far more ſurpriſing than the Myſtery of the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

If ſtill you require another Repreſentation of this Object, that might further give you a clearer Notion of the ſame, Conceive a <hi>falſe Sun,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two different things, ſo cloſely united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they ſeem as it were confounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz.</hi> A Cloud, and the Light of the Sun. The Cloud is not the Sun, nor is the Sun the Cloud; And thus the <hi>Humane</hi> Nature of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Nature the ſame with the <hi>Humane.</hi> This <hi>falſe Sun,</hi> is a Sun, and yet a Cloud; ſo likewiſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is God, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Man. This falſe Sun is formed of the Subſtance of the Earth, becauſe it is compoſed of a Cloud, which is nothing elſe but the Vapours of it; and of the Sun himſelf, being formed out of thoſe Beams in which the Body of that Planet conſiſts; ſo in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner <hi>Chriſt</hi> is taken from the Earth and is a part of the common Lump of Mankind, becauſe he is
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:94927:214"/>
Man, which does not hinder him from being the Subſtance of the Father, ſince he is <hi>the Brightneſs of his Glory.</hi> This is a very juſt Repreſentation of that great Myſtery, but not perfect. But we hope every juſt and equitable Reader will eaſily forgive the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this Compariſon in a Subject that is ſo far exalted above our weak Imagination.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Moreover of all thoſe who pretended to treat of the Nature of the Deity, none but the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who thought it was idle and lazy, divided it entirely from its Creatures; and all other Men beſides, looked upon it as united to its Works. The <hi>Heathens,</hi> for inſtance, imagined it was affixed to their Temples and Statues, to which they ſuppoſed it conſtantly united. But the <hi>Jews</hi> more properly looked upon God as being united in a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner to a <hi>Buſh,</hi> or a <hi>Cloud,</hi> or the <hi>Ark.</hi> And ſeveral of the Incredulous now adays repreſent the Deity to themſelves as an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Soul affixed to <hi>univerſal Matter,</hi> juſt as our Soul is united to our Body. If then it be ſo common to Men to conceive God as being united to his Works, why ſhould it ſeem ſo ſtrange to them to repreſent him as cloſely united to the Humane Nature of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that too in a more particular manner than to any of his other Creatures? For if there be any Creature which the Deity may be united to, it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be ſuch an holy and innocent Creature as that is. And if it be poſſible for God to unite himſelf to any living Body, it is much more likely he ſhould impart himſelf to the Soul of <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> If an <hi>Ark</hi> was capable to be filled with the Preſence of God, there is not the leaſt Difficulty in conceiving that Humane Nature being <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and far <hi>perfecter</hi> than all the <hi>Arks</hi> in the World, ſhould have been thus honoured in a more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And if Men, in ſhort, ſtick not to make the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:94927:215"/>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Soul</hi> as it were depending upon <hi>Matter</hi> by its Union to it, why ſhould we refuſe to admit of an Union which leaves to God his intire Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and Liberty, and aims at nothing elſe but the bringing the Body and Soul of <hi>Christ</hi> in a greater ſubjection to Him?</p>
                  <p>We no ſooner embrace the Myſtery of the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> but every thing that ſeems offenſive in the Doctrin of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> will preſently vaniſh. We ſhall then eaſily comprehend that 'twas poſſible for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to die, ſince he was Man; and that his Death is infinitely valuable, ſince he was God. And ſo great is the Dignity which proceeds from the Union of thoſe two Natures, that it makes the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> equivalent to the Puniſhments our Sins had ſo juſtly deſerved.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall not then think it difficult to be fully convinced of the Truth of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Lord; for it would be unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that a Nature as had been honoured with ſo particular an Union to the Deity, ſhould yet have been for ever diſſolv'd, and remain'd to all Eternity under the Power of Death: But we ſhall think it very reaſonable to imagin that it could not but have riſen from the Grave, into which it had been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſcend. If then <hi>Chriſt</hi> be truly riſen from the Dead, can our Incredulous Reaſon ſtill refuſe to believe that we ſhall alſo riſe again?</p>
                  <p>But how can that Reaſon contradict a Truth which the Diſciples ſaw? They beheld the Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both in the Miracles which he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in his Holineſs of life: They ſaw God manifeſted in the Fleſh, and were Witneſſes of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Lord: They perceived Angels coming down towards him: The Goſpel was preached to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by their Miniſtry: The World believed on their Preaching; and Laſtly,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:94927:215"/>
they ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſcending into Heaven, all which were very ſenſible and evident matters of Fact.</p>
                  <p>The Myſtery then of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> tho the hardeſt to comprehend of all thoſe of <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> implies however nothing contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But we muſt except the moſt Holy and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> another Myſtery, which being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exalted above the reach of our ſhallow Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, is not eaſily reconcilable to it. Nevertheleſs 'tis moſt certain, that the Sublimity of its Nature renders it not any ways repugnant to Reaſon. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Becauſe the word <hi>Perſon</hi> is not to be taken in the ſame ſenſe with that of <hi>Eſſence.</hi> I grant that three <hi>Perſons</hi> and one <hi>Perſon,</hi> one <hi>Eſſence</hi> and three <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences</hi> implie a Contradiction; but the Notion of one <hi>Eſſence</hi> and three <hi>Perſons</hi> is not liable to any, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you know the Signification of thoſe two Terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe the Deity is ſo great and ſo ſublime a Subject, that we ought not to wonder if we can't reach to the Greatneſs of it by our weak Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 3<hi>dly.</hi> Becauſe for ought we know, the moſt conſiderable Difficulties of this Myſtery proceed from a Defect of <hi>Revelation;</hi> or the ſilence which holy Writ obſerves on that account. Perhaps we ſhould not think it at all hard to conceive, if the Holy Ghoſt had been pleaſed to reveal its Nature a little more clearly to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But ſuch is the wonderful Conduct of God, who is reſolved to humble us, and not to ſatisfy our vain Curioſity nor indulge the Pride of our Underſtanding, which is too greedy of Knowledge. 4<hi>thly.</hi> Becauſe we are not wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Images, there being ſeveral capable to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that Object, tho never ſo incomprehenſible in it ſelf. Thus for inſtance, the ſame Soul is an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> as it perceives; a <hi>Will,</hi> as it has a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and a <hi>Memory,</hi> as it recalls the things paſt to the Mind; all which three Faculties are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:94927:216"/>
in one and the ſame Underſtanding. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo the ſame Light is in the Heavens a <hi>Sun;</hi> in the Air, <hi>Brightneſs;</hi> and in the Cloud, a <hi>falſe Sun.</hi> 5<hi>thly.</hi> To all this we may yet further add, that the greateſt Difficulties of this Myſtery proceed from thoſe Speculations in which <hi>School Divinity</hi> has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved it, to the great Scandal of our Faith, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Confuſion of our Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>For who can endure the Liberty thoſe <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi> Divines have taken, in pretending to form and decide ridiculous, raſh, and impious Queſtions concerning that greateſt Myſtery of our Religion? Can we think any reaſonable Man could read all their impertinent Queſtions without Indignation? As, whether ſeveral Divine Perſons could take but one and the ſame Perſon? Whether the <hi>Word</hi> could have taken upon him in an <hi>Hypoſtatical</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Form of an <hi>Angel,</hi> of a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> of a <hi>Woman,</hi> of an inſenſible <hi>Being,</hi> of an <hi>Accident,</hi> of an <hi>Act</hi> of Sin, of a <hi>Devil;</hi> ſo that if theſe Propoſitions were true, <hi>God is a Sin, a,</hi> &amp;c. Whether the <hi>Word</hi> has taken the Soul in an <hi>Hypoſtatical</hi> Union rather than the Body, or the Body rather than the Soul? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if Man had not Sinned, the <hi>Word</hi> would not have taken our Fleſh upon him? Whether Humane Nature was firſt united to the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or the <hi>Perſon?</hi> Whether the Humane Nature was united to the Divine by ſeveral Unions? Whether a Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may take upon it ſelf the Form of a created Perſon? Whether Humanity was united to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Christ</hi> by way of <hi>Accident,</hi> or of <hi>Subſtance?</hi> Whether the Humane and the Divine Nature are a part of <hi>Christ,</hi> and whether <hi>Christ</hi> be two ſeveral things? Whether <hi>Christ</hi> be of a create or uncreate Unity? How it came to paſs he did not take upon him the very individual Nature of <hi>Adam?</hi> Whether this Propoſition, <hi>Chriſt is Man,</hi> was true during
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:94927:216"/>
thoſe three Days he remained in the Grave? Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould have died of old Age, had he not been crucified in his Youth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the only Difficulties that occur in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> As for the reſt 'tis ſo eſſentially, ſo viſibly, and ſo neceſſarily agreeable to Reaſon, that we cannot but wonder that our Incredulous Adverſaries have not yet perceived it. This we have already ſufficiently proved in ſeveral places of this Work, and we cannot well inſiſt further upon it, without repeating again what has been already ſaid.</p>
                  <p>It is ſufficient therefore to obſerve, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is as it were the Reaſon of <hi>Nature, Society</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> He is the Light enlightening every thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we ſhould fall into infinite Troubles and Perplexities. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Center of all Events, which ſeemingly relate to his coming; he is the Center of Truths, which are the more clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the nearer we approach him; the Center of all the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies, which are meer Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance in themſelves if they relate not to him; the Center of all Virtues, which have no ſufficient Force or Motives able to induce us to practiſe them, but by the conſideration of Life and Immortality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Center and Foundation of the inviolable Rule of Conſcience, which would be nothing elſe but Errour and Illuſion, if the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith</hi> were a Fable. The Center of all thoſe Characters of Wiſdom viſibly diplay'd in all the Works of God, ſince nothing but the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> can lead Man to the true End of his Creation; none but that can juſtify the Wiſdom of God; the Center of all the Hopes of Man; for what is there that he could hope for, if <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were a Lye? The Center of all the Evidence and Certainty that is in our Knowledge; for what is there that we could be certain of, if our Soul were only a Diſpoſition of
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:94927:217"/>
                     <hi>Atoms,</hi> and had no ſuch <hi>Spirituality</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> as that imputed to it by the <hi>Chriſtian Religion?</hi> There need have been only a different Configuration of Parts to form <hi>first Notions</hi> quite contrary to thoſe we now have. Let any one therefore cloſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Matter, and it will appear to him, that if we deny <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who teaches to know our own ſelves in revealing to us Life and Immortality, no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be expected either for Reaſon or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

                  <p>THere is nothing truer than that the <hi>Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is great, noble and divine; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reflect on the Greatneſs of its <hi>Miracles,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of its <hi>Morality,</hi> the Purity of its <hi>Doctrin,</hi> the Holineſs of its <hi>Precepts,</hi> and the Completion of its <hi>Prophecies,</hi> without immediately acknowledging it to be ſtampt with Divine Characters. But yet we ſhall find it altogether defective, if we ſeparate it from <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſince its Eſſence conſiſts in its relation to that.</p>
                  <p>We cannot conceive without it, how God can be the God of one Nation, and yet not be that too of other Nations alſo; that the Deity ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a material <hi>Ark,</hi> and being the Father of Spirits ſhould ſo carefully ſeek after an external and corporeal Purity; that unwilling to ſatisfy his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> he ſhould require Sacrifices of Men; or if wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be appeaſed by Offerings and Oblations, he ſhould demand ſuch mean ones of them, which were unworthy the Majeſty of his God-head; that God
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:94927:217"/>
who made Heaven and Earth, ſhould dwell in a Temple made with Hands; or that he who created all things <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible,</hi> ſhould take pleaſure in an external Pomp; that he who made the Smelling, which he wants not himſelf, ſhould delight in the ſmell of Incenſe; or that his Voice, properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhould be heard, to which Thunder it ſelf ſcarce bears the Reſemblance of an Echo: I ſay, we can never conceive any of theſe things, without the help of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For who can reconcile the Wiſdom ſeen in the Religion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with the Imperfections diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in it? How could that Lawgiver prove ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himſelf? And how could ſo many Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Divinity be attended with ſo many ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuperſtitious Cuſtoms and trivial Ceremonies? Conſult but the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and you'll then no longer wonder at it; there you will find both the Reaſon and Wiſdom of every thing that ſurpris'd you in the <hi>Old Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the Cuſtoms contained in the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> are partly reducible to Three Heads. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> To a general Preparation of all things for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> who was to come. 2<hi>ly.</hi> To the Repreſentation of his Office and Oeconomy, by a Type or Shadow. 3<hi>dly.</hi> To the deſcribing of him after ſuch a manner, as to render it altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Elect Souls not to know him when he came. Whoſoever ſhall conſider the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> under theſe Three Notions, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly diſcover nothing in them that can perplex his Faith; but he will find that every thing therein ſerves to increaſe his Knowledg, by diſcovering to him as it were the Scheme of God's Councels, and his great Plan and Deſign of Religion.</p>
                  <p>But ſince 'tis not our preſent Deſign to dive into the unfathomable Abyſs of the <hi>Juſtice, Wiſdom</hi> and
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:94927:218"/>
                     <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, ſo neither ſhall we enquire into the Reaſons which induced him to permit Men to ſin; or why he was pleaſed to ſave ſome rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or upon what account he made uſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of a Mediatour, rather than of any other Means; or whether there were any other way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the ſins of Mankind, but the Death of Chriſt? I ſay we ſhall not trouble our ſelves about any of theſe vain and fruitleſs Enquiries: And ſince it is but juſt we ſhould freely own our Ignorance, I think we can never find a better opportunity to acknowledge it than when we are talking about the ſecret Methods and Councels of God, becauſe we can never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the bottom of them, unleſs we ceaſe to be what we are, or he to be what he is.</p>
                  <p>Without attempting then to ſearch into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of theſe things, which is altogether incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible to us, and of which we are not able to ſpeak but imperfectly, we freely ſuppoſe the Truth of them. We do not in the leaſt queſtion but God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Sin, becauſe we are all Sinners. We know that a ſmall Number of Men are ſanctified, to whom the Scripture makes ſeveral great and ſublime Promiſes. And we are alſo taught, that they are delivered from their Sins by the intervention of a Mediatour, and that God had reſolved to bring it to paſs by ſuch means even before the Foundation of the World. But let us now conſider how the Wiſdom of God prepared and diſpoſed Men for it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Preparations related in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> are manifold. For there are Preparations of Events, Preparations of Ceremonies, Preparations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, Preparations of Precepts, and Preparations of Tenets.</p>
                  <p>As for the Events, they all relate to this great Center of Religion. Had <hi>Abraham</hi> always lived in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> he muſt neceſſarily have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:94927:218"/>
                     <hi>Idolatry</hi> as well as the reſt of his Kindred, or he could never have preſerved to his Poſterity the Knowledge and Worſhip, of the true God; and his Seed conſequently could not have been a Seed of Bleſſing for all the Nations to come. It was then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely requiſite he ſhould forſake his Country, as well as his Kindred. And had <hi>Jacob</hi> always lived with his Father <hi>Laban,</hi> the Poſterity of the latter would have corrupted that of the former; ſo that <hi>Eſau</hi> having already mixed himſelf with Strangers, the holy Race could by no means avoid being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the profane, and ſo the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> would not have been entailed upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Family or Nation, becauſe in Succeſſion of Time it would have been altogether impoſſible to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from the reſt. It was then neceſſary, that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould forſake his Father-in-Laws Houſe, and conſequently live apart from all other Nations. And had it not been for the protecting Providence of God, this People, who was honoured with his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants and intruſted with his Oracles, would have abſolutely periſhed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and together with them the Hopes of a promiſed Redeemer. To preſerve therefore ſuch comfortable hopes, they were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſeparated from all other Nations; and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to keep themſelves in that State, tho' they differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them all in matters of <hi>Policy, Manners, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> yet it was neceſſary they had God for their ſupream Magiſtrate, who gave them all thoſe wonderful Marks of his Protection we read of in the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> Tho' thev were carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captives into <hi>Babylon</hi> for their Sins they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily gathered together again from that Diſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Seventy years after, leſt a longer Bondage ſhould have made them for ever loſe the Marks of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                  <p>'Tis no difficult matter to perceive that it was in
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:94927:219"/>
behalf of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> only that God was pleaſed to make ſo many Diſtinctions: And the Promiſe of his coming could not be entailed upon every Nation of the World. He ſet apart one ſingle Nation from the reſt, purpoſely to intruſt them with ſo great a Salvation. And becauſe 'twas abſolutely requiſite this Diſtinction ſhould remain till the Birth of that Redeemer, ſo for that End he appointed five very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Principles of that Separation. The firſt whereof was, the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>true God,</hi> a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Character of the Election of that People, and a Priviledge they could not chuſe but be infinitely jealous of, eſpecially when they conſidered, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Darkneſs, Ignorance and Superſtition was then diſperſed in the World. The ſecond was, the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> that ſign of his Covenant, which God was pleaſed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould bear in their Fleſh, to diſtinguiſh them the more effectually from all other Nations. For it was not by meer Chance, or out of any fantaſtical Humour that this Cuſtom was firſt ſettled among the <hi>Jews.</hi> 'Tis not to be ſuppoſed they could have received, without very powerful Motives to it, ſo painful and difficult a Cuſtom, ſo contrary to the natural Affection of Mothers, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Example of <hi>Zeporah;</hi> nay, which even ſeems at firſt view ſomewhat ſhameful and obſcene. As for <hi>Philo</hi>'s and other Mens Reflexions on the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Circumciſion, they are very pitiful. The third Principle of that Diſtinction was the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which God gave to the Patriarchs and their Poſterity after them, tho' he did not give them immediatly an actual poſſeſſion of it. He fixed the Hearts of that People upon that particular Land, leſt they ſhould have been inſenſibly diſperſed over the Face of the whole Earth. And the Patriarchs upon their Death-beds ſtrictly recommended the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of their Bones into it, the better to fix the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:94927:219"/>
Hopes and Affections of the whole Nation upon it. But leſt it ſhould have happened, that the <hi>Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> the <hi>Periſites,</hi> the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> &amp;c. who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in poſſeſſion of that Land, ſhould have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed themſelves with the holy Generation, and conſequently corrupted them by their <hi>Superſtition;</hi> God himſelf conſented that thoſe Nations ſhould in this Life undergo an exemplary Puniſhment for their Sins which had been carried on to the utmoſt pitch of Exceſs, and for that end his Vengeance made uſe of <hi>Joſuah</hi> and his Armies as Inſtruments to deſtroy them utterly. The fourth was the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Temple,</hi> which God reſolved ſhould be the Center of the ceremonial Worſhip, he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolemnly declared that no Sacrifices, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther material Oblations whatſoever could be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, but what were offered in them, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prevent by that means the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring from that place, which was to be as it were the Center of their Religion, and by conſequence to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh their Separation from all other Nations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſurer and ſtronger Foundation, which too was neceſſary to make one day their <hi>Meſſias</hi> known. Laſtly, the fifth Principle of that Diſtinction was the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the Law it ſelf, which was of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the obſervance of its Ordinances indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably obliged the <hi>Jews</hi> to abominate and deteſt all Commerce with other ſtrange Nations, or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all other Nations to look upon the <hi>Jews</hi> with Horrour and Indignation. For it injoyned the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſacrifice the Creatures other Nations worſhipped as Deities, and the latter ſcrupled not to feed upon the Fleſh of thoſe Animals, which the <hi>Jews</hi> had in Execration, &amp;c. In a word, the external and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Purity the Law ſo carefully preſcribed them, prohibited the <hi>Jews</hi> all manner of Commerce with thoſe prophane and polluted Nations.</p>

                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:94927:220"/>
But God thought it not ſufficient to ſet apart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf one particular Nation from the reſt; he was further pleaſed to ſeperate alſo in that Nation one Tribe from all the reſt; <hi>viz.</hi> the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> in particularly aſſigning to it thoſe Promiſes of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> which are contained in that excellent Prophecy uttered by the Mouth of an expiring Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch; <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor the Lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come; and unto him ſhall the gathering of the People be,</hi> Gen. 49. 10. God was alſo pleaſed to chuſe one ſingle Family in that Tribe, to aſcribe principally to it the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And that was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>David,</hi> to whom he promiſed that <hi>he would make his ſeed ſit upon the Throne as long as the Sun and Moon endureth;</hi> which Promiſe would have been manifeſtly falſe and abſurd, were it not exactly fulfilled in the perſon of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Laſtly, he choſe ſuch a <hi>Branch</hi> of the Family of <hi>David, as ſhot forth</hi> as it were <hi>out of a dry ground, and out of the root of Jeſſe,</hi> that is, a Branch of it that was fallen in a very mean and wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. All which Diſtinctions were deſigned only to make Men diſcern and know the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and to prevent the loſs of that Knowledge ſo neceſſary to their Salvation, in the Confuſion of Nations, Tribes, Families, and Generations.</p>
                  <p>But it was not only by meer Events that God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Hearts of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to receive the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias;</hi> he impoſed upon them alſo an infinite number of Ceremonies to inſpire a more fervent Deſire in them of being freed from the Burthen of thoſe Rites. He revealed to them but in part many ſublime and important Tenets, that they might earneſtly deſire a clearer and fuller Revelation of them. He gave them a Law too, which wholly conſiſted in carnal Motives and Rewards, and was attended only with temporal
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:94927:220"/>
Bleſſings and Threatnings, which Law was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them by its Inſufficiency to receive a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. The Law intervened, that Sin might abound; and God ſuffered it to abound by way of prevention, that Men at length being made ſenſible of their Guilt, might have recourſe to his Mercy, which was ready to be revealed unto them in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus it appears all things as it were prepared the <hi>Jews</hi> to a new Oeconomy and Diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo add, that there was nothing but what repreſented it. The Lawgiver and People, the Covenant it ſelf, the Mediatour, the Worſhip and State of the Faithful; in a word, every thing was ſhadowed in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> as in a great and magnificent Picture, drawn by the hand of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and expoſed to the publick view of Men in all Ages to come.</p>
                  <p>Therein the Deity is repreſented under an humane Shape, to give us a Type of God manifeſted in the Fleſh. He is ſaid to have wreſtled with <hi>Jacob,</hi> as an Admonition to us, that Prayer is a ſort of Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherewith God is well pleaſed. He charged <hi>Moſes</hi> not to come near the fiery Buſh where he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf, till he had firſt put off his Shoes from his Feet, the better to make us underſtand, that without Holyneſs we neither ought, or can approach unto God. He ſhewed his Back-parts only to his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> to inform us, that the advantage of <hi>ſeeing him Face to Face,</hi> that is, of perfectly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Will and his Councels, particularly belonged to a far greater Prophet than <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Two Covenants are likewiſe repreſented to us by <hi>Abraham's</hi> Two Wives. The Covenant of the Goſpel by <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Mother of the free Children; and the Covenant of the Law, by <hi>Agar,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Bond-men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:94927:221"/>
The faithful People, that is, the Church or the Congregation of thoſe Men who are choſen for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, are farther repreſented to us ſometimes by the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſometimes by the Aſſembly of the firſt-born, and ſometimes by the Multitude of the <hi>Levites</hi> and Prieſts. And the Conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church is very remarkable. The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from all other Nations, and ſo are the faithful from the reſt of Mankind. God was the Protector of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only, when at the ſame time he forſook all other People. In like manner none but that Holy Congregation of People we call the <hi>Church,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſperſed in all Times and in all Places of the World, can juſtly boaſt of its being immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the Almighty. The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were abhorred and had in execration by all other Nations, and ſo is the Church hated by all the World. The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cried unto God for help in the midſt of their Oppreſſion, and their Cry came unto him; and juſt ſo has the Church had its Martyrs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Sufferers, continually crying out night and day, <hi>How long, Lord,</hi> &amp;c. The People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had no other Guide but God; no other Light but his; no other Support to defend them but his Providence: They were fed for a long time with nothing but that Bread he miraculouſly gave them from Heaven for their Suſtenance, &amp;c. The Church in like manner has no other Lights but what proceed from God; no other means of preſervation but his Providence; no other Support but his Strength, &amp;c. God dwelt in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and being willing to conform himſelf as it were to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> would have a Tabernacle erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, when they themſelves dwelt in Tabernacles, and a Houſe when they alſo made their Abode in Houſes. So God is now in the midſt of his Church, and the Faithful themſelves are his Temple and his Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:94927:221"/>
Further, the Divine Worſhip paid to God in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> was an excellent Figure and Type of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Worſhip that we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are bound to give him. To the Temple that was divided into the <hi>Porch,</hi> the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> and the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> is anſwerable the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the eternal Sanctuary of God; To the <hi>Levites,</hi> all the <hi>Faithful</hi> without Exception that are deſigned to ſerve God; to the <hi>White Cloathings</hi> of the Miniſters of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, the <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Holyneſs</hi> of all thoſe who deſign to approach unto him; to the <hi>Purity</hi> of the Body, the <hi>Purity</hi> both of the Heart and Conſcience; to the Blood of <hi>Goats</hi> and of <hi>Lambs,</hi> which was a Confirmation of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> the Blood of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> which confirms the <hi>New Testament;</hi> to the Entrance of the High Prieſt into the Holy of Holies, wearing the Names of the Twelve Tribes written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Breaſt, and preſenting to God the Blood that was ſhed in the Porch, correſponds the <hi>Aſcention</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> into Heaven, where he continually preſents us to God his Father, and intercedes for us by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Blood which he ſhed for the Expiation of our Sins; to the purifying Waters which waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the Pollutions of the Body, the Waters of <hi>Grace</hi> which ſanctify the Spirit; To Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> to the ſound of the Trumpet of Rams Horns, the Voice of the Goſpel; to <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf the Mediatour of the Law, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour of the <hi>New Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The different ſtate and condition of the Church is is alſo further repreſented to us by the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Our ſpiritual Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is marked out by their temporal Slavery, our Deliverances by their Deliverances, our Enemies by their Enemies; and ſo juſt and reaſonable is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity there is betwixt thoſe Images and their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, that the Holy Scripture often makes little
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:94927:222"/>
diſtinction betwixt them, and intermixes in one and the ſame Chapter that which concerns the temporal State of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and that which concerns the Spiritual condition of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> as alſo the Events that attended the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy, and the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> Theſe things are worth our Obſervation, and he that does not duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, will never be able to underſtand any thing in the Prophecies contained in the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Wiſdom of God was reſolved we ſhould not want a competent number of Types that might ſufficiently repreſent to us the <hi>Excellence, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of our <hi>Mediatour.</hi> Thus <hi>Iſaac</hi> conceived in the Womb of a barren Woman the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of his Father, the Foundation of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, offered up for a Sacrifice upon a Mount by the very hand of his Father, riſing as it were from the Dead, by being delivered from the Knife he had already lifted up againſt him, and having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Seed as numerous as the Stars of Heaven and the Sand of the Sea; this <hi>Iſaac,</hi> I ſay, was a lively Image of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was conceived in the Virgins Womb, the Darling of his Father, in whom he was well-pleaſed, the Foundation of all his Promiſes, the Source of his Bleſſings, dying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> riſing again in a wonderful manner after his Death, and <hi>ſeeing his Seed after him when he had made his Soul an Offering for Sin.</hi> Thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſold by his Brethren, betrayed out of Envy, accuſed tho' Innocent, condemned becauſe he would not ſubmit to the immodeſt Deſires of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious Woman, delivered out of Priſon, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> cloathed in Garments ſuitable to that Honour, and then ſitting at his Right Hand, was a wonderful Repreſentation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed out of Envy, ſold by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:94927:222"/>
who were his Brethren, condemned for refuſing to comply with the Synagogue, caſt down into the Darkneſs of Death, endued with heavenly Gifts, raiſed again to Heaven, and ſitting at length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the Right Hand of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> defigned to be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of the Legal Covenant, reſcued at his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity from a Deluge of Blood, expoſed to the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and as it were given up to a ſure and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Death; but afterwards delivered by a kind of Miracle from the Fury of the Waters, and alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering not long after his own Nation himſelf by a lucky Turn, when he ſeemed to be caſt away, was an exact Repreſentation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who came into the World to be the Mediatour of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> was delivered at his Birth from the Murder of <hi>Herod,</hi> and ſaved Men after his having ſuffered Death. <hi>Jonas</hi> who was caſt into the Sea to appeaſe the Tempeſt, and ſwallowed by a Whale, which three Days after caſt him again on the Shore, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently gives us to underſtand, who it was that calm'd by his Death that Storm our Sins had raiſed, that went down into the Grave, and afterwards roſe again the third Day. Laſtly, <hi>David</hi> being raiſed from the State of a <hi>Shepherd</hi> to that of a <hi>Monarch,</hi> was an excellent Type of <hi>Christ,</hi> who after his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation inherited a Name that is above every Name.</p>
                  <p>And as for thoſe Prophecies which have deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by ſuch notable <hi>Epochaes</hi> and ſignal Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, both the Perſon, Coming, and the Time of the Coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> we have already very largely ſpoke of them; ſo that what we have ſaid in that reſpect, is more than ſufficient to make us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the exact Proportion there is betwixt the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> as well as betwixt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. <hi>Moſes</hi> Illuſtrates <hi>Chriſt</hi> as we have proved in our firſt Part of this Treatiſe; and

                     <hi>XI</hi> Portraiture of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as it is conſidered in the Proportion it bears to <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE have already deſcribed the <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> as it is thus conſidered, in having fully proved in ſeveral places of this Work that it takes away the Corruption which had diſordered Nature; that it ſubverts <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> which was the Corruption of <hi>natural Religion;</hi> that 'tis the perfect Reſtauration of the latter; that it reeſtabliſhes the Principles of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> which God had imprinted in our Hearts; that it produces the moſt perfect Union of Society by <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> that <hi>Humility, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Wiſdom,</hi> and all other kind of Virtues which ſupport <hi>natural Religion,</hi> derive the Force of their Motives from the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> they alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equivalent to all ſenſible Objects; and laſtly, that it makes us anſwer the End of our Creation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a wonderful Comfort and Satisfaction to our Minds, and at the ſame time exalts our Nature to reflect that the End for which Man was deſigned, is the ſame with that of <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> and the End of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> the ſame with the true End of Man's Creation. Every thing that goes to the Conſtitution of Man's Nature does in a manner ſeek after God. The infinite Curioſity of our Minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly thirſting after the Knowledge of New Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſeeks after that Deity which the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> diſcovers to us, becauſe that Deity contains all things in the Excellence of its own Nature. The greedy and haſty Deſires of our Hearts, which can
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:94927:223"/>
never be truly ſatisfied with any Object we ſee, ſeek after God as a <hi>Supreme Good,</hi> which contains in it all other Advantages.</p>
                  <p>It was a thing before unheard of, that a Man muſt ſatisfy the Deſires of his Heart by glorifying God. To give our ſelves up to Godby renouncing our ſelves, and to renounce our ſelves to dedicate our ſelves wholly to God, are meer Paradoxes; yet ſuch the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> plainly demonſtrates to be true, by ſupplying the Defects of Mankind, and reſtoring <hi>natural Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now reflect upon thoſe Eleven different Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures or Characters which we have thus offered to your Conſideration. Obſerve that our own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation had no ſhare in the Product of <hi>natural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of the Heart of Man, of the <hi>Morality</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of its <hi>Doctrin,</hi> its <hi>End,</hi> and the <hi>Effects</hi> of it; of the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> given in favour of it; of its relation to the great End of Man's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Glory of God. Conſider, that all thoſe Repreſentations depend not upon any of our fooliſh Fancies, or fantaſtical Whimſies of the Incredulous; and that altho we ſhould not underſtand the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> yet we ought to refer it to a Celeſtial Principle, ſince we have diſcovered that it is qualified and adorn'd with ſo many Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Divinity.</p>
                  <p>What then ſhall we ſay, when we reflect that we have it by a voice from Heaven; that an infinite number of Martyrs ſuffered Death to confirm it, that the Events and Miracles performed in the World taught it us; that many undeniable matters of Fact convince us of it; that the Prophets declare it, and the Devils themſelves ſilently own it? What can we ſay now that we are ſurrounded on all ſides with Light, with the Light of the <hi>Senſes,</hi> the Light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the Light of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

of their accompliſhment, the Light of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> the Light of <hi>inward Senſe,</hi> the Light of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> the Light of <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> the Light of <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact,</hi> the Light of <hi>Doctrin,</hi> the Light of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the Light of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding?</hi> We ſhall certainly own that it is the Work of God, and earneſtly beſeech him who granted us the Knowledge of his holy Religion, that he would be pleaſed both to defend it againſt the falſe Subtilties of its ſecret and open Enemies, and deeply imprint it in our Hearts for the ſake of his Glory, and the Salvation of our own Souls,</p>
