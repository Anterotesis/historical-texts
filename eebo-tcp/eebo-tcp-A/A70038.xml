            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ithout regarding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner the World shall please to receive it, and at the hazard of encreasing the number of ill Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, I have undertaken to write a Book; which I have been the rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd to do, by reason that so many now-adayes take upon them that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
<pb facs="tcp:61444:3"/>
The Book-sellers pay no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize that I know of: Our Masters (blest be God) have not yet unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought them of imposing a Gabel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that sort of commodity. I cannot however but confess it would bring in a great Revenue; and 'tis pitty the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Excise should loose so fair an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of filling his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers (or rather their own.) For the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ill Writers is much greater than any man would imagine, and certainly a penny a Quire for all the Trumpery the Press sends out in a Year, would amount to a pretty matter. But possibly they are affraid these pretenders to wit should rise in Rebellion, and no body is willing to draw upon himself a whole Library of Invectives. But be it how it will, found my self in the humor, and at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb facs="tcp:61444:3"/>
to play the fool a little as well as others; I had nothing else to do, and thought it was better to spoil a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at home in my Chamber, than to wear out my shoes in walking the streets to no purpose.</p>
            <p>In this, my first and principal design was to divert my self; my next (Dear Reader) to please thee, in saying here and there some things, that I thought were pleasant and rational e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. If thou lik'st it, I have my end, and demand nothing of thee in return, but that thou wilt confess it; which I shall hear of by some body or another: only I think fit to give thee this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement, that it is really a true History, excepting that part of the <hi>Sultaness</hi> her escape, with that of <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and <hi>Isabella Albirond</hi> only getting
<pb facs="tcp:61444:4"/>
off clear in the truth of the story; and therefore do not look upon it as a meer piece of Invention, for it is no such thing.</p>
            <q>Fu quel chi'o dico, è non n'aggiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go un pelo, J o'l vidi, J o'l so.</q>
            <p>It is not so long since this hapned nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we can reckon by any thing but the months; and therefore has at least the grace of novelty, which no one can deny it. If I would have taken the liberty of the Romance-writers, who make what Adventures they please, and carry them on at the extravagant rate of their own Fancy, I could per adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have made this more modish, and much fuller of affairs and intrigues. A few hours meditation would have done that; but for once I paint by the Life, and not by invention. The aforesaid
<pb facs="tcp:61444:4"/>
Gentlemen raise their fabulous stories, to such a degree of surprize or impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity indeed, that they seem sometimes to drop out of the Clouds: but in the mean time Truth is doubtless that which best pleases in a Narrative. If thou art of this opinion, thou wilt take more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in reading such a Piece of gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as this, which has really come to pass, than one of those celebrated Fables, that has hardly ever enter'd into more than one mans Imagination.</p>
            <p>What there is more of rare in this is, that never any Bagatelle of Love came out of <hi>Barbary</hi> till now. The Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Algier</hi> do not much intrigue themselves in Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but another sort of Pirate is here come under the Standard of Love, to carry away from these <hi>Barbarians</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:61444:5"/>
greatest beauty their Nation ever had: Whether, or no it be lawful prize, do thou (friendly Reader) judg; and if it prove otherwise, arraign him rather than me. I have follow'd the <hi>Mesmoires</hi> that were deliver'd to me, to which I have only given words, and wherein the workmanship has nothing defac'd the natural truth of the story.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61444:6"/>
               <hi>Albirond,</hi> who in the untoward posture his affairs at that time were, would have gone in quest of War to the remotest parts of the Earth: but the Stars who in these dayes are very little inclin'd to favour men of execution, seem'd joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have conspir'd the ruine of the Janty sort of men, by a general cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arms. It was by no means safe for <hi>Albirond</hi> to stay in <hi>France;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain affairs that frequently happen to men who carry the <hi>punctilio</hi> of honor upon the point of their Swords, had driven him from thence, he must of necessity take upon him the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Knight Errant, as many others did.</p>
            <p>In this condition of a wandring Knight, he had the opportunity of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most beautiful and the greatest part of <hi>Europe;</hi> and with a competent proportion of wit that he was master of, and a handsome carriage he had made shift to learn at home, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd himself respect in all places, and acquir'd friends wherever he met with men of the better sort of breeding, and added some such passages, and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the History of his Life, as were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61444:6"/>
fit one day to be the subject of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. This carreer of his continued near upon two years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ended at the City of <hi>Ligorn</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which is one of the most famous Ports for traffick upon the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>One day as he was at this place, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pensive and alone upon the Sea shore, and meditating which way for the future to dispose of himself, in the strange irresolution and incertitude he then was what course to steer, a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain whymsy took him, wholly to throw himself into the arms of Fortune, and to that end to put himself aboard the first vessel that should set out from the harbour, let it be bound for what part of the world soever; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly without further examining this his extravagant resolution, he found a Vessel for his purpose, that ready and laden, waited only for a wind to put out to Sea. He had but little time to turn him in, wherefore in all haste he caus'd his baggage to be embark't, and put himself aboard; where all things concurring with his design, the wind within two hours after stood as fair as heart could with, and in six dayes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61444:7"/>
brought them before <hi>Tunis,</hi> one of the principal Cities of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of that Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albirond</hi> was not altogether a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this Country, he had already been acquainted both with <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> and had a smattering of their Language, which he had learn't in a voyage he had formerly made to the Kingdom of <hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Morocco.</hi> So soon therefore as he came a shore, he went immediately to salute the <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> which is the King of the Country, to whom he gave an account of his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. From thence he went to visit the <hi>Bassa,</hi> who there represents the person of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and after him the two <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> or Generals of the Army, who are the four principal Lords of that Kingdom. I could here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps satisfie the curious by insisting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the manners, and particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this City; for although the <hi>Turks</hi> are all subject to one Prince, and that they have all the same Law, yet the policy and manner of living of those of <hi>Africk,</hi> are a little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the other <hi>Turks</hi> of the East: but it is not my design to mix any thing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61444:7"/>
so serious, with what I only intend for a pure, and uncompounded piece of mirth. Neither do I write this for the grave Sr. <hi>Politick Woodbee's;</hi> the chief, and only end of my writing being to entertain the amorous with a new piece of Gallantry.</p>
            <p>These four Lords did all receive <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> with civility enough, that is to say, with as much as the humor of that Country will permit: but our Cavaleer was nevertheless much better satisfied with Mahomet <hi>Lapsi</hi> General of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Forces, than with all the other three. This Lord at the very first dash, offer'd him a Lodging close by his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and gave him two Slaves to attend him wherever he went, together with a <hi>Moor</hi> to secure him from such affronts and insolencies to strangers, as are very usual in that barbarous Country. It is true, that Mahomet <hi>Lapsi</hi> was really one of the finest Gentlemen, not only of <hi>Africk,</hi> (where Travellers expect to meet with nothing but Lyons and Tigers,) but even of <hi>Europe</hi> also, where the world is more rational, and better bred. His Stature and fashion had something in them of great, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestick

above the rest of the <hi>Africans,</hi> he was rather fair than brown, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion was very clear and good, and there was nothing in him of the <hi>Turk</hi> to be discover'd, saving a certain Ayr of Fierceness, that became him well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and his way of conversing with all sorts of men, was affable and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, much above what is to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from a <hi>Barbarian.</hi> He had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers't with few other than Merchants in his own Country, or if he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times seen a Gentleman, it was only chain'd to the Oar, which made him the sooner to observe something in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> that was new, and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that oblig'd him to a particular esteem of his person. This esteem in a few dayes improv'd it self into an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that affection encreas'd to such a degree, that the <hi>Beglarbeg</hi> seldom din'd or sup'd without <hi>Albirond,</hi> and would also have him one in all his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of divertisement and recreation. Of these, hunting was that wherein he chiefly delighted, and for this he had two or three fair Country-houses not above a mile distant from the City. Of these nevertheless, the most magnificent

               </gap>; the Feast lasted from eight of the clock in the morning, till three in the afternoon, during which time they had sometimes a cessation from ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, to smoak a pipe, that past from hand to hand thorough the whole company. All being done the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> taking <hi>Albirond</hi> by the hand, carried him to see the house, of which the Richness of the Armes, and Furniture, and the prodigious number of Jewels wonderfully astonisht our Cavaleer, the things he saw being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable, but above all the Beds, where nothing was to be seen, but Tissue, and embroyderies in Gold layd on three inches thick. From thence they went into the Garden, where the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure must needs be very charming, to see all the Trees in the middle of Winter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

make a little stay, to give a beautiful <hi>Idea</hi> of a most delicate Garden; but least I should importune any of my Readers (for there is nothing more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and distastful to Readers, then the Descriptions of Pallaces and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,) I leave it to every ones imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to represent to himself, that it must of necessity be a very fine place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which by the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> was preferr'd before all his other Scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of which moreover the Flowers of the Orange and Citron Trees, that are continually in the blossome may give some account; and besides it is easy to believe, that seeing it was the sole <hi>Regal</hi> of so great a number of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Women, it ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant. Nevertheless they very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy'd that diversion, and the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> had only a prospect into it through one little window, to which none nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Grand Sul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Albirond</hi> was marvailously taken with this Garden, and forgot not the good manners of highly commending it to the <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> who in the good humor he was of obliging this Cavaleer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61444:10"/>
by all sorts of civility, offered him the Command of his Coach, to carry him thither so oft as he pleas'd. <hi>Albirond</hi> return'd him very many thanks for the honor he was pleas'd to offer him of his Coach, which nevertheless he did not think fit to accept, but would by no means resufe the priviledg he gave him of coming sometimes into the Garden. Mahomet <hi>Lapsi</hi> was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ravish't, that he took that for so extraordinary a favour, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on immediately gave order to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to receive him when, and so oft as himself should please as a particular friend of his, and to leave him absolute Master of all. <hi>Albirond</hi> made very good use of this liberty, it was not very far from the Town, and he fail'd but very few mornings of coming to divert himself in that delightful place.</p>
            <p>To a man in Love, solitude is very charming, especially in absence, where men entertain themselves with their own thoughts, recollect all the pleasant passages of their Lives, and meditate in full liberty at their own fancy; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it often depends upon the humor a man is in at such times, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61444:10"/>
himself happy, or miserable. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> was too fine a Gentleman never to have sight for some fair one, and his Love was accompanied with so remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable a Constancy, that it still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great ardor, after four or five years of fidelity. In this it was that he chiefly found himself unhappy, neither Banishment from his Country (for which he had a natural affection) nor the loss of his Estate (which was very considerable) had been able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose his brave soul; but his heart which was set on fire by the penetrating eyes of too beautiful a person, alone suffer'd all the torments of a cruel Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile. He one day sufficiently exprest his passion by these verses, which he grav'd upon a leaf of one of those Fig-Trees of <hi>Barbary:</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>You tender issue of my Woe,</l>
               <l>The blood the wounded Lover bleeds,</l>

            </lg>
            <p>He had not promised to himself from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61444:11"/>
               <hi>Barbary,</hi> that he should pass away so many happy hours in this delightful place. The whole Garden contributed to the easing of his griefs; and it is most certain, that there is not a spot of Earth to be found o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61444:11"/>
that had appear'd to him, which made him break into this suddain Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

            <p>Every thing in this Garden already proclaim'd, and was full of <hi>Albirond's</hi> passion, the trees were all wrought with his Cyphers, and the walls, nay the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leaves that were not too tender to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61444:12"/>
endure the Graver, were carv'd, and graven with verses, and several other amorous fancies. There was in the whole Garden but one place, that was priviledg'd from his sighs, and that was that part that lay under the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which in truth was the most delightful of all; but as a man that was very well acquainted with the customes of the Country, and how tender the <hi>Turks</hi> are of their women, he was discreet enough to avoid that Quarter. This discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his nevertheless was not sufficient long to resist the temptation of change of place, and to that desire that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty does usually raise in generous and attempting minds; so that one day having observ'd somewhat nearer at hand, that there was one little window only in that Apartment towards the Garden, he could not so far conquer his curiosity, but that it carried him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great Pavillion, that covers a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair Bath, where <hi>Mahomet</hi> every Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer used to bath. This Pavillion is very ingenuously contriv'd, consisting of six little Rounds or Circles, which are so many Beds of green Turfe, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately lay'd, as seem to allure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61444:12"/>
the beholder to lye down, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon them. In one of these Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets it was that <hi>Albirond</hi> design'd to pass away the best of his time in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and was enclin'd to believe, that there he might hope for some allay to his Torments, which gave him occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to speak after this manner the first day he entred into it:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Ye solitary dark Retreats</l>
               <l>Where the fresh Ayre, and silent shades</l>
               <l>Preserve themselves, maugre the heats,</l>
               <l>And light wherewith the Sun invades,</l>
               <l>Can you not cure my hearts deep wound,</l>
               <l>And in this Melancholy Grove</l>
               <l>Is there no medicine to be found</l>
               <l>Against the most unhappy love?</l>
            </lg>
            <p>His fancy was too ravishingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the beauty of this place, not to push so pretty a beginning a great deal further, when a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent voice, which at that instant he heard over his head, put him quite out of his Poetry. It is not here for me to tell you how strangely he was surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, 'tis hard to imagine it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having seen <hi>Albirond</hi> in the posture
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61444:13"/>
of his astonishment, it is hardly to be believed. All his sences were contracted into that one sence of hearing, he stood as motionless, and stiff as a statue, and his soul seem'd to have no other senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than what was inspir'd into it by this ravishing voice. The close inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weving of the Boughs, and leaves so damp't the sound, that he could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly hear no more, but these last words only, which was enough to make him conclude the song to be <hi>spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Non importa que los ojos matan se ressuscitan.</q>
            <p>The surprise, and the harmony of this voice wherewith he had been so rapt at the first strains that toucht his ear; the song being ended, gave way to the curiosity he had to see a person that sung so well: at the first he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be some slave, and went out of the Pavillion to be more fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. He thought it could only come from the window of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and there indeed he spyed a person that endeavour'd to conceal her self, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61444:13"/>
whom in so doing he perceiv'd to smile, possibly at his curiosity. The Cavalier at this stood still, and saluted her, to try if by that meanes he could oblige her a little more to discover her self; which thereupon she accordingly did; and in so doing, not a little surpriz'd <hi>Albirond</hi> with the number of Jewels she had on, which instead of dazling him with their lustre, gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the person he had mistaken for a slave, must infallibly be one of the principal Ladies of the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> so that without further delay, he made her a most profound reverence, with a resolution to retire, it being a respect due to the Ladies of that Country, to avoid their sight, especially the Women of quality. This Lady (who perhaps had no mind to drive him from thence) made him a sign to stay, and withall said something to him, which he did not well comprehend, by reason that he was not so perfect in the Language of that Country as to understand every word, when it was spoke quick and roundly to him. He form'd an answer however, telling her in the same Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that he humbly ask't her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61444:14"/>
for having taken the liberty to come walk under her Apartment, and that he had not thought any one could have come to that window. To which she made answer again; but after such a manner that he could not understand the one half of what she said, and therefore could answer nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. In the mean time he stood upon Thorns, and was very impatient to put an end to this discourse, in which he should have been very unwilling to have been surpriz'd: but the Lady was by no means of his mind, and with the delight she took in looking upon him, would have been glad she could have made him better understand her. She then withdrew herself from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, biding him stay a little, and she would presently return, which she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did immediately after, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with her a slave, who spoke to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond,</hi> and in <hi>Spanish</hi> askt him of what Nation he was. The <hi>Cavalier,</hi> who spoke <hi>Spanish</hi> very well, replied that he was a <hi>French</hi> man, that it was by accident he was come into that Quarter of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> and therefore desir'd she would make his excuse to that beautiful Lady.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61444:14"/>
You need not, replyed the Slave, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your self about that, for I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready order to tell you from her, that she before desir'd rather to see you walk under this window, than in the lower walks; where you have us'd to be every morning. <hi>Albirond</hi> civilly made answer, that if by that he might oblige so fair a Lady, he should be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proud to please her: but that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it might be ill taken, and that he might be blamed, should he happen to be discovered in that place. The slave thereupon assur'd him, that there was no danger in the case; For besides that the Trees would conceal him from being seen in that walk, it was now a time when the Garden was free, and no one came to work there, as at other times. To which she added, that he was to come a little more early, that he might at more liberty entertain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self there with them, whilst the rest of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> were asleep; which having said, she retir'd, and <hi>Albirond</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it was to dismiss him for that time, was about to do the same, had not the <hi>Sultaness</hi> commanded him yet to stay a little longer. She sayd not very
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61444:15"/>
much to him; but her diversion was to throw him down certain little stones, which the <hi>Cavalier</hi> receiving in his hatt as they fell, first kis't, and after put them in his bosom, as favours that he did very highly prize The Lady laught at this action of his, and pleasantly ask't him, since he put such a value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those pibbles, what he could do in case she should throw him something of greater price? To which <hi>Albirond</hi> made answer, that he had no dearer reposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory than that, wherein to put any thing of the greatest valew; but that every thing that came from her was equally pretious, and that those pibbles would in his hands convert themselves into Rubies and Diamonds. She still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to say some things to him, that were aery, and obliging enough, and that the <hi>Cavalier</hi> was not so thick-scul'd but to understand, and thereupon fail'd not to return the best answers he could: but these little wantonnesses of theirs, continued something too long, to a man that was in fear of being discovered; which he ever and anon signified to her by a little unquietness he made to appear in his countenance, and by ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61444:15"/>
looking this way, and that, to see if no body came. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> still bad him not to be afraid, but it was hard Counsel to obey, where there was so much to fear. She was as dangerous to see, as there was danger of being seen with her; and the perplexity was equally great, whether in relation to her own eyes, or to those of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albirond</hi> was no sooner deliver'd from this dangerous enterview and parly, but that he took a resolution to walk no more so near the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> nor so much as to enter into the Garden; wherein peradventure his discretion will appear very strang to such, as will not that a man who makes a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gallantry, should loose any one moment of time, when an occasion presents it self of pushing any one home to its natural and proper end. But this way of fooling is only proper for some Countries; and such as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little acquainted with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of this whereof I now speak, how fond soever they may be of those little adventures, will approve of <hi>Albirond's</hi> discretion, in not daring to hazard one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61444:16"/>
of so delicate a kind. He had no mind, neither indeed ought he upon a light occasion to offend the <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> who every day laid so many obligations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and of whose favour he stood in so great need to live in safety in so barbarous a place. This fair <hi>Sultaness</hi> notwithstanding was eternally before his eyes; his mind was a little discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed with her beauty, so that whatever he was able to do to oppose it, he had by fits a certain itching desire to break the resolution he had made, and some hankerings after the Lady that disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted his thoughts, and insensibly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved some scruples he had, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice whence that passion did proceed, or almost knowing when the fit was upon him. Some moments there were wherein he would have been in the Garden at what price soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and yet at the same time he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he had ever been there: and to say the truth, this <hi>Sultaness</hi> was such a master-piece of Beauty, as was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to stagger the resolution of the firmest of men. Never was any thing so delicately shap't as she, and although <hi>Albirond</hi> had seen but the one half of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61444:16"/>
her, yet to be flesh, and blood, and a man, was enough to be smitten. Her age at that time, might be about five and twenty, but in her cheeks appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Youth, and freshness of a Girle of fifteen. All her lineaments were exactly perfect; her hair, her complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, her eyes, her mouth, and her neck were things to be painted, and amongst all those Graces and perfections, her manner of dressing was so gallant, and so rich, that it was an additional en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment to captivate <hi>Albirond.</hi> The lustre of her sparkling Jewels made her appear a constellation, but the fire of her delicate black eyes put out the poorer light of the numerous Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, as the whiteness of her skin baffled that of the Pearls. All this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> acknowledg'd in his heart, and although it was not possible, that he should ever cease to love <hi>Urania,</hi> or that he should ever love any thing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with her; nevertheless the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a person rendr'd attractive by so many titles of beauty, and arm'd with so many not to be resisted charms, stood suspected to him, and he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have avoided the least shadow
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61444:17"/>
of infidelity. These two or three dayes that he forbore going again to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, was with him a very melancholly time, during which he had a continual conflict in his Soul; but what good will a man's constancy do him, when he is once possess't with the merit of an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able person: On the contrary, nothing makes one love more, than an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to resist it; and a heart comes off much deeper wounded by fighting, and opposing a passion it has no mind to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain. He thought the time intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable long, and it seem'd to him that an infinite number of dayes were lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and gone, since he had been in his beloved solitude. The delights of this Garden; or rather the charmes of this fair <hi>Sultaness</hi> made all other places appear unpleasant, and seem tedious and uneasy to him; so that he must of necessity either take a final leave of <hi>Barbary,</hi> or return to a place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was so infinitely delighted. He fancied the Sun shone no where but there, and that there was nothing but darkness in all other places. O frailty of humane Souls! <hi>Albirond</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, he yields to the importunity of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61444:17"/>
his inclination, and is strongly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he shall have power enough over himself to go into the Garden without coming near the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Love made him believe so, but he deceiv'd himself, and under this Error it was; that the little God would take his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to establish his Empire in the bosome of the wavering <hi>Cavalier,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would declare himself. He goes then to the Garden, and true it is, that his courage chiefly appear'd in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence he offer'd to his own inclination, by limiting his steps within the bounds prescrib'd. Yet did his feet now and then deceive him, and would sometimes insensibly carry him too far beyond his limits, that he often wanted but very little of being totally overcome: but then <hi>Urania</hi> alwaies came in the nick into his remembrance to divert him. He was now already as good as victorious; the time was already at hand that he was to return to the City, and he was preparing to be gone, when an arrow that wisk't close by his nose, did very much surprize him, and made him stay to see what it might be. It fell not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from him, as being loos't with no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61444:18"/>
great force, so that he went and took it up, and in so doing, found there was a Ticket fastned to it with silk, which his curiosity making him immediately to unty, opening the paper, he found these words writ in the Spanish Tongue.</p>

                        <hi>You certainly deceived us, when you told us you was a Frenchman. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers of that Nation acquit themselves a little better of the respect that is due to Ladies, and are more dextrous at a piece of gallantry than you are. In two or three dayes time that you have not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in this Garden, you forgot the promise you made us; and it is now fit you should know to whom you engag'd your word, 'tis to the Great Sultaness the wife of Mahomet Lapsi, a person whom you ought infinitely to consider, and respect, and who peradventure has a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too much esteem for you. You would do well to manage an inclination of so great advantage to you a little better, wherefore if you will take my advice, do not this day depart the Garden without</hi>

                  <l>To a new passion's yielding now.</l>
                  <l>What strange injustice, Heaven, is this!</l>

               <p>In ending these last words he was come up close to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where he had scarce time to offer at some excuses, before the slave demanded of him why they had not seen him of so many days; and the reason why he had not (now he was come thither) walkt on their side of the Garden, according to his promise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albirond</hi> though a little surpiz'd with so suddain and so brisk Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories, was not nevertheless to seek for some pretences of affairs of weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concern, wherewith he had been perplext; telling them moreover, That the reason why he had forborn to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the <hi>Seraglio</hi> was, because he had seen no body at the window: but these excuses were not sufficient to defend him from some reproaches the fair Slave cast in his teeth, in the behalf of her Mistriss; and the <hi>Sultaness</hi> her self

putting on a very severe countenance, ratt'ld him at a terrible rate; calling him ingrate, insensible, and unworthy of the least kindness she had for him. These are the favors of that Country; and it is after this manner, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of those parts declare their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neither is it to be wondred at, that she should be so forward with a man she had never spoken to but once, and had only seen at a pretty distance; for there was nothing in the person of this Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, that was not grateful: he was ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more neat, and very finely dress't, and well enough understood the secret of engaging a Lady, that is never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle sensible and inclin'd to be in Love. And moreover 'tis the custom of that Nation, that the women commonly are the first taken, and the men there revenge us to some purpose for what they make us suffer in <hi>Europe;</hi> to all which you may add (if you please) that the <hi>Beblerbeg</hi> had already acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> with the strict and particular friendship he had contracted with <hi>Albirond;</hi> and had spoke so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously of his person, his courage, and his wit, that she must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity

               <p>The beautiful <hi>African</hi> having remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a little while without saying any thing to <hi>Albirond,</hi> the at the last qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified her little displeasure with a <hi>Spanish</hi> song, that her slave <hi>Isabella</hi> had taught her; which she sung with so languishing and so amorous a tone, as perfectly made an end of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely captivating her Lover. After which she would needs have him to sing too, which also she entreated him by her slave to do. <hi>Albirond</hi> was not hard to be perswaded into that little complaisance; for his voice was tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably good, and he sung passably well for a <hi>Cavalier.</hi> He therefore made choice of a little <hi>Italian</hi> Song, that he himself was very much delighted withal, and that had been made for him by a friend of his, of which these were the words</p>

               <p>Whil'st <hi>Albirond</hi> was singing, the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness</hi> sent her slave for some sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, which so soon as he had ended his song, she threw down to him; and which without all peradventure, he gathered up with much better will than he had done the stones the time before. Tis well when pibbles convert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Comfits, for the favours are then much sweeter. She threw him down also a great deal of very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fruit, together with a very fine handkerchief to carry them in; all which <hi>Albirond</hi> could not handsomely refuse, without displeasing his new Mistriss; for they make a refusal in such a case a capital affront, and the greatest contempt that can be offered. After this manner the <hi>Cavalier</hi> return'd loaden with sweets; but they would not suffer him to depart, till first they had made him swear to come again ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61444:22"/>
early the next morning: but alas it was very little necessary to put <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> to his Oath in such a case, who found himself sufficiently engag'd by a necessity much more binding than his vow; and yet the sweets that had so charm'd him, were not those he had tasted in the Conserves, but they were the fair eyes of the beautiful <hi>African,</hi> that in poisoning, had enchanted his heart. The simple inclination to Love with which he had the foregoing days found himself only attainted, was now half converted into a real passion. He now began better to understand what she said to him, and so well, that he scarce lost a word. And, to confess the truth; Love (for a young child,) is a very expert Deity, he understands all Languages, he learns them all with very little difficulty; nay, 'tis sufficient being once possest with him, to have eyes only, to understand whatever one has a mind to.</p>
               <p>In the morning, <hi>Albirond</hi> saw the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness,</hi> and he went to wait upon the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> in the afternoon; but he past over the ensuing night with greater disquiet, than any that had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61444:22"/>
                  <hi>Urania</hi> already presented her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his imagination, and seem'd to reproach him, and to demand satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his inconstancy; but the charms of the fair <hi>Sultaness</hi> were already grown so prevalent with him, that maugre his duty he ow'd, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he had to his former Mistriss, his feeble heart suffered them to possess themselves there of a very considerable place, to the prejudice of <hi>Urania's</hi> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and interest; insomuch that all he could possibly do, was yet to preserve for her the first and best room in his brest. The night was very long with our new wounded <hi>Amoroso,</hi> or at least it seemed to be much longer than it was; and as if the light of the day, ought to disperse the clouds and mists of his mind, as well as dissipate the shades, and horrors of the night, he was in great impatience to wait so long for the long look't-for morning. And indeed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61444:23"/>
manner he could devise, and much fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than he had at any time appear'd since his comming into <hi>Barbary,</hi> before. Like a Gallant who was to go visit his Mistriss, he omitted nothing that he conceiv'd might serve to set him the better off, but rifled all his truncks, and tumbled over all his wardrobe, to find out what he thought might please her best. In which spruce dress he sallyed out of his chamber, and in the ardor and eagerness it may be imagin'd he was at that time, was not above a quarter of an hour in going to the Garden. Being there come, he thought it was a little too early for the Ladies, and no body yet appear'd, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a little noise that he made in the Pavillion soon drew the <hi>Sultaness</hi> to the window, who threw something down to make him come out into her view. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> was wonderfully astonish't at her sight, for if he had omitted nothing, that might serve to make him appear with the better grace, and presence; the <hi>Sultaness</hi> had also on her part been as curious to set off the lustre of her own Beauty with an infinite number of Jewels, and a most exquisite dress. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61444:23"/>
could be so rich, nor any thing was ever so fine; but it was withal a kind of undress, wherein a certain negligence was to be observ'd, mixt with an extraordinary pomp, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a negligence of very great Art. She had upon her head a rich Cawle of Gold after the Turkish fashion, that serv'd her in the nature of a Vail, with which she cover'd part of her neck, which modesty seem'd to oblige her to conceal, but that love made her now and then to discover by little acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal motions, but wherein there was nevertheless a great deal of design. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> had nothing about his heart that was proof against these enchantments, his eyes were ravisht with the delight of beholding so beautiful a person, and to such a degree, that, as if he had been charm'd, he had not once the power to open his mouth, to speak so much as one syllable to the fair <hi>Sultaness:</hi> She was therefore herself constrained to break the Ice, and to ask him how he had past the night. I am afraid, <hi>Madam</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Albirond</hi>) that I am to expect no more nights of repose, and if you will take the pains to consult your Glass, you
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61444:24"/>
will there find, that it is very hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you, and afterwards to sleep. To this she return'd no answer, but took occasion to let fall a very fair purse, which <hi>Albirond</hi> immediately gathered up, and was about to present it to her, but the <hi>Sultaness</hi> bad him keep it for her sake, telling him that it was full of kindness. The purse was a rich one made of Gold twist, and wrought with a great quantity of little pearls, which <hi>Albirond</hi> having five, or six times kiss't, he told the <hi>Sultaness</hi> (who saw and was very well pleas'd with that action,) that if it was full of kindness, he was afraid it would be the occasion of his death, because he had already more love than his heart was able to bear.</p>
               <p>It is not to be believed how natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gallant the Women are in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there is nothing barbarous but the Men, neither are they barbarous to that degree, they are represented to us; but as for the women, there is nothing they are not expert in, that can any way contribute to the gaining of a heart; which doubtless proceeds from this, that the men having commonly more wives than one (they being permitted by their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61444:24"/>
Law, to take to the number of four le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate wives) every one is industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to gain the best room in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in this these Brutes are more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful than others of a more refin'd reason; so that this of whom we are now speaking, being the principal wife of the <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> it is to be suppos'd was no fool. She was Sister to the <hi>Basshaw,</hi> and reputed the most beautiful woman of all <hi>Tunis;</hi> and though <hi>Albirond</hi> did not perfectly understand her language, he nevertheless was such a proficient in it, as to judge, that the fair <hi>Turk</hi> had a very great share of wit, for every thing that fell from her tongue was marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour aery, and full of spirit, as well as infinitely obliging. You should (said she once to him upon occasion of his not well understanding something she had said,) by this time methinks have learnt our language. It is <hi>Madam</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Albirond</hi>) too short a time since I had first the honor to see you, to learn so much as to be perfect in a Language; especially, where the power of your fair eyes possest me with a passion sufficient to divert me. But (added the fair one) if one can love in one day, I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61444:25"/>
conceive also, that they may learn to understand in the same time, and I have an opinion that should you speak to me in any language whatsoever, I should make a shift to understand you. If it be that way you intend <hi>Madam</hi> (repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Albirond</hi> again) I do understand you very well, and assure you of the same; but it is also true, That this Language has no need of words, since the eyes render it intelligible enough, without other expression: and after this manner mine will soon enform you of what my mouth would perhaps be puzled to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. But are the eyes (continued the <hi>Sultaness</hi>) so faithful as not to deceive you? Mine are (replied the <hi>Cavalier,</hi>) and will not deceive you, when they give you to understand, that they are charm'd by the power of yours. If I have (said the fair one) obtein'd over you so great a victory, I have succeeded in my design; but you must know, that I intend to proceed further yet, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to penetrate into your very heart, to see if there be there any room for mine. Alass <hi>Madam!</hi> (replied <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> with a deep sigh, and in a langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing accent) you have perhaps done
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61444:25"/>
that already; for by the disorder I feel in my soul, I know very well, that my heart is no more my own. I must then also give you warning (said she smiling) to take heed, and fairly tell you before hand, that I am one of those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors who never restore the places I have taken by assault, and am of an humor to reduce all things to fire, and bloud, before I will consent to be depriv'd of what is once my own.</p>
               <p>I have no mind to repeat all that these new Lovers said to one another in their first ardor, and besides it might perhaps importune my Reader; what I have said is sufficient to let you see that they were already advanc'd pretty far in their affairs. There is no mean to be observ'd in love, which is only justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by its extravagancy and excess; and all things are excused, if not allowed, in people that are in love. <hi>Albirond</hi> returned toward the City, and his impatience was so great (as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is in people possest with this passion) as would not permit him to forbear till he came home to his lodging, to examine the purse. The
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61444:26"/>
work of it was exceedingly queint, and fine, which the better to admire he turn'd and turn'd it above a hundred times; at last he made bold to unty it, and without suspecting there was any thing within, drew out a Ticket (written in a Character ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from that of the slave, who writ a very fine hand) which contein'd these words in <hi>Spanish,</hi> which with much adoe maugre a great many pot-hooks, he made shift at last to unriddle.</p>

In the mean time he past over this night with much greater content, than any of those that had gone before, not that he slept much better, but there is a sort of raving as nourishing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful as the soundest sleep, and that in recreating the Spirit does nothing abate of the bodies force, and vigour.

                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61444:28"/>Though <hi>Albirond</hi> past away a good many happy hours inthese pleasing ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, yet that wherein he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to go to visit his adorable <hi>Sultaness</hi> was of too great importance to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. This hour was already come, just as he was up and ready drest; wherefore taking a very pretty purse he had, garnisht with ribons and puting his Ticket into it, he took his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Garden, where (for Love adds wings to the most tardy and slow of pace) it was not long before he did arrive. His Mistriss was already at her window waiting for him; who so soon as he came within her reach, rain'd down upon him a shower of fine flowrs together with certain dainty Nosegays she had neatly made, and adorn'd with a great number of pearl; all which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> gathered up, and put them into his hat; which being done he threw up his little purse, which the <hi>Sultaness</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with a very good grace, and kist it with the same Ceremony, and Affection that <hi>Albirond</hi> had done hers before. She very much admired the Work, and vvas mightily taken
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61444:29"/>
with the gayness of it, which was new to her who had never seen any of that fashion before. But her curiosity chiefly appear'd in the haste she made to open it, to see if there was not also some Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket within, and to her great joy she found that her dear <hi>Amoroso</hi> had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected one to her; she immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd it to her slave to interpret, which whilst she was doing, the <hi>Sultaness</hi> in her eyes discover'd how much she was delighted with the Contents, which she also would sometimes turn towards him, and in certain places of the letter with which she was best pleased, threw little pibbles at him, calling him wag, wanton, and little fondling. After the slave had three or four times read it over to her, the <hi>Sultaness</hi> commanded her to entertain <hi>Albirond</hi> a while, and that she would immediately return. The <hi>Cavalier</hi> took his oportunity of her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to demand of <hi>Isabella,</hi> if she had indited her Mistris's letter, to which she made answer, that she had only tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated it out of the <hi>Sultaness</hi> her <hi>Morisco</hi> into <hi>Spanish,</hi> who had from her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed it again in her own hand. This Slave had a marvailous share of wit,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61444:29"/>
and neither her face nor her fashion were like those of an ordinary Slave, which <hi>Albirond</hi> had very well observ'd, and had he thought he should have had time to do it, before the <hi>Sultaness</hi> should return, had a mind to have entreated from her some short account of her life, and of the adveneure that had brought her to this Captivity; but the moments, that the <hi>Sultaness</hi> enjoy'd in his conversation were too ravishing for her longer to forbear to return. She came then loaden with sweet-meats of which she made her Lover a very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral present, reserving only some few for her self and her slave, which they eat to bear him company. He this day likewise received another purse also full of Musk, and Civet, and Amber-Gris; and had this <hi>Cavalier</hi> had an avaritious Soul, he might also have added to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the heart of so beautiful a person a great number of Jewels, and knacks of exceeding great valew: but he who never had been good at recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and whose generous heart whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enclin'd him to acts of bounty, had he had wherewithall to obey his liberal humor, could never have forgiven him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61444:30"/>
and would have lookt upon it as an unpardonable crime, should he once have entertain'd so much as a thought of making use of the bounty of this charming <hi>Sultaness</hi> to extract from thence advantages so mean, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a man of honor.</p>
               <p>One day entertaining his Mistriss at this rate, and telling her the despair he was in that he could not approach nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to her, to have the honor at least to kiss her hand, and that the <hi>Sultaness</hi> manifested to him the same desire, <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> contriv'd a way to satisfie them both in that particular; bidding <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> go look a little below the old pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where he would find a pipe of Lead, through which in summer they convey'd water into the Bath, and there try if he could not thrust in his arm. <hi>Albirond</hi> accordingly went, and found it true the Slave had told him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the pipe, which went through the wall; and returned to bring them the news. Upon which the <hi>Sultaness</hi> lost no time to go meet her Gallant, who so soon as he heard a noyse on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the Wall, thrust in his hand, which his Mistriss taking she carrest it a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61444:30"/>
thousand pretty wayes, and having done so a pretty space, put through her own to <hi>Albirond</hi>'s side, who kist it a thousand thousand times, and paid it back the civili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies he had received. If I was not now speaking of Lovers, I know the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld would think me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ridiculous to insist upon these little foolings betwixt them, but such as know any thing of Love, will confess to me, that toying is none of the least delights, and that in the beginning of a passion, one turns every thing to good fortune. This perhaps was one of the greatest that <hi>Albirond</hi> was to expect or hope for, and he thought his sufferings very well recompenced with this little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Nothing could be so lovely as that hand of hers set off with a great number of rich rings; but notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which he priz'd infinitely more was the incomparable whiteness of it, which in truth he was so strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken withal, that at that moment he would not have exchang'd that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle hand, for the most beautiful body in the whole world, that of the same piece only excepted. However this kind of sport ended at last, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61444:31"/>
both of them several times past, and repast both the one hand, and the other, at one of which times the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness</hi> took <hi>Albironds,</hi> and layd it in her bosome, which <hi>Albirond</hi> was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sensible of, both by the Softness, and the roundness of what he felt. And this hole serv'd them for some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with several grateful opportunities of enjoying yet more and newer inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of delight, in despite of the rude restraint of the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> but that wherein the Traffick of Love seem'd to be the most pleasingly maintained betwixt them through this Conduit, was in the amorous Letters they convey'd by this means to one another, so that nothing more could have been desired, but that it had been a little bigger, that they might have seen one another; or rather wide enough to pass through to a more perfect enjoyment.</p>
               <p>These little <hi>Gantilesses</hi> having past betwixt them to their mutual satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Albirond</hi> return'd again to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where he was no sooner come, but that the Slave gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the <hi>Sultaness</hi> was a little offended with him; at which he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61444:31"/>
was very much surpriz'd, and askt her for what, for that he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how he could any way have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged her. It is (replied <hi>Isabella</hi>) because she expected you should have taken one of the Rings from off her fingers, to have kept it for her sake, as she believes had you had a real passion for her, you would have done. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Cavalier</hi> entreated <hi>Isabella</hi> to appease her Mistriss, by giving her to understand, that it was not the custom of the <hi>French Cavaliers</hi> to take any thing from fair Ladies, but rather to present them, than to receive any thing from them, as it was all the reason in the world they should. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> who was gone no further but into her Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net to take thence a Letter she had writ the night before, upon this imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately return'd to the window, where <hi>Isabella</hi> presented her with the excuses <hi>Albirond</hi> had desir'd her to make in his behalf, with which, and without much difficulty, she soon put her out of her little pet; I will nevertheless, said she, that <hi>Albirond</hi> hereafter accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himself to the humor of our Country, so long as he continues in it,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61444:32"/>
and afterwards he may pursue his own method with the Ladies of <hi>Europe</hi> if he please. We Women here are as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous as the men are in his Country, and he is not to pretend to an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over us in that particular. It seems then Madam (said <hi>Albirond</hi>) that you will after this manner buy those hearts, which your own charmes have power sufficient to subdue to your devotion; it would also seem (replied the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness</hi>) that you would make a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of ours, which your own merits do themselves enough deserve. We consider not all the value of the things we present, we only seek the pleasure of giving; and that because it is a high testimony of Love, when we frankly bestow our favors.</p>
               <p>This was no ill passing away of a mans time in <hi>Barbary</hi> to be treated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner by so beautiful a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and had there been any bounds in Love, with which a man could rest content, <hi>Albirond</hi> had certainly been in a very happy condition, and had had all the reason imaginable to be highly satisfied with his fortune; but it is not love when a man can stop there, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61444:32"/>
it is impossible to love, and not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue it to the end. In the mean time this passionate <hi>Amoroso</hi> could not tell how to hope for much more than he had already received; he lov'd in a place where nothing but a spirit could get in, the door of the prison of these fair Slaves was never open to any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to those poor Martirs of Jealousy; and what wayes so ever <hi>Albirond</hi> could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to this end, he found them all full of danger and impossibility: nay <hi>Isabella</hi> her (self with all the wit she had) was to seek in this affair, and the <hi>Sultaness</hi> who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e desire was equally great with that of <hi>Albirond,</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to consider, in what an unhappy perplexity she had embark't herself, to love where there was no possible hope of remedy. Alass! said she one day to her slave, into what a misfortune (my dear <hi>Isabella</hi>) have I blindly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated my self; which is such, that whether I love, or am beloved, I find my self on all sides environ'd with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. For what advantage is it to me, that a dear Lover has a noble passion for me, if I can no way relieve him? my own torment by that meanes only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61444:33"/>
so much the greater, and I suffer at the same time all the miseries I cause in him. What have I committed against Heaven to endow me with a destiny so averse to Love! or why does Love make me love, where destiny has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpos'd so many invincible difficulties betwixt my love, and me!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Isabella,</hi> who besides the obligation she had to her Mistriss, had moreover a particular inclination for her; did not here abandon her in her sorrow, but shar'd with her the one half of her Tears. There was nothing she would not have undertaken to ease her of her grief, in order whereunto she every day attempted something; but still to no purpose, so that she was fain to referr it to time to produce some happy altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the fortune of her afflicted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss. But time brings a very slow and pitiful relief to the passion of Lovers to whom every moment seems an Age. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> found nothing in that, that any way contributed to her conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; death it self would have been more welcome to her, than those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, and she desir'd, and indeed in the languishing condition she then
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61444:33"/>
was, stood in need of a prompter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p>In the end she unbethought her self, that <hi>Albirond</hi> might perhaps come through the <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> apartment to a window of her Chamber that lookt into the Bath of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which though it was shut up with a Gril it would nevertheless be some ease to their torments, if she might once at least embrace him through the Grate, to obtain which she had nothing to do but to corrupt the Governor of the Pallace; which she doubted not but <hi>Albirond</hi> might easily bring about. This project of hers she communicated to <hi>Isabella,</hi> who upon the hearing of it confest, That Love was very inventive in the wits of those who were his <hi>Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites:</hi> For that she (she said) could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thought of such an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. She saw no impossibility in the thing, and the sole difficulty of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming the Governor appear'd unto her a very easy matter for <hi>Albirond</hi> to effect; who being very much conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Pallace, might with some little Present make him do whatever he would have him. The <hi>Sultaness</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:61444:34"/>
was mighty well pleased to see her plot approv'd of by <hi>Isabella,</hi> and that she saw so little difficulty in effecting it, wherefore so soon as <hi>Albirond</hi> came in the morning she told him what she had thought on in order to some little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of each other, and that it would not be amiss for him to take a little pains to try if he could not bring it about. It is not to be presum'd that so passionate a Lover must needs be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visht with so fair an occasion, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd therefore that he would neglect nothing; but would use his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to overcome all difficulties, and so departed. All the remainder of the day he spent in meditating of the means and prepared himself for his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as a thing upon which his good or evil fortune chiefly depended. It was nevertheless an odd kind of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to see a fair Lady with whom he was passionately in love through a few Iron Bars only, in which at once there would be pleasure and pain mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but yet (if we consider it) what a happiness it must needs be to a Lover who had never seen her before, but at the distance of fourty Cubits o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61444:34"/>
his head, is not easy to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
               <p>Now this Governor, that he was to deal withal, was a man of a Bruitish and difficult humor, who was not to be overeacht by subtilties and devices; and therefore it was necessary to deal with him by hand, and to engage him by a Bribe, and yet there was no safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in trusting him with so dangerous a secret. It was therefore requisite to make the engine move without giving him any light into the affair, and that was a thing of no ordinary difficulty. <hi>Albirond</hi> nevertheless (hoping all things from Love and Fortune) made provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some bottles of excellent wine, together with good store of Fowl, and whatever else was necessary for a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som treat, with these he takes a case of very fine pistols that he had brought out of <hi>France</hi> along with him, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by three Slaves that carried all the good provision, goes early in the morning to the Garden. Being come to the place he repairs forthwith to the Governors Lodgings, whom he found in his Chamber, telling him at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the room, that he was come
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61444:35"/>
to dine with him, and to that purpose had brought wherewithal to make a tollerable repast, that therefore there remain'd no more care nor trouble for him, but only to cause a good fire to be made to get ready the Fowl, and so fall too. The Governor at this good news a little unbent his angry brows, but that which chiefly made him clear up his sullen looks, was the sight of the bottles of Wine, which was not fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him, it being a liquor that he seldom tasted of but at such good times as the <hi>Beglerheg</hi> came thither to make a debauch. A stoop of good Wine is an admirable pass-port wherever a man goes, and better receiv'd in all places, than the best letters of recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Governor had a drunken Soul of his own, which made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Albirond</hi> at the first appearance of the Bottles with a civility not usual to his brutish nature, but after he had drunk half a dozen Glasses, he fell to caressing him with the greatest ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and friendship imaginable. He lik'd the Wine wonderfully well, which made our <hi>Cavalier,</hi> who would loose no opportunity of setting all his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61444:35"/>
engines on work, tell him, that if he lik'd that sort of Wine, he might send for it if he pleased every day, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement that I do assure you, in few words, pleased; and prevail'd upon him more than a long set speech, penn'd with the greatest elegancy and art. The house was all on a roar with joy, by the example of the Governor, whom his servants had not seen in so good a humor of many a day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albirond</hi> took an occasion whilst dinner was making ready to go take a turn, or two in the Garden, where being come, he saw no body at the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Rendez-vouz, and yet the hour appointed was already past, but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a little noise he drew the Slave to the window, who died with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to see him come, by reason the <hi>Sultaness</hi> was in so great anxiety, that she was layd down upon her Bed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain her melancholy, believing that since <hi>Albirond</hi> so long deferr'd his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, he was certainly frustrated in his design. She ran therefore in all haste to tell her Mistriss he was there, who thereupon presently appear'd at the window but infinitely sad, though
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61444:36"/>
with a sadness that immediately clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up upon the sight of her Lover, who there gave her an account of the good forwardness their affairs were in. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> was very well satisfied with the news; and was so confident of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bironds</hi> dexterity (as people are apt to believe what best pleases them) that she doubted not of having that very day the joy of embracing, and kissing her beloved Servant.</p>
               <p>They then past away some time in flattering one another, with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights they should enjoy in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, which also they already seem'd to taste by way of advance, when a certain noise interrupted their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and made them both shift as fast as they could to conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. This was the Governor who himself was come to call <hi>Albirond</hi> in to dinner; and having run through all the walks of the Garden, had left no place unsought but that side only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wise he examin'd from the one end to the other, without any news never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless of him he sought for, by reason that he had conceal'd himself in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61444:36"/>
and who so soon as the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was gone a little past him, stole out behind him, and taking the shortest cut out of the Garden went into the Kitchin. <hi>Azem</hi> (for so was this Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor call'd) came in also presently after, telling him that he had been all over the Garden to seek him.</p>
               <p>The Cloth was presently layd, down they sate, and to't they fell with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good appetites; but they did not eat so well, but that they drank a great deal better. <hi>Azem</hi> had moreover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the three Guards of the Pallace (for there was no more) who likewise laid lustily about them, insomuch that it requir'd very little pains to make them drunk, for they drunk freely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of themselves, and voluntarily doubled the healths that <hi>Albirond</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
               <p>The dinner lasted a little too long for those Guards, who were oblig'd to be continually at the Gates of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and it had been no less than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent death had the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> chanc'd to come, and not found them there which made them take leave of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and return to their post, by which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61444:37"/>
meanes our <hi>Cavalier</hi> had the greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to entertain the Governor, than he had during the time of their being there. He made good use then it is to be supposed of his opportunity, and so good that there past interchangeably great protestations of love and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late friendship betwixt them, when it being now time to give the last blow to the business, <hi>Albirond</hi> drew his case of pistols out of his pocket, and of them made a present to <hi>Azem.</hi> The <hi>Turk</hi> at first made some difficulty of receiving them, thinking it too great a favour, and presently fell to rifling his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to find out something that was fit to give him in return of so great a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and made him an offer of a very fine Cimitar, no no (said <hi>Albirond</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him in his armes) you shall give me nothing but your friendship, only I shall desire of you, if you can do it, to let me see an apartment in the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace I have not yet seen, which I am told is furnisht with the richest furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and have a great curiosity to see it; I mean that which is over the <hi>Mosque.</hi> That quarter (replied the Governor roundly to him) is that which leads to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61444:37"/>
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Women, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are some very fair Romes very richly furnish'd, and where is no spare of Gold and pretious stones; but no one is ever permitted to enter there, but with the <hi>Beglerbeg;</hi> amongst which rooms there is one that looks through a greated window into the Bath of the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> and it would be dangerous both for you, and for me, to have you seen there, by reason this is the season wherein they Bathe.

                  <hi>Azem</hi> was too deeply engaged to his liberality, or had perhaps drunk too deep to deny him this; but it was upon condition, that he should never speak of it to any one living, for that it was as much as his life was worth, should it ever come to be known. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> made no difficulty to give him that assurance, nor the other thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deliver him the Key, and because he was of necessity to go to the City to speak with the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> about some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61444:38"/>
that was to be done in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he entreated him to stay till he came back, that he might return the Key into his own hands.</p>
               <p>In short all things favour'd <hi>Albironds</hi> design, and now the <hi>Sultaness</hi> who had given out to her people that she inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bath, had above a long hour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his coming, when he having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd some doors stole softly from one Chamber to another, till at last he came to that where the window was, and where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>The <hi>Sultaness</hi> was laid down close by the Bath under a Canopy of crimson Damask upon a Bed of the same colour, raised no more than half a foot only from the Ground. There was in the Bath a stove that kept the place suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently warm, from whence issued out a perfume of divers odors, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst it self throughout the whole house, but the face and posture of this charming person carried with them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, that rendred all the Sences,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61444:39"/>
but the sight only of no use. She was in an undress fit to go into the Bath, her hair dishevell'd, her breast all open, her armes at liberty in great wide Sleevs of a Cambrick smock, and for a covering to the best part about her, she had only a short Jupe that reaching very little lower than the knee, gave the eye free access to delicate legs, and feet dress'd in rich buskins embroydered with Gold, and set over with Diamonds: but in truth this picture I here give you of her, is very differing from, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely short of what I received from <hi>Albirond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was asleep when <hi>Albirond</hi> came first to the window, and he had made so little noise in coming that he did not otherwise, than by violence of his sighs disturb her rest. He was turn'd to a statue, at the sight of so many Graces, and what has been fained of the <hi>Metamorphose's,</hi> was at this time true in him. At last this adorable beauty awak'd, and was the most surpriz'd in the world to see <hi>Albirond</hi> so near her, and blushing as if she had been asham'd of being taken in that posture, called for <hi>Isabella</hi> who was at work in the next

You have surpriz'd me <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> said she in a very odd posture, and I am afraid, have seen something that you should not have done; I know not what you think of me. What I have seen (<hi>Madam</hi>) replied <hi>Albirond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> has abated nothing of the affection I have for you, and has only serv'd to augment a Passion which I had thought had been by nothing to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased. I, but for all that (added the fair one) I ought to punish you for not waking me at first, which indeed you should have done. If <hi>Madam</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the <hi>Cavalier</hi> again) you would allow a mans Soul more liberty when he looks upon you, one should then better know ones duty, but a man turns Marble at the sight of so many charms, and if you had not restored my voice, I do believe I should have continued all day without uttering a word. But what ayld you (said she) that you could not speak. Alass my Soul, <hi>Madam,</hi> my Soul (said he) that you have ravisht, and do yet retain from me, so that I know not if I am alive, or no, if you do not

               <p>He received and gave all sorts of kisses, in which conflict his lips were so well bit, that they spin'd out of bloud in above twenty places. The desire with which he was at that time enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, did not however so totally take away his sence of feeling, that he was not sensible of this strange way of kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, which made him shew his bloud to the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> who only laught at it, and wiping his mouth with her own handkercher, call'd his bloud the Soul of sighs, kissing him over and over again, a thousand and a thousand times.

This might have given him some suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and t was also high time for the <hi>Sultaness</hi> to retire, not to give any to the other Women that attended her, who might have thought some accident had befaln her, should she longer than
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61444:41"/>
ordinary have deferr'd to return from the Bath. They began therefore to take leave, and to embrace, as they had been never to see one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and so many tears were shed at parting as drown'd all the pleasures they had lately enjoy'd. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> at this separation put a very fair Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ring upon <hi>Albironds</hi> finger, and he also gave her another that he used to wear, which were the pledges of their faith. What unconscionable Usury does love make his poor subjects pay for two or three moments of delight! It seem'd to <hi>Albirond</hi> that he had lost the light, being separated from the fight of his fair <hi>Sultaness,</hi> and not knowing which way for the future to come to see her so near again, he could have wisht himself dead. What he had seen, and the satisfactions he had had that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, so wholly possessed his mind, that he past over the whole night in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, without the least inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to sleep. The remembrance of which felicities, furiously augmented his unrest, and enflam'd his desires; and when he came to consider that this had been the greatest, if not the last favour
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61444:41"/>
he should ever receive, he fell into a mortal despair. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> in the mean time was no less perplext, and took as little rest as he; for Women are for the most part more violent in their passions than men, especially when they are once arriv'd at such a point, that there is but one step more to the height of their desires. This fair Lady fight away the time upon a Bed which she bath'd with her tears, as if she had been the only person in the world that had the greatest reason to be afflicted, and there was nothing but the company of her dear <hi>Isabella</hi> that did a little conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her for the loss of her dearest Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Pitty my grief (said she to her) my dear Slave; and if there be no cure to be had, find out at least some way to deceive it. Invent some argument, if it be possible, to make me believe I shall once again embrace my beloved <hi>Albirond,</hi> and receive some testimony of his real affection for me, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that I find I cannot live. <hi>Isabella</hi> promis'd her to employ all the wits she had to try to serve her, and to find some means to bring <hi>Albirond</hi> into her arms; telling her withal that she had thought
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61444:42"/>
of one expedient which seemed to be the shortest way, but that it had in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a little difficulty, which she much doubted whether <hi>Albirond,</hi> (though she knew he had the courage to attempt it,) had yet the strength to overcome, which was to come through the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow they were wont to entertein him at to which end she would let him down a Rope to help him.</p>
               <p>This was in truth a design of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They past over the whole night in plotting their heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon this subject, and in the morning so soon as it was day, and that <hi>Albirond</hi> was come into the Garden (for

Upon this the Slave went presently to fetch one she had already prepar'd for the purpose, and return'd bringing the <hi>Sultaness</hi> along with her, who would also lay to her helping hand if need requir'd. They tied the rope then fast to the window, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards let it down to <hi>Albirond,</hi> who in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61444:43"/>
it was both too smooth, and too slender, there was not grasp enough to be taken of it, and it cut his hands to pieces; nevertheless he put to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most force, and redoubling his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, mounted more than half the way. But his vigor could no longer continue in the pain he felt of his hands, and his activity was of so little use, where his strength fail'd him. It was too invincible a labour to perform without the help of a better rope; and he was so weary, that he was able to advance no further, he was therefore constrain'd to go down again, and in so doing, to let himself slip so fast, by reason of the soreness of his hands, that he thought he had broke his Legs, and did effectually put one aukle out of joint with the fall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultaness</hi> was a woful Spectatrix of this unhappy accident, and the cry that <hi>Albirond</hi> made at the pain of his foot, pier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t so deeply into her very heart, that she sunk down half dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the armes of her beloved Slave. Our unfortunate <hi>Cavalier</hi> was so totally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with the sence of his own pain, that he took no notice at all of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61444:43"/>
swooning, and very much ado he had to crawl three or four paces to lean himself against the wall of the Pavilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; such as have had such mischances, know whether they are painful, or no. In the mean time a little ayr that the Slave gave the <hi>Sultaness</hi> by opening her bosom, made her come to her self again, who at the first opening of her eyes, cast them upon her beloved <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> with so languishing a look, as had been of vertue sufficient to have taken away more than the one half of his pain, had it not been a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>waged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the tender sence he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy seen she had for his disaster. But he must no longer delay to get some reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for his foot; wherefore with intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pain he made shift to get to the Garden door, where finding his horse ready for him, he immediately moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in a very little time arriv'd at the City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultaness</hi> saw him limp off in this miserable condition with a heart so shrunk up with sorrow, that she was not able to give him so much as one word; but went presently, and threw her self upon her bed, there to lament
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61444:44"/>
a misfortune so bitter, and of which she accus'd her self for the only cause. Alass (said the afflicted fair one) how miserable (my dear <hi>Albirond</hi>) am I, if I no better reward thy fidelity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! are these the favors that I owe to thy generous passion, and do I only love thee to destroy thee! Ye Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies who are so obstinately bent against me, what pleasure can you taken in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me love after this manner, is it not enough that I am once unfortunate, but you must double my misfortunes? Cruel Destinies! let me alone suffer the effects of all your malice, but forbear to wound me in that part where I am so sensible; be less cruel to so dear a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and I will never complain of your utmost severities. His courage, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, his mind, and all those charming qualities he is Master of to so eminent a degree, should me-thinks plead in his behalf, and prevail upon your obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy to afford him a better fortune; and Heaven it self should, in my opinion, work something in his favor. Has he merited your displeasure to that degree to be so ill rewarded for his kindness to me? Oh, if it be possible exercise your
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61444:44"/>
power with less injustice, if you will render your selves worthy of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
               <p>Sorrow was here more eloquent than powerful: when it is not excessive there is a certain kind of pleasure in complaining, which the afflicted are sensible of in evaporating their griefs. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> her self even in her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress found something of consolation in it, that gave some little ease to her heart; and <hi>Isabella</hi> who never left her, did all that in her lay to mollifie the cause of her despair. She remonstrated to her, that the hurt <hi>Albirond</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd was not peradventure so great as she imagin'd it to be, that the next day she hop'd they should see him, and that he would be well, and that even for his sake she ought not to torment her self after that manner; least by so doing she should make her self sick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than which nothing could more crucifie him. This Slave had so ready, and so flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a wit, that she could perswade her to whatever she would; nevertheless it was not enough to this enamour'd Lady to see <hi>Albirond</hi> only, if she could only see him as she had hitherto done,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61444:45"/>
and though he should be cur'd of his foot, his heart would still remain in the same wounded condition, neither would that amendment in him cure her of her burning desire wherewith she was continually tormented. Ah <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> (said she to her upon this subject) how furious a passion is love, when one has no hope of remedy! What good will it do me to see him, if I do not see him here, if I continue still in the same torments, and cannot obtein opportunity to manifest to him my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous transports, and mix my Soul with his? Well <hi>Madam</hi> (replied the Slave) have a little patience; Love is ingenuous, and <hi>Albirond</hi> will I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you again find means to see you in the Bath, by once more deceiving the Governor. That thou art simple (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the <hi>Sultaness</hi> with a little free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) to believe that love can be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through an Iron Grate. There must be nothing betwixt us two, but that God of our Souls, and Iron Bars are both too hard, and too cold to permit us to taste the pleasures of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and enflam'd ardor. She spoke with this liberty to <hi>Isabella,</hi> whose heart
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61444:45"/>
and fidelity were sufficiently known to her, and also her torments were a little mollified by these discourses, for a little thing will serve to ease the pains of these Lovers, and to qualifie them for a time. But in the morning when she saw that <hi>Albirond</hi> came not, she then fell in good earnest into so great a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that she neither aet nor drank any thing of all that day, giving <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> to apprehend, that she would fall into the last despair. The other Slaves that attended on her thought she had been ill of some violent feavor, the rumor whereof was spread throughout the whole <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning came to the ear of the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albirond</hi> so soon as ever he came into the City, presently got his ankle set, and by the advise of his Chirurgeon kept his Chamber. He did not howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loose his time, but having got a better rope than the former, he fitted it after such manner, that it might be a little more useful to him in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his design.

made here and there certain little Rounds or steps upon which he might rest one foot when he was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                  </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to the afflicted <hi>Sultaness</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the instant started up, and flew with unimaginable swiftness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the place, though her weakness was such as upon any other occasion would hardly have permitted her to set one foot before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, where being come she appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her happy Lover in a funeral pomp, which did not ill set off the whiteness of her skin, and which was a great black veil that cover'd her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy all over. <hi>Albirond</hi> discover'd in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61444:47"/>
eyes of his beautiful Mistriss, as well as in her habit, something that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary sad, and even her posture was so languishing; that he was afraid some dire misfortune had befaln her; which made him in great anxiety of thought, demand of her the cause of so great sadness; when the Slave seeing her Mistriss return no answer, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to speak for her, telling him that the <hi>Sultaness</hi> had like to have died for sorrow, at the accident had the other day befaln him, which she did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be much greater than it was, by reason he had not been there the day before, and that that was the cause of the alteration he saw in her. <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> then acquainted them with the reason, and consecutively shew'd them the rope he had brought, at the same time linking it at the end of the former, which yet hung down, and which they also drew up to them, and made it fast to the window.</p>
               <p>The trees did so shade the wall of that apartment of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> that <hi>Albirond</hi> could not possibly be seen. He therefore began his Scalado, wherein he scrambled so well, and made so
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61444:48"/>
good shift, what with his hands, and what with his feet, that at last with much adoe he got up to the window. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> had withdrawn her self into her Chamber for fear of seeing him receive another disgrace, so that pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the rope up to him, he follow'd <hi>Isabella,</hi> who led him by a pair of stairs of fifteen or twenty steps, which mounted into her Mistrisses Chamber. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> did not as yet appear, and the impatience of our <hi>Amoroso</hi> was such as not longer to endure to be delaid from seeing her, which made him with great earnestness demand of <hi>Isabella</hi> where she was, to which the Slave made answer, that she was only gone to put on Ornaments more suitable to the present joy of seeing him in that place, and would immediately return. Accordingly she delaid not to come, and at her first entrance into the room throwing herself into the armes of her amorous Gallant, she gave him by that action an infallible testimony of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary passion; as <hi>Albirond</hi> also by devouring kisses, and close embraces demonstrated his; in which affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Contention they naturally
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61444:48"/>
strove who should exceed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I shall not here trouble my Reader; nor my self with a description of the furniture of this Apartment, within which was a Cabinet or Closet hung with cloath of Gold, set all over with Emeralds and Diamonds, of which I shall only in general give this short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; That it was a place sufficient in it self to have created Love, had they brought none along with them. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> led <hi>Albirond</hi> into this splendid Cabinet, where they both of them sate down upon embroyder'd Cushions close by a bed of the <hi>Turkish</hi> fashion; and where being sate, they look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another without speaking one word, as both of them knowing one anothers minds, without it being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that either of them should break the Ice. These moments are none of the least happy, but they are of very little duration, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of passion does with great facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty transport us to delights of greater ardor. The Beds of that Country are the most commodious in the world, for certain little wanton purposes; they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61444:49"/>
are very little rais'd from the Ground; and love had rendred the fair <hi>African</hi> so feeble, that <hi>Albirond</hi> with one sigh blew her flat upon her back into the middle of this by which they were sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Who that had seen these two young people in this posture, but would have thought the hour of their happiness had been now come, wherein to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their mutual fires, and to mix their souls; and that there was now no further obstacle to their full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one another: but <hi>Isabella</hi> came just in the nick to spoil the sport, and made them to separate in so great haste, that it was not a minute to be delaid. Ah <hi>Madam</hi> said she (as she entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cabinet pale, and almost breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less for fear) we are lost, we are undone, for here is the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> come in, and is already enter'd the Apartment. The very name of the <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately frose up the bloud of the two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers already in the height of Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and strook them into so great an astonishment, that <hi>Albirond</hi> knew not which way to take, nor what to do: but the <hi>Sultaness</hi> without standing to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61444:49"/>
pause, hastily going out lock'd him in the Cabinet, from whence he would with all his heart have thrown himself out of the window, had it not look'd into the Base-Court of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Neither could he go back by the same way he came without danger of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Beblerbeg,</hi> so that every thing fill'd him with fear and confusion, and he fancied every moment that he was already taken. He therefore fell to peeping up and down for some little hole, or corner wherein to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but the place that in the end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd him, was too little to be by him discover'd at first sight, and in a hurry and fright wherein he sought it; though at last he found a little door in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Cabinet behind the hangings, wherein by good fortune the Key ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally was, and in opening found that it was (sir-reverence) a house of office. The place was very straight and capable of containing very little more than one person only, especially one of his bulk and stature, however he thought it at this time the finest place that ever he had been in, and very glad he was that he had found it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61444:50"/>
it was at that time of all others the most proper for him. I cannot ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless affirm that his joy was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether perfect: For he was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe there, and in the apprehension he was, some one might perhaps have seen him climb the window, who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> with it, he could not but think he should presently be found out; and it was no small cause he had to fear, for the least that could befall him, should he be taken there, was to be roasted, or flead alive, and that without appeal or any hopes of pardon. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> on the other side after she had lock't <hi>Albirond</hi> in the Cabinet, and put the Key in her poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, went, and threw her self upon the Bed in her Chamber, where she lay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting <hi>Sidi Mahomet</hi> her husband. In which condition she much needed not to counterfeit being sick; the fear she was in, not a little contributing to make her look very pale and ill.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> whom the report of his wives sickness had drawn thither so early in the morning to cure her by his presence, at his coming into the room carrest and kist her a thousand and a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61444:50"/>
thousand times; for you must know, that it is ordinary with the <hi>Turkish</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when their husbands never so little omit their ordinary visits to them, to take it so hainously to heart, as to be effectually sick indeed. Wherefore <hi>Sedi Mahomet</hi> thinking the <hi>Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>taness</hi> had no other Malady but that, and no longer to defer the remedy he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to apply unto her, bid his wife cause her Cabinet to be opened, for there it was that at his kindest visits he usually past the time away with her: But the unfortunate Lady concluding that there would be an end of <hi>Albirond</hi> if she should open it, pretended to have lost the Key two dayes before. The excuse was passable enough to be found out on the suddain, but it would not serve the turn, for the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> to shew how impatient he was to content her, seeing the Key was not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently had, commanded some of the Eunuch's to break open the door.</p>
               <p>Whoever had at this time been in <hi>Albironds</hi> place, would doubtless, as well as he, have been damnably afraid of his Carcass; he heard, and almost fell't every bounce they gave at the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61444:51"/>
door, and then it was that he really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd they knew of his being there. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very blow of the hammer pierc'd quite through his head, and so shook his very heart, that he was twice or thrice upon the point, rather to let himself slip down through the hole of the privy, then to suffer those cruel torments that he imagin'd were prepar'd for him. The <hi>Suitaness</hi> was in no less fear than he, which made her fancy her self already half dead, and was once resolved to discover the whole truth to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and to make an offer of her own life to save her friend.</p>
               <p>The door was at last forc'd open, whereupon she first enter'd in, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> from precipitating a bloudy revenge upon her beloved Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, when being enter'd she was as much astonish'd on the other side, not to see him there. She could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what could be become of him, and therefore knew not whether she should rejoice or be sad, nevertheless she fear'd the worst, and could find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in her hope that could minister the least consolation to her: but her good fortune was such, that what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61444:51"/>
or emotion soever, the <hi>Turk</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in the countenance of his wife, he never attributed it to any thing but her disease, and therefore without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating further into the cause of her confusion, past away with her half an hour upon the same bed where <hi>Albirond</hi> had begun to be happy. After which he took her along with him to go both together into the Bath, and then it was that the <hi>Sultaness</hi> cast her eyes round for <hi>Isabella,</hi> to give her some account of <hi>Albirond,</hi> and what was become of him; but she playd least in sight, for the Slave out of the apprehension she had conceived that <hi>Sedi Mahomet's</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry should extend it self even to her (as it was very likely it would) was gone to hide her self in a secret place of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> from whence also she came not out, till she heard the noise they made in going to the Bathe. At this noise she took a little heart, and by reason she heard no sound of anger or complaint, concluded that all was at peace, and well in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> In this opinion therefore she crept by degrees into her Mistresses Apartment, where being come, not any one said one sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61444:52"/>
to her, and yet she knew not what to think to see the door of the Cabinet open, where she still concluded that <hi>Albirond</hi> must needs be, and out of that conceipt fell to searching up and down for him; which having done a pretty while to no effect, she then went to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of her compunions for the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Upon enquiry she found all things as well as heart could wish, and she was only in pain for the unfortunate <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond,</hi> whom she could not imagine what should be become of, which made her again rumble up and down the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; to see if she could not find him hid in some corner of the room. To this purpose she lifted up the Arras quite round the Cabinet, and in so doing past twice or thrice by the door of the house of office, but not seeing the Key in it, she concluded he could not be there. Nevertheless, a little recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her self, and remembring that she had left it in the door that morning, she had I know not what kind of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy, that <hi>Albirond</hi> was infallibly hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in that place. There was now no body left in the Appartment, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Slaves being by this time gone
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61444:52"/>
down after the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> and she had made the doors so sure that no body could get in but by her admission; so that she rapt at the closet door with great assurance, calling <hi>Albirond</hi> aloud by his name, who presently made answer demanding of her if the coast was clear, and if he might come out in safety, to which she having made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that he might, that she was all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and there was no cause of fear, she so far assured him that be a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his lost Spirits at the good news, and ventur'd to come out. <hi>Isabella</hi> could not at his first appearance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear laughing, to see him look so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and so pale, and in that merry pin askt him, how he had past away his time in that house of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ease; Why, much worse (replied <hi>Albirond</hi>) than any one can imagine, and than any one unless they had been in my place, can believe. But what did you think (added the Slave) would have become of you, and what did you resolve to have done, had you been discover'd? I had not my wits so much about me (replied <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi>) to consider what I had to do, and all that I can tell you is, <note n="*" place="margin">A very ingenuous confession.</note> that never
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61444:53"/>
any one did their business better than I have done in this house of office; and will further confess to you that my fear had very like to have made me scum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer my self to death. Love (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he) is apt to commit many follies, but I think it was more than an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry folly to purchase two or three hours satisfaction at such a price; for it would not only have cost me my life, but moreover that of the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> which is a thousand times dearer to me than my own. These reflections (said <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>) alwaies come too late, and when there is no need of them. if Love had not its dangers, the pleasure would not have been half so great. I have known as wise people as your self, who have run as great a hazard as this of yours, and have not come off half so well as you have done. Alass! and here a deep sigh made a Period to the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Slaves oration, and that sigh was also accompanied with some <note n="*" place="margin">A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that laugh, and cry in a moment.</note> tears, which with her handkerchief she endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to conceal. I very well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive said <hi>Albirond</hi> (who was soon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the shower) what this means, and I have before now discovered in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61444:53"/>
your countenance, that you are not a person to be enslav'd, had not some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary misadventure contributed to the mishap; which also you ought not to conceal from me, for you see that I am upon very good terms with the <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> and that I have some interest with the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> with which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages I fancy at least, I may be able to do you some Service. Deny me not then an account of your fortunes, I am your friend, and you ought not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust me, who repose so absolute a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in your friendship and vertue; prepare your self therefore to give me this satisfaction, that I may contrive some way to serve you, and if you think fit, let it be with the first opportunity; for at present I conceive it very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for me to retire; and having done enough at this bout to escape the fright I have been in, and therefore let me take my leave of the <hi>Sultaness</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. The Slave then told him that her Mistriss was with <hi>Sidi Mahomet</hi> in the Bath, where she usually continued with him two or three hours, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he intended to spoil all, and to loose himself, he was not to think of retiring
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61444:54"/>
by the same way that he came, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the <hi>Beg's</hi> attendants were many of them in the Garden, and therefore he must of necessity stay till he was gone. <hi>Albirond</hi> therefore remain'd still in the Cabinet, but with much less apprehension, then before, when the Slave had assur'd him, that it was <hi>Sidi Mahomet's</hi> custom, so soon as ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he came out of the Bath to return imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the City. The oportunity then being so favourable wherein to satisfie his curiosity in the History of the fair <hi>Isabella,</hi> he would by no means loose it, but looking very intentively upon her, the more I look upon you (said he) the more I discover in you the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of an extraordinary person; I shall not however desire to penetrate very far into your secrets, forasmuch as that may perhaps be troublesome if not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to you, I shall therefore only desire to know so much of your life, as you have your self a mind to tell me; but withal I cannot but declare that I have an extream desire to oblige you, and do assure you that you shall in me find the fidelity of a man whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession as well as ambition it has ever
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61444:54"/>
been to serve the beautiful sex, and to be useful to the Commonwealth of Ladies. I see very well (replied the fair Slave) that my tears have discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you, one part of my misfortune, and I find my heart enclin'd to lay open its deepest wounds to your view, my eyes have already told you too much for me to gainsay, and the esteem I have of your person has so great an Empire over me, that though I were certain to perish by my own confession, I could not nevertheless conceal any thing from you; perhaps you had already heard the whole story of my unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate life, had I had opportunity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to have made you the Relation, and seeing you have the Complaisance to give ear to the complaints of a poor afflicted person, I will not loose this of satisfying your curiosity in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of a disasterous fortune, wherein I will also disguise nothing of the truth: and if in the conduct of my life you shall peradventure find any thing fit to condemn, yet the franckness and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Was born in the City of <hi>Valence</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> desoended from one of the noblest Families of the Kingdom cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Penarocca,</hi> and from Ancestors whose bloud upon several brave occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hath given testimony of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and whose vertues and merit have rais'd them to the principal Charges, and chiefest Commands in <hi>Spain.</hi> My birth was happy enough. Nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought me into the world in such a condition, and having been (if I may say so) too liberal both to my person, and my mind for me reasonably to complain; and I was brought up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of a Mother who was so passionately fond of me, that in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the World, she had no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret but only to part with me. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (which it appears had no intention to favor me long) began in her death to persecute me. I was at the time when she died too young to lament her
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61444:55"/>
death to such a degree as became the funeral of so excellent a Mother, and to be enough sensible of the great loss I sustein'd; but time has since obtein'd that from my better understanding which my innocence knew not how justly to pay to her obsequies: I was left (together with one only brother) to consolate a Father, whom the sole consideration and fear of making us unhappy, prevented in the resolution he had taken to die, that he might not survive so sensible a separation. The passion he had for his Wife was very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the affection he ever bare to us; for he would never marry again, though he was of such a vigorous age, as might justly excuse it, but made it his whole concern to bring us up after such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as became children of our Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Our Family was very rich, and out of regard to the portion. I had good reason to expect, there were a great many Matches ready for me in <hi>Valence,</hi> even before I was of an age to be married. My Father who was in no great hast to marry me away, and whose only joy almost it was to see me with him, would not so soon part with me,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61444:56"/>
but suffered me at liberty to enjoy those first years of You<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, which certainly are the sweetest and most pleasant of ones whole life. I had at that time an Aunt who liv'd in a very fair Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, two leagues only from the Town. She was a Widow, and had no Children, and the Estate my Father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected she should leave him at her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease, besides the affection of a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, oblig'd him to an extraordinary complacency towards her. In this dear Aunt of mine I found almost the Love and Fondness I had lost in a passionately affectionate Mother; she would have me continually with her, so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever my Father could pretend in the necessity of his affairs that requir'd my presence in his own house, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless constrain'd to let me bear her company above the one half of the year. This place also where I had more liberty than in the City, pleas'd me much more than the other, and what with the pleasure of the Chace, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten going abroad, we there past away our time in a more delightful leasure. We had there for the most part very good company, but that which most
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61444:56"/>
delighted me was the pleasure I took in enterteining my self sometimes alone in a little wood, that was not above two hundred paces distant from the house. There it was that I us'd to meditate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some over-grown Trees, the shades whereof were very proper to nourish a little melancholick humor, to which I have all my life been a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd.</p>
               <p>One day that I adventur'd to walk a little further in this wood than I was wont at other times to do, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Company than a young Maid only that attended on me, I was suddainly surpriz'd with a noise of Horses, that me-thought made directly towards me, and that by the carreer of their speed, I judg'd would presently be upon me. I had curiosity enough to stay their coming but withal a certain trouble that seiz'd me to see my self thus alone, made me resolve to return without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who they were. Nevertheless, I was diverted from this resolution also by my Brothers voice, which I knew very well at distance, though I could not understand what he said, and that gave me some assurance, He was in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61444:57"/>
company with <hi>Don Pedro</hi> de la <hi>Mera,</hi> and the <hi>Marquiss</hi> de <hi>Pignastella,</hi> both of them Gentlemen of the best quality of <hi>Valence,</hi> who galloping full-drive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, cryed out to me as loud as ever they could, to look too my self; but I knew not of what I was to take heed, for I saw nothing, and the very fear I was in made me incapable of any resolution. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was the first that came up, and very opportunely, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the fury of a wild Boar they had hunted from break of day in the morning, and that had it not been for <hi>Don Pedro</hi> came to fall upon me, as if his only revenge had aim'd at me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. This generous <hi>Cavalier</hi> seeing me in this manifest danger immediately leap'd from his Horse, clap'd hand to his poignard, and with a brave resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expected the encounter of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Animal. He accordingly at his first approach attacqu'd and wounded him; but the force of this Boar was so great, that being after the wound more enrag'd than before, he put us all into extream fear of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s life. He had buried his poignard all but the Guards in the throat of this furious
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61444:57"/>
Beast, which he did not think fit to draw out again, seeing him yet in so great a rage; he had also with his other hand seiz'd his neck; but for all that he was not Master of him, and he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably doubted to come off with the worse in the end, which made him call out to my Brother and the <hi>Marquiss</hi> to shoot. My Brother who lov'd him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely well, and who was afraid of making an unlucky shot, in killing the one instead of the other, durst not adventure to fire his pistol upon the Beast, but bid the <hi>Marquiss</hi> do it, who accordingly did, though not so well ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, but that in laying the Boar dead upon the place, he also cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I beheld all this strange adventure with a trembling that I could not shake off, nor perswade to leave me even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Boar was dead.

                  </gap>ice upon this occasion. In the mean time my Aunt, who had heard something of his accident by the Maid that waited on me, and who had run home again upon the first alarm, came with five or six of her servants, who took up <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and carried him to her house, where all the care was taken of him, that a man of his quality could expect, and the service he had done for me did justly deserve.</p>
               <p>I was not much acquainted with this <hi>Cavalier,</hi> for I had never seen him but once before with my brother, but the good Office he had so lately done me, appear'd to me so highly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the blood he had spilt only to preserve mine, had touch'd my heart with so sensible a pity, that I conceiv'd the care of his cure principally belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to me, and was as sensible of his mischance, if not more than he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61444:58"/>
He was handsome, had a great deal of wit, and withal had so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular a grace in every thing he said or did, that the least action of his was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make one love him. I was then very young being not full sixteen, and the little conversation I had had with Lovers made me so ignorant in those affairs, that I scarce knew what Love was. The <hi>Marquiss</hi> had been the first who had ever spoke to me of any such thing, he indeed had pretended to me, who also being of a very illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Family, my Father had not thought fit to forbid him. He therefore had spoke to me three or four times to that purpose, which I had ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and look'd upon as the discourses of a Man of wit, who spoke very well; and consequently without taking any further notice of the liberty he took in declaring his passion, had only laught at that, whereat, had I understood my self, I ought to have been offended, and gave him leave to say whatever he would upon that subject. His affairs however were nothing the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd by those opportunities I gave him to court me, and whether it were
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61444:59"/>
that he wanted a friend in my heart to speak for him, or that he had not the art to gain it in his favor, his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship made no manner of impression; but on the contrary I conceiv'd such a (I know not what) kind of animosity against him, from the time that he had hurt <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> though he had done it out of a friendly design, that after that I scarce ever saw him, but with a dislike, even to horror. I knew well enough that he had wounded him with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to do him service, and that I had no reason to think the more of him upon that account, yet could I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer my aversion to him; I could have wisht he had been more <hi>adroit</hi> and that he had done what was impossible for him to do. To conclude, and to tell you the truth, this wound was so fresh and bleeding in my heart, that I could not so soon forgive him, what reason soever in my own sense he might have on his side to plead in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
               <p>This injustice of mine towards the <hi>Marquiss</hi> had perhaps no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, than the too tender sentiments I had entertain'd in favor of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61444:59"/>
whom I was eternally commending for his generosity and courage, was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually and openly declaring that I stood oblig'd to him for my life, and was evermore keeping a great clutter and taking visibly upon me the care to see him well look'd unto, and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serv'd. My Aunt and my Brother attributed this diligence and passion of mine to no other cause, but only to the gratitude and acknowledgment the signal service he had done me oblig'd me to, but the <hi>Marquiss,</hi> (whom Love had made much clearer sighted, and who interpreted the care I took of <hi>Don Pedro</hi> like a jealous Lover,) penetrated deeper into the truth of what began to spring in my bosome, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that time forward began to conceive a Mortal and implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred against his friend. His jealousy soon discover'd it self, and he was not long before he gave me infallible testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of it, of which the first occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he took was, when one day he heard me enquire of <hi>Don Pedro's Valet</hi> de <hi>Chambre</hi> how his Master did. You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your self so very much (said he) for this sick man, that I think if he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61444:60"/>
quickly recover he will stand oblig'd to you for the best part of his cure. I could be glad (replied I) that he should be oblig'd to me for it all, and yet I should think I had not made a sufficient return for the Life Iowe to his Valour. Could every one (said he) who would willingly expose themselves for you, assure themselves of such an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, they would be too happy. I know not (answered I) who those are that would run the same hazard; but I have seen <hi>Don Pedro</hi> do it, and that is enough. At these last words I would have gone away to disingage my self from further parly with him, but he follow'd me continuing to say after this manner to me; 'tis in truth (<hi>Madam</hi>) a very inconsiderable service once only to expose a mans life for you; there are who every day dy before your eyes, without the least reward of compassion from you, and without your being in the least concern'd for them. To this I would return no answer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because I did not on the suddain understand his meaning, or rather (if you will have it so) because I had no mind to understand him, that I might
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61444:60"/>
put an end to a discourse that was by no meanes pleasing to me; where my Brother came in very opportunely to my relief, and delivered me from my importunate Gallant, by taking him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to go see the fishing, for those great fishes they call Gurnards.</p>
               <p>This fishing was to be performed close by the Sea shore, not above a quarter of a League distant from the house, so that my Aunt had also the curiosity to go see it, whom I found ready to take Coach, and who would also take me along with her, to be of the party. I doubt not <hi>Albirond</hi> but you have heard of this fishing, the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof is every year in <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and make no question but you very well know the greatness and the strength of this sort of fish. 'Tis a sport of great entertainment, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well worth the seeing; but our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi> having told her that he had seen it, and that it was also in use in his Country, <hi>Isabella</hi> past over the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. The Fishermen (continued she) were ready, and only stayed our coming to give us the diversion; when seeing us come they began to fall to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61444:61"/>
their business to put themselves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to handle their Tridents, a sort of weapon they make use of against these Fish. Our <hi>Cavaliers</hi> would also have a hand in the business, and would have their share of the labour, as well as of the sport, and to that end mixt themselves with the Fishermen, where they signaliz'd their force and dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against these overgrown Fishes. Of these there was a prodigious number, and of a most prodigious greatness, the least of them being as big as a man, and the manner wherewith they disingaged themselves from the hands of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers, and the resistance they made with their tails, had something of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing in it. My Aunt and I were in a little boat by our selves, without the nets, to behold the pleasure of the combat; but our pleasure was of very short continuance and paid with a very great hazard we run of being both drown'd. The nets were, it should seem, old, and had been long used; and the number of the Fishes were so great, that having met with a part of the net that was more rotten than the rest, or perhaps already broken, twenty or
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61444:61"/>
thirty of them rusht through together with so great swiftness and fury, that meeting our boat in the way they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently overturn'd it, plunging my Aunt and me into three or four Fadom depth of Water. The <hi>Marquiss</hi> was the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to us, and first aware of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster. There was no time to loose; he could swim very well, and therefore threw himself into the water with so seasonable a promptness to my relief, that he arriv'd at me just as I rose again from the bottom, from whence my cloaths had bore me up, where suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me with one hand, and swimming with the other, he presently brought me ashoar, which also was not far from us. Two Fishermen that were nimbler, or quicker at least than my brother, did the same service for my Aunt, who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a little more by the accident than I had done, I having been sooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and yet the fright which had wholly possest my Spirits, had reduc'd me to such a condition, that I lay for dead. They then help'd us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge the water we had drunk in, by which we were something reliev'd; but the weakness wherein I found my self
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61444:62"/>
was such, that I yet shew'd very small sign of life. The Grief the <hi>Marquiss</hi> was in to see me in this condition is not to be exprest, but it was very visible in his face, and the tears which he could not refrain were a speaking proof of the passion he had for me.</p>
               <p>So soon as I came a little to my self, I enquir'd news of my Aunt, and was not a little surpriz'd to find my self in the <hi>Marquiss</hi> his arms, and yet more to see his face all cover'd over with tears. I must confess, that in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, he was an object to have touch'd the most obdurate person in the world with compassion, and this tenderness of his spoke so highly in his favor, that it had been to have had no heart not to have been a little sensible for him. He at least merited my esteem; but to what use serves merit, when a man is destin'd to be unhappy; for although every thing pleaded in his behalf, my heart return'd no answer, and was wholly possest with the Love of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that my understanding only paid him the acknowledgment due to his passion; and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was Master of all the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61444:62"/>In the mean time they put us into the Coach, in the pickle we were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Sea, and presently brought us home, where we found all things necessary to relieve us, and to bring us again to our selves. In this case fear was our greatest evil, for we had receiv'd no harm from the Fish; and my Aunt who was of a less delicate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than I, in three or four dayes left her bed, and I thought the time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding long, and my weakness was fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously afflicting to me, in that it would not permit me to continue my little services to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to quit his Bed, and to walk up and down his Chamber. He faild not immediately upon the disaster had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln me, to send his <hi>Valet</hi> de <hi>Chambre</hi> to complement me upon the occasion, by whom I return'd this answer, go tell thy Master (said I) that the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience I find in my sickness, is, that it deprives me of the pleasure I had in contributing something to his cure.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had never seen me but that one time I spoke of before, when my Brother brought him into the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61444:63"/>
House, he had however at that very moment been touch'd with the most tender sentiments it was possible to have for any person with whom one is the most passionately in love. He had found ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> I know not what kind of charms that engage people to love at first sight, without any great reason why, and his passion was daily augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the difficulties he found of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining means and opportunity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his affection to me. Neither could he think of any way so likely, and so fair by which to obtein his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, as by contracting a strict friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with my Brother, which also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great difficulty he brought to pass. He likewise fancied he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no ill beginning to his design in the service he had done me in exposing his life against the surious Boar; but when he heard of the <hi>Marquis's</hi> good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the new obligation I had to him for a second life also, his jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy faild but very little of throwing him into such a despair, as with his own hands to tear open his wound, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to destroy himself. He knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well what a passion the <hi>Marquiss</hi> had
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61444:63"/>
for me, that my Father approv'd of it, and made no question but that this last adventure would totally gain me to him; the thought whereof afflicted him in such sort, that whatever obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging messages I had sent him by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, he perverted them wholly to his own disadvantage; and poyson'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with that which ought in reason to have been his cure. He repeated from time to time the words had been brought him from me, and from thence form'd a fatal sentence against himself: Go (said the poor afflicted <hi>Cavalier</hi>) and tell thy Master, that the greatest inconvenience I find in my own indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, is, that this accident deprives me of the pleasure I took in contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting something to his cure. Is not this (continued he) to give me plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to understand, that my Rivals last service has obliterated all the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation she could have to that she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from me, and that she cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injustice do any thing in my favor? Yes, I confess it (charming <hi>Isabella</hi>) he has perform'd more for you, than I could do, he has rescued you from the merciless waves wherein you were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61444:64"/>
to perish, and in so doing expos'd his own life to manifest ruine: Yet (said he again presently after) did not I also rescue you from as great a danger of death, and did not I also venture my life more adventurously than he, and does that merit nothing? Have I only escaped the Tushes of that enraged Beast, to dye by you? Ah how much more happy had my fate been, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an end to my dayes to prolong yours, than thus to wear it away in this miserable manner, without any hope ever to approach the delight of my eyes, and my only bliss!</p>
               <p>After this manner it was that <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> afflicted himself in the best estate of his most prosperous fortune; and to this degree of unhappiness was he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, by being ignorant of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, whilst the <hi>Marquiss</hi> past away his time much better than he; his Love flattered his hope, and after so great a service as he had lately done me, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming me from the Sea, he made no question but that a generous heart, as mine was, must of necessity surrender it self up to his passion. But what share could I give him in my heart, if
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61444:64"/>
the destinies had already so favour'd <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that it was no more my own? would he have had me; or could he in reason expect, that seeing there was some tenderness due to an action that had deliver'd me from death, I should be less grateful to his Rival than to him, who had perform'd the same ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for me, and that with an equal, if not a greater hazard of his own life? perhaps he imagined that there was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an acknowledgment due to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but alass! there is little room for a bare acknowledgment in love; and we little insist upon such poor returns, when we are once possest with such sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents as those in the behalf of any person, our hearts then going altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one way, and there can be no rivality in hearts, though there is in pretenders.</p>
               <p>I now began to rise from my bed, and was well enough to endure the Visits of my friends; my brother therefore came bringing the two <hi>Cavaliers</hi> along with him to see me, and in entring into my Chamber, I have brought here (Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster said he) two of my best friends to give you a visit, to both of which you
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61444:65"/>
in a very little space become indebted for your life, for the one has rescued you from the fury of a Boar, and the other preserved you from the deep; so that after what manner soever you shall consider these two generous actions, I doubt it will puzzle you to determine to which of the two you think your self the most oblig'd, and which way to recompence their services without rendring the one jealous of the other, and dissatisfied with you. I was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to see them both come in toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which made me blush, and put me into some disorder, of which the Rival <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> who immediately took notice of it, made a various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> concluding it to proceed from the trouble of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him there, and that serv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him in his former opinion: but the <hi>Marquiss</hi> more happy in his <hi>Ideas</hi> than he, took it quite after another <hi>Biais,</hi> and turn'd it to his own advantage. In the mean time my heart was possest with thoughts quite coutrary to theirs; for it is true that I was a little out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to see in the person of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss</hi> a man to whom I stood oblig'd for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61444:65"/>
my life, and whom I could find in my heart to recompence with no more, but only a bare esteem, whilst my heart was wholly given up to <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> Could my Brother have penetrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my bosom, he might there have seen the effects of my injustice, but withal of a necessary injustice proceeding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from this, that having been too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous in favor of the first, I had no more left me but a will only to conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the other. I was a little perplext with the question he put to me, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> very seasonably prevented me, to give me time to think of an answer. I conceive (said he looking upon me) that we are both of us sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in the glory of these two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures. <hi>Cavaliers</hi> make a profession of serving fair Ladies, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to other recompence, than that of having serv'd them. I know (said I) what esteem I ought to have both of one, and the other; I acknowledg their merits to be equal, and know very well what so considerable a service as that for which I stand oblig'd to either of them, may reasonably exact from me: but you Brother (said I) who have so
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61444:66"/>
great an interest in my life, will your self I hope acquit me of these obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for I must ingenuously confess I find my self perplext how to do it. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one payes their own debts Sister (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered my Brother laughing) and I shall not engage my self for you to Creditors that perhaps I should not be able to satisfie. If either of us (said the <hi>Marquiss</hi> then) can pretend to any thing more than the honor of having done you service, it is <hi>Don Pedro</hi> without doubt, who has lost some of his bloud to preserve yours, whereas it has cost me no more but only the shifting of my Cloaths. If either of our actions (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to him) be considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 'tis rather yours, wherein you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed your self more, than I did; who only lost my bloud because I wanted dexterity to kill the Boar. Sister (said my Brother) if we will believe these Gentlemen, it will be no very hard matter to disingage you from your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; but I would nevertheless hear you with your own mouth determine to which of them you think your self the most oblig'd. I have already told you Brother (said I) how hard a thing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61444:66"/>
it would be for me to do it, I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rely upon your better judgment, without engaging my self in a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, that would infallibly make me pass for an ingrateful person in the opinion of one of these two <hi>Cavaliers.</hi> Upon this my Aunt came into the room, and we fell upon other discourse; and, to tell you the truth, she came in very good season for me, who was in great fear I should not very well disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my self from a discourse, wherein I saw I was too much prest by my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At last he went out, and my two Lovers with him, each of them pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with the same opinion that before, saving that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> felt himself a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reliev'd from his former trouble, and began to conceive a little hope from certain kind glaunces I had cast upon him, and that might have made him promise to himself all he could have desir'd, had he not been prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with such a jealousy as blinded his understanding. However he observ'd enough to inform him that he ought to despair of nothing, till he should first see further into the affair, upon laying open his heart unto me; an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

that he long'd for, and panted after with the greatest impatience, and that he took hold of after this manner.</p>
               <p>One night that they were all three in my Chamber, and that my Brother was set to Cards with the <hi>Marquiss, Don Pedro,</hi> and I, one on the one side of the Table, and the other on the other to see them play, and sometimes talking to one another of several things. I perceiv'd the trouble he had in his heart, by what I discovered in his face, and his eyes diseourst unto me quite another thing, than what came from his mouth. A certain pleasure that I took in looking upon him, by degrees disperst all those clouds in his countenance, and I observ'd that his sadness clear'd up, as those innocent favors he receiv'd from my eyes encreast upon him. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took a little heart, and in truth it was high time for him to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for he was to go away the next morning to return to <hi>Valence.</hi> He could not approach so near me, as to whisper in my ear a secret of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as that of his Love; the Laws of civility, and fair fashion not permitting
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61444:67"/>
such liberties in our grave and severe Country; neither could he aloud open his bosom to me, in the presence of two of the most dangerous witnesses he had to fear. He was therefore fain to make use of this device, by which you will see what shift Love can make, and how ingenuous and inventive it is in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how to declare and make it self known. He took some Cards that were thrown out of the Game, and held them over the Candle till they were all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver black'd with the flame, which he did with so indifferent an ayr, and without discontinuing his discourse, as though he had done it without any manner of design. After which with the corner of another Card, he writ upon one of those he had smutted for the purpose, some verses, which I think I yet remember, and they were these.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Prest with an amorous extasy,</l>
                  <l>Ought I to speak or hold my breath?</l>
                  <l>If I speak not, alass, I dye;</l>
                  <l>And if I speak, my sawcy tongue</l>
                  <l>For offring to my fair that wrong,</l>
                  <l>Can nothing hope thereby but death.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:61444:68"/>After he had fill'd that Card, he past it over very dextrously to my side of the Table, which whilst I was reading he took another upon which he continued to write after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>No, on this choice I stick too long,</l>
                  <l>Respect to her will tye my tongue;</l>
                  <l>She shall interpret, she, and she alone</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Of the excess of my true flame,</l>
                  <l>And my death one day shall proclaim,</l>
                  <l>So great, and so discreet a passion.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>He did by this as he had done by the other, and convey'd it to me to read, without either my Brother, or the <hi>Marquiss,</hi> (who were intent upon their play) taking notice of us at all; after which I receiv'd a third also, no less gallant than the other two; and of which as I remember these were the words:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Paleness of my face, which with such art</l>
                  <l>Such speaking lines has painted out my flame,</l>
                  <l>Is Speech too eloquent not to proclaim</l>
                  <l>The power a fair one has over my heart:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:61444:68"/>And that no one can Amarillis see,</l>
                  <l>So fair and bright, but must her Martyr be.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>I look'd upon him twice or thrice in reading these papers, with an ayr, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to give him to understand in my eyes more than he could reasonably have desired of me; but he was in such fear there to meet with the sentence of his death, that he durst hardly lift up his to look upon me, but kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in such a posture as would have mov'd my compassion, had I had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to love him. By this time I conceiv'd he had said enough to me to deserve an answer, and in that thought took one of the Cards also; after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving defac'd the Characters of those he had writ upon it, and set my self to framing an answer, by so much the more obliging, by how much I had no mind to suffer him longer to languish, but to assure him of my heart. You see how easy a thing it is for Love to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over a young heart, that has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been acquainted with him. I here made a duty of a favor, that I ought not to have granted till after the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest violence of assault, and yielded
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61444:69"/>
him a confession by way of advance, that ought to have been forc'd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from me with the greatest pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of importunity and prayer. I gave all the liberty to my sighs they would themselves desire, under the shadow of a genorosity of mind, believing the effects of my tenderness towards him, to be the effects of a grateful heart. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner Love did his business so well, that he had already instructed me how to answer a declaration of Love; and I found no great difficulty in expressing my self upon this subject, but I was not so <hi>adroit</hi> as he in convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Card over the Table. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss</hi> who had his eye almost continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon me, and who had seen me write surpriz'd me in the manner, and so, that he had s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ateh'd it out of my hands, had I not been very nimble to prevent him. This insolent action of his, and the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation I was in to have succeeded so ill in my design, put me to the blush, and were the occasion that I spake a little angerly to him. This is very bold (said I) to offer to snatch a thing from me, that you have nothing to do withal, and that was not intended for you. It is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61444:69"/>
true (answered he) that it was intended for <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> but he and I are so good friends, that I thought I might pertake with him in a favor that came from you. At this <hi>Don Pedro</hi> who had made a shew of taking no notice at all of what had past, was ready to break in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fury, rage presently mounted into his eyes, and he was just upon the point to have discharg'd his anger, but I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appeased him with such a look, as gave him to understand, he would oblige me in letting matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and proceeding no further. I would not so much my self as return the <hi>Marquiss</hi> any answer, for fear of pushing things on too far, which were in a better posture as they were, than if I had made him never so good a Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. They then continued their play, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> who had exercised an extream violence over himself in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining his passion, was constrained to make some pretence to go out of the room, that he might unload his heart of the rage where with it was overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and oppressed. It was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he return'd again a little better compos'd, and at his coming made me
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61444:70"/>
to understand, that he should be very glad of an answer from me: but I had no mind to recommence a sport, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I had at the first assay faild to succeed. The obliging manner wherewith I spoke to him, had been sufficient of it self to give him comfort, had not his evil been extream: but besides that one is never enough assured of what they do with the greatest passion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, he moreover fancied the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss</hi> to be a very dangerous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.</p>
               <p>His jealousy was very much augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a little squabble that hapned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them the same night, and of which one of my gloves was the occasion. I fell, I know not upon what foregoing discourse, to speaking at the Gloves that were made at <hi>Valence,</hi> which I said, I thought were as good as those of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> of which that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> might better judg, I pull'd off one of those I had on which were of <hi>Valence,</hi> and gave it to him to smell unto, who kist it two or three times after a very amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fashion, and afterwards restored it to me again, which as I was about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to draw on, the <hi>Marquiss</hi> who had
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61444:70"/>
a mind to have the same honor, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to let him see it. To tell you the truth, I was very glad of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, as well to revenge my self upon him, as also to shew <hi>Don Pedro</hi> a favor, which made me deny him in these words, that I spoke something after a disdainful manner. It is not amiss <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss</hi> (said I) a little to punish you for your boldness to teach you to be more discreet another time; but he from whom this preferrence had taken away all manner of reason and discretion, stept suddenly up to me, and without any kind of respect, at one rude twitch s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atcht it out of my hand. This violence did very much surprize me, and I was so highly offended at it, that durst I have discover'd my indignation before my Brother, I had doubtless past the bounds of a Virgin modesty: but <hi>Don Pedro</hi> who had a particular reason, as you shall presently hear, that this glove should not fall wholly into the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis</hi>'s hands, did not in this sudden sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, neglect the care to rescue it out of his possession, but leaping upon him, seiy'd upon one half of the Glove, and would never let go his hold; but as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61444:71"/>
they were tugging who should get it clear from the other, growing in heat with the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s opposition, who held as fast as he, he told him softly in his ear, that it should cost him his life if he did not let it go: but that was no good argument to the <hi>Marquiss</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him, who more than ever stung with jealousy and honor, strove with all the force he had to make himself wholly Master of the Glove; answering <hi>Don Pedro</hi> with great vehemency, (but likewise in his ear,) that it should cost him his life, if he longer persisted to oppose his design.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. My Brother, who as yet knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s passion, took a delight in seeing them scuffle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fell to railling the <hi>Marquiss;</hi> but the dispute proceeding at last too far to make any longer a jeast of it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to apprehend that they might in the end grow into extreams; wherefore being very well acquainted with the <hi>Marquiss</hi> his fierceness and <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s spirit, without letting them grow to greater heat, stepping betwixt them, he entreated them to forbear further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and to deliver the Glove to him.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61444:71"/>
To this they both consented, having both of them too great a respect for my Brother not to acquiesce in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and besides it was not the interest either of the one or the other in their pretences to me, to be upon ill terms with him. After this manner then my Glove was restor'd back to me, but in a very ill plight; they gave over their play, and the two Rivals parted, as we thought, very fair. My Brother who observ'd them to be yet both of them very much incenst, did not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever make them embrace upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, not thinking what had past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them to be of such importance that it ought to have been any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred having slept upon it, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by two persons betwixt whom he thought there was so great a friendship, as was not to be broken by so small a difference, so that they retir'd each of them to his own apartment, and left me at liberty to go to Bed. Being left to my self, the first thing I did was to put my glove into a better form, for it was betwixt my two Gallants strain'd out of all manner of shape, when putting my hand into it to that purpose, I was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61444:72"/>
a little surpriz'd to find a paper folded up like a letter: I open'd it, and at the bottom saw <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s name sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd, and then presently understood the reason he had to make such a bustle about the Glove to retrive it out of the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s hands, and then also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd he had taken opportunity to write it at the time he had withdrawn into his Chamber: but could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with what <hi>legerdemain</hi> he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd it into my Glove; for though my eye had never been off him whilst he had had it in his hand, I perceiv'd nothing at all of the conveyance. I was then impatient to know the Contents, and I will communicate them to you, for I have ever carried all his Letters about me wherever I went. In saying which <hi>Isabella</hi> took a little Casket she had in the very same Cabinet where they were, from which drawing out several papers, and having tumbled some time amongst them for the right one, she in the end found out this, which opening she delivered to <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> to read, who there found these words.</p>

                     <p>HAd I not (Madam) been withheld by the fear of offending you, the <hi>Marquiss</hi> had been punish'd upon the place for his insolence, and nothing but the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute power you have over me, could have hindred me from taking a prompt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Judge then, I beseech you, how great that power is, and how great the Passion I have for you must be, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence I have prastised upon my self in this occasion. I should never have dared to have spoke so freely to you, were it not now high time to do it, I having this night only left me wherein to be rosolv'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I must live or die. The Cards you read may perhaps have enform'd you of the straight I am in; but I know not what I am to hope for from the answer you then made me; and yet I shall not look upon it in the nature of an obligation I have to the <hi>Marquiss</hi> that he prevented me from seeing the sentence of my mishap.

               <p>After <hi>Albirond</hi> had read this Ticket, he return'd it back to the fair Slave, who after this manner continued his story.</p>
               <p>I know not what effect this Letter might have wrought in another, but as for me I must confess that being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a little prepossest in <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s favor, I found my self strangely moov'd with it. Me-thought there was so much discretion and respect in the manner of his adress, and so much passion in his Letter, that I conceiv'd I ought at least to have a very tender esteem for his merit only, and that I could not deny the sentiments of a very kind friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship at least to so great and so respective a passion. What cannot a Lover per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade when he is acceptable to the person he pretends to? How easily does a heart encline to love, when ones rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is once disordered? and with how great facility do we find out fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61444:73"/>
to deceive our selves when we once entertain a passion, and give our selves leave to love? Nevertherless I will not here confess to you all my weaknesses, nor give you an account of all the follies I was guilty of. I shall content my self therefore with only telling you, that this Ticket mollified all the indignation I had this night conceiv'd at the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and huffing carriage, and that I could not permit any animosity in my Soul to co-habit with the joy and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness this little Love letter had pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest me withal. So that I did not only excuse the <hi>Marquiss,</hi> but moreover en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely forgave him; and all this out of the sole reason I had to be satisfied with my self, after being certainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s affection. I past over the whole night, caressing in my mind this new and dear lover. I made him speak after my own fancy, and say a thousand little things that the best could please me, which was in effect my self to labour to make him absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of a heart in which he thought he had as yet made no impression. Yet how fixt soever I was upon this pleasing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61444:74"/>
object, to tell you the truth, the <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Marquiss</hi> did often confound the delight I took in it, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension I had of appearing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful person. He had perform'd so great a service for me, and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I had to him for my life oblig'd me to have some compassion on him. I had no mind to be accus'd of a vice, which of all others my heart had ever the most abhorr'd: and yet I knew not how to acquit my self towards him as I ought. I could not of my self afford him any thing more than the bare sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of a real esteem, with which I was very sure he would never be satisfied, if there should not be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in the case, and more I had not left to dispose of, and in the mean time the credit he had with my Father, favour'd him on the other side. I knew very well that he would ever be better receiv'd than <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> because he was heir to a better fortune than he, though he was not of a more illustrious Family and that his offer would sooner be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted than that of the other, should he demand me in Marriage. All these reflections did not a little perplex me,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61444:74"/>
I saw how many difficulties were in the way of my inclination, and that I could never hope to be <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Wife, so long as the <hi>Marquiss</hi> should pretend to me. I therefore resolv'd with my self to make an attempt upon his Spirit by freely confessing to him part of the inclination I had for his Rival, and to try by the principles of generosity to reduce him to reason, to obtein from him, that he would not make use of my fathers autority and good disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards him to obtein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of a heart, of which another had already the possession. But in truth he was too far gon in Love for me to hope for any compliance from him in so delicate a point as that, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he should desist from loving me, out of love to my self. He was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Soul with the severity I had practised upon him, and the affront he had receiv'd in the presence of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable and triumphant Rival, had put him quite besides himself. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if fury be madness, seiz'd upon him that very night, and to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he could not sleep one wink, and would a thousand times have plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61444:75"/>
his Steeletto into his own bosom, had not he had a design to have stab'd it into that of his Rival. It was enough he had whisper'd to him in his ear, that it should cost him his life, and he lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for nothing so much as the break of day to determine the controversy betwixt them; a resolution that made him pass over the night with some kind of pleasure, if a man can be capable of pleasure in such a condition as he was in.</p>
               <p>My Brother, who lay in the next Chamber to him, hearing part of the noise he made in rising, and walking up and down all night, and the complaints he sometimes utter'd, knew not what to think of it, and would therefore himself go see what the matter was, and whether or no he might not perhaps be ill. The <hi>Marquiss</hi> seeing him come into the room was extreamly troubled, that the effects of his ill humor had distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed my Brother, and askt his pardon, telling him, that in truth, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not very well, but that it would signify nothing, if he could but get a little rest. Upon which my Brother left him, giving charge to the Servants
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61444:75"/>
to make no noise on that side of the House, but that they should let him sleep all the morning. If melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and trouble of mind do sometimes keep one from sleeping; they do yet sometimes also oppress one with sleep, especially when the mind is agitated to such a degree as is insupportable in it self; which was the reason that this sorrowful Lover, began to sleep at the very time that he had determined to rise, and my Brother who did believe him to be there really sick, went to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to acquaint him with it, and to deferr their departure till the next day. The morning was very fair, and not knowing how to pass away the time they agreed to go Hauk at Partridg, and to come home to dinner, and so they accordingly did.</p>
               <p>In the anxiety of mind wherein the <hi>Marquiss</hi> at that time was, his sleep it is to be suppos'd could not be very long, so that he awak'd very presently after with a suddain start, but a little too late for his design; for his people told him, that my Brother and <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> were gone out a Hawking. It is not to be imagined how infinitely he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61444:76"/>
was troubled at this disappointment; he hated himself for yielding to sleep at such a time as this, and on the instant fell upon a hundred resolutions, which all ended at last in this, that he would take this opportunity to see, and to talk with me, whilst there was no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the House, to interrupt him. He would take hold of this occasion to make me declare the choice I intended to make, that he might be certain of my intentions, and be satisfied from my own mouth, if the ardor of his flame had not had the power to move me in his favor. In this resolution he walk'd a great while up and down his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to meditate after what manner he should break the business to me, and after all, what he was to hope for; wherein his mind was agitated with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts, but amongst them all with very few that administred to him any consolation at all. Every thing opprest him, and he durst promise to himself nothing of good, insomuch that he even prepared himself to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and meditated fit reproaches for my ingratitude.</p>
               <p>The hour was come that he thought
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61444:76"/>
I might be up, and ready; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ask'd leave to see me and I saw him enter my Chamber with such a trouble in his countenance, as at once begat my pity and my fear. He was totally in disorder, and knew not which way to begin what he had meditated to say unto me; he pull'd off his gloves, and presently put them on again, and all without speaking a word, and with so pleasant a countenance, that in earnest one had need of so great an esteem as I had for him, to forbear laughing in his face. At last seeing I assisted him not in beginning the discourse, he broke out almost trembling after this manner. If (<hi>Madam</hi>) in the sad condition to which I am reduc'd by your disdain, I may yet be permitted to hope to be heard—pray give me leave (said I hastily interrupting him) first to explain my self to you, before I hear what you have to say. I cannot deny you the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg you have of speaking to me, but take notice withal, that it would be a little dangerous to you, not to use that liberty as you ought. I know very well that you are netled to the quick; I perceive also that you think you have

reason to be so, and in this belief of yours, you may not perhaps have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand enough over your passion to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear such expressions, as might injure, and justly offend me. I am a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate in this point, and of such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as cannot suffer without doing wrong to my quality, that any one should presume to quarrel me upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny subject whatever, and there is, a certain distance to be observ'd to such women as I am, that people sometimes repent they have transgrest. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention wherewith I observ'd the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss</hi> to give ear to my discourse, though he durst scarce lift his eyes up towards me, was the occasion that I fram'd my self to use him a little more kindly, than I intended to have done had he carried himself after a less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective fashion to me at first; which made me proceed to speak to him after this manner. I have not been so little conversant in the World; nor am so ill read in it, not to know that you are a <hi>Cavalier</hi> of very great merit; neither have I a soul so ingrate as not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that you have done me a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high and signal service, and at the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61444:77"/>
same time to confess that I stand indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you for my life; and if I was a little more Mistriss of my self than I am, I know after what manner I should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit my self of that obligation, and what I should grant to your passion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above the esteem, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any one to deny you. But <hi>Marquiss,</hi> it is no more in my own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to dispose of my self, and to deal sincerely and truly with you, the great service you did me came a little too late for you. The same reasons I may justly have to favor you with my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I have also had to favor another, who (as you have done) did also rescue me from the Jaws of death: Yet do I not so far wrong you in my opinion as to think that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> has more merit, or that in particular he deserves better from me than you do; but he has bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune, and that which two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which either of you have perform'd in my behalf, may each of them reasonably challenge from me, his alone did first clearly carry, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in an absolute necessity of being an ingrate to you. I might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd this from you; but I will be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61444:78"/>
to the last degree towards a man who has done so much for me, and indeed I should condemn my self for unjust, should I not disabuse you, and not franckly confess unto you, that I have nothing left wherewith to pay the obligation I have to your merit and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Yet do not take this unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from me, but rather quarrel your own evil fortune, and content your self with the regret I have, that it is not in my power to make you a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. If you are a man of reason, as I take you to be, you will not ask that of me which it is impossible for me to grant; but on the contrary will make a generous effort to overcome a passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that some other woman shall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deserve, and better acknowledg than I can do. I saw <hi>Don Pedro</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his person betwixt me, and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a chaft and enraged Boar, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his own life to save mine. I saw him cover'd over with the blood of a wound given him by you, and which also pierc'd the very bottom of my heart. Lay the blame then upon that unlucky shot of yours that has so much contributed to your misfortune, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61444:78"/>
pity me in that having one life only I must owe it to two persons at once, and that hereafter I cannot live without appearing at one and the same time too generous and too ingrate. So then <hi>Madam</hi> (said the <hi>Marquiss</hi> with the countenance of a man condemn'd to die) I have nothing to pretend to. You have done too much for me (answer'd I suddainly) to obtein nothing from me, I confess it, and that I may not pass in your opinion for an ungrateful woman I do promise you—at which word <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and my Brother <note n="*" place="margin">By'r Lady in very good time,</note> enter'd my Chamber; and the <hi>Marquiss</hi> who would not for that loose the opportunity of knowing upon the place how far his pretences might go, and what he was to hope for, well <hi>Madam</hi> (said he softly (after I had saluted our Hawkers) what do you promise me?

                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:61444:79"/>
had not the sight of his Rival rowz'd up his Spirits with the incitements of revenge; and yet there remain'd such a disorder in his countenance, as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently denoted there was something extraordinary laboring in his mind. My Brother was not nevertheless any thing at all surpriz'd to see this alteration in his face, imagining it to be nothing but the effect of an ill nights rest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i which made him form his first complement to the enquiring after his health; but in the disorder wherein the <hi>Marquiss</hi> was, he only answer'd him by halves, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner went out of the room. He was immediately followed by my Brother, who thinking his last nights distemper had again suddainly seiz'd him, would go offer him his service, and see what he might stand in need of.</p>
               <p>By this meanes <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was left with me all alone, and a fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it was, no body being by, wherein to declare his mind, neither perhaps could he in his whole life ever again expect so fair an occasion; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less as if we had been afraid to deliver to one another what we had both of us so great a mind to say, we both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61444:79"/>
confounded and dumb. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I should have had more confidence to have spoken to him, had we been at less liberty to do it; I dreaded that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but I was more afraid of my self least I should play the fool in being too open to him, and let him see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into my heart than he ought to do. On the other side he also who might be in suspence after what manner I had received his Letter, did eternally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; every moment to hear a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounc'd, which he should know but too soon, if it were other than favourable to him. Nevertheless during these strang revolutions in our minds, our eyes by a mutual consent by little and little re-assur'd us, and he saw nothing in mine that was of any dangerous portent. Yet did he not well know how to trust to this favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable appearance, but creating cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage out of the force of Love, after he had sometime look'd upon me, I know not (<hi>Madam</hi> said he) what your silence may intend after what I have adventur'd to do, that is after the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I presum'd to write to you, and that doubtless you found in your Glove. If
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61444:80"/>
that liberty I made bold to take, carry any thing in it that may displease you, and if the greatest and the most respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive passion that ever man had, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your indignation, for Heavens sake let it break upon me. Revenge your self upon a rash and inconsiderate person whom Love has made to forget his duty, and that too unruly an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has seduc'd into that offence. It is I do assure you, high time to do it; for if you leave me longer in the miserable suspence wherein I now am, you will find that my death will deprive you of the satisfaction of having your self pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht my insolence. He there made a little stop to see if I would return him any answer; but seeing no signs that I was about to do it, Ah <hi>Madam</hi> (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he) since you are not pleas'd to speak to me, I see very well, that I have attempted too far, and that I am my self to revenge you of—No, no <hi>Don Pedro</hi> (said I interrupting him) I should not be silent if you had any way displeas'd me, which I had no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner spoken, but that he threw himself at my feet with tears of joy, transported to such a vibsile degree, as I do assure
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61444:80"/>
you gave me very great content. My Princess, My Queen, (said he) you have in three or four words made me the happiest person upon Earth. I would by no means suffer him to continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this posture, and it was well I did not, for my Brother came in upon the instant to tell us; that dinner was upon the Table. I therefore gave my hand to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who all that day after was so well satisfied with himself, that one might see joy sparkle in his eyes; but the <hi>Marquiss</hi> was of a quite contrary humor, and all the time he sate at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner behav'd himself like one that was really sick. He eat very little, and was so infinitely abated with his passion, that one might see in his face a notable alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. My Brother did not well know what to think of it, for he observ'd in him a greater melancholy than could naturally accompany an ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, and therefore tryed in my eyes to learn if I did not know the true cause of his disease. I, for my part, was more civil to him, than I us'd to be at other times, and I should have yet been more, and have given him more testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of favor and friendship had I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61444:81"/>
not fear'd there by to have discompos'd <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> so tender we are of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding those we love.</p>
               <p>My Brother then made a motion to them to go visit a Lady of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hard by, whom he had promis'd to see before he return'd to <hi>Valence,</hi> which <hi>Don Pedro</hi> readily consented to, but the <hi>Marquiss</hi> would by no means hearken to it, excusing himself by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his indisposition, and also that he must that very day of necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the City, though the truth of it was, he had no mind longer to continue in the company of a man that he hated to death. My Brother notwithstanding (who would not put off his visit) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and therefore gave order for all the Horses to be sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for the <hi>Marquiss</hi> would also take horse to go away at the same time, and with <hi>Don Pedro</hi> went out of the room to make himself ready as he pretended, but whilst my Brother staid a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to enquire of me if I knew nothing of the cause of this <hi>Cavaliers</hi> ill humor, one came running into the room to tell him, that he had mounted with <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> upon two of the first horses came to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61444:81"/>
hand in the stable, and that they were both gallopt together full speed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the wood. I then instantly told my Brother, that they were certainly gone to fight, conjuring him to make all the haste he could after, to go and part them. My Brother could hardly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to believe it, not being able to imagine that for the little quarrel they had had overnight, they would offer to proceed so far, especially in a place which they ought to respect in regard to him. However he immediately went, and in all diligence, but came a little too late for the <hi>Marquiss,</hi> whom <hi>Don Pedro</hi> after having run him through the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had already disarm'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Brother at his arrival upon the place highly complain'd of their proceeding, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with some heat, that they had his friendship in very little conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to offer to fight a Duel in a place where he had so great an interest, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon a quarrel that in all mens judgments must needs pass for a trifle; for he never dream'd of any other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them, but the little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute they had had overnight about the Glove. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> (to excuse himself)
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61444:82"/>
protested he knew nothing of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel they had fought about, and that the <hi>Marquiss</hi> had in a manner compell'd him to it, without having given any reason why; but the <hi>Marquiss</hi> declar'd himself much more to my Brother, and so soon as they were together alone, that he could speak in private with him, acquainted him with the reasons that had induc'd him to this extream; rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him word for word, all that I had said to him of the advantageous sentiments I had for his Rival. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was for all this by no means satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him; but he was yet much more surpriz'd at my behaviour, and the liberty where with I had declar'd my self in a choice, which ought not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to depend upon my own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, especially when in favor of a man to whom he saw no likelihood that I should ever be united. He saw a great deal of untoward work throughout the whole adventure: but he thought it necessary in the first place above all things to reconcile the two <hi>Cavaliers;</hi> for he much better than I foresaw the consequence of such an affair, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would by all means take up the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61444:82"/>
quarrel, that the noise of it, which could not any way be to my advantage, might pass no further. I confess, I for my own part did not consider it with the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I ought to have done, and the fear I had been in of the event of the Combat, was wholly converted into an excess of joy, when I saw <hi>Don Pedro</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn victorious and unhurt. Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd me of all the resentment that I ought to have had against him, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon so light an occasion expos'd both his own life &amp; mine, and it was not till having a little better consider'd of the business, that I began to find out how much my own had been concern'd in his danger, and then I conceiv'd, that I ought for honor's sake at least, force my self to express a little anger against <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> Nay, I was in hopes by that means to engage him to love me better, and that a little severity upon this occasion would make him more considerate ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time in affairs where I was so much concern'd. My Brother was so ill satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, that of all that day he would never once come near me, and moreover wholly turn'd my Aunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, by repeating to her what the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61444:83"/>
                  <hi>Marquiss</hi> had told him. It was no hard matter for me to perceive all this, by the cold carriage and angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance she put on, and consequently I doubted not but that the <hi>Marquiss</hi> had said my errand; but it was no longer time for me to disemble my inclination and Love had too strongly fortified my mind to disavow a thing I was reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to persist in to the last hour of my life. I fear'd nothing, and methought was strong enough, if my beloved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror was true to me, bravely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter all the Tempests that I saw were gathering together against me. With the thoughts of him I so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified my self as to be able to conquer all difficulties, and the severity of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not of so terrible conscquence but my passion I thought would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overcome it. But all this while <hi>Don Pedro</hi> saw me not, for my Brother after having reconcil'd the two Rivals, had conjur'd them both to desist from any further pursuit, if they were not resolv'd totally to break with him; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal, that he had already reason sufficient to be diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tisfied with their proceeding, and that to prosecute it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61444:83"/>
further, would be in either of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to declare themselves an enemy to him. To this the two <hi>Cavaliers</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no answer, perhaps as well to avoid the making him a promise, that neither of them had any intention to keep, as also because they durst not deny him a thing, which they conceiv'd was not handsomly to be denyed to the Brother of their Mistriss, and a man who was their own intimate friend. My Brother nevertheless took this silence of theirs for consent, and thereupon rested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self assur'd of their future discretion in that particular. In the mean time I had order not to stir out of my apartment till they were gone, so that although they yet staid three dayes longer in the house by reason of the <hi>Marquiss</hi>'s wound; I remained all the while a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to my Chamber, without being seen by any of them. But the Pen is a great relief in these occasions, tis that we make to speak when the use of the Tongue is denied us, and we sometimes express our selves more willingly, and with much more freedom by writing, than perhaps we could do by word of mouth. The first Letter that I writ to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was this.</p>

                        <hi>PRovided you will be on my side. I fear nothing; and all I fear, (and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I tremble to think of,) is, that your friends will perhaps persecute you in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to turn me out of your heart.

                        <hi>sole thought kills me, and if you do not comfort me with some hope as to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I dare not undertake to you, to keep a heart alive that is only yours. Judg then, I beseech you, by the passion I have for you to what torments I am going to be abandoned in this cruel absence, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were not much more easy for me to dye. Oh, my beautiful Princess, what joys and what to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rments shall I feel at once, in the assurance of your esteem, and in the privation of the light of your fair eyes. Therefore for Heavens sake, if you have any care of my life, advise me what to do to undergo so great a mishap, and let not so passionate a Lover end his dayes by so cruel a death.</hi>

               <p>Every Sillable that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> writ to me, fill'd my heart with Love, and there was nothing to be said that could content me, that I did not pick out of his Letters, and interpret to my own liking and his advantage.

                  <hi>Don Pedro</hi> then with the <hi>Marquiss,</hi> departed for <hi>Valence,</hi> whither my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also bore them Company, and where all the Town was presently full
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61444:88"/>
of this affair; for these two <hi>Cavaliers</hi> were too considerable there, for this Duel to be kept a seeret; and the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss</hi> who was not fully satisfied with <hi>Don Pedro</hi> (as Lovers never are with their Rivals, unless they make them give way) had no great mind to have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd. My Father was furiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censt at me, and whatever my Brother could say in my behalf to appease him, would needs send for me home the same day, and accordingly dispatch'd away servants to that purpose. But my Aunt who was better acquainted with her Brothers prompt and passionate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, than any other, not willing to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to go home so soon, and just in the heat, nor alone; would kindly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me; and therefore acquainting my Father with her determination, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded three or four dayes time, to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the affairs of her Family during her absence.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain sollicited, both by my Fathers friends and his own, not to think any more of me, unless he intended to pull mighty and dangerous inconveniences upon himself: but to what use serves
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61444:88"/>
interdictions and perswasions, with a Spirit wholly possest with love, that fears no other death, nor other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but what his passion alone can make him suffer. The Munday I had mentioned in my letter to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> was now come, and he heard no news of my return, he therefore mounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone on horseback, as if he went abroad to take the Ayr, and after having fetcht a great compass, that no one might know the way he design'd to take, slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at last into the true Road, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd by hard riding to recover the time these little, but necessary delays, had made him to loose. This precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his however serv'd him to very little use, or rather none at all; it was too light to pass in so new an affair; he had spies every where set upon him to watch his motions, who so soon as ever they saw him on horseback immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went, and gave notice to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>It is not to be questioned whether or no he did not presently guess whither he went, for he did not so much as doubt it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wherefore taking along with him three or four of his servants well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61444:89"/>
and well arm'd, he follow'd him so close, and made so good haste, that he arriv'd at my Aunts about the time that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and I met at the appointed Rendezvous. He there immediately fell to enquiring where I was, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told that I was walkt out towards the wood, he was netled to the quick, therefore came upon the spur to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place where we were, and coming found us set both together under the shade of certain great Trees that were proper for that purpose. I blusht to see him, and was so confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that I had not a word to say, we had seen him come at a pretty distance but had no means to avoid him, nor to hide our selves without danger of being discover'd; which would have made it so much the worse, neither would I have done it if I could, that I might not give him to suspect there was any thing of criminal in a meeting, where there was nothing but honorable and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Love. My Brother was as full of fury to find us thus together, as we of confusion, and his passion was such as hindred him from saying any thing to us in his first heat; but he exprest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61444:89"/>
much better in the fire that darted from his eyes. He immediately alighted, and looking upon me with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance full of fury and disdain, he took <hi>Don Pedro</hi> aside, and there discharg'd his passion upon him, telling him that were it not for fear the world should think that he took the unhandsome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him of having three or four men in his Company, he would upon the instant have taught him better to have kept his word; but that he would do it at his return to <hi>Valence,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bad him prepare himself. <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> made answer that he had made him no promise at all, that his suit was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and fair, and that therefore if he should be too much provok'd, it should appear, that he was ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer any man that should interpose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him, and his pretence. An answer at which my Brother was so netled, that they had certainly faln foul, had I not stept in betwixt them, and entreated <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to retire, who immediately obeyed me leaving me with my Brother who more incenst than ever, discharg'd himself in most extravagant, and bitter language upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:61444:90"/>And now all the whole house was bandied against me after this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and my Aunt had much ado to vouchsafe me so much as a look, who thereupon made ready to go away in the morning, and my Brother would be gone the same night, though it was very late to acquaint my Father with the business. The night was very light and clear, and he did not think he had any occasion to fear, having no other quarrel upon his hands, but that with <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who likewise he believed to be too brave a Gentleman to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque him by night. In the mean time he was no sooner got into the middle of a wood, through which his way lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt my Aunts house and the City, but that he saw himself suddenly beset and assaulted by four <hi>Cavaliers.</hi> He had by misfortune taken only one Servant back with him, having left the rest behind to attend upon us; however he did not loose his courage for this advantage, but betaking himself to his sword and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol he upon this occasion perform'd actions, much more worthy of the days light than the nights obscurity. He made no question but that this <hi>Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:61444:90"/>
was laid for him by <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s treachery, which made him calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name, to dignifie him with the Titles of Traitor, Coward and Villain, to see if that provocation would make him discover himself amongst the Crew. On the other side his enemies, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure expected a generous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, being much better arm'd than he, prest him on all sides, and so briskly, that he saw his man, who for his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and valour deserv'd a better fate, fall dead at his feet. This blow instead of astonishing enflam'd him the more, so that furious as a young Lion he flew upon the first in his way, and run his sword quite through his body, of which wound he fell down dead to the earth; yet was the fight unequal enough to make him with good reason despair of the victory, he had still three men, strong and well arm'd to fight withal, a disadvantage that would at least have startled another man, and the blood which ran from five or six wounds he had already received, could not but make him sensible, that his forces could not long hold out; and he indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them every moment to grow
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61444:91"/>
less and less, when a <hi>Cavalier</hi> arriv'd in the most opportune season that could possible be to take his part. Ah coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Traitors (said he in rushing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Villains) is it after this base manner that a single man is to be assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such odds? cease Rascalls, cease further to attacque him, or it shall cost you your lives. This seasonable relief so unexpected by my Brother put new vigor into him, and restor'd the strength he had before with his blood almost wholly lost, so that he put himself into a posture bravely to second his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nder. He was at that time too little himself to know this strangers voice; but he very well observ'd by what he saw him do, that he was no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary person. They had soon dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched two of the Traitors, and the third who saw it now so dangerous a game, would se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k that safety by flight, that he absolutely despair'd of by keeping his ground: but our new come <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> ceas'd not to pursue him into the thickest part of the wood, and had certainly overtaken him, had his horse that was wounded been able to have made good so long a course, but his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61444:91"/>
horse failing, he was forc'd to return back to my Brother, and came to him just as he was swooning away with the faintness occasioned by the bleeding of his wounds.</p>
               <p>Never was man in so great a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity as was this <hi>Cavalier</hi> to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a solitary place in the night, far from any manner of help, and alone with a friend that he most dearly lov'd dying in his arms: so that he knew not well what to do, but yet had a care of the main concern, that is, that with his scarf he bound up that of my Brothers wounds, which as it bled most threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the most danger; after which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving set him upon one of the strongest Horses he could choose amongst all those that were left upon the place, he himself mounted up behind him, and after that manner brought him into the City.</p>
               <p>It is not to be imagin'd what a strang astonishment my Brother was in, after he had a little recover'd his Spirits, and that the remedies the Chirurgions had applied unto him had brought him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to himself, to find that he was in <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s House, and that he whom
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61444:92"/>
he had suspected for the Author of the Treachery, was the man to whom he stood oblig'd for his life. An action with which he was so ravisht, and that so absolutely won his heart, that he could not forbear protesting to him upon the instant, he was too sensibly touch'd with his generosity, any more to have any design to oppose his desires: that therefore he was only to try to conquer his Fathers aversion, and that as for him he would favor his pretences, like a true and intimate friend. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> you may be sure was not wanting in his answer to so obliging a protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but replied after so affectionate a manner as engag'd my Brother more than ever to honor and love him. In the mean time they made it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to find out the Author of this Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinate, and in truth it was no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to do by the three men that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had kill'd, two of which were the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s own servants and the very horse upon which <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> had carried my Brother, was known to be his best Courser. It was known a few dayes after, that it was not my Brother the <hi>Marquiss</hi> had aim'd at in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61444:92"/>
this Treachery, that the Assassinates had been mistaken, and that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush had been laid for no other but <hi>Don Pedro</hi> only; but for all that; the mistake did not hinder my Father, from pressing on the affair with the greatest heat and vehemency, and so far it was prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the <hi>Marquiss</hi> was necessitated to leave the City and Kingdom, to go seek his safety in another.</p>
               <p>It now seem'd that <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Love ought in reason the better to succeed, by the ill posture his Rivals affairs were in, and that my Brothers friendship af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so recent an obligation, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly make him happy in his desires; but my Fathers obstinacy was invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and frustrated all our hopes. My Brother had like to have faln into his disgrace for having one day spoken to him in favor of my Love, whereat he was so offended as to forbid him upon the instant, for having any friendship or correspondency with him upon pain of his mortal displeasure, which you must know chiefly proceeded from an old grudg, and a certain animosity he had ever nourisht again <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s whole Family, ever since a preference
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61444:93"/>
his father had obtein'd at Court in a Government which mine also at the same time pretended to. After this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction my Brother was oblig'd to live after a less friendly manner with him, so as never to frequent, or be seen in his company unless he accidently met him. The obstacles to our happiness daily increast, and were so many, that I knew not which way to overcome them, having no more the same liberty in the Town that I had before in the Country; and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> who was yet more sensible of the inconvenience than I, took it so grievously to heart, that it very often put him into despair. He could not hope that my Fathers humor should ever come about to be favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, being an obstinacy not to be parallell'd, or that was ever heard of; so that even his own most intimate friends, he knew, could no better have prevaild upon him. He was therefore to try his fortune, and to resign up that into her hands which it was vain to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust with any other, and that he knew not how to work by any contrivance of his own. Yet knew he not which way to go about his business, and the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61444:93"/>
prison to which I was reduc'd was so close, and so well guarded, that it was hardly possible to convey so much as a Letter to me, without falling into my Fathers hands. My own kinred and relations were not permitted to see me but by his especial leave, and with some other of his own appointment, and even this favor was granted to none, but those of my nearer Kindred. In all these difficulties what should this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate young man do? He took a resolution to go visit a Kinswoman of mine, with whom he was intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and who sometimes came to see me, to try if by laying open to her the most secret sentiments of his heart and the violence of his passion, he could gain her over to his party. He thought that if he could once move her with a little compassion, she would not deny him her assistance, and that at least he should find some consolation in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with her of me. All that he could obtein from her at this first visit was, that she would be ready to serve him; but that then he must take heed he did not put her upon any thing that was inconsistent with the honor of a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61444:94"/>
Maid, a point wherein she was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tender, and that especially he must excuse her from carrying any Letters, Tickets, or any other thing whatever in writing: that she would speak to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss in his behalf; but that she was very sorry to see him engage himself in an affair, wherein so many and so invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difficulties, besides those at present, wereto be foreseen. Whereupon she fell to saying a great many fine things, and that were very rational upon that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to divert him from further enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himself in so dangerous affection; but it was all in vain, and all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers she represented to him, did not in the least stagger his resolution from prosecuting his design. He already lov'd too much to be capable of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel against it; and it was impossible for him to wrastle with a passion, by which he was already overcome.</p>
               <p>This dear Cousin of mine came the same day to see me, and needed not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preambles to make me fall upon the discourse of <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> for as I had a very great confidence in her, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready committed the greatest part of my bosome to her trust. She found me
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61444:94"/>
in an excessive melancholy, which a little to divert, and to put me into a better humor, she acquainted me at the very first with the visit she had receiv'd. I embrac'd her five or six times for joy, and being she had a very great kindness for me, soon won her over to my side. Thus did she every day comfort me, and consolate <hi>Don Pedro</hi> in carrying some message or another betwixt us; but nevertheless this satisfaction was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and poor if it proceeded no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I never discover'd to her the one half of what I had a mind to tell her and I had yet discretion enough to conceal part of the flame by which I was devour'd. At last, that she one day saw sorrow painted in my eyes, and death in my countenance, she deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of me what I ail'd? whereupon lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my heart a little more open to her than I had formerly done, I by degrees wrought upon her to carry me a Letter to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> which she having enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do, I took Pen, Inck and Paper, and write after this manner.</p>

               <p>This beautiful young Cousin of mine was engaged too far in our confidence to recede, and her severe humor with the aversion she had for Love intrigues, grew pliant by degrees by conversing with so much flame; and although <hi>Don Pedro</hi> with all his wit had not had the

power to perswade her into that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, my sufferings nevertheless had awak'd her pity; and indeed the condition to which I was reduc'd would have touch'd a soul of marble with compassion. She restor'd my dear Lover from death to life in delivering my letter to him, there was nothing of grateful and obliging he did not say to thank her, and he had in his transport of joy thrown himself at her feet to embrace and kiss them (had she not hindred him from doing it) for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.

               <p>I cannot but confess to you <hi>Albirond</hi> that my passion proceeded a little too farin making me resolve to do a thing so contrary to my Fathers command, and my own duty; but alass! the Law of Love is the strongest Tye, and takes place of all other obligations; it is born, and grows up with us, it neither learns, nor is to be taught: Nature alone reads to us her Lectures, and imprints them in us with her own hand. Where this Law commands, the powers of the earth can signify nothing, since even Heaven it self obeyes it. Methought every thing was lawful for me to do, in a captivity so strange, and so unjust; at least my disordered Reason made me to believe so, for to tell you the truth, one is not alwaies willing to produce the best ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and such as they ought to do against a design with which we are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and if we reproach our selves with it as a crime to be in Love; the weakest
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61444:97"/>
Arguments we can pick out for such a purpose, we are willing to think is all that can be said.</p>
               <p>In the mean time what way soever I could contrive for the execution of our design, I found them all not only very difficult; but almost impossible to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and very well foresaw that if my dear Cousin did not assist me in this extreamity; my hope would utterly forsake me, and I must infallibly be a victime to my Fathers cruelty, and my own life. I then after having laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to her the excess of my passion, with a torrent of tears, and in the best terms I could express, propos'd the business to her; but I was not so happy as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that I did perswade her to it. She would by no means be drawn to have a hand in an affair, that she foresaw must needs be a blemish to her honor, and trouble her repose; so that all she would be induc'd to do, was through the compassion she had for my sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to mix with me some of her tears, and try to comfort me.

                        <hi>THere is of late a certain rumor spread abroad concerning you and the</hi> Marquiss <hi>that pierces my heart, and which, if it be true, will bring me to my Grave.

Alass! since it is my fate, that I must only love to perish by my flame, why may I not at least have the honor to dye at your feet (my dearest Princess) and there render up a Soul that is wholly yours. Ah what a joy would it yet be to me, that dying you might receive my last sighs, and to hear you say, Dye</hi> Don Pedro, <hi>dye my dear, and since I cannot be thine—for Heavens sake do you make out the rest, for in the abundance of tears that sally from my heart, I am able to write no more.</hi>

               <p>So soon as I had read this letter I threw my self upon my bed, there to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve into tears, in which posture I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all that day; and I had so much the more reason to be so afflicted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that that very Evening my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the <hi>Marquiss</hi> were to be brought together to be made friends. The <hi>Vice-roy</hi> was the person their friends on both sides had applied themselves unto to do this business, who being my Fathers intimate friend, was willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61444:99"/>
to undertake it, and in order thereunto, had invited both parties to supper, then and there to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. This it was that depriv'd me of all manner of hope, forasmuch as upon this reconciliation I certainly knew a marriage would suddainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; but I was resolv'd to beg of my Father in the last necessity, either to put me to death, or to give me leave to go end my dayes in a Convent.</p>
               <p>With this determinate resolution my heart took a little truce, for there is no more to do in the last extreams but positively to resolve upon something, to gives ones heart a little ease. In this sad tranquility I was, wherein people usually are when they despair of all manner of relief; when about ten or eleven of the Clock at night, I saw <hi>Don Pedro</hi> enter my chamber, who at his coming in cried out, <hi>Madam,</hi> to see you I am come to brave my death, too happy if I may receive it after this good fortune; for in the affliction I have liv'd ever since I was blest with your sight; nothing can be more welcome, and I shall die content if the blow come, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have been so happy as to kiss your
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61444:99"/>
feet. Now you must know that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> having learnt that there were but two men left in the house (one whereof was plac'd over me in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Keeper, and the other had the charge of the Gate committed to him, whilst my Father and Brother were at the <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> at Supper) had so well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his business, that having by the dexterity of some of his servants (who had corrupted the Porter) made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self master of the Gate, and kill'd the other whom they found asleep, he came up to my Chamber without any other opposition, than that of some women, whom the very fear of death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from crying out to give any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm.</p>
               <p>If ever any person was surpriz'd, it was I, when I saw <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> he seem'd me thought an apparition, I scarce knew how to believe my own eyes, and so many different motions at once opprest me betwixt the joy of seeing him, and the fear least some mischief should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him, that I knew not what to say. To what shall I attribute this silence (<hi>Madam</hi> said he) is it that you condemn me to dye, and that my passion is not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61444:100"/>
powerful enough to move your pity? Pronounce my sentence; if my life seem any thing considerable to you, save it in escaping your self out of the hands of my Rival. If you love me let me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you out of this captivity; or if you will that I die by a cruel denyal, I am ready to satisfie and obey you. No, no, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> (answered I all confus'd,) I am not insensible of what your heart suffers for me, but do not you forget, that it is with a man of honor I entrust my self, and that it would be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test unworthiness in you to abuse the credulity of a heart that loves you, and gives it self wholly up to you. It would be the greatest of all infamous treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (cried <hi>Don Pedro</hi>) could I live for any other but you, and could I be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the least infidelity to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who has oblig'd me at the rate you have done. I therefore swear to you by your self, by your own fair eyes by which I am so charm'd, and which I so much adore, that my faith is and shall over be yours and only yours; after which words I gave him my hand, and he presently conducted me down stairs out of the House, and out of the Gate
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61444:100"/>
of the City, where we found a Coach ready to carry us to the Port which is no more than half a league only from the Town, and where there lay a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Frigat that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had hir'd for the purpose, and that only staid our coming to hoist sayl, and to put out to Sea. I shall not here tell how transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with joy <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was when he saw himself at a pretty distance from the shoar, and that the interposition of the Sea secured him from the pursuit of his enemies, neither could he himself sufficiently express it by words, though he said to me all the fine things that a tender and violent Love could dictate to a man who had a great deal of wit, and a great deal of passion. He assur'd me a thousand times over and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that his flame should be eternal; but the tears that fell from his eyes, and with which he bath'd one of my hands, which he held close to his mouth, gave me a much better assurance.</p>
               <p>I am now in a humor good enough to tell you what delight our Souls were rapt withal in these first moments of our liberty, and how overjoy'd I was at a happiness I so little expected; but I fear
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61444:101"/>
the <hi>Sultaness</hi> will presently return, and therefore must finish the rest of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy story without insisting upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that now only serve to encrease my misery, by the remembrance of those past and vanisht delights. You here see how Love feeds upon tears, and is never satisfied; and you shall also see how he overwhelms with misery at the same moments, that he seems to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate with joy. The weather had been the most favourable in the world for four or five dayes, and we were out of fear because out of the reach of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers anger, and we had not above for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Leagues to sayl to the Isle of <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> to which place we design'd to go, by reason that the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> thereof was <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Uncle: but when fortune has once design'd a man for unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, every thing is a verse to him, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing turns against him, and the Sea upon which all the Elements are to be fear'd, is the Theater where this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Goddess plays the most and the best of her Game. One is never there assur'd of any thing, at the same time we desire, we hope, and are afraid. The Earth, the Ayr, the Winds, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61444:101"/>
of fire, even in the midst of the waves, are all of them mortal enemies; but men are more to be avoided than all these. We were now in hope in one dayes sayl to discover the Isle of <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> when one of the Sea men came to acquaint <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that they had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd from the Coasts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> from which we were not very far, a Galley that made towards us, and that therefore we must resolve by force of Oares to recover the Isle of <hi>Corsica,</hi> if we would avoid being taken, for there was no doubt to be made, but that they were Pirates.</p>
               <p>This news put me into a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fear than it did my Lover, who was not a man accustomed to tremble at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Alarm, and who thought himself raised to too great a degree of fortune having me in his possession, to suspect so great and so suddain a fall. He came then upon the deck to see what course this Galley steer'd, and saw that in truth she came upon us with sayls and oars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and that therefore there was no more time to loose. He then made them turn head towards the Island of <hi>Corsica,</hi> to which place we had the wind to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61444:102"/>
Southward, the most favourable that could be to our design: but the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley had the same advantage, and it stood rather more right for them than us, so that in case it should stiffen never so little upon them, we could hope for no other but to have them in three or four hours aboard us.</p>
               <p>After then that he had given all the orders necessary to fly, or to fight in case it could not otherwise be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he came to find me in the Masters Cabin where I was, and where in truth the one half of my courage had forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me. He disembled the best he could the fear that began to seize upon him, not of being taken, or of loosing his life, but of loosing me; yet could he not so well disguise his apprehension but that I quickly discover'd it in the little disorder I saw him in, and the trouble I perceiv'd in his countenance did but too well enform me of what he had in his heart. I would therefore be the first to comfort him, should our fatal design reduce us to the extremity of all misfortunes, and creating cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage out of my love to make some shew of resolution, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> (said I)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61444:102"/>
it is no longer time to conceal any thing from me, I see very well that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will not yet cease to prosecute us, and that the danger wherein we are of being taken by this Galley allows us but a little time to manage. Let us therefore make the best use of it; 'tis enough this is no Galley of <hi>Spain;</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> will have more compassion of us, than my Father would have, and I shall be much better pleased to fall into their hands, than I should have been to have seen my self in the arms of the <hi>Marquiss:</hi> How hard soever my servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may be amongst these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> Love has already prepar'd me with too long a habit of misfortune to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it. The miseries of slavery will be supported with pleasure, so long as I can preserve to you the faith that I have promised to you, and that I again swear to you by all that is Holy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—at which the tears gusht into two Torrents out of my eyes, and made an end of telling him that, which they stop'd my mouth from expressing. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> upon whose heart these words of mine had wrought the effect that you may imagine they must needs do upon

a heart tender and passionate to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that his was, remain'd immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a Rock, and beheld me weeping in the posture of a man that was about to expire, and who had lost all the sence and faculties of life. Poor <hi>Don Pedro!</hi> what a sad condition was he in! he had not the power to answer me one word, so that he only held my hand close to his breast, endeavouring by that action to make me understand that his grief took away his tongue, and that it was so great he was not able to express it. These motions are too violent to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long, and he must of necessity give them more liberty in the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and let them sally out of his mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Unfortunate man that I am (he began to say) who alone am cause of all the disgraces that befal the person whom I adore above the world, and that I must be born for no other end, but for her undoing and ruine! O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, what strange offence have I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against you, that you should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute me above other men with so great injustice! Have I incurr'd your displeasure to that degree? who is it that would not have done the same
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61444:103"/>
thing that I have taken upon me to do? and what violent course have I taken, that Love did not command, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel me unto? My dearest Princess (continued he looking upon me with an eye that pierc'd into my very Soul,) your constancy does equally astonish, and afflict me; but I am overcome by your love, to see that I have precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you into so dangerous a fortune as this that overwhelms my courage, and that if we are taken (as it is very much to be fear'd we shall, without a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular relief from Heaven) I deliver you up to the most cruel race of people in the whole world; whilst in the mean time you fear nothing, and the passion you have for me is such, that amidst a thousand reasons you have justly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me, you continue to overcharge me with bounties, that are incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly above all others, fit to charm a heart that is wholly devoted to your vertue and are pleas'd in the midst of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams to give me new assurances of your fidelity and affliction. An (<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>) with how exemplary a vertue is your brave soul endued! and why have I not a thousand lives to lay them all
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61444:104"/>
down at this instant in the service to which the excess of this generous affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours does oblige me. On the contrary <hi>Don Pedro</hi> (said I interrupting him) if I have any title or power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein any signal testimony of your love, it is to preserve that life of yours upon which mine does so absolutely depend; for Heavens sake therefore do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate your self into the hazard of so unequal a fight, or at least remember that you cannot dy, but I must also pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with you. Good God! <hi>Albirond,</hi> how should I stir up your compassion, should I repeat to you all that we sayd to one another upon this occasion, which yet only serv'd to make us more sensible of the sad extreamity to which we were reduc'd, and to make us more tender of one another, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation we mutually renew'd of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and inviolate faith.</p>
               <p>The wind in the mean time freshned upon our sayls, and by that means had assisted the Pirates also with so brisk a Gale, that the Galley had fetch'd us up an hour sooner than we expected; notwithstanding by the force of more sayl that we had clapt on, we were got
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61444:104"/>
within fifteen Leagues of the Isle of <hi>Corsica,</hi> when the Galley was come up only within Canon-shot. She gave us at her coming up but one of her Chace pieces only, which at this first firing did us no harm at all; but that as she drew within nearer distance grew to greater danger, and having two that were full Canon plaid at last so full into our mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle deck, as at one volley cut of six of our men. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had given strict order not to fire on our part till the Galley should come up very near, that we might give them a whole broad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> side at once. The match was too unequal, for they had aboard the Galley ten men to one that we had in the Frigot; for alass! we little expected, and had less prepar'd for so dangerous an encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: nevertheless our men took heart by the brave example of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> by whom they were animated with such resolution as had been sufficient to have inspir'd courage into the greatest Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards in the world. In the end the Galley boarded us, and was received with the same bravery with which she attacqu'd us. These Sea fights (as you your self know) are the most furious,

He made head in all places where his presence was most requir'd, and thrust himself into the mouth of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with so great agility and courage, that one would have said there had been ten <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s instead of one; and indeed a Mistriss to fight for (and she too upon the place) is a wonderful incitement, and so great a spur to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, as will make a man perform things even beyond the power of a man.

Three or four times they attempted to board us, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten were bravely repulsed, so that mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the odds against us, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> with his handful of men held the victory in suspence. The courage and oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so little a number of so good men as those of ours, made me despise the weakness of my sex, and I was never less in fear of death than in this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so that I follow'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi> which way soever he went, who having three or four times entreated me to retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cabin, seeing it was in vain, and that I was resolv'd to share with him in the glory of the action, it is not to be believ'd, what wonders my presence made him do.

And though he had been certain to dye all manner of deaths, he would a second time tempt the same fortune, to try to repair so infamous a stupidity by feats worthy a man of his force and mettle; and he was confident enough of his own abilities, not to fear twice together to give false fire. Oh Heavens! what power has glory over a young heart already replete with love! but especially when a fair Mistriss is in the concern. It is true that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61444:115"/>
he had been engag'd in several other encounters of this nature, but such an accident had never befaln him before, and he might safely say without vanity that in all his other amorous conflicts he had behav'd himself as well, and come as bravely off as any <hi>Cavalier</hi> in the world. All the rest of that day he made very much of himself, and avoided all violent exercise to keep his forces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; but it is true withal, that he did eat but very little, and that he did not sleep much better; for though he made no great doubt but to behave himself better the next time, yet could he not banish from his mind the grief of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done as he did, or rather of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been able to do nothing at all.</p>
               <p>In the morning (which prov'd as fair an one as could be wish'd for the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the flesh,) he arm'd himself at all points, not for the camp of <hi>Mars,</hi> but for that of <hi>Venus,</hi> and came into the Garden, much better drest and perfum'd than he was wont to be; but in truth something with the latest for him, by reason that a great many slaves which <hi>Azem</hi> had brought thither were working at <hi>Sidi Mahomet's</hi> Bath, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61444:115"/>
had begun by the Aqueduct, to which the pipe of Lead belong'd where they us'd to lay their Letters. It is not to be imagin'd with what astonishment and grief our unfortunate Lover saw these people there at this time, it being as though he had seen so many persons prepar'd to put him to death with a thousand several cruel torments. What fury, what Tempests arose at once in his mind! to see the evil condition to which his affairs were reduc'd by this accident, and the little likelyhood there was, that he could of a good many dayes acquit himself of his debt; which to do, the impatience he was in was the thing that the most of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted his mind. In the mean time he was constrain'd to turn aside into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther walk to avoid being seen in that of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> where the Slaves were at work, and there the working of his fancy carried him so far before he was aware of what he was doing, or which way he was going (his thoughts being wholly taken up with the deliberation of what he was to resolve upon) that he was got to the end of the Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he almost knew where he was: but
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61444:116"/>
there coming a little to himself he took notice of a Slave, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat being withdrawn apart from the rest, was reading a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the contents whereof (as it should seem) he skrew'd himself into so many extravagant postures, as sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted him to be at the end of his wits, and either enrag'd or afflicted, or both, even to despair. The odd and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gestures of this Slave possest <hi>Albirond</hi> with a certain curiosity to know who this fellow was, and what the matter might be; which he might the better do by reason that by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of some trees in the walk, he might steal pretty near him without danger of being seen. He advanc'd therefore, and stopp'd not till he approach'd so near that he could very well hear every word he sayd, which also he utter'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loud after this manner in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue. Ah ingrate! ingrateful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (said he) I but too well know thy hand, that thy false heart has here made use of to the violation of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity thou hast so often, and with so many vows engag'd to me: why was I not born blind; or rather why was I born at all? To what cruel Destiny
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61444:116"/>
has Heaven reserv'd me in delivering me from the fury of the waves, to no other end but only to bring me hither with my own eyes to behold but too too clear and killing testimonies of the blackest infidelity that ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vpon the face of the earth! Let us doubt no more, my Soul, my eyes are too faithful witnesses, I see and read it: This faithless woman has given up her self to another, not by any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Law of equity, seeing she had no power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of her self anew, after having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up her faith to me, but by a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Law, of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But why do I stay any longer in the world? or why do I delay to go out of it since she for whom I only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ravishes away my life to give it to a Rival? Let us dye then, let us dye with the torments that I suffer, since I am already dead to those delights I propos'd to my self in the enjoyment
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61444:117"/>
of the sweetest fair that ever betray'd a true affection. 'Tis to have ceast to live, when we can propose to our selves no joy in living; let us then cease to suffer, and part with a life that carries with it more misery and torment than a thousand deaths. But ought I to dye without being first reveng'd? and have I not means enough left me wherewith to punish this too happy Rival, and too unfaithful Mistriss? Let us then first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge our selves. Let us first kill those that murder me, and let us reserve our selves, my Soul, till first I have made an end of them who have depriv'd me of my heart. The Slave so soon as he had spoke these words, was about to turn back again to go to his fellows; when <hi>Albirond</hi> who was not above three steps from him, stopt him short, and in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strangely surprized him. He deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him what he ayl'd to look so sad and dejected, or why he thus separated himself from the rest, and whether he wanted any thing wherein it might be in his power to relieve him? The Slave instead of returning a civil answer to so obliging a Compliment as <hi>Albirond</hi> had made him, only paid him back with a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61444:117"/>
look full of scorn and indignation, as if his quarrel had been to him, and without any kind of reply, strove to get his arms at liberty, by which the other held him. This rude carriage of the Slave did a little astonish the <hi>Cavalier,</hi> who could not imagine why he should behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to him after this manner; but he saw he was of necessity to detein him by force, to be better satisfied in the business, believing with good reason, that there was something more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in the case; but for what reason the Slave should proceed after this manner, quite contrary to the behaviour of all the rest, he could not so much as guess, especially towards him, who obliged them all by all the wayes he could, and who was respected by every one, upon the account of the friendship the <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerbeg</hi> manifested to him upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. He would therefore make use of a little cunning to try to engage the Slave to tell him all, by repeating to him what he had already gathered out of his own mouth. He then after a gentle and courteous manner, askt him two or three questions, concerning his name the place of his birth, and how he came
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61444:118"/>
to be made a Slave; to which the fellow grumbling answer'd, that his name was <hi>Alphonso,</hi> that he was of <hi>Valence</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that a <hi>Tagarin</hi> had sold him to the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> his Master. But <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> who was not content with this, and that had a mind to learn something more particularly from him, askt him again what made him so sad? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was not that Letter he had seen him read, that had put him into that ill humor? telling him that he ought not to deny him that little satisfaction; that he should not repent him of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him his <hi>Privado,</hi> and that if he knew him well, as he believed he must needs do, he might believe, that it was in his power to do him a good office to his Master. <hi>Alphonso</hi> so soon as ever he heard him mention the Letter became more troubled than before, and like a mad-man wrested himself out of <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond's</hi> hands with these words that he said to him going away. Yes, I have a Letter, but it shall be delivered to no other but the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> himself, who I hope will revenge me in righting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the injury that is practised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in his own house. These words
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61444:118"/>
were too plain not to put <hi>Albirond</hi> to a damnable non-plus, he saw well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that they were levelled at him, and that it was no more to be doubted but that this Letter came from the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness.</hi> One is apt to fear every thing vvhen every thing is in reason to be fear'd; nevertheless upon examining the affair from the one end to the other, he could not conceive what interest this Slave could have in it; nor of what he would that the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge him. He sometimes thought that he had pierc'd into the marrow of the Mistery, when he vvas the vvhole Heaven vvide, and the furthest off of all; for by the handsome mean of the Slave, and his bold manner of speaking, he imagin'd him to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Sultanes's</hi> Gallants, whom she had favour'd before him; and these words of ingrate and faithless that he had heard him exclaim vvith, did but too much confirm him in this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here it vvas that Jealousy (a passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that had never before possest him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the <hi>Sultaness,</hi>) seiz'd him after such sort, as might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have hurried him to some precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61444:119"/>
violence upon the Slave, had he not been already at a good distance from him: but he being got out of his reach, he turn'd into another vvalk to meditate upon some remedy in so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate an affair. One vexation drives out another; he had already forgot that vvhich had so much perplext him but a little before, in that he could not execute his design, and now his vvhole fancy vvas at vvork to contrive some way to get the Slaves Letter from him, either by fair means or soul; that so he might disengage himself from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, by which he was on all sides strangely tormented. He walked on ruminating after this manner; when an arrow, like that before, whishing by his ear, stopp'd his progress. He ran presently to take it up, not doubting but it brought some Ticket along with it as the other had done, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he found one tied to the shaft, which contein'd these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ALbirond, think of disengaging us from the danger we are now falling into, and wherein you your self, to our great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, are equally concern'd. Thus it is,</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:61444:119"/>
                  <hi>The</hi> Sultaness <hi>last night commanded me to write a letter to you, which I did after so indiscreet a manner, as will cost us all our lives if you do not use your utmost endeavor to recover it. I layd it, by her order, before wee went to bed, in the pipe of Lead, where I us'd to lay the others, that you might read it so soon as you came into the Garden; and this Morning, this Company of Slaves you See, are come er'e we were awake to work at the Bath, and have unluckily begun by this pipe, which they have remov'd out of its place. The letter must therefore necessarily either be still within it, or some of them must have taken it out. For Heavens sake try your wits then to find it out, and if you have any hopes of delivering us from the fear and trouble wee are in, make us a sign with your handkerchief, for the Sultaness is in a mortal apprehension.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So soon as <hi>Albirond</hi> had read this Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he no more doubted but that the letter they spake of was the same he had seen in the slave <hi>Alphonso's</hi> hands; but yet he could not imagine what reason he could have to be so highly concern'd a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it, nor what to think of his saying the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> should revenge him. He still
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61444:120"/>
fell into his former opinion, that this was some fovourite of the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> and that upon a less account than an interest of Jealousie, a slave could not pick any thing out of a letter that was not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. All these reasons, and all these different thoughts ended at last in a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to retrive this letter by what way soever, at least to prevent it from being carried to the <hi>Beglerbeg's</hi> hands. To this end he went presently to the pallace, and there enquired of the first of the Guards he met with, if he knew the slave <hi>Alphonso?</hi> and that he must in the name of Governor <hi>Azem</hi> go fetch him thither. The Turk made answer, that he did not well know which of the Slaves this was, that he had only heard the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> had bought such a one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen dayes since, but that he would immediately go bring him to him. As soon as <hi>Alphonso</hi> came, <hi>Albirond</hi> bid him follow him; which the slave made no difficulty to obey, knowing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that it was in <hi>Albironds</hi> power to cause him to be cudgell'd to death if he commanded it only, without asking any reason why. When the <hi>Cavalier</hi> had got him á pritty way out into the fields,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61444:120"/>
attended only by two <hi>Moors</hi> that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually waited upon him, he there askt him first of all, if he had belong'd to the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> any considerable time? To which <hi>Alphonso</hi> making answer, that in truth it was but a few dayes since he had been sold to his Master, it serv'd not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to undeceive <hi>Albirond</hi> from his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer error, and at the same time possest him with a greater curiosity than ever, to interrogate him, What reasons he could have to concern himself so much with that Letter? seeing that it was not possible that in so short a time this slave could have made any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar acquaintance with the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> but he himself must infallibly have had some knowledg of it. He prest him then in very good earnest, to tell him, why he should make such a business of that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; telling him in plain terms, that he would see it, to know what pretence he could have to revenge himself of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate. Yes (sayd <hi>Alphonso</hi>) who could not very well avoyd answering him, and declaring the whole business) of an ingrate, that will betray you also, as she has already done me. I know not (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyd <hi>Albirond</hi>) of whom you intend to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61444:121"/>
speak, you must therefore better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain your self, and tell me who it is you complain of, for without doubt you are mistaken. This Letter (replyed the slave) has alone sufficiently enform'd me of more than I ever expected to know, but I will never deliver it to you so long as I have life; and tis enough for you to know, that it comes from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, to beleive that a man may suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently revenge himself, who has as much, or a greater interest there than you. But what pretence (sayd <hi>Albirond</hi>) can you have in the Seraglio who are a stranger, and but newly arriv'd in this Country? who do you know there, this letter does not come from the party you imagin. Alass (sayd <hi>Alphonso</hi>) I know the hand but too well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would to Heaven that my eyes did not assure me that it comes from a faithless Maid, who writes it to you: from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For, to be short <hi>Albirond,</hi> since I
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61444:121"/>
see my affairs reduc'd to this desperate condition, I care not much if you know all, that you may have as much aversion, as perhaps you have love for a creature, the most treacherous and false that ever set her foot upon the face of the earth. This <hi>Isabella</hi> (Sir) by whom you are now enchanted, is the same who betraid me for you, after having promis'd and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to me her faith with a thousand Oaths, above a thousand times, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having given me such assurances, as she cannot without dying of shame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Albirond</hi> had thus far harkned to the Slave with a marvailous attention; but he had now said enough to unravel all this adventure, and to discover the truth of an affair concerning which he had been so much perplext. After what <hi>Isabella</hi> had told him in the story of her Lover, he had all the reason in the world to believe that this was he, and that he had not been cast away as she thought; which, was also so much the more likely, because she had said she saw him upon a planck. All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considered, <hi>Albirond</hi> without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Slave to proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cut him short, by demanding of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61444:122"/>
him, if his name was not <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and not <hi>Alphonso?</hi> Yes (said the Slave) I am that unfortunate <hi>Don Pedro</hi> of whom that traytress (he subject of my tears) has doubtless given you some account, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> who—Here <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> would needs interrupt him from proceeding any further, assuring him that it was nothing but the fear of being seen by these <hi>Moors</hi> that withheld him, from embracing and paying him all the respect that was due to a man of his quality and merit; after which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to perswade him, that he was his friend, and not his Rival: but he found that a thing something hard to do, and was in the end constrain'd to shew him <hi>Isabella's</hi> second Letter, and even to declare unto him part of what had past betwixt the <hi>Sultaness</hi> and him, thereby to dispossess him of his former conceit; and then it was that <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> began to pant with a little joy, after so many torments, and so many miseries, that Love and Jealousy had afflicted him withal. He observ'd something in <hi>Albirond</hi> so generous and so gentile and so little of the Traitors mode, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his own protestations, helpt
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61444:122"/>
wholly to clear his understanding from his former suspicion, and to make him hope for better things, and a better fortune than he before expected. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> also, on his side, was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle satisfied with himself for having brought so ticklish and so difficult an affair to so good an issue, and which he had before judg'd almost impossible to succeed to his advantage; at least with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his being necessitated to push things on to the last extream. They enter'd from this time forward into the most perfect friendship that could possibly be; <hi>Don Pedro</hi> wholly relyed upon <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> for his fortune, he gave him the Letter which he himself had found in the pipe of Lead, and had taken out thence without any one having percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him; and in the end both of them, without taking any further notice of one another, return'd to the Garden, where <hi>Alphonso</hi> fell to work amongst the rest, and <hi>Albirond</hi> took another walk, where he might be seen from the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to give the sign with his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, that all was well. He there continued something longer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

during which time he resolv'd in his mind with some delight the several dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent passions he had been tormented with in that one morning. It is true that the Nature of Love is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than what people imagine. 'Tis like a fire, that shines at distance, and pleases our sight, but when one comes to touch it,</p>
               <q>Oh how it Burns, the Monster teeming (earth Never produc'd such a prodigious birth.</q>
               <p>'Tis a thing wonderful hard to deal withal, the world knows it not; there is nothing so vexatious, nothing so woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; nor any thing that kills with so much impunity all that submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to his power. Little Traitor that he is! You would say that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so charming when he lies sunning himself in the warm rayes of a wanton beauty; that there is nothing so sweet when he tempts you with a kiss, or with something of greater kindness; but if he once takes a fancy against you, vvith vvhat torments and miseries does he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm you, a thousand times more cruel than the pains of Hell; and then
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61444:123"/>
it is that he is properly to be call'd Love without love. He makes a shew as if he would be familiar with you, that he invites you with two fair eyes which have nothing in them but fair promises; but if one try them, if one approach them, and if a man repose any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them, you shall see with what poyson they shall regale you. <hi>Albirond</hi> did not exactly make the same reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the <hi>Sultaness;</hi> for she in truth had not dealt over rigorously with him, and Love had more reason to complain of him, than he had to complain of Love in this affair; which also he was so conscious of, that he thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more but an occasion wherein to pay his arrears; upon which as he was deeply meditating, another arrow came just in the nick to direct him. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently imagin'd that it brought another Ticket, as he found so soon as he had taken it up that it did, and which unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the shaft, he there read these words.</p>
               <p>

He immediately accepted the challenge, for which he suffer'd so great a disquiet, that he would have been content to have died upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had first perform'd the duty of an able man; only that which most troubled him in the business was <hi>Don Pedro</hi> (whom we shall hereafter call <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi>) with whom he had a great mind to have a longer conference, and to send for him that very night; but an affair of Love commonly carries it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, and <hi>Albirond</hi> had been to be excus'd, though he had quitted one of greater importance, for an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion wherein he was not only to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his Love, but was moreover con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to vindicate his reputation.</p>
               <p>Just as he was upon this deliberation, <hi>Alphonso</hi> very seasonably past by with the other slaves, who were going to the Pallace to dinner; whom <hi>Albirond</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caus'd to be called to him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken him aside acquainted him with the desire he had to have talkt
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61444:125"/>
with him that evening had it not been for some business, that he could not possibly dispence withal, but he assur'd him that the next day he would send for him, when he would give him some account of his Mistriss, and where they would together resolve upon some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in order to his, and her liberty. He would at that time hold him no longer in talk, that he might give no suspicion to the Guards who were apt to make a great deal of cluttur about nothing, and to turn every whisper, and almost every look into suspicion. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi> then thus parted from him; and <hi>Albirond</hi> took the way towards the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where all the afternoon he had made himself ready for the Triumph that was preparing for him at Night. He went to make the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> a short visit, who was furiously importunate with him to stay supper, though he made shift to excuse himself, and to get away, by telling him in how ill an humor he was to drink. For the Ordinary of that Lord was a continual debauch, and no one was to sit down to his Table unless he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd before ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to drink to a very great height. This visit being over, his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61444:125"/>
next care was to take the order that was necessary at his lodging, that they might not wonder he lay from home, as it had some times hapned before upon other occasions; all which being done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suffering any one to go along with him, he went to the <hi>Rendesvous,</hi> where by reason of the slaves being at work in the Garden, every one almost went in and out at pleasure, without the Guards taking particular notice of any; an accident that very much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourd <hi>Albirond</hi>'s design, who would not that they should have observ'd him to go twice thither in one day.</p>
               <p>He came there pretty betimes, the better to make choice of his place, and was soon perceiv'd by <hi>Isabella,</hi> who stood Centinel on the Top of the Tower. Immediately upon his comming he pickt out a remote corner to keep himself as much as he could from being seen; which it was no hard matter for him to do, for the Garden was spatious enough, wherein twenty might have conceald themselves without fear of being discover'd. It is to be supposed that in two or three howers time, that the shades of night delayd totally to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>The night being at last come, and the Guards of the pallace having gone the Round of the Garden? our passionate, and impatient Lover began a little to taste the sweet ayre of liberty. He went out of his shady prison, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took the shortest cut to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and would not go so much as a step out of his way, for fear of loosing a moment of occasion, so soon as <hi>Isabella</hi> should be come to the window; and being come under the wall he there stayd expecting her comming with a wonderful pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>

long, when one is in expectation of any thing, but especially in matters of love. The night was exceeding dark, that is to say, the most beautiful to <hi>Albironds</hi> eye that ever he had seen, and it seem'd in nothing to dislike him but only that <hi>Isabella</hi> a little to long delay'd her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and so long it seem'd to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient <hi>Cavalier,</hi> as at last rays'd a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conflict in his Soul betwixt hope and fear; but a little noise, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently heard above at the window, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately took up the quarrel. He thereupon gave a little <hi>Hem,</hi> to signify that he was there; when presently the Ladder was let down, which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so much pains in making the time before. He lost no time, but mounted nimbly, and almost at one breath, up to the window, where <hi>Isabella</hi> stood wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for him, who nevertheless was a little surpriz'd to see him so soon at the Top. She receiv'd him after a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging manner, in return whereof <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> told her in her ear, that he had news of great importance to acquaint her with, but that it would require some time in the telling, and a place where no one could over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hear them. For the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61444:127"/>
place (replied <hi>Isabella</hi>) I think there can be none more convenient than the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi>'s chamber, and we shall certainly have some spare moments in all this whole night to confer together; for I have something also to tell you of a dream I have had this night; but let us go, for the <hi>Sultaness</hi> stayes expecting I should bring her an account of you, and she will be overjoy'd when she sees that you bring it your self. You will find her in bed, but not of sickness, unless Love be a disease. Prepare your self therefore for brave assaults, for you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beheld any thing so lovely as what you are now going to see in all your life. Upon this they came to the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> her Chamber door, into which <hi>Isabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> enter'd first alone, to receive her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris'<hi>s</hi> orders, if she should introduce <hi>Albirond,</hi> who stood waiting her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure at the door; at which news the Fair one, as full of impatience, as of joy, start up, and was her self going to meet him,
<q>Benche ne gonna, ne faldiglia haccesse:</q>
had not <hi>Albirond</hi> (who was as impatient of delayes as she) stept in before he had
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61444:127"/>
leave given him so to do. But how were the eys of this happy Lover then struck with the most beautiful object he had ever beheld! He has himself assur'd me that he was for some time so dazled, as if he had not seen at all. This fair En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantress had adorn'd the bed wherein she lay with all the richest furniture she had; but there was nothing so fair as her self, though she was at this time stript of all other ornaments, but what were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally her own; she had only a stript Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Mantle, the ground whereof was Gold, with which she cover'd but the one half of her bosom, and almost all the rest of her body was to be seen through a smock, the transparent fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness whereof was very proper for the design she had to hide nothing of those parts wherein she conceiv'd lay the chiefest of her beauties. <hi>Albirond</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd her, where putting one knee to ground, he took one of her fair hands which he kist above a thousand times: but the <hi>Sultaness</hi> (who worse than death fear'd a relapse of impotency, could not endure that this extasy of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who utter'd not one word, should so long continue) would break this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous

Well <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> (said she smiling) have you reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered your vigor since yesterday, and may we now expect to know what a man of ability you are. You should not <hi>Madam</hi> (replied her <hi>Amoroso</hi> with a languishing ayr) reproach me with a disgrace, of which you your self were alone the cause, for if it was not an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of your Charms, I know not by whose enchantment I should be reduc'd to a condition I never found my self in before: but (added he with a pretty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident smile) I have to day taken an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote, and if I am not mistaken in my own constitution, I find something in my self more of a man than I had yesterday; at which last words he had the courage to take off her mantle, which also she had only put on for ceremony, and that she parted withal without any manner of opposition; and there in this Pallace of Love, he gathered the Roses and the Lillies he had forgot the day before.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:61444:128"/>Hor sino'a gli occhi ben nuota nel golfo Delle delitie, é delle Cose bella.</q>
               <p>How sweet those sorts of pleasures are, is not here by me well to be exprest and <hi>Albirond</hi> himself, though he had at this time more than one tongue in his mouth, would for all that have much ado to do it; they are delights so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing, as are above all imagination, and such as a man can only advise those to taste, who have a mind to know tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they are. 'Tis a pleasing kind of occupation, wherein a man cannot well say he is alive, forasmuch as he is certainly all the while dying of joy and content: But this is most certain that never Conqueror since the first practise of arms, came more puft with glory for the greatest victory he ever obtein'd, than <hi>Albirond</hi> came off from this amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous encouter; where nevertheless there was not much blood to be spilt: and so well satisfied he vvas with his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, that transported with joy of his gallant behaviour, he could not forbear asking the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> how she lik'd the state of his body, and if she
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61444:129"/>
was satisfied with his abilities. Go you ill conditioned thing (replied this fair one with the dying eyes) you only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed me the time before, to make me relish this the better now, and if you come again, I do verily believe I shall dye of delight. I will by no means (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Albirond</hi>) be the occasion of your death; but I know very well, that if these kind of amorous enchantments kill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they also at the same time revive. At which word he took the charming Lady again in his arms to give her a proof of what he had said, and accordingly they both of them dyed a death, that very few people would refuse. This was done, and repeated more than once, I cannot say how oft, neither ought I to do it, that I may leave to every one the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of diverting himself in his own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination according to his own humor and constitution, with all that there past betwixt them during some happy hours.</p>
               <p>In the end the <hi>Sultaness</hi> by being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well rock'd, was faln into a gentle slumber, and <hi>Albirond</hi> who for some time had no mind to disturb her repose, and who also himself stood in need of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61444:129"/>
some little cessation, took this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to go to <hi>Isabella</hi> to tell her what he had promis'd. The fair Slave could not forbear laughing so soon as she saw him come, not knowing which way to frame her self to ask him, what she had a very great mind to know: but <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> presently put her out of her pain by speaking first. Well <hi>Isabella</hi> (said he) shall I alwaies be reproach'd with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency? I know not (replied the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Slave who had not yet given over laughing) how well you may have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd your self to night; but I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there was once reason sufficient to reproach you with it. After this they both sate down close by one another, where <hi>Albirond</hi> told her all he knew concerning <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> which <hi>Isabella</hi> found so surprizing and thought so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding strange, that she had need of all the confidence she had in <hi>Albirond</hi>'s worth and integrity to believe it. Her joy notwithstanding was infinitely great, and she was so much pleased with the news, that she made him three or four times over and over again give her a description of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s person, to see if he was not deceiv'd, and still
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61444:130"/>
found that he gave a perfect descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his face, his voice, his stature, his fashion and his manner of speaking, and to be short, the whole account was <hi>Don Pedro</hi> himself throughout, so that she was certain it must be he, and now pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for nothing but the happy hour, wherein she should be so blest as to see him. Let mine eyes but once more see thee (cried she above twenty and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times together) but one moment, and then let me dye, I shall be satisfied with my fate. <hi>Albirond</hi> then repeated to her at large all that had past concerning the Letter that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had found in the conduit, with the Jealousy it had put him into, and the things it had made him say, at which poor <hi>Isahella</hi> tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wept. But after all, they were to think of the means to make them both happy, wherein <hi>Albirond</hi> saw no other way but only to try the power he had with the <hi>Sultaness</hi> to obtein her liberty without making any mention of <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> but that <hi>Isabella</hi> thought almost impossible, considering the intimacy and friendship establisht betwixt her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss and her, who she thought would never be perswaded to part with her,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61444:130"/>
especially so long as <hi>Albirond</hi> should continue in the Country, and that he himself would have much ado to disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himself from her if he did not do it by stealth, and without taking any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal leave. <hi>Albirond</hi> told her that he would further consider of it; but did in the mean time assure her, that he would evermore labor with all his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and endeavor to contribute to their happiness with all the power he had: that he would talk with <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> about it, and that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude together once for all, upon what resolution they were to take.</p>
               <p>After he had given her these assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his good inclination and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to serve her in what shouldlye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his power, he return'd towards the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> for fear least if she sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

a pretence, that she found no fault with being disturb'd. On the contrary she a little grumbled at him, that he would suffer her to sleep so long, telling him that that had not in it over-much of the Gallant. <hi>Albirond</hi> excus'd himself, by telling her, he thought she might have wanted rest; your self rather you mean (replied the <hi>Sultaness</hi> very roundly, and with a pretty smile) who could not have pusht your courage much further without the relief of this little drowsiness of mine, which seiz'd me so opportunely for you. I do not see at this time (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Albirond</hi>) that you have any great reason to complain of me, for—No (interrupting and taking him in her arms) I cannot complain said she, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear to be oversatisfied, and least you should one day make me pay for the pleasure of this night with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand tears; but you ought to consider, that if you love me well, you ought to love me so long as you live, and never to separate your self from me. <hi>Albirond</hi> was about to reply, when <hi>Isabella</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The <hi>Sultaness</hi> was not so well satisfied with this excuse; but that she chid her a little, telling her, that if she was so timerous, she would do a great deal better to stay in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with her, rather than to put her into such frights as were enough to kill her. The Slave excus'd her self the best she could, and so retir'd softly back again to her own Chamber.</p>
               <p>Now the truth of the story was, that she had seen a man enter into her Chamber, which on the suddain (as well it might, where she expected no such thing) had so suspriz'd her, as had put her to the squeek, but that so soon as the first fright was over, she knew to be <hi>Don</hi>

                  <hi>Pedro.</hi> This Lover whom Jealousy had tormented without his being able to overcome it, seeing nothing in <hi>Albironds</hi> discourse that could presently satisfy him he was not in love with his Mistriss, apprehended a furious Jealousy at what he had sayd to him in the Garden, that he would bring him newes, and that he had an affair he could not dispene withal, which hinder'd him that day from talking with him. Upon this he askt leave of his Master that he might have the liberty to go to <hi>Albironds</hi> lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, telling him that he had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to come to him; and accordingly having leave so to do, he went, and was as soon as he came there, told, that he could not see him that Night, by which his suspicion being infinitely more aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, he doubted not but he was by appointment to pass away that very night in the arms of his faithless Mistris; and thereupon put on a resolution to dye, or to know the truth once for all. Thus resolv'd, he departed that very moment, and fortunately recover'd the Gate of the City from whence he made towards the Garden, to which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he durst not approch till it was
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61444:132"/>
dark night. The hour being at last come, he walkt up and down a long time on this side, and on that, to see where he might best get over the wall; and at last found a kind of Breach, which nevertheless was very hard to climb, but with a little trouble being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry active, he at last overcame the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and enter'd the Garden at the same time that <hi>Albirond</hi> had just moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the window. He a thousand times searcht every Corner, Arbor and Bush of the Garden, as if he had been sure to find <hi>Albirond</hi> in some of those places with his ungrateful Mistriss, and in this diligent search of his he often past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where he listned ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentively to try if he could hear nothing there. Behold here how Love made sport with a poor Lover, and how many ridiculous parts he made him play. At last he was aware of a Rope that hung down, and was fastned as he thought above to the wall: for the night was so dark, that it was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he took notice of it by meer chance only, and it must also be very near at hand, or otherwise he could not have seen it at all. This was the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61444:133"/>
of Ropes, which the Slave had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perhaps forgot to pull up to her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Albirond</hi> was enter'd in at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; or that possibly she had left there on purpose, that in case of suddain need it might be ready for him, to go down by, and to make his escape. However it was, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> presently guest to what end it hung there, and as soon made use of it to get up by, which though he did not perform so nimbly as <hi>Albirond,</hi> yet he did it well enough to get into the window, from whence with a trembling pace he crept directly to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabella</hi>'s Chamber, for there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stairs nor other way to go, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that. He found her laid upon her Bed half a sleep, and who wak'd not at the noise he made in entering into the Room, because in truth he made none at all, excepting that of some sighs that escap'd from him, when he was come so near as almost to kiss her, and that rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her from her slumber made <hi>Isabella</hi> give that suddain skreek, who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coming to her self, said softly to him, is it you <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> or do I yet dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

return'd her no answer, but embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her much more amorously than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when <hi>Isabella</hi> (who was afraid that the noise she had made might have frighted the <hi>Sultaness,</hi>) prayd him to forbear a little, fearing all would be spoil'd should she come to know what <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had done, and should see him with her, and so ran speedily to her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss to set her heart at rest from the fear she might have put her into; which having done as you have heard, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back to her Lover, whom she wholly satisfied, and swept his fancy clean from all the naughty impressions he had entertein'd of her Love and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, which she had preserv'd invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to him, even after she concluded him to be dead. They then talkt, and consulted together a long time about the means they were to take to put themselves into liberty; but they saw no kind of possibility in it, unless <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> could be won seriously and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to assist them.</p>
               <p>After two or three howrs entertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with her Lover, <hi>Isabella</hi> thought it necessary that he should first depart and wait for <hi>Albirond</hi> below in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,

who also seeing the night far spent, told the <hi>Sultaness</hi> it was by no means either convenient or safe for him to stay till day, and therefore now took his leave of her with a promise to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and pass with her the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the same manner. Upon these conditions she gave him leave to go; but not untill she had first given him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand kisses, and presented him with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral knacks of great value. <hi>Isabella</hi> went with him to the window, where she told him in his ear, that he would find <hi>Don Pedro</hi> below in the Garden? but that he must not wonder at it, for she would hereafter acquaint him with the occasion of his being there, and in the mean time begg'd he would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, if not for his own sake, yet for hers, who was so much a servant of his. <hi>Albirond</hi> could not but very much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this news, and did so little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the meaning of it, that he would not have gone down, till first <hi>Isabella</hi> had given him greater light into the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, if she had not again assur'd him that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> would tell him more, and that it would be too long a story for her to tell him then. <hi>Albirond</hi> upon
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61444:134"/>
this went down, and was no sooner come to ground, but he was accosted by <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who with a Congee down to the ground askt his pardon for the effects of a cruel jealosy, which he told him he would rather pitty than be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended withal if he had himself ever been passionately in love. <hi>Albirond</hi> caught him in his arms, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving return'd him some Complements in exchange of friendship, heard him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the whole story of this adventure, in so passionate terms, as himself was sensibly toucht with the sence of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. All the danger that he found in it was, what they would think at the <hi>Fondou</hi> (which is the prison for the slaves at Tunis) when they should miss <hi>Alphonso</hi> at the shutting of them in, and the danger wherein he had engag'd himself in going out of the City at the hour that he adventur'd to do it, and without leave. Notwithstanding fortune (that sometimes favours Lovers) had so well dispos'd all things in his favour, that the master of the slaves, having been at <hi>Albirond</hi>'s lodging to enquire for <hi>Alphonso,</hi> was there told, that in truth he had been there to ask for <hi>Albirond,</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:61444:135"/>
and was doubtless gone a long with him; an answer where with the <hi>Turk</hi> rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so well satisfied, that he made no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry after him, nor penetrated no further into that affair. In the mean time <hi>Albirond</hi> who saw it was no good staying for him in the Garden with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso,</hi> (or <hi>Don pedro</hi> whether you please) and that it was fit for them to shift thence before the day should break, demanded of him which way he should get in; whereupon <hi>Don pedro</hi> leading him to the place, they both of them got over to the other side of the wall, and took into the wood, where they past away the short remainder of the Night. So soon as it was broad day they return'd to the Garden, where <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond</hi> calling to him one of the Soldiers of the Guard, he bad him conduct <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi> to the work, and in his name to excuse him to his Master, he having for that night employ'd him in some affairs of his. This being done, he took up his way directly to the City, where being come he went to take a little rest upon his Bed, which without question he stood in very great need of, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise he had been at, had been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61444:135"/>
violent, and moreover he was to make himself ready the night following to return to the assault.</p>
               <p>In all the long consultation he had had with <hi>Don pedro</hi> they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve after what manner they were to proceed, to Deliver <hi>Isabella</hi> out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; for <hi>Don pedro</hi> was of opinion that they must steal her away, and carry her out of the window, without so much as at all acquainting the <hi>Sultaness</hi> with the design; but <hi>Albirond</hi> could not consent to play so unhandsome a part to the prejudice of a person that he lov'd and by whom he was passionately belov'd again, saying moreover, that it would bee a most vile ingratitude in him, could he have the heart to run away from her without taking his leave, after so many favours receiv'd, and that it was much better to proceed by fair and handsome wayes, which if they should not take effect, it would still be time enough to proceed to extreamities, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all other more moderate wayes had faild. After this manner did <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> argue the business; but <hi>Don pedro</hi> could by no means relish this course, and could hope for no good issue from
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61444:136"/>
this way of proceeding, fearing to loose all by endeavoring to save all, as he had often seen it fall out in such affairs. After what manner soever <hi>Isabella</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, provided she was at liberty, it was all one to him; nevertheless it vext him, that he should be come from <hi>Corsica</hi> (to which shoar he had escapt by swimming) on purpose to this place; that he had caus'd himself to be sold to the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> by a Tagarin (which is a sort of Religion amongst the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>) and that after all this, when he was upon the point to execute so brave an enterprise, he must hazard the spoiling all for little niceties of honor which he conceiv'd they were not oblig'd so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously to observe with people of so naughty a Religion. <hi>Don pedro</hi> argued like an interested Lover, and <hi>Albirond</hi> like a well principled man, and a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier of honor, who would at once both serve his friend, and observe the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum of honorable proceeding.</p>
               <p>Hee did nothing all that day but sleep, and in that one took enough for two, or three to come. The hour was now come, that he was to go to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he would else be to late. He went
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61444:136"/>
thither then, and so soon as ever the night was shut-in, <hi>Isabella</hi> made a little noise at the window, and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by a Countersign that <hi>Albirond</hi> was there ready, she let the Ladder down to him, which she afterwards pull'd in again, for fear least some other might do as <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had done the night before. So soon as ever <hi>Albirond</hi> was enter'd in, he would without any more ceremony have run with his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary impatience to the <hi>Sultaness</hi> Chamber; but the Slave advis'd him to have a little patience, and to go lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely to work, for that the <hi>Sultaness</hi> she said was asleep. During this little delay they had leisure to confer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the outer room, where <hi>Albirond</hi> gave her an account of all that had been debated, betwixt <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and him concerning her deliverance from captivity; but that he was by no means of opinion she should depart without the <hi>Sultaness</hi> her leave and consent; or at least without having first tasted her inclination as to that particular, and as for his part he must needs confess, he could not find in his heart to separate himself from her after so treacherous a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61444:137"/>
manner, as not to bid her farewel. You are then far enough (replied <hi>Isabella</hi>) from departing this Country. Not so far neither (replied <hi>Albirond</hi>) for when the <hi>French</hi> vessel (which by the favor of the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> I have caus'd the Pirates to restore, as not fair prize, since the treaty of peace) shall be made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to put to Sea, I will embark my self in her; and I think they are in so good forwardness, that in two dayes they will only stay for me. You are not so near going away as you think, I do assure you (replied the Slave) or at least the <hi>Sultanass</hi> suspects no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for that you may know all, as I was but even now talking with her about you, and that she was according to her passion, multiplying the pleasures she had in having so captivated your heart, she said, that for her love you were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of undertaking all things, since you had so often despis'd your own life to come unto her. I then inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively demanded of her, if she thought those pleasures were likely to continue, and whether besides the danger there was of your being surpriz'd at one time or another, she did not fear in the end
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61444:137"/>
to see herself reduc'd to a necessity of parting with you for ever. To which she made answer, that as to the matter of surprizes, she would proceed with so great care and discretion, that she hop'd that would never come to pass; and that as to the rest she could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that so long as she had your heart, which she made no doubt but to keep, you could ever have the power to leave her. That as to this particular, she had set down a resolution to pass with you the remainder of her dayes. That the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> could not live always, and when he should dye, that she should have power enough over you to make you change your Religon, and to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her. All these things that <hi>Isabella</hi> told him, put <hi>Albirond</hi> into a little Quandary; but nevertheless he did not much concern himself at it, and it did by no means make him alter his opinion, that he ought not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the extream affection this beautiful person had for him.</p>
               <p>Just as they were upon this point, the <hi>Sultaness</hi> call'd <hi>Isabella,</hi> who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ran in to her to receive her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to let her know that <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:61444:138"/>
was just come, who also enter'd with her, where he found his Mistriss with a rosy complexion which she had got with some hours of repose, and that presented her to the eyes of her Lover much fairer than ever he had seen her before, at least he fancied her to be so, and drawing nearer began to complement her upon that subject, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her, that sleep had given her a new luster. If I owe any thing to sleep (replied the beautiful <hi>Sultaness</hi> taking him by the hand) it is for the pleasant dreams it has made me to dream, in the little time I have been sleeping, for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought that you and I were together in a rich and stately Pallace, where we walkt at liberty without fear of spies, and of which methought you were the Master: Would to Heaven <hi>Albirond</hi> that this Dream might prove true, as for my part I do not think it impossible but it may; but what think you? I have no great faith in Dreams <hi>Madam</hi> (replyed <hi>Albirond</hi> with a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found sigh) but if I were to wish for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing upon earth, that should be it, which to my great misfortune I know to be infinitely above my hopes. Let
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61444:138"/>
me once more tell you <hi>Albirond</hi> (said she) that there is no impossibility in it, and if you love me as you should do, you ought to hope it will come to pass, as well as I. <hi>Albirond</hi> who by what <hi>Isabella</hi> had told him before, saw very well what the <hi>Sultaness</hi> was aiming at in this discourse, was put to a little <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus,</hi> however he would not let her go without an answer. If I love you! <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (said he) it does a little surprize me that you should so much as doubt it, at the same time when you see me run into the jaws of death only for your love: but you must pardon me if I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what reason you can have to call for a testimony of my passion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vain hopes of a Dream, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I see no appearance; nor so much as similitude of truth. I can easily mend that matter (replied the <hi>Sultaness</hi>) for I have treasure enough both for you and me, and since Heaven has so united our hearts, it may also one day uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61444:139"/>
that you love me above your life, you ought to send up your vows to Heaven, that it may place you in that condition, and not to destroy your own fortune by despair; for I shall no longer live content, than I can hope it will be so. I here see my fair <hi>Sultaness</hi> (said <hi>Albirond</hi>) that the passion you have for me is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, since it eclipses your judgement in my favor: for though my fortune should be such as to advance me to that degree of honor you are pleased to speak off, do you not consider (<hi>Madam</hi>) that you and I are of different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that such marriages are not here allow'd after my way? When there shall be no more but the point of Religion in the case (replyed the <hi>Sultaness</hi>) there will not be much difficulty left to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. What! would you make such a scruple to change your Religion for me? This proposition did not so much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize <hi>Albirond,</hi> by reason he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for it before; but nevertheless he found himself very much mov'd at the roundness of the question, which made him say to the <hi>Sultaness</hi> a little more gravely than before. Do you believe <hi>Madam</hi> (said he) that I am a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61444:139"/>
my Religion for any worldly consideration whatever? Have you so mean an opinion of your servant? Ah (<hi>Madam</hi>) assure your self I might well falsifie my Faith even to you, if I could fail in it to the God that I adore—Well (said the <hi>Sultaness</hi> interrupting him coldly) you shall not falsify your Faith, you have done too much for me alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the first fair Wind you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to your own Country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out once considering that you leave me here all alone abandoned to all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and miseries, that a tender heart can suffer in the loss of the person it most dearly loves, and that I shall never more behold so long as I live. Which so soon as she had sayd, she drew out her handkerchief to hide an infinity of tears that trickled from her fair eyes, and which she was not unwilling <hi>Albirond</hi> should take notice of, as knowing very well that there are few things, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

him; for the first motions of pitty being a little over, his Religion immediately after got the upper hand, Mauger the power of Love, of all other considerations, and which was more of his own violent affection. He did the best he could to refrain from such testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of weakness, and to try to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate this charming sad one with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of solid sence. We ought to have assur'd our selves (my dear <hi>Sultaness</hi> said he) from the beginning of our engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we could not continue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all our lives, that our fortunes were such as would one day oblige us to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, if but to avoid so cruel a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as that of Death. I will defer my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture so long as possibly I can, and if four, five or six dayes are not enough, I will make them ten or twelve, wherein to assure you a thousand times, that in what part of the world soever I shall be I shall eternally burn for you with the same ardor, that I at this instant do, and that I will never—Ah cruel!

But my dear <hi>Sultaness</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Albirond</hi>) what would you have me do? No, no (said she) depart so soon as thou wilt; but know that it shall not be without me, and that I will follow thee where-ever thou goest like thy sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and even into Hell if there can be any thing there more cruel than thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness, and the torments that unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness makes me feel. Speak, wilt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse me? <hi>Albirond</hi> was more interdict than ever to see this desparate resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hers, he already repented him, that he had not taken <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s and <hi>Isabella</hi>'s counsil, and he had such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity in his soul, as begot an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble disorder in his passions, which sided with his heart against his Reason. At last the more honest and the more generous consideration carrying it above his own particular interest. You have overcome <hi>Madam</hi> (said he) I can no longer resist, I am yours. How (said she clearing up a

little) thou consentest that I shall go with thee, and that I shall have the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to be no more separated from thee, whereever thou goest? Not so my fair <hi>Sultaness</hi> (replied <hi>Albirond</hi> again) but that I will stay here with you, which I swear to you I will do, but upon this condition nevertheless, that you will no more tempt me in point of Religion; for there is no kind of death that I will not rather choose, than to alter that. Alass (said the <hi>Sultaness</hi> again) I do not ask so much of thee, pursue thy former design; but for pitty sake permit that I bear thee company, deny me not this grace (my dear <hi>Albirond</hi>) for that Deities sake thou dost so much adore; I will take enough with me to make thy fortune, and <hi>Isabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> shall also go along with us.</p>
               <p>The fair Slave who from the time her Mistriss had begun to weep was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into the Chamber, vvas ravisht with joy to hear her talk after this manner, and to see her resolv'd to this course, vvhich finding so much to her own advantage, she joyn'd with her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Albirond</hi> to perswade him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it should be so; for more than one half of the concern vvas her own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinterest;

Thou wilt be then my death, barbarous Frenchman (sayd the <hi>Sultaness</hi> with a resolute ayr) and I must satisfie thee before thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est from the place; at'which she start up on a suddain, and ran to a poyg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

who was meeting in tears could prevent her, and setting the point to her breast, speak, speak (continued she) choose which thou dost better like, or that I follow thee, or Death; for my soul at least thou canst not hinder from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee. The glittering of the steel, and the resolute action where with the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness</hi> spoke these words quite disarm'd <hi>Albirond</hi> of his resolution, who was in such a condition with the surprize, that he was ready to fall down in a swoond at his Mistrisse feet. Ah Madam (sayd he in a languished tone) you know very well how to make use of the power Love has given you over mee, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the little vertue I had left I see I must sacrifice the remainder to you and treading under foot all the dayes of my life, permit you to follow the fortune of a man, who was never so unhappy as now that good fortune seems the most to favour and exalt him. Become secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to me for your self (sayd the <hi>Sultaness</hi> delivering the poygnard to <hi>Isabella</hi>) that you will never forsake me, and I fear not your Fortune, let it be as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as it can; I shall carry that along with me, wherewith to sweeten that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61444:142"/>
where of you so much complain. For my part (sayd <hi>Albirond</hi> to her again, since nothing of all that I have been able to say, has had the power to divert you from your resolution, I here swear to you a fidelity such a one as never was, nor ever shall be equall'd by any, and a love that nothing but Death shall ever have the power to destroy.</p>
               <p>After this they fell to talking of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, and to examining the speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and most secure means, by which they might make an enterprize of this importance to succeed. <hi>Albirond</hi> had already a vessel prepar'd for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which was as good as his own; for it was he that redeem'd all the <hi>Mariners</hi> from the Oare, and who had ecquipt her with all things necessary at his own charge. Nothing then remaind but how to contrive to help the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> down from that high win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; <hi>Albirond</hi>'s Ladder of Ropes was not sufficient for women, who are not always so active as men, but this was soon thought on. <hi>Albirond,</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> were of opinion to make no mention as yet of <hi>Don pedro,</hi> and the <hi>Sultaness</hi> who had eaten nothing of all day, had a

mind to take a little repast after so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a resolution, of which they already by way of advance tasted the delights.

               <p>Or if you will that I explain my self better, after these two Lovers had eaten sweet-meats their fill, and drunk to one another more than once, they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to taste something more sweet, in those ravishing pleasures to drown the trouble they had put one another into. Sweet-meats are no ill diet for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, nay I have heard it said, that one has more pleasure in kissing a mouth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has had another sweet added to its own natural sweetness. <hi>Albirond</hi> did his business very well for a man of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere vertue, and the <hi>Sultaness</hi> in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of hers would have dryed up many more tears than she had shed; she often reproach'd him in the middle of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous conflict, that he did not love
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61444:143"/>
her, since he dar'd to think of leaving her, and that he had made so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of taking her along with him, and <hi>Albirond</hi> still excus'd himself with his former reasons, which he said had been but too rational and convincing, had he not been in Love. I, but does it become love (said she) to be so rational, as to seek for reasons to abandon all? Ah you vext me to the heart (continued she) when you went about to perswade me to it.</p>
               <p>The nights are very short in these occasions, and time insensibly steals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which <hi>Albirond</hi> was nevertheless aware of; and for fear the day should surprize him in that place, he took his leave of the <hi>Sultaness</hi> to go take order for all things, and to take his measures so right, that when they should once be upon the execution of their design, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be wanting that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger all the rest. <hi>Isabella</hi> often desir'd him to remember that diligence was the parent of success, that the sooner they put their enterprize in act, it was the more likely to succeed, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays are alwaies fatal in dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:61444:144"/>He slept not of all that day, but was perpetually running up and down from place to place in order to his business. He first went, and talkt with the Pilot of his ship, who promis'd him the next day to be ready to depart, whereupon he accordingly order'd the rest of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as they ought to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He caus'd good store of all sorts of provision necessary for the voyage to be carried aboard; he took leave of all his friends, and particularly of the <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> who made him stay din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In earnest I have often wonder'd at <hi>Albirond</hi>'s confidence, who durst any more eat with a man after he had put on a resolution to betray him: for this <hi>Cavalier</hi> wanted no honesty, but all things are to be pardon'd in Love; who has power to make men do any thing of what kind soever. In the evening he went to the Garden, where he talkt two howrs together with <hi>Don pedro,</hi> who was ravisht with joy at the good newes, and with whom after he had concluded of what they were to do, he sent him again to his work amongst the other Slaves; and crept into the old place where he had conceald himself the times before, till the approaching night should
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61444:144"/>
call him out to his business. Soon after the time came that he was to steal out of his hole, which he accordingly did, and went to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where <hi>Isabella</hi> was already waiting for him at the window, for she now began to be more impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of seeing him than before, and died of longing to hear what news, and how their affairs went on. The sign was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately given on both sides, the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der immediately let down, and <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> quickly at the top, where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the joy of these two fair Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by telling them at the very first dash, that all was ready, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had no more to do but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselves against the following night, when he would come with two horses to fetch them, and to carry them to the Port. It is not to be exprest how infinitely overjoy'd they were at this good tydings, what caresses they gave him, and how extraordinary kind they were to him, especially <hi>Isabella</hi> who was ready to leap out of her skin for joy: and in earnest it is true, that people es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape very willingly out of servitude to go meet a Lover, which although it be but to quit one slavery for another,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61444:145"/>
yet the setters of the last are as easy, and pleasant to every one, as the other are rude and intollerable. There was then that night great joy and junketting in the <hi>Sultaness</hi> Chamber, but one often relishes joy with a very great Gusto, of which they soon after repent, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fall heavier, when they have first appear'd in the livery of good fortune. <hi>Albirond</hi> past away the remainder of the night with his Mistriss, where you may be certain he was not altogether idle, and an hour before day departed to give the last blow to their design.</p>
               <p>How heavy do these kind of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes lye upon the conscience of an honest man, who has never been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to do any thing without first weighing the action in the ballance of justice and honor! All the remaining part of that day his soul was opprest with melancholly, and with so great a number of untoward presages, that death would at that time have been a wel-come remedy, but he was gone too far to retreat. The <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> was this day gone a hunting, and the Slaves had no more work to do in the Garden, and he had <hi>Don Pedro</hi> in his own power, whom
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61444:145"/>
he had sent for to that purpose: in fine all things seem'd to favor his enterprize, and yet his heart could not be at rest; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e had strange boadings in his Soul, and his conscience already reproacht him with his treachery to the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> his friend. But a man must go through with what he has once begun, and necessity must silence all these secret murmurings of honesty and reason. He sent for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Order to give notice to the Pilot to be ready to set sayl that very night, and that he should send out the long Boat to wait at the place he knew of; so that there now remain'd no more to be done, but only to get their two fair Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strisses out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which also had been a matter of no great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had they been as much in see with Fortune, as they were with Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albirond</hi> had four very fine Horses that he had bought, and which he kept without the City, whither he went with <hi>Alphonso</hi> to see and to put them into a condition for present service; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accordingly done, he sent his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before to attend him at the Port, where making shew as if he follow'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

towards the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> where just as the night was shut-in, he arriv'd. He made <hi>Don Pedro</hi> with two empty Horses to stay in a wood there was about two hundred paces distant from the Garden where he himself alighted, and went to climb the wall, to which purpose he had the day before provided a Ladder of wood wherewith to serve the Ladies. <hi>Isabella</hi> was at watch, and had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hour taking the ayr at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where she fancied every leaf that fell to be <hi>Albirond,</hi> at the last he came, where she let down the rope, by which he was to get up, and which also was to assist them in going down. There was no talk of ceremony or caresses, all things had been ready at the <hi>Seraglio</hi> from break of day in the morning, and the <hi>Sultaness</hi> had no mind to carry any great lumber with her, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encumber'd with it by the way.

of <hi>Albirond</hi>'s invention to help them down with greater ease to their tender hands, and it prov'd useful and strong enough, these being Women that were pretty and light. They again moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and descended the wall of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the same facility, and so came all safe to the place where <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was, who immediately threw himself off his horse to embrace his dear Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss, and to hold her the <note n="†" place="margin">By which you may note that the Ladies rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stride.</note> Stir-up to get up. <hi>Albirond</hi> did the same for the <hi>Sultaness</hi> when being all seated, and ready to set forward, they all started together, and gallop'd away after so spritely and joyful a manner, that they seem'd to fly. Neither indeed had they any time to loose, for it was above three long leagues from the Garden to the port of the Gullet to which place they were to go, and were also there to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive some hours before day, both for fear of being discovered by the Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, as also that they might set sayl before the search which the <hi>Turks</hi> are accustomed to make in all <hi>Christian</hi> Vessels that are going out of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. But to what serve so many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions when one has not fortune on

ones side! we are apt to stumble at a straw, and 'tis to much purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all things to hook her in, when by a strange Capricio, she will in a moment overthrow and destroy all that has with a thousand cares and cautions been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes preparing.</p>
               <p>This amorous Troop had not rid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a quarter of an hour, but that for all the noise their own Horses made in galloping with the speed they did, they heard another a greater, and which raised a great deal more dust. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Albirond</hi> gave the word to make a little halt, to hearken from whence it should come, and what the noise should be; but it was not hard for him, or any of the Company to guess, and a little with the latest, that they were Horses, and a great many Horses too, for they were hard at hand, and coming as they perceiv'd by the voices, and the tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of the horses the very same way, and upon the same rode that they were going<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Albirond</hi> made no doubt but it was the <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> and though it had been said that he was not to return from hun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61444:147"/>
other than he should come that way and so well accompanied. They were here to take a speedy resolution, and his opinion was that the safest way would be to stip into the wood to let them pass by; but the further they went that way, the more they heard the Horses coming upon them, for it was on that side that they had hunted, and that in truth the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> was returning home. They then began to think of turning quite back again, which they had done better to have thought on at the first, by reason that the habits of the two fair Ladies, especially that of the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> so sparkled in despite of the nights obscurity, as by their lustre attracted the <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> Cavaliers, who spurr'd after them full speed. <hi>Albirond</hi> seeing no more remedy for their disas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that the match was too une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to be able to resist so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as that of those who pursued them; he told the Company in short, that there was no more hope, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was to shift for themselves, that whoever could escape the present dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, should find a shallop within two hundred paces of the Gullet that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61444:148"/>
to carry them aboard the Ship; where if it should be his hap the first to arrive he would not stir from thence till the last necessity. He said no more but spur'd away with much greater speed than before, all the way encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> to whom he kept as close as possible he could. <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> in a moment were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht out of sight, and in the end they were all so squander'd in the thick of the wood, that they met no more, till they met in another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albirond</hi> who was acquainted with almost all the windings of the wood as having often been a hunting there, soon found the way out, and after was not long before he arriv'd at the water side. He found the long-boat at the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place which there waited for him, but would not step into it, till it should be day to see if he could heare any newes of the rest. He sent out two, or three of the Mariners to see if they could spy any one comming, but in vain, for they brought him back no news at all; but not long after came first <hi>Isabella</hi> full speed, and within a quarter of an hour after <hi>Don Pedro</hi> running on foot:
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61444:148"/>
                  <hi>Isabella</hi> with her face all scratcht, and her Cloaths torn with the wood and <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> all bloody with two great cuts in his head, and a pistol shot quite through his left arme: who seeing no one pursue them fell to enquiring of <hi>Albirond</hi> for the <hi>Sultaness;</hi> and what was become of her. I know not (sayd he weeping) alass to my eternal shame, I know not what is become of that beautiful person, but I very well know my self to be the most wretched of men. Oh Heavens (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he) what offence have I committed against you, that you should at once pour all your vengeance upon me? What fault have I committed that Love did not compell me to? Why did you give me eyes to see, understanding to distinguish, and a heart to love, if for adoring the most adorable creature in the world I must be thus severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht? Or why did not all your indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fall upon my accursed head, who was the cause of all, but that the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, the truest, and the best Mistriss that ever man had must perish for my sake, whilst I survive like a Coward, a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and a Beast, to run a way from the Destiny, that she too Certain has already
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:61444:149"/>
undergone, or must immediately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, for the vilest, and the basest Villane upon Earth. Oh Heavens—and with that he sunck down to the ground in a swoon, without any signs of life. <hi>Don pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> and <hi>Isabella,</hi> who were upon thorns to be gone, were very much troubled at this disaster: but <hi>Albirond</hi> presently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to himself, they fell to comforting him, perswading him to hope for better things, or at least to preserve himself and them by hasting speedily away, since there was no other course now to be taken. They represented to him the danger of staying any longer there, which would infallibly be the ruine of them all, if he did not presently take hold of the oportunity fortune now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him of making his escape. To which <hi>Isabella</hi> added that without all doubt the <hi>Sultaness</hi> was well, it being unlikely that any one should dare to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any violence to her, since even when she had been surrounded with them in the heat of their pursuit, and moreover provokt by some wounds <hi>Don pedro</hi> had dealt among them, they had yet forborn to hurt her out of respect to her Sex: that the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> she believ'd, was certainly
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61444:149"/>
taken, which she was infinitely sorry for; but that it could not be remedied, and she only lamented her for the sorrow she would sustain in being separated from him whom she lov'd above the world; for as to the rest, the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> was so passionately fond of her, that in a little time all would be forgiven, and she would be in the same condition that before. But <hi>Albirond</hi> more afflicted with these consolations, in which besides that he saw no apparence of her safety, he was however confirmd that she was for ever lost to him, and either of those thoughts were sufficient to precipitate him into despair. No, no (sayd he) she is lost, for ever lost, and if alive more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy than if she were dead; and I, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed I, am cause of all. Go make use of the oportunity you have to escape, and may you be happy in your Loves: but for me, who have violated the Laws of hospitality, the gratitude of a man, and the common faith of men, and therein lost my Love, my honor, and the peace of my whole life, I will here remain, and sacrifice a wretched life to her memory, who has already sacrific'd hers to my unhappy love. Go then, and prosper, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61444:150"/>
leave me to my Fate, and all the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship I begg at your hands, is, that you will no more remember there was ever so unfortunate a person as <hi>Albirond,</hi> which is the greatest favour you can do me, and the only dying request I have to make. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle startled at this resolution of his; as he saw it would be absolutely ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous to them all: yet could he not in his own judgment but approve his generosity; and allow him to have all the reason in the world to do as he did, seeing that in such a case a man of honor ought not to out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>live his Mistriss: he could however have wisht his venture had been single, not altogether upon his own account, but out of the tender regard he had to <hi>Isabella,</hi> whose affection would make her as great a looser as any of the rest, and who he thought could never survive it. However his love gave place to honor upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and his noble heart disdaining to abandon a <hi>Cavalier</hi> embark'd with him in the same design, and by whose means alone they had thus far suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their enterprize, at the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:61444:150"/>
last gasp of his fortune, he return'd him this answer. <hi>Albirond,</hi> I am sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for your own sake to see you thus desperately resolv'd; but assure your self I am not a man to forsake you in this last of extreams; but will share with you in life and death; and turning to <hi>Isabella,</hi> My dearest Soul (sayd he) I must now take my leave of you for ever: Honor, and my Destiny will have it so: we have done enough (if it be done) in preserving you, and I have no great reason to complain of Fortune, since we save the best of our venture: My death will doubtless reconcile you to your Father, and the news you will carry him thereof will seal your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I could have been glad to have liv'd with you a long, and I know it would have been a happy life; but since I cannot live with honor, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving basely abandoned my friend in his last necessity I should afterwards be so unfit for you, that it would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you to love me; but now that I dye like a man of honor you may love my memory, which I hope you will, and ever remember—No,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61444:151"/>
no (said <hi>Isabella</hi> interrupting him, and weeping, as good reason she had) <hi>Don Pedro</hi> I will never outlive you, and since you have the heart to leave me, for whom, you made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, at least, you only liv'd, to dye out of Complement only to a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Cavalier,</hi> my resolution shall be as great as your generosity, and I dare dye with you, although you will not live with me. To this point were they come every one of them, considering what they had next to say, when on a suddain they heard a noise of Horses, which thundring amain towards the place where they were, made them conclude that the pursuers were at hand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to prepare for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albirond</hi> besides his sword, had a case of pistols which he had secretly carried under his Cassock for the worst of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and in case of any opposition, which though where ever he should happen to meet it whilst he was on shoar, he knew would be fatal to him: Yet that he might dy like a brave Cavalier, and carry some of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

a long with him, he had discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made that provision. <hi>Don pedro</hi> had a sword only, which <hi>Albirond</hi> had likewise furnisht him withal, and now delivering one of his pistols to him; Let us dye <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> sayd he, let us dye bravely, and sell our lives to these <hi>Barbarians</hi> so dear, that they may be ashamed of the purchase, which having said they were moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a trice, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> upon <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>'s Horse, and <hi>Albirond</hi> upon his own, and stayed expecting the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Enemy, which by this time were come so near, that they discover'd the formost to be the fair <hi>Sultaness</hi> with five or six <hi>Turkish Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> pursuing at her heels; she was quickly with, and as soon past them, but the pursuers being four or five Horse-le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By this the match seem'd to be pretty equal, two more only appearing near at hand and a third spurring at pretty distance; but a fourth also immediately appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61444:152"/>
in the heels of the other, they thought it was time to make hast with these; that they might not have the disadvantage of having them all four upon them at once: they advanc't therefore to meet them, which as they were doing, <hi>Albirond</hi> at a little distance receiv'd one of their Javelins in his thigh, which though it took but about two fingers thickness of the flesh, yet piercing quite through, nail'd him as it were fast to his saddle: the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and only wounded his Horse; so that they still went on to make good the charge, where being joyn'd horse-head to head the fell to the sword, and a while dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it with equal bravery. <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> had forgot his wounds, and <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond</hi> had no leisure to take notice of his, so that fresh and full of vigor they assaulted their adversaries, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the disadvantage of wounds, and loss of blood, with so resolute a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as sufficiently denoted, they would overcome, or dye. In this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture was the combat when the two last came up to the place, who seeing <hi>Don Pedro</hi> all bloody, and the Javaline stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in <hi>Albironds</hi> thigh, and at the same time the two Ladies who were now got together, and standing by at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of some few paces, they either thought their Comrades so secure of the victory, or else had themselves so much a greater liking to the prey, that they past by the Combatants, and went to seize upon the <hi>Sultaness</hi> and <hi>Isabella,</hi> who it is to be presum'd were likely to make very little resistance, and must have been their immediate prey, had not the <hi>Mariners</hi> played the Men, as well as the two <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> who seeing the case alike desperate for them all, betook them to their Oars, and such other weapons as they had at hand, and therewith so belabour'd the two <hi>Turks</hi> that they sooon laid them dead at their feet.</p>

fear'd, should have accounted it a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Game: but remembring that in the condition they then were, to be long in overcoming was in effect to be overcome; and expecting every moment when more of the pursuers should come up, to deprive them at once of their victory, and of their lives, and which was dearer to them than all, of their dearest Mistrisses, they fought with unimaginable ardor to put an end to the dispute, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted but too long for their common safety. And it was not long before <hi>Albirond</hi>'s adversary gave him a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble oportunity to do his business; for the <hi>Turk</hi> thinking at every blow to cleave him in two, made a furious blow at his head, which <hi>Albirond</hi> made so good shift to avoid, that it only fell upon his shoulder, and there gave him but a slight wound, the force of the blow being broken before, whilst in the mean time he run the <hi>Turk</hi> quite through the body, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fell like a Tower stone dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Horses feet. This hapned just at the time when <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Horse sunk down under him of his wound,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61444:153"/>
an accident that would have been as fatal to him, had not <hi>Albirond</hi> came in seasonably to his relief, who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Turk</hi> with his Cimitar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in the Air ready to discharge a mortal blow upon <hi>Don Pedro</hi> (who nevertheless having disengag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from his Horse stood bravely in his defence) strook him such a blow upon the vvrist, that his Sword mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vvith the joynt, hand and Cimitar drop'd down over his Horses ears, at the same instant that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> ran him quite through the belly, of vvhich two vvounds he also fell dead to the Earth.</p>
               <p>They did not stay long (you may suppose) to congratulate one another vvith their victory, nor to insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commendations of one anothers valor, vvhich upon other occasions men very hardly forbear to do; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The day now began to break, and a brisk Gale of wind stiffned upon them from the shoar, which if it should but a few hours continue would soon carry them out of sight of Land, and out of the danger of pursuit, which also they did not much apprehend, there being never a Ship (which was a happy juncture for them) ready in the harbor: but the Ladies were so fearful of being taken, that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers</hi> had enough to do to comfort and assure them, and yet they carried their fears so well, that it did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from caressing their Servants
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61444:154"/>
after a very tender and affectionate manner, and from taking care of their wounds, which were none of them of very great danger, but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less such as oblig'd <hi>Albirond</hi> to halt a little before the best friend he had, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to carry his arm in a sling. Several Complements past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and a great many fine things were sayd, both on the one side and the other; after which falling to enquire of one anothers adventures, <hi>Isabella</hi> as being the first after <hi>Albirond</hi> that came in to the <hi>Rendez-vous,</hi> told them, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and she being environed with a great number of <hi>Turkish Cavaliers</hi> in the wood, her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And so I was very likely to have been (said <hi>Don Pedro</hi>) but that desperately ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61444:155"/>
into the thickest of them. I bore one of them horse and man to the ground, and got into the thick of the wood, where I forsook my horse, and favour'd by the night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd my self in a hollow tree, till I heard the pursuers a great way from thence, and then I stole out of my hole, and at last finding my self got clear of the wood, ran in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you saw me on foot to the Port. And I (said the <hi>Sultaness</hi>) had the ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be pursued by my Husband himself (as I knew by his voice) with the gross of his Trayn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who being himself the formost of the Troop, was so eager in his pursuit, and in his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness took so little heed to his way, that his horse stumbling at the stump of a Tree came over and over with so terrible a fall, as I verily believe has broke his neck; so that the most of the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> alighting to take him up, I was only pursued by those few you saw, and have so roughly handled, and so came in after the manner your selves know better than I, who was in such a fright that I scarce knew what I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:61444:155"/>They were taken up with these, and the like discourses till the Sun being got about an howr high, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it was necessary for the Ladies to take a little repose, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them to doe, whilst they went out upon the Deck to incite the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Mariners; which they also did, though that was no very necessary care, their own fears ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding spurrs to their endeavour, with which together with the fair wind they had, and the lightness of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, of her self a good Sayler, they so skird a way before the wind, that by noon they had almost lost sight of the Coast of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and doubted not in a very short time (if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prov'd constant, as they believ'd it would,) to recover the Island of <hi>Sardinia</hi> to which (as it was agreed betwixt the two <hi>Cavaliers</hi>) they steer'd their course.</p>
               <p>With the Suns going down the Wind slackned upon them, but kept the same Quarter all that night, and the next morning they had another fresh gale with which they made very good way, and now sayl'd on without any

more fear of being pursued, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout noon they discover'd a head of them a sayl, which at distance put them into some fear, least it might be a <hi>Turkish</hi> Pirate, but they soon found their fears to be vain, it being a Galley of <hi>Malta,</hi> who was looking out for those Pirates, and was a brave tall Ship commanded by a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and a Knight of the Order, who was very famous in those Seas for many brave exploits against those enemies of the Christian Faith.</p>
               <p>The Galley was not long before she hal'd them in, a Summons that our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers</hi> were very glad to obey, as see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves now totally out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and therefore launcing the long-Boat, <hi>Albirond</hi> would himself needs go aboard the Galley, though the <hi>Sultaness</hi> was very importunate with him to stay, and to send some other, for as yet the name of Christians (who were now to be her best friends) was terrible to her. So soon as <hi>Albirond</hi> was come aboard the Galley, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently gave the Captain an account of his escape with another Gentleman, and some Slaves he had deliver'd out of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61444:156"/>
Captivity; at which he seem'd to be very glad, enterteining him with very great curtesey, and making him an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of any thing in his Ship, himself, or his friends might stand in need of; for which <hi>Albirond</hi> returning him many thanks, and going to salute the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knights and Gentlemen of the Galley, he was there aware of an old acquaintance, and particular friend of his, who with great joy embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him, the first Ceremony being over, told him, that his friends in <hi>France,</hi> from whence he was lately come, were in very great pain for his absence, that they had made his Peace with the King, and that he would be a wel-come man into his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: but withal whispered in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Of the first news <hi>Albirond</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad, as he had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be, seeing himself by the care,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61444:157"/>
and good Offices of his friends resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Country, and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess favor, and was not very sorry for the last, as being now much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided; neither did he doubt, but with what the <hi>Sultaness</hi> brought along with her to purchase such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue in <hi>France,</hi> as should settle him and his very well at their ease for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Having been for some hour, or more entertein'd aboard the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, he was at last dismist by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with great demonstration of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and friendship, and return'd back to his own Vessel, which afterwards pursued her voyage without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adventure, till within a short time, to their general joy they arrived safe at the Island of <hi>Sardinia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So soon as ever they came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> immediately sent off the shallop, to acquaint the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> with his coming, who presently sent out Boats to fetch him, himself in the mean time coming down to the shoar to receive him, and all the Artillery of the Town and Haven thundred their wel-come. His Uncle had hear'd the whole story of his troublesome
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61444:157"/>
affairs, and of his flight; wherefore so soon as the first Complements to the Ladies were a little over, taking his Nephew aside, he acquainted him, that <hi>Isabella</hi>'s Father was lately dead of an Apoplexy; that the <hi>Marquiss</hi> was turn'd religious, and that <hi>Isabella</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was shortly to be married to the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s Daughter of <hi>Valence</hi> a Lady of very great beauty and vertue, with a portion of thirty thousand Ducats; and now wanted nothing but the good news of his Sisters safety to make him compleatly happy.</p>
               <p>Thus after so many dangers; griefs and fears, did joy in torrents come tumbling in upon our fairs Lovers; so that nothing now remain'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their happiness, but the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fion of the fair <hi>African,</hi> which also was no hard matter to do, and she had not run such and so many hazards to stick at any thing; so that being instructed by the Bishop of the place she was within a few dayes receiv'd into the bosome of the Church, and at the same time solemnly married to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birond.</hi>
