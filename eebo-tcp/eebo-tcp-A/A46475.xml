         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of that our Ancient Kingdom, by their Representatives in Parliament Assembled,
in the Reign of our dearest and most entirely beloved Brother of ever Blessed
Memory, made us desirous to call you at this Time in the beginning of Our Reign, to give
you an opportunity not only of shewing your Duty to Us in the same manner, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of being Exemplary to others in your Demonstrations of Affection to Our Person, and
compliance with Our desires, as you have most eminently been in Times past, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
never to be forgotten by Us, nor (We hope) to be contradicted by your future
Practices. That which We are at this Time to propose unto you, is, what is as necessary
for your Safety as Our Service, and what has a tendency more to secure your own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
and Properties, than the Aggrandising our Power and Authority (though in it
consists the greatest Security of your Rights and Interests, these never having been in
danger except when the Royal Power was brought too low to protect them) which now
We are resolved to maintain in its greatest Lustre, to the end we may be the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to Defend and Protect your Religion as Established by Law, and your Rights and
Properties (which was Our Design in calling this Parliament) against Phanatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,
Murderers and Assassins, who having no fear of God more than Honour for
Us, have brought you into such difficulties as only the Blessing of God upon the steddy
Resolutions and Actings of Our said dearest Royal Brother, and those employed by Him,
(in Prosecution of the good and wholsome Laws by you heretofore offered) could have
saved you from the most horrid Confusions and Inevitable Ruin. Nothing has been left
unattempted by those wild and inhumane Traitors for endeavouring to overturn your
Peace: And therefore We have good Reason to hope, that nothing will be wanting in
you to secure your selves and Us from their outrages and violence in time coming, and to
take care that such Conspirators meet with their just deservings, so as others may thereby
be deterred from Courses so little agreeable to Religion, or their Duty and Allegiance to
Us. These things We considered to be of so great importance to Our Royal, as well as the
Universal interest of that Our Kingdom, that We were fully resolved in Person to have
proposed the needful Remedies to you, but things having so fallen out as render this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for us; We have now thought fit to send our Right Trusty and Right entirely
beloved Cousin and Counsellour <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Queensberry</hi> to be Our Commissioner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you; of whose Abilities and Qualifications We have Reason to be fully satisfied;
and of whose Faithfulness to Us, and Zeal for Our Interest we have had Signal Proofs
in the Times of Our greatest difficulties. Him We have fully intrusted in all Things
Relating to Our Service, and your own Prosperity and Happiness, and therefore you are
to give him intire Trust and Credit as you now see We have done; From whose Prudence
and your most Dutiful Affection to Us We have full Confidence of your entire Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
and Assistance in all those Matters wherein he is instructed as aforesaid. VVe do
therefore not only recommend unto you, that such things be done as are necessary in this
Juncture for your own Peace, and the support of Our Royal Interest, both at home and
abroad, but also that you do them so speedily as may Evidence to the World that you
are still in the same manner addicted to the Royal Interest, of which we had so much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
when amongst you, that we cannot doubt of your full and ample Expressing
the same on this occasion; by which the great concern We have in you Our Ancient and
Kindly People may still increase, and you may transmit your Loyal Actions (as Examples
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47363:3"/>
of Duty) to your Posterity. In full Confidence whereof We do assure you of Our
Royal Favour and Protection in all your concerns. And so We bid you Heartily Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

            <head>The Speech of the Lord High Commissioner.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HIs Majesty has been pleased so fully and obligingly by the Letter you have now
heard to intimate his Royal pleasure to you, as what I am to say seems in a manner
superfluous, so I need not take up much of your time, nor shall I do more than touch a
few things as briefly as is possible.</p>
            <p>And in the first place, my Lords, This being the day of His Majesties Coronation in
our Neighbouring Kingdom, you see he is no sooner placed on the Throne of his Royal
Ancestors than he inclines to have your advice in what may import the good of his Service
and Subjects here; By which you ought not only to be convinced of the great confidence
His Majesty has in the Loyalty of this his Ancient Kingdom, and their good Example to his
other Dominions, but also how fully he makes good his Royal Word and Declaration,
to follow (in his Reign) the Example of his late Majesty of ever glorious Memory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whose Protection and Government we enjoyed so long Peace and Quiet; I say (my
Lords) as by calling you so soon, His Majesty expresses great confidence in you, and
seems still mindful of the Zeal and Affection of the last Parliament for the Rights and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of the Crown, so (in a due return) it is not to be doubted, but you will upon
this occasion not only exceed what has been formerly done, but also comply with all that
can be proposed for establishing His Majesties Greatness and your own Security, and by
this convince the World how sensible you are of the great honour His Majesty has allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you of being the first Parliament of his Dominions to do so.</p>
            <p>I am in the next place to tell you, that His Majesty is very mindful of the Duty and Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Kingdom to his late Majesty and himself, when he was here amongst us: And
the better to compose the minds of his faithful Subjects, I am allowed to assure you of his
Princely Resolutions to protect and maintain the Religion and Government of this Church
as they are now Established by Law, and that he will take the Persons and Concerns of
the Regular Clergy into his special Care and Protection; And in order thereunto, I am
to give the Royal Assent to such Laws and Acts as can be reasonably proposed.</p>
            <p>I am likewise to let you know, That His Majesty will concernedly maintain your just
Rights and Properties according to the Established Laws of this Kingdom, and will not
allow of oppressive Arbitrary Proceedings in Souldiers or others, And further His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
being sensible of the great decay of our Trade, has warranted me in His Royal
Name to consent to such Laws as can reasonably be proposed for recovery and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof.</p>
            <p>And, my Lords, to conclude what I am to say on this Subject, His Majesty is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Encouragement, Welfare and Prosperity of this his Ancient Kingdom, as
He will not only do what can justly be desired or expected for these ends, but even in
Business of the Excise and Militia (his immediat concerns) I am warranted to go the
greatest lengths for your ease and conveniency that the nature of these things can bear,
and His Majesties Service and your own Security will allow.</p>
            <p>And, my Lords, His Majesty having in all things so evidently discovered his gracious
inclinations for the good of this Kingdom, and given us the fullest assurances of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Protection that our hearts can desire, what suitable Returns and Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
can we make to so excellent and imcomparable a Prince, who in all things relating
to our quiet and prosperity prevents our very desires; So if during his Reign (which I
pray God to make long and glorious) we be not the happiest people in the World, we
have only our selves to blame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47363:3"/>
And now the King having so fully done his part, it concerns you in the next place to mind
yours; And in order thereunto, I make no doubt but you will assert the Rights and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
of the Crown, and establish the Revenue as amply upon His Majesty and his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Successors as it was enjoyed by the late King or any of his Royal Predecessors, since
you cannot (in the least) doubt but his Royal care for your repose and security will
rather exceed than fall short of any of his Ancestors. But to use any further Arguments
to incite you to what is so much your Duty and Interest, were at the same time to question
your Loyalty and Zeal for His Majesties Service, and your concern for the interest and
honour of your Native Country whose Representatives you are, so I shall not injure
you, nor lessen your thanks by saying more upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>My Lords, His Majesty certainly expects from the Prudence and Loyalty of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that effectual ways will be fallen upon for destroying that desperate Phanatical
and irreclaimable Party who have brought us to the brink of Ruine and Disgrace, and
are no more Rebels against the King than Enemies of Mankind; Wretches of such Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Principles and Practices as past Ages never heard, nor those to come will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
What Indemnities and Acts of Grace and Clemency have they not Contemned?
And all the use they made of them has still been to harden and confirm them in their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
Villanies; and how inconsiderable soever they appear, assure your selves they
ought not absolutely to be contemned; for if they had not support and correspondence
not yet discovered, it is not to be supposed they could have so long escaped the care and
vigilance of the Government: It therefore concerns you both in Honor and Prudence, no
longer to dally with them, but that the utmost severities be most effectually applied, and
all wayes taken, both to find out their Favourers and retired and secret Haunts.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I doubt not but all of you sufficiently know that some of our Nation are
deeply involved in the late Horrid Conspiracy, who (and some others for other Treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Crimes and Practices) are to be proceeded against before this Parliament; The
Evidence of their Guilt I shall leave to its proper Place and Time, and do not doubt but
His Majesties Advocate will manage that weighty matter with suitable care and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
So all I shall further say upon this Subject at present is, that if Almighty God (who
watches over the security of Princes) had not Miraculously Discovered and disappointed
those the most Hellish and Barbarous Designs that were ever contrived, in Place of that
Peace, Happiness, and Tranquillity which we now Enjoy, these Kingdoms had certainly
been at this day a Sea of Blood and in all imaginable Misery and Desolation; which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evident beyond denial) will certainly provoke your and all good Mens Indignation
and Resentment against those who can be reached, not only as Advisers and Contrivers of
such Villanies, but Concealers of them: And since our Honour and Security every way
seems absolutely bound up in the Life of His Sacred Majesty, ought we not most cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to grant what the Exigencies of His mild and gentle Government requires? Especially
seeing what we give is still bestowed upon our selves, and for maintaining us in our just
Rights and Possessions, against the most cruel and Barbarous Designs of His and our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemes.</p>
            <p>And now my Lords and Gentlemen, in the last place touching my self I shall not say
much, my unfitness for this Eminent station is possibly more obvious to me than to any of
you; however since His Majesty has been Graciously pleased to place me in it, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to serve him boldly and firmly, and thereby labour to make up my other great
defects: And as this has still been my Practice in the other great Trusts I have the Honour
to carry under His Majesty, so I know His Goodness will always accept the sincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
of His Servants in place of greater Performances.</p>

            <p>When by the Command of the late King, His Majesty who now Reigns came first
hither, what Disorders, Divisions, and Animosities found He amongst us? To bring the
state of things into your prospect as it was then, could not be very grateful to you, nor
pleasing to me, but we all remember with joy how well He left us, and by what easie
gentle ways He brought about the Establishment of that Unity, which we were beginning
to despair of:</p>

God grant may be long and prosperous) that we might have the opportunity of present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Him with the first Fruits of the Service of His Parliaments, and of becoming Exemples
to His other Dominions, is the greatest and what we should prize the most, improving
it as far as it will go.</p>
            <p>When we consider what strange turns the extravagant Follies of some, and the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
devilish Contrivances of others among us have taken, since the last Meeting of
Parliament, what Convulsions have Attacted the Body of this Nation, and how vile a
Ferment has raged in it, to have our Advice called for by our Prince, how to provide
proper Remedies for it, is the greatest Honour could be put upon us.</p>
            <p>That we may do what in Duty we are bound in return, let us lay aside all private
Aims and Ends; for how can we hope to serve His Majesty, or promote the Interest of
the Nation, while our Eye is directed only towards our own particular? and let us with
the Frankness and Cheerfulness of honest <hi>SCOTS MEN.</hi> use all possible means for
Uniting of the Nation, and the driving from amongst us, whoever will not joyn with
us upon such Terms as may conduce to the Advancement of the Honour and Interest of
our King and His Crown, and the Well-being of this our Native Countrey, which we
should not suffer to be defiled and rendred contemptible to the whole World by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
so Venemous a Bastardly brood of villanous men, as have of late, to the reproach
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of Humane Nature it self, maintained Principles, and ventured upon
Practices not to be named amongst any who have ever heard of a Government, much
less of Religion.</p>

and Command in the strictest adhering to
His Word; such Temperance and Sobriety, so indefatigable a diligence in Affairs, so
Undaunted a Courage upon all occasions, and so unwearied a Clemency towards the most

what is least to be admired in him; what Reputation other Princes have laboured for,
at the vast extent of Blood and Treasure, and the putting of a constant constraint upon

His Clemency, and Care towards his People. Let us give Him the return of our Love, our

felicity and prosperity, let it be an additional tye upon us to advance His Honour and

            <p>YOur Majesties gracious and kind remembrance of the Services done by this your
ancient Kingdom, to the late King your Brother of ever-Glorious Memory, shall
rather raise in us ardent desires to exceed whatever we have done formerly than make
us consider them as deserving the Esteem your Majesty is pleased to express of them, in
your Letter to us dated the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March.</hi> The death of that our excellent Monarch is
lamented by us to all the degrees of Grief that are consistent with our great Joy for the
Succession of your Sacred Majesty, who has not onely continued, but secured the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
which His Wisdom, His Justice, and Clemency procured to us: And having the
honour to be the first Parliament which meets by your Royal Authority, of which we
are very sensible, your Majesty may be confident that we will offer such Laws as may
best secure your Majesties Sacred Person, the Royal Family and Government, and be so
exemplarily Loyal, as to raise your Honour and Greatness to the utmost of our power,
which we shall ever esteem both our Duty and Interest. Nor shall we leave any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for extirpating all Fanaticsm, but especially those Fanatical Murtherers and Assassins,
and for detecting and punishing the late Conspirators, whose pernicious and execrable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
did so much tend to subvert your Majesties Government, and ruine us and all your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
faithful Subjects. We can assure your Majesty that the Subjects of this your Majesties
ancient Kingdom are so desirous to exceed all their Predecessors in extraordinary marks of
affection, and Obedience to your Majesty, that (God be praised) the onely way to be
Popular with us, is to be eminently Loyal. Your Majesties care of us when you took
us to be your special Charge, your Wisdom in extinguishing the seeds of Rebellion and
Faction amongst us, your Justice which was so great, as to be for ever exemplary, But above
all, your Majesties free and cheerful securing to us our Religion when you were the late
King your Royal Brother's Commissioner, now again renewed when you are our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
are what your Subjects here can never forget. And therefore your Majesty may
expect that we will think your Commands sacred as your Person, and that your Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will prevent our Debates. Nor did ever any who represented our Monarchs as
their Commissioners, (except your Royal Self) meet with greater Respect, or more
exact Observance from a Parliament, than the Duke of <hi>Queensberry</hi> (whom your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
