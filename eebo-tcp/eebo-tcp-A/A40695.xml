         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Writing: But I find now an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

the Parliament not being at leiſure
to hear the Manifeſtation of what
I humbly propos'd, I am conſtrain'd
to anſwer the malicious Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents

APPEAL
TO
Both Houſes
OF
PARLIAMENT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MY laſt Three Books ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
occaſion'd ſome
Diſputes in the World,
which I hop'd to have
finally decided this Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and having intimated as
much in my <hi>Narratives,</hi> I think it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93039:5"/>
highly concerns Me, at this time,
to let the World know, That I
have not been negligent on my
part; to perform every particular
of my Promiſe, both as to what
relates to the Confirmation of the
Diſcoveries that I made, of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of the Enemies of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the Years 1690. and 1691.
as alſo the proving of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitious
Birth of the pretended
Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> and that he was
the real Son of Mrs. <hi>Mary Gray,</hi> by
which Name ſhe was called, whilſt
I knew her; and her Brother, as ſhe
call'd him, the Secular Prieſt, lives
yet at <hi>Callis,</hi> by the ſame Name.</p>
            <p>How far I have urged for Leave
to demonſtrate the Truths of both
theſe weighty Matters, you will
plainly find by the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and Petitions, which were all
delivered, though it was my Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93039:5"/>
to preſent them at a Time,
when Both Houſes of <hi>Parliament</hi>
were taken up with more weighty
Affairs; and theſe Propoſals of
mine wou'd have taken ſo much
of their Time, in the particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations,
as might have been
Prejudicial to the King's Affairs, to
which I ſhall ever have a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard;
and nothing but the intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Wrongs I have ſo long groan'd
under, and the Tyrannick Inſults
of the Jacobites of this Kingdom,
cou'd poſſibly have induced me to
trouble the <hi>Parliament</hi> at ſuch a
time: Nor ſhall I deſiſt to ſue for
Juſtice, and a fair Hearing on
both ſides, when I may poſſibly
(without any Inconvenience to the
Publick) obtain ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
            <p>For, I ſolemnly decIare to all the
World, That, to be permitted to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93039:6"/>
clear my Reputation, and to prove
the Truths of all I have PubIiſh'd,
is my greateſt Ambition. And it
hath pleaſed Almighty God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
me ſo Plainly and fully to
prove it, when required, that I do
not fear, even now the High
Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> is Sitting, to
engage to forfeit my Life, in caſe
of failure: Such Sacred Truths can
fear no Factions, nor Parties what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
nor can I ever, though hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
threatned by thoſe poor Senſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
and Moneyleſs Animals, that
call themſelves <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that wiſh
for nothing ſo much as a <hi>French</hi>
Government, and the Diverſion
of ſwimming in Troubled Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
in which they hope by others
Ruins to mend their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93039:6"/>
I confeſs, in anſwer to Me, they
may very juſtly affirm, That I have
not got ſo much by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to boaſt of my Riches,
or any thing elſe, unleſs in my Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:
I muſt ingeniouſly own,
my hard Uſage was not very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Fleſh and Blood; but no
power on Earth ſhou'd make me
Diſloyal to King <hi>William,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
to the Intereſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am in Charity with all Mankind;
yet I confeſs, it has been ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to me, to ſee my greateſt
Enemies, who unjuſtly Lorded it
over me, fall from their Stations,
and into Diſgrace, by the ſame
Meaſures that they made uſe of
to enſnare me; and I have much
Reaſon to bleſs God, for the good
King's, and my Country's Sake: And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93039:7"/>
that God will, I hope, as He has
begun, deliver His Majeſty, this
Kingdom, <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
from all our Boſome Enemies,
which heighten our Diviſions, and
are the greateſt Curſe we groan
under; ſince from them, I may ſay,
(almoſt alone) the <hi>French</hi> Tyrant
receives thoſe Hopes, (which have
often failed him) that have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
the Continuance of the
War ſome time; nay, the <hi>French</hi>
King's harſh Uſage to the late King,
and all with him, is a plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
That he has no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Zeal for his Cauſe,
only by Flattery from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:93039:7"/>
Amongſt our Zealous <hi>Proteſtant
Jacobites,</hi> I would fain know, what
Reward thoſe Gentlemen think to
have, who have been ſo earneſt
for a <hi>French</hi> Power, that they took
the Oaths to King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi>
to make themſelves ſerviceable to
King <hi>James,</hi> as they pretended; and
had the Aſſurance to write to King
<hi>James</hi> and his <hi>Queen,</hi> to tell them ſo.
I am very certain that King <hi>James</hi>
kept ſome of their Letters to this
effect: And others of the ſame
kind I thought good to ſecure in
<hi>England,</hi> which with a great many
more, had e're this time been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
to the World, only I was
ambitious to have had them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Parliament firſt: At leaſt
I hoped and pray'd in my Petition,
(as you may ſee) That I might
have Leave of either of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to have publiſh'd all I knew
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93039:8"/>
of that kind; which I ſhall yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to obtain.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit making ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
on what happen'd upon my
ſending a Letter to the Speaker
of the Houſe of Commons, the
Right Honourable <hi>Paul Foley,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
It was, as you will alſo find, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to Sir <hi>John Fenwick;</hi> not that
I had any Prejudice againſt the
Perſon of Sir <hi>John Fenwick,</hi> but an
Abhorrence to his moſt deteſtable
and barbarous Crimes. For the
firſt two Years after the late King's
Abdication, every time that I came
to <hi>England,</hi> from St. <hi>Germains,</hi> I
brought Letters to Sir <hi>John Fenwick,</hi>
and was daily with him and other
Gentlemen of the late King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
at their Meetings, to conſult
for to carry on their Deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the preſent Government:
And in thoſe Unhappy Errors, Sir
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93039:8"/>
               <hi>John Fenwick</hi> was as much involv'd
as moſt of the ſame Pretenders,
and gave the late King, and the
<hi>French</hi> King, very large Promiſes
of the wonderful effects of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the North of <hi>England;</hi>
which was propos'd to be joyn'd
with many others, and to make a
conſiderable Army, near <hi>Scotland,</hi>
where Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi> was to act
as Lieutenant-General, for which I
brought him a Commiſſion from
the late King; who has often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> That Sir
<hi>John Fenwick</hi> was a good Horſe-Officer,
but had no extraordinary
Opinion of his Management in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Caſes, that requir'd a firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
and a ſerious Conduct.</p>
            <p>It had been Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
very often to promiſe the
<hi>French</hi> Court much, and perform
nothing to their expectation; yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93039:9"/>
neither Sir <hi>John</hi> nor his Party ever
omitted, by new Engagements, to
atone for the Diſappointments, which
they often excuſed, by laying the
Blame on ſome Roguiſh under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
informing Brother; affirming
to King <hi>James,</hi> That the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was ſent from his Court; which
made his late Majeſty and his
Queen very often jealous of all
about them; and really, to ſpeak
truth of the Court of <hi>St. Germains,</hi>
there is almoſt as many Factions
as there is People; ſo that even King
<hi>James</hi>'s ſmall Government there, is
attended with much Difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>During my Correſpondence with
Sir</hi> John Fenwick, <hi>on the late King's
account, I was once in company with
him and three others, at a Tavern
in the City of</hi> London, <hi>where Sir</hi> John
<hi>and the reſt ſign'd an</hi> Addreſs <hi>to the</hi>
French <hi>King, which was ſign'd elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where

be ready, on any occaſion, to joyn and

in ſuccouring their moſt diſtreſſed

            <p>And one of Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to K. <hi>James,</hi> ſoon after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
was, to adviſe him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the French King, That then
there was an Opportunity for him
to place many for his Intereſt in the
Service of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> there
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93039:10"/>
being a great many Places to be
ſold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is what I knew, and could
juſtly depoſe, againſt Sir <hi>John Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</hi>
And having long ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the King and the Houſe of
Commons of this matter, I thought
it my Duty to offer to atteſt the
ſame Face to Face with Sir <hi>John,</hi> at
the Bar of the Houſe of Commons,
which occaſion'd my writing to the
Speaker.</p>
            <p>It's true, Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi> is now
indicted for a much later Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
againſt the King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(which is of the ſame kind,
and plainly prov'd by Captain <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
&amp;c.)</hi> and I dare preſume to
ſay, that there is no intelligible man,
that is not partial in the matter, but
what in their own Conſciences does
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93039:10"/>
believe Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi> really guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
I muſt confeſs, in my own
Opinion, there was no occaſion of
my being called, or any greater
Proof than the Honourable Houſe
of Commons had before them;
for which reaſon my ſelf was not
call'd.</p>
            <p>Give me Leave to make one
Obſervation more of my own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which is, <hi>That Sir</hi> John Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick
<hi>has often, in my Company, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
againſt the Perſons he lately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to accuſe, with the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and Hatred imaginable; and I
cannot hear of any body that ever knew
him converſant with any of thoſe Lords
or Gentlemen ſince. And what is yet
more ſtrange to me, is, That Sir</hi> John
Fenwick <hi>has not ſo much as mention'd
(as I have been inform'd) the Names
of one of thoſe, who to my certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93039:11"/>
were actually concern'd with him
for King</hi> James<hi>'s Intereſt, as they term
it; no, he has not diſcover'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any of thoſe
that ſign'd the Addreſs with him How
Sir</hi> John <hi>was prevail'd on to be guilty of
ſo great a piece of Folly, God knows.</hi>
Only I muſt beg his Leave, with
others, to believe it an Action very
much unbecoming a perſon of his
Rank, much leſs a Chriſtian in his
circumſtances, and one that has ſo
long ow'd his Life to the great
Clemency of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I hope he will conſider it
himſelf, and remembring what he
is, may, before it is too late, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his Conſcience faithfully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
GOD, King <hi>William,</hi> and his
Native Country; for, I preſume,
there is little Comfort in dying for
a bad Cauſe: And for them at
<hi>St. Germains,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>England,</hi>
of the French Intereſt, which wiſh
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93039:11"/>
him hang'd with all their Hearts,
and are impatient for it, as they
have often been on the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>I preſume, the late King's deſire
of the death of ſuch, was not
meerly to encreaſe the number of
his Friends in Heaven, that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible;
for King <hi>James,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are damn'd,
cannot ſo much, after their Deaths,
as have one Twelve-penny Maſs
ſaid for their Souls. Therefore if
King <hi>James</hi> have any Remorſe, it
muſt be the Subject of many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
and cauſe of much Sorrow,
to think, as his Faith obliges him,
how many Souls are gone to Hell
by his Engagement in a very bad
Cauſe. I hope and pray, that no
true <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> though never ſo
much engag'd in the Intereſt of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93039:12"/>
the preſent Government, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to judge ſo uncharitably of
any of our greateſt Enemies, that
have died moſt juſtly, for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to murther the beſt of Kings,
and to involve the Nation into Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Miſery.</p>
            <p>By this the late King and the
French Court ſhew little Charity;
no, they're barbarous and inhuman,
by engaging <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> nay, even
by receiving them into their Service,
with a deſign to expoſe their Lives,
and ſo conſequently their Souls.</p>
            <p>This Argument truly weigh'd,
(and a Thouſand more there is to the
ſame purpoſe) ſhould, I think, be
ſufficient to diſſwade any <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
from any manner of Engagement on
the late King's or French Court's
account.</p>

                  <salute>Honoured SIR,</salute>

               <p>I Humbly preſume, that every Free-Born
Subject of <hi>England,</hi> has a
Right to the Juſtice of his Country;
and I hope few, but my ſelf, have
cauſe of Complaint to the contrary:
How I have deſerved it, I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
ſince I know of no other Fault, but
my want of cautionary Advertency,
when I Engaged for <hi>Dalleval,</hi> and
<hi>Hayes,</hi> which was Impoſed on me by
the Artifices of the <hi>French Court,</hi> and
the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Friends in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as I have offered to prove by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Witneſſes, before the <hi>Parliament;</hi>
and alſo, that the Management of that
Affair coſt the <hi>French King</hi> many <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi>
Pounds, in order to invalidate me;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93039:22"/>
which render'd my Caſe very hard, and
a cruel Oppreſſion; when even the
very Enemies of the Government are
allow'd to Expoſe me, becauſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
their wicked Deſignes; and I
am deny'd leave to prove my wrongs.</p>
               <p>It was to ſerve King <hi>William,</hi> and
theſe Kingdoms, that I went
to <hi>France,</hi> after my firſt Diſcovery,
and even into the <hi>French King</hi>'s Cloſet,
Expoſing my Life to the Wheel, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
my neareſt and deareſt Friends,
Intereſt, and Imploy, to ſerve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Government, from thoſe great
Dangers that ſeem'd to threaten it:
This is, Sir, what I am ſure, you very
well know; and alſo, that my <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
were Confirm'd by the Lord <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>'s,
and Mr. <hi>Crone</hi>'s Confeſſions.</p>
               <p>You were, Sir, of the <hi>Committee,</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the <hi>Houſe</hi> to Examine me,
when <hi>Hayes</hi> and <hi>Dalleval</hi> went off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And you have been often pleaſed to
expreſs, how very hard you thought
my uſage was, on that account: My
Sufferings have been more than I can
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93039:23"/>
Expreſs; and my Concern is greater
for my unhappy Country, than for my
ſelf; and if not for mine, yet for the
Publick Good, I pray the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
to Examine my Cauſe, that you
may plainly know, what <hi>England</hi> has,
and may ſuffer by thoſe Devices and
Inſtruments of the <hi>French Court:</hi> And
if the <hi>Houſe</hi> pleaſes to appoint a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi>
to Examine me, and thoſe I ſhall
produce on this Account, to prove what
I offer, I am confident, it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
to the Nations Satisfaction and
Intereſt: And if not, be pleaſed, Sir,
to move the <hi>Houſe,</hi> that I may have
leave to print my <hi>Caſe,</hi> and the Copies
of all the <hi>Letters</hi> I brought from <hi>France,</hi>
&amp;c. For, ſince I was Voted againſt, by
the former <hi>Houſe,</hi> and an <hi>Addreſs</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the King, to Order the <hi>Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
General</hi> to proſecute me, I dare not
Appeal to His Majeſty, (who is the beſt
of Kings,) until I have Honourably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
the <hi>world,</hi> how much I am <hi>wrong'd</hi>
and miſrepreſented, by the ſubtil devices
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93039:23"/>
of King <hi>James</hi>'s Adherents, who ſo eaſily
impoſed on my Judgment, and ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

               </p>
               <p>In a word, Sir, if I have done the
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> any Service, I hope
my Requeſt will be granted: And, if
I have not, I deſire to be Hang'd.</p>
               <p>I have given my Original <hi>Petition</hi> to
