         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>HOW
GODS PEOPLE
Are not to take the
Names of the Heathen Gods in their Mouths.
Nor follow their Cuſtoms nor learn their Waies, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THus ſaith the Lord to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 
               <q>Learn not the
way of the Heathen, and be not diſmayed at the Signs of
Heaven, for the Heathen are diſmayed at them, for the
Cuſtoms of the People are vain, <hi>&amp;c. for</hi> they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Brutiſh and Fooliſh: their Stock is a Doctrin of Vanities.
Thus ſhall ye ſay unto them, The Gods that have not made the
Heavens and the Earth, even they ſhall periſh from the Earth, and
from under theſe Heavens,</q> 
               <bibl>Jer. 10.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Pour out thy Fury upon the Heathen, that know thee not, and upon
the Families that call not upon thy Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they have eaten up
<hi>Jacob,</hi> and devoured him, and conſumed him, and have made his
Habitation Deſolate: but the Lord is the true God, he is the Living
God, and an everlaſting King at his wrath. The Earth ſhall tremble,
and the Nations ſhall not be able to abide his Indignation,</q> 
               <bibl>Jer. 10. 25.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Here you may ſee they that follow the vain Cuſtoms of the
Heathen, and learn their waies, and follow the Doctrin of their
Vanities, are Fooliſh and Brutiſh, and ſuch Worſhip the Gods
that are made with Hands, which made not the Heavens and
the Earth, and all ſuch Gods the Lord ſaith ſhall periſh
from the Earth, and from under theſe Heavens; as you may ſee
theſe that learned the way of the Heathen, and followed their
vain Cuſtoms and Doctrines of Vanities, and were Fooliſh and
Brutiſh, and were diſmayed at the Signs of Heaven, and theſe
are ſuch that eat up <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſecond Birth, and ſeek to devour
him, and conſume him, and to make his Habitation deſolate.
So the Jews the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not to learn the waies
of the Heathen, nor their vain Cuſtoms, nor to follow their
Doctrine of Vanities, for they were fooliſh and brutiſh that did
ſo: And the portion of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſecond Birth, is not like them,
for the Lord is his portion. The Lord ſaid to the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and Old Covenant, <q>In all things that
I have ſaid unto you be Circumſpect, and make no mention of the
Names of other Gods, neither let it be heard out of thy Mouth,</q>
               <bibl>Exod. 23. 13.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Now here you may ſee Gods People were to make no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Names of other Gods, namely the Gods of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
that were made with hands, neither were they to be heard
out of their Mouths, for he ſaith, <q>The Gods that made not the
Heavens and the Earth, even they ſhall periſh from off the Earth,
and from under theſe Heavens,</q> 
               <bibl>Jer. 10. 11.</bibl> And God's People
were not to learn the way of the Heathen, nor follow the vain
Cuſtoms of the People: for they are altogether Brutiſh and
Fooliſh, and their Stock is a Doctrin of Vanities: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God's People in the Old Teſtament, were wholly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſuch things, but they were to Serve and to Fear the
Lord God.</p>
            <p>The old Pagan <hi>Saxons,</hi> in their Idolatry, brought in the
Names of the Daies after their Gods; and theſe called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
have retained them to this Day; and yet they ſay the
Scripture is their Rule, for their Faith and Practice, and yet their
Practice is quite contrary to the Scripture, and the Command of
God. The Firſt Day of the Week, the Idolatrous <hi>Saxons</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
the Idol of the <hi>Sun,</hi> from whence came <hi>Sunſday</hi> or <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
The Second Day of the Week they Worſhipped the
<hi>Moon,</hi> from whence came <hi>Munday</hi> or <hi>Moonſday.</hi> The Third
Day they Worſhipped the Idol of the <hi>Planet,</hi> which they called
<hi>Tuiſco,</hi> from whence came <hi>Tueſday.</hi> And from their Idol <hi>Woden,</hi>
came <hi>Wodenſday,</hi> called <hi>Wedneſday.</hi> And from their Idol, <hi>Thor,</hi>
came <hi>Thurſday.</hi> And from their Idol <hi>Friga,</hi> came <hi>Friday.</hi> And
from their Idol <hi>Satur,</hi> came <hi>Saturday.</hi> And the Heathen called
<hi>Mars</hi> the God of Battle, and from thence they called the firſt
Month <hi>March.</hi> And <hi>Venus</hi> they called the Goddeſs of Love
and Beauty, and from thence they called the ſecond Month
<hi>April.</hi> And <hi>Maja</hi> a Heathen Goddeſs, called <hi>Flora,</hi> and <hi>Chloris,</hi>
were called the Goddeſſes of Flowers, unto <hi>Maja,</hi> the Heathen
Idolaters uſed a Sacrifice, from thence was the third Month cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>May;</hi> and upon the firſt Day of <hi>May</hi> they uſed to keep
<hi>Floras</hi> Feaſt to the two Goddeſſes of Flowers (to wit) <hi>Flora</hi>
and <hi>Chloris. Flora</hi> was a Strumpet in <hi>Rome,</hi> that uſed on the
firſt Day of <hi>May</hi> to ſet up a <hi>May-Pole</hi> at the Door to entice her
Lovers; from whence came <hi>May-Poles</hi> to be firſt obſerved.
And from the Heathen Goddeſs <hi>Juno,</hi> is the fourth Month called
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e. And in honour to <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour,
they called the fifth Month <hi>July.</hi> And the ſixth took its Name
<hi>Auguſt</hi> in honour to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi> And <hi>September, October,
November,</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> are called from the <hi>Latines.</hi> And one
<hi>Janus;</hi> a King of <hi>Italy,</hi> was for his Wiſdom pictured with two
Faces, and whom they Honoured as a God, and from this name
<hi>Janus</hi> was the eleventh Month, called <hi>January.</hi> And <hi>Saturnus,
Pluto, Febeus</hi> were called the Gods of Hell, whom the Heathen
ſaid had the Rule of the Evil Spirit there; and from <hi>Pluto, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus</hi>
was the twelfth Month, called <hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here you may ſee how the Chriſtians call the Daies, and
many of the Months after the Heathen Gods and Goddeſſes, and
not after the Scriptures, which in the Beginning called them the
Firſt, Second, Third, Fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And called the Months,
Firſt, Second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Twelfth.</p>
            <p>And the Lord Commanded the Jews his People, as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>In all things I have ſaid unto you be ye Circumſpect, and
make no mention of the Names of the other Gods: Neither let it be
heard out of thy Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all you that profeſs Chriſtianity, how do you obey the
Lord, and are circumſpect, who make mention of the Names of
other Gods &amp; Godeſſes, &amp; are ſo often heard out of the Mouths of
you and your Children, and to keep them up in the Memory both
in your Mouthes and Childrens, ye put them in your Almanacks
leſt ye ſhould forget them; and yet you ſay the Scripture is your
Rule, and yet diſobey both the Command of God and the Holy
Scriptures of Truth, and are often angry with, and deride the
People of God in ſcorn, you call Quakers, becauſe they do not
call the Months and Daies after the Heathens Gods and Goddeſſes,
but do call them according as the Holy Men of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Truth have firſt called them, and cannot call them after
the Idolatrous Heathens Gods and Goddeſſes, nor mention their
Gods and Goddeſſes Names, as you do, without the Breach of
the Command of God, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 13. and the Scriptures
of Truth.</p>
            <p>The Lord Saith, <q>I will Cut off the Names of the Idols out of the
Land, and they ſhall no more be Remembred,</q>
               <bibl>Zach. 13. 2.</bibl>  And
the Lord ſaith, <q>I will take away the Names of <hi>Baalim</hi> out of her
Mouth, and they ſhall no more be Remembred by their Name,</q> 
               <bibl>Hoſ. 2. 17.</bibl>
