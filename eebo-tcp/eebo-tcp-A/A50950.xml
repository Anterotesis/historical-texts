            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But now how doth this determine against Monarchy? why yes, thus, or not at all; The King denies the people their right, therfore the people may take away his. Is this one of the grounds upon which the Observator doth intend to overthrow Monarchy? yes, if our Author may be judge.

            <p>I but saith the Author, <hi>Compare us to any other Nation in the Christian world, we in our worst times, were least unhappy.</hi>

            <p>A strange reason, that because other Nations are not so happy as wee, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance out of defect of their Government, or themselves, that therefore wee must inslave our selves to be like them: I feare this is the labour of the time, to reduce us to their condition; and I hope this will be our care, not to be content with a comparative hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse only, but to labour to maintaine our ancient rights and priviledges.</p>
            <p>Againe the Author saith, that <hi>he shall not endeavour to excuse the former times, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with our present miseries: though neither be defirable, yet we are too sensible, which we have justest reason to complaine of.</hi>

            <p>Tis certaine that no evill is defirable, but yet if Fate decree it, let me suffer under the hand of justice, rather than of wrong and oppression.

But admitting it be expounded in the preter perfect tense, and not in the future; why yet saith the Observator, it matters not: for by the oath and the Law of the land the king is bound to do justice; and the granting of new laws unto his people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their request, is an act of justice, &amp; necessary as well as the dispencing of the old, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there being the same necessitity, the publike trust must needs equally extend to both. But the Aethor will shew us, why <hi>elegerit,</hi> must of necessity bee taken in the preterrerfect, not in the future, as this case is, for saith he, <hi>the word</hi> (consuetudines) <hi>which cannot referre to the future, undenyably evinces, it was meant of the time past.</hi>] Under favour this doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly conclude that <hi>elegerit</hi> must be taken in the preter perfect tense, for no more then the King can grant such customes as the people sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that the oath must bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, <hi>reddendo singula singulis,</hi> as we say in law; that is, that he will confirme their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent customes which they doe already enjoy. and that he will grant unto them such new laws as they shall hereafter make choyce of: other reasonable construction the oath will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of, and agreeing with this exposition is the first clause of his Magisties oath, where demand is made whether his Majestie will grant and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And contrary to that which the Author doth assert, the Parliament have made it clear and manifest by their declaration lately published, how that <hi>elegerit</hi> hath been alwayes rendered in the future tense, and not in the preter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tense.

Tis strange that the times should so vary the case, and that long enjoyment or possession (which doth usually confirme and strengthen a mans right) should be a meanes to take it away. But before I passe this over, let me tell the Author, that it is a most idle, scandalous and false aspersion: and if I do in all this wrong him, let hee himself judge upon his owne inference, which is this, that the defending and maintaining of the ancient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>That there is not the least colour of a pretence to such a power, I have before plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced it. Kut I pray heare his reason, why this power, as to some respects may not be greater than the King. <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>since the law hath given the King a power, by dissolving of the Parliament, to take away that power (as is pretended) greater than his owne, if they had ever made claime to superiority over him, he would quickly have put an end to that dispute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is in plaine termes to say, that a power that is but temporary, cannot be greater, than that which is continuing and unalterable: a strange fallacy, why, if the Kingmake one high Constable of England <hi>ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Or if the King conferre the dignitie and Office of Lord Keeper to another, by committing of the seale unto his custody, is he therefore not superiour to the rest of the Nobility because removable at his Majesties will and discretion? an absurditie to thinke it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before this power be challinged, it would be fit to vote down that clause in a law, made 2 H. 5 cited by his Majesty, That it is of the Kings regality to grant or deny such of their petitions; as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that this is said to be cited by his Majesty, I shall not question the truth of it, though I have searched the Statutes, and I cannot find any such clause; But admitting it to be so, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any one make a question whether that there were such a Prerogative in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> as the Kings negative voyce? certainly not.

Againe the last verse, He that doubteth is damned, if he eate, because he eateth not of faith; for whatsoever is not of faith, is finne.

            <p>
               <hi>But some determination must be supreame, and therefore either the Kings power and trust must</hi>
