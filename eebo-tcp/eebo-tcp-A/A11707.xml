            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>FOR-SA-MEIKLE as We are not ignorant of the Great Diſorders, which haue
happened of late within this Our ancient Kingdome of SCOTLAND, occaſioned, as is pretended, vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of the Service Booke, Booke of Canons, and High Commiſsion, thereby fearing innovation of
Religion and Laws. For ſatisfaction of which feares, We well hoped, that the two proclamations of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of December, and nineteenth of Februarie, had beene aboundantlie fufficient: Nevertheleſſe, finding
that diſorders haue daylie ſo increaſed, that a powerfull rather than perſwaſiue way, might haue beene juſtlie
expected from Us: Yet Wee out of Our innatiue indulgence to Our People, grieving to ſee them run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſo headlong into ruine, are graciouſlie pleaſed to trye, if by a fayre way Wee can reclayme them
from their faults, rather than to let them periſh in the ſame. And therefore, once for all, Wee haue thought
fit to declare, and hereby to aſſure all our good people, that We neyther were, are, nor by the Grace of GOD
ever ſhall bee ſtained with Popiſh ſuperſtition: But by the contrarie, are reſolved to maintaine the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Chriſtian Religion alreadie profeſt within this Our ancient Kingdome. And for farther clearing of ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Wee doe heereby aſſure all men, that Wee will neither now nor heereafter preſſe the practice of the
foreſayde Canons and Service Booke, nor anie thing of that nature, but in ſuch a faire and legall way, as ſhall
ſatisfie all Our loving ſubjects, that wee neyther intende innovation in Religion or Laws. And to this effect
haue given order, to diſcharge all Acts of Counſell made thereanent. And for the high Commiſsion, We ſhall
ſo rectifie it with the helpe of advice of our privie Counſell, that it ſhall never impugne the Lawes, nor bee a
juſt grievance to Our loyall Subjects. And what is farder fitting to be agitate in generall Aſſemblies and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
for the good and peace of the Kirke, and peaceable government of the ſame, in eſtabliſhing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
preſently profeſt, ſhall likewiſe be taken into Our Royal conſideration, in a free aſſemblie &amp; Parliament,
which ſhall be indicted &amp; called with Our beſt conveniencie. And We hereby take GOD to witneſſe, that Our
true meaning and intention is, not to admit of anie innovations eyther in Religion or Lawes, but carefullie to
mayntayne the puritie of Religion alreadie profeſt and eſtabliſhed, and nowayes to ſuffer Our Lawes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frindged.
And although We cannot bee ignorant, that there may be ſome disaffected perſons, who will ſtryue
to poſſeſſe the hearts of Our good Subjects, that this Our Gracious Declaration is not to be regarded: Yet
We doe expect, that the behaviour of all our good and loyall Subjects will be ſuch, as may giue teſtimonie
of their obedience, and how ſenſible they are of Our Grace and Favour, that thus paſſeth over their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors;
and, by their future carriage, make appeare, That it was onlie feare of INNOVATION, that hath
cauſed the diſorders which haue happened of late within this Our ancient Kingdome: And are confident,
That they will not ſuffer themſelues to bee ſeduced, and miſsled, to miſconſtrue Us, or OUr Actions; but reſt
heartilie ſatisfied with Our pious and reall Intentions, for mayntenance of the TRVE RELIGION, and LAWES
of this KINGDOME. WHEREFORE, Wee requyre, and heartilie wish all Our good People, carefullie to
advert to theſe dangerous Suggeſtions; and not to permit themſelues, blindlie, vnder pretext of Religion,
to be led in diſobedience, and draw on, infinitelie to Our griefe, their owne ruine; which Wee haue,
and ſtill ſhall ſtryue, to ſaue them from, ſo long as We ſee not Royall Authoritie ſhaken off: And moſt vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie
ſhall make vſe of that Power which GOD hath endewed Us with, for reclayming of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
People.</p>
            <p>OUR WILL is herefore, and We charge you ſtraytlie, and command, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent
theſe Our Letters ſeene, you paſſe to the Market-croſſe of Our
Burgh of EDINBVRGH, and all other places needfull; And there, by open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
make publication hereof, to all and ſundrie Our good Subjects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through
none pretend ignorance of the ſame. The which to doe, Wee commit to
you conjunctlie and ſeverallie, Our full Power, by theſe Our Letters; delivering the
ſame, by you duelie executed and indorced, agayne to the bearer.</p>
