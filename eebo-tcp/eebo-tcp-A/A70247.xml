            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Title of this Book gives thee little incouragement to buy or to read it, and it was purpoſely ſo given. If it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms but as much as the Title pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, thou art not deceived; if more, thou art advantaged.</p>
            <p>The Subject is ſeemingly trivial, and ſuitable to the Title; yet it hath exerciſed the Wits and Pens of many Learned men, and makes way
<pb facs="tcp:50395:3"/>to Natural Diſcoveries, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of greater importance; at the worſt it may be an innocent Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, and poſſibly delightful to thoſe that are pleaſed with Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Experiments of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The Experiments therein are ſome new, ſome vulgar and common, and ſome borrowed from thoſe Excellent perſons, whom though the Author highly honours for their Learning and Industry, yet in ſome things diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from them in their Solutions and Concluſions from thoſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they have moſt ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly found out and delivered.</p>
            <p>The Author pretends not to an equality of Learning to thoſe from whom he thus diſſents, much leſs to Infallibility; there may poſſibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb facs="tcp:50395:3"/>want of Exactneſs in his Tryals, there may be imperfect and miſtaken Computations. The Diagrams though but few, yet rude. The Reſolutions and Concluſions may either be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or not ſo clearly or evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and inferred, or deduced.</p>
            <p>But he that conſiders the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this Inquiry, the various complications' of Cauſes, and Effects, and Appearances that occur therein, the great difficulty of arriving to exactneſs in the Experiments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will rectify or eaſily excuſe ſuch miſtakes or inadvertencies, if any ſuch occur in theſe Papers.</p>
            <p>If the Inquiry hath not attained its full complement and perfection in theſe Papers, yet the Author hath obtained his End therein, namely, to give hints and occaſions to Ingenious
<pb facs="tcp:50395:4"/>perſons to make farther and better Diſcoveries, and to rectifie (if there be occaſion) the miſtakes of theſe or other mens Solutions; and to give a little warning to men of Wit and Parts, not to be too haſty or poſitive in exterminating the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Philoſophy, and entertaining new <hi>hypotheſes,</hi> 'till they have fully and maturely conſidered, and well looked about them. The Author's Name is not prefixed, for it would be of ſmall advantage or uſe: and he is thereby the fitter to bear the correction of his Errors, and to retract them with more eaſe, and leſs obſervation, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch ſhall occur to his diſcovery or notice; and therefore hath left the Book it ſelf, and the matters therein delivered, to bear their own burthen, and to ſtand or fall as they deſerve.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the many Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of latter Ages, there hath been invented that Engine that commonly goes under the name of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, which is but this: A Glaſs-Tube of three foot or more long, cloſed at one end, and then filled with Mercury or Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, and then the open end ſtopped with the finger, and inverted into a veſſel of reſtagnant Mercury &amp; and when the end is ſufficiently immerſed, then the finger nimbly removed ſo that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50395:5"/>no Air get in, the Mercury will ſubſide in the Tube to the height of <hi>29</hi> Inches, and half an inch, or near thereabout; but infallibly between 27 and 30 Inches, leaving the reſidue of the upper end of the Tube emptied of the Mercury.</p>
               <p>This Experiment, and the ſolution of it, hath exerciſed the Tryals and Wits, and Invention of very many excellent Perſons, ſuch as were <hi>Helmont, Gaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Kircherus, Shottus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Carleton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sinclere,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quett,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Paſcall, Magnanus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle, Linus, Honeratus, Fabri,</hi> and divers others; who though men of great Learning and Induſtry, have run into ſeveral Parties, and given Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and raiſed Concluſions from it, extreamly contradictory the one to the other.</p>
               <p>And although this ſeems but a very trifling and ludicrous Experiment, yet almoſt all diſſenting Parties have made it to ſuffragate to their ſeveral precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Sentiments, and Perſwaſions, and that in Philoſophical Points of as great moment and importance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50395:5"/>as moſt to be found in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inquiries. Some from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm themſelves in their Perſwaſion, that there are both interſperſed and coacervated Vacuities or Spaces, empty of any corporeal ſubſtance in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; others again as confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the untruth of that Opinion, and that from the ſame Experiment. Others again from hence confirming themſelves in the <hi>Carteſian</hi> ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>Tria Principia,</hi> and eſpecially of that <hi>Materia Subtilis,</hi> which cannot be excluded from pervading the moſt contumacious and ſolid body: Others attributing the ſame Power to the more ſubtil parts of the aerial conſiſtence; ſome from hence concluding an actual preſſure and gravitation of the Air up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſubjected bodies, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Mercury is ſuſteined by way of Preſſure, and Truſion, and Counterpoys, and have ſubſtituted thereupon as an undoubted <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> a world of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conſequences in natural appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, not only in the greater World, but alſo in the leſſer World the humane
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50395:6"/>ſtructure. Others again have hereupon maintained their opinion of Attraction as the neceſſary effect of Tenſion, and reſolve this ſuſpenſion of the Mercury unto the force of attraction and ſuction, occaſioned by that Catholick Law of Nature for preſervation of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the Univerſe, and all its parts, and the <hi>Fuga Vacui,</hi> and are no way ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with that confidence that decryes it.</p>
               <p>From this diverſity of Judgments of Learned men, we may learn, firſt, how little it is in natural Effects that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and truly know and underſtand, when ſo trivial an Experiment that we have ſo eaſie an acceſs unto, and handle with our hands, and perceive by our ſight its motion, which yet ſo gravels, or at leaſt divides men of great Parts, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Learning and Experience. 2. How ſtrangely partial men are to thoſe Sentiments that they have once enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and perchance taken much pains to mould and faſhion, or have even publickly engaged unto or for; whereby it comes to paſs that men are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50395:6"/>impartially to conſider what makes againſt their opinion, and frame a thouſand imaginations to evade the ſtrength of the oppoſite reaſons, and to conſtrue all appearances (as melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick perſons do the ſound of Bells) to ſpeak what they fancy; And poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly all the oppoſite Opinators in this buſineſs are under the like partiality and unindifferency.</p>
               <p>There is a great odds between a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter propounded only as an Hypotheſis, and propounded as a real truth. In the former there is nothing more required than a true underſtanding of the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi> and a ready Wit to contrive ſome Model, and to dreſs it up ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly, that it may anſwer the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> and to fit up ſuch expedients as may meet with and ſtop the Leaks that otherwiſe would happen in the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis: And ſuch a man tells us not ſo much what the truth of Nature is, as what he thinks he could have made it, if he had had the handling of it; ſuch may be the Syſtemes of <hi>Ptolomy, Copernicus,</hi> and <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50395:7"/>which cannot be poſſibly all true, though poſſibly they may be all falſe. And yet every of them is ſo fitted and accommodated by the Wit, Invention, and Induſtry of the Authors, that they ſolve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> very near equally: And thus if I remember aright <hi>des Cartes</hi> fairly propounds his <hi>tria Principia</hi>'s; and ſome other parts of his New Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
               <p>But to propound a thing as really a truth in Nature, is another kind of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and requires not ſo much a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Invention, but an impartial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into the things themſelves, and examination how all things ſtand one with another, as we truely find them, and not as we mind to make them: For the Laws of Nature are ſtable, and ſetled, and regular, and not like the Laws of Men, or the faſhions of our Cloaths, mutable, according to new Modes, or devices of Fancy.</p>
               <p>Therefore the bare accommodation of Hypotheſes to the Solution of the moſt obvious <hi>Phaenomena</hi> is not always the meaſure of its truth, for that may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50395:7"/>be but the product of Invention and Wit. For it is apparent, that though it is impoſſible that all the varying So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of this trifling Experiment can be all true, yet they are all ſo dreſſed and pieced up, that they do ſolve the moſt obvious <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in this Experiment, well near equally each with other.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, if any <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> happen cleerly either in this or any other inſtance, that do croſs and thwart that which is taken up as a neceſſary <hi>poſtulatum</hi> in any of theſe Solutions; it is if not an undeniable, yet a great and poſſibly a clear demonſtration, that the Hypotheſis its ſelf is falſe, and ill Founded, eſpecially if it be the great <hi>Baſis</hi> upon which ſuch Hypotheſis is bottomed and built.</p>
               <p>And if the foundation of a Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, or the general <hi>poſtulatum</hi> upon which it is bottomed, be falſe, or only imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, although the Inferences and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions made upon ſuch a <hi>Baſis</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with all the fineneſs and ſubtilty imaginable, and ſuch (as were the <hi>poſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> it ſelf true, upon which they are bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50395:8"/>would be as neceſſary and conſequential, as the Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Euclide,</hi> yet the whole fabrique will fail when it comes to tryal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the Aſtrological Predictions Calculated with Art enough upon a falſe Ephemerides.</p>
               <p>I that come after the Labours and Scrutinies of ſo many Excellent Men that have gone before me upon this Subject, cannot promiſe my ſelf or others that I ſhall ſay much in this Matter that hath not been ſaid before; and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a free Diſcourſe requires that I ſhould take in ſomewhat of other mens Labours. But I ſhall avoid, as much as I can, the imputation of a Plagiary, by mentioning the Authors as I have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: But yet, though ſomewhat that I ſhall ſay hath been ſaid before, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by <hi>Linus,</hi> and <hi>Fabri,</hi> yet ſomewhat will be new, although the moſt I ſhall do herein will be to make the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and manner of Explication of it as much my own as I can, which I ſhall do in this order.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall explain ſome Termes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50395:8"/>which I ſhall have occaſion to uſe, that ſo I may write intelligibly according to that ſenſe I gave my words; though it may be poſſibly not according to the ſenſe wherein others have uſed them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as preliminary to what I ſhall ſay touching this Experiment, I ſhall ſet down ſome Statical Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that may be uſeful to me upon this inquiry, not that I ſhall ingage my ſelf in the whole Theory of Statical Principles and concluſions; this hath been done already by thoſe worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> handled this Subject, as <hi>Archimedes, Steving,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> and others; but only ſhall glean up ſome general Obſervations therein ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to this inquiry.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſet down what it is not, that may be ſuppoſed in the ſpace derelicted by the Mercury, namely, it is not Nothing, nor Ayre, nor <hi>Aether,</hi> nor any Body that comes from without.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſhall ſet down what I think it is that poſſeſſeth the place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relict by the Mercury.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I ſhall ſet down what I think
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50395:9"/>is not the cauſe that ſuſpends the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Mercury, in the Tube to that Altitude of 29 Inches, or thereabouts; namely, not the Gravitation or preſſure of the impending Ayr, nor its Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricity.</p>
               <p>Sixth, I ſhall ſet down what I think is the cauſe, that ſuſpends the column of Mercury from ſubſiding in the Tube be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Twenty nine Inches, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, I ſhall ſet down thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that ſeem of the greateſt force againſt the laſt ſuppoſition.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, I ſhall take a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of ſome other Experiments, as touching the coheſion of Poliſhed Marbles, and the <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, and the riſing of Water in the common Pumps.</p>
               <p>And this Order I ſhall as near as I can obſerve in the enſuing Chapters.</p>

                  <hi>The Explication of ſome Terms, that may be of uſe in the following Inquiry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">FIrſt, I ſhall obſerve the difference between the ſpecifical or intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique Weight of a heavy Body, and the extrinſique Weight or <hi>pondus molis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For inſtance, a pound of Mercury, and a hundred pound of Mercury, have the ſame intrinſique Weight, but yet not the ſame extrinſique Weight: A pound of Water and a pound of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury have the ſame extrinſique Weight, for each quantity weighs but a pound, but they have not the ſame intrinſique Weight, for quantity for quantity, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury is heavier then Water.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Bodies are ſaid to have the ſame ſpecifical or intrinſique Weight, when the ſame bulk or quantity coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſeth equally the other; and thoſe Bodies are ſaid to differ in intrinſique Weight, where a greater quantity of the one is required to Equiponderate a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50395:10"/>leſs quantity of the other; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a Cylinder of Mercury, of an Inch long, and half an Inch Diameter, counterpoiſeth a Cylinder of Water of the ſame Diameter and 13 Inches ½ or 14 Inches long, or thereabouts. But although a Body ſpecifically or intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically lighter than another, may in ſome caſes have the advantage in point of ſpeed in motion of a Body of equal extrinſical Weight, becauſe it takes up leſs room, and ſo meets with leſs reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the <hi>medium,</hi> yet upon the Scale they equally counterpoiſe each other.</p>
               <p>But again, there is this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; a Body of a greater intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique or ſpecifical Gravity of an equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſique Weight, with a Body of leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſique weight, will ſometimes equally preſs upon a Fluid Body, upon its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, but will preſs more than the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when both have the advantage to get below the Superficies; for inſtance,</p>
               <p>Take a pound of Lead, and a pound of Wood, whether lighter or heavier than a quantity of Water equal to it,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50395:10"/>lay them each upon a peece of Cork that will ſupport them in the Water; the pound of Lead, and the pound of Cork will both ſwim upon the Water.</p>
               <p>But if the Cork be taken away, the Led will ſink, and the Wood will ſwim if lighter than a like quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and if heavier than the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity it will ſink, but not ſo faſt as the Led.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a difference between an intrinſique Weight, and an accidental Weight, which may be various; as for inſtance:</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the poſition of the one and the other: Water and Water are both intrinſically of the ſame Weight, yet if Water be in a Tube, open at both ends, and be ſtopt with the Finger at the lower end, and then when contiguous to the Water in a Veſſel, the lower end it is opened, all the Water in the Tube will ſubſide to an equal Superficies with the Water in the Veſſel, becauſe its higher poſition gives it an accidental Weight more than that in the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>So again, Ayr and Ayr have the ſame
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50395:11"/>Weight, though it be hardly meaſurable, but if Ayr be compreſſed as in a Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, it gains an accidental Gravity by its Compreſſion of parts more than the common Ayr.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a difference in Terms between Gravitation, and preſſure of heavy Bodies; for inſtance, A Tube ſtopt at the upper end, and driven down in a Veſſel of Water forcibly, the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Water upon the Ayr in the Tube, will contract the Ayr as much as it can (ſuppoſe it an Inch) and the reſt of the Ayr in the Tube will preſs upon the Water, becauſe it will not yield more to the Water; this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Preſſure in the Ayr upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of the Water upwards upon the Ayr; yet neither are properly Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, though poſſibly, I may in ſome paſſages uſe the words promiſcuouſly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a difference between Gravitation <hi>ad motum,</hi> which I call ſometime ſenſible or perceptible Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, and Gravitation <hi>ad pondus,</hi> which I ſometimes call real or inſenſible, or Phyſical Gravitation: For inſtance,</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50395:11"/>
               <p>If a cubical Veſſel of Water contain 56 pound weight of Water, and a piece of Cork, or parcel of Oyl of two pound weight be placed upon the top of the Water, it will not ſenſibly gravitate, but will be born up by the upper Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Water, whereunto the lower Superficies of the Cork or Oyl will be contiguous, becauſe being ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically or intrinſecally lighter than Water, it is ſuſtained by it, and makes no motion in the ſubjected Water.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Fig.</hi> I.) But yet it is plain that in concretion with the water, the whole weighs 58 pound, whereas before the water alone weighed but 56 pound; ſo that here is a gravitation <hi>ad pondus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hereunto <hi>in concreto</hi> to the water. But let us ſuppoſe that the Veſſel <hi>A, B, C, D,</hi> be filled with water unto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies <hi>C, D,</hi> and the tube <hi>E,</hi> open at both ends be immerſed into the water, and then a quantity of oyl, that is lighter ſpecifically than water, be poured upon the ſuperficies of the water; this will raiſe the water into the tube <hi>E,</hi> above the common ſuperficies of the water, to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50395:12"/>ſuch a proportion of height in the Tube as will countervail the weight of a like Cylinder of Oyl, which will be ſome. what near to the ſuperficies of the Oyl, becauſe the water at <hi>G,</hi> is not equally preſſed with the reſt of the ſuperficies of the water by the incumbent Oyl. The diſparity of the preſſure cauſing motion or elevation of the water in the part not equally preſſed; ſo it is <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatio ad motum,</hi> and not ſimply <hi>ad pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> So if upon a veſſel of water there be placed a Body ſpecifically heavier than water, but not exactly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to its ſuperficies; here is <hi>gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio ad motum,</hi> as well as <hi>ad pondus;</hi> for the body ſinking into the water muſt needs raiſe up as much water as the ſpace it ſelf takes in ſubſiding into the veſſel of water.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame account it is, if the ſubſiding body be a Fluid, as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> it will by ſinking into the water drive up as much water as the room it takes, and ſo make the ſuperficies high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo that an unequal preſſure of any Fluid muſt neceſſarily make a motion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50395:12"/>upwards of the parts of it, and thereby raiſe the ſuperficies by ſo much in bulk of water as will countervail the room that the immerſed body takes up in the water. And this and the like I call ſenſible gravitation, or gravitation <hi>ad motum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There is a difference between <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and <hi>Potentia;</hi> and this is well enough evidenced in the inſtance of the Oyl and Water above given: The oyl gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitates upon all the ſuperficies of the water, except that ſubjected to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Tube <hi>E</hi> there is the <hi>pondus</hi> of the oyl and the water driving up, and ſuſtaining the water in the Tube to that height that equiponderates a like column of oyl there is the <hi>Potentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sinclere</hi> and others, that contend for the Solution of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment by the Gravitation of the Ayr, apply this difference unto two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which poſſibly in the event of their Examination will appear otherwiſe; namely: 1. That the Ayr equally preſſing the reſtagnated Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in all places thereof, but that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50395:13"/>which is directly under the column of the ſuſpended Mercury, and thereby Equiponderating a column of Mercury only of <hi>29</hi> Inches ½ and no more, keeps it ſuſpended at that height by the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondium of both, there is the Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the column of Mercury, which is the <hi>pondus,</hi> and the Impending column of Ayr, which is the <hi>potentia ſuſtinens,</hi> that Counterpoyſeth that <hi>pondus.</hi> I ſhall have occaſion to uſe this difference of <hi>pondus</hi> and <hi>potentia,</hi> in relation to this Experiment alſo, but in a different way. 2. The other inſtance, to which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies this difference, is in all Fluids, whether Ayr, Water, Mercury, or any elſe: Namely, if a Body be in any depth of Water; ſuppoſe above it were 20 foot of Water, and below it two, three, or four Foot of Water, or more, ſubjacent to the lower Baſe of the Body. The upper column of Water is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to preſs downwards, <hi>per modum pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris,</hi> upon the upper Superficies of the Body, and the lower column of Water, contiguous to the lower Superficies of the Body, is ſuppoſed to preſs upwards,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50395:13"/>
                  <hi>per modum potentioe.</hi> And he ſuppoſeth that the preſſure of the <hi>potentia</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is alwayes equal to the preſſing of the <hi>pondus</hi> downward: This is a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition fitted principally for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating of the Solution of the Coheſion of Poliſhed Marbles, by the Gravitation and <hi>potentia</hi> of the Ayr, preſſing upwards and downwards, and ſome other inſtances, whereunto the ſingle Gravitation of Ayr down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards will not be ſufficient: The proof whereof will be conſidered hereafter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is a difference between the reſiſtence or Renitence of a Fluid, and the Gravitation or preſſure thereof: If a man ſtrikes forcibly with the flat of his hand upon the Superficies of the Water, he ſhall find near as much pain as if he ſtruck upon a Board, although the Water doth not counter-move the hand, but receives and reſiſts its ſudden force; the like occurs frequently in Ayr: The fierce ſtriking of a wand through it, bends the wand, and the fierce Colliſian of the Bullet againſt it, is not without a reſiſtence of the Ayr,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50395:14"/>though too weak to encounter it.</p>
               <p>And this Renitence or reſiſtence, without any counter-motion at all by the Water, is that which makes the Motion of the ſame heavy Body through the Water conſiderably ſlower than through the Ayr; and the ſame Weight of Led or Iron, or other heavy Body in Water, to weigh leſs upon the Scale, than when it is in Ayr, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardation of its Motion, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of its weight, being the ſame effect of the ſame Cauſe; namely, the reſiſtence of the Water, greater than in the Ayr, without relation to any counter-motion, or counter-preſſure in the Water it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is a difference between Rarefaction and Tention, and between Condenſation and Compreſſion, though the effects be much alike in both.</p>
               <p>Rarefaction, (for inſtance, of the Ayr) is the Extention of its parts, commonly by heat, or what is equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the fiery Partacles that it receives, whether from the Sun, the <hi>Aether,</hi> or common fire, or other Calefactive nature.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50395:14"/>
               <p>Tenſion, is when the parts of the Ayr are diſtended by virtue of ſome force or power that layes hold of its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, as a Lute-ſtring is under a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a greater length, by a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weight appended to it; only it hath this difference, a Lute-ſtring or the like, is not capable of Tenſion in length, but it muſt have a contraction in thickneſs, but Ayr as it hath a motion every way, ſo it is capable of Tenſion every way.</p>
               <p>The effects aſwel of Tenſion as Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance holds thereby a greater and more extended ſpace. 2. The Body, thus either by heat or force, Rarefied or Tenſed beyond its true natural ſize and ſtaple, hath a Motion of reſtitution, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurally contracting it ſelfd, and preſſing inward. 3. The Body thus contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it ſelf, by the Catholick Law of Nature, to preſerve the continuity of the World, layes hold upon the Bodies next adjacent, and conterminous to it, and as much as it can draws it inward.</p>
               <p>Again, Condenſation and Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion differ in this, that the former is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50395:15"/>commonly made by the Conſtipation of Cold; the latter, by any other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible preſſure, as in Wind-guns, Aeoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piles, and the like.</p>
               <p>They both agree in their effects. 1. That the Ayr Condenſed or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, takes up leſs room or ſpace, than its natural and due ſize. 2. That they have each a Motion of reſtitution, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding it ſelf to its juſt ſize.</p>
               <p>And this Elatory or Spring, I allow to the Ayr; namely, of retraction, and expanſion, when put out of its natural ſize or ſtaple: But the imaginary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Spring, attributed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ayr, as its natural tendency, I take to be only invention.</p>
               <p>It is hard to ſay to what proportion Ayr may be Rarefied or Tenſed; ſome think to above 70 times its common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, or to what degree it may be Condenſed or Rarefied; ſome think to ſeven, nine, or ten times, leſs then its ordinary conſiſtences, or more: <hi>Quod vide apud</hi> Morſen <hi>in pneumaticis, et aliis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. There is a difference between the common Gravitation of a Fluid of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50395:15"/>any kind, as it is a heavy Body, and the appropriate Gravitation of it as it is a Fluid Body: In reſpect of the former, it doth as all heavy Bodies, preſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly downward towards the Centre; But as it is a Fluid Body, it hath an appropriate Gravitation of its own, whereby it corrects and allayes in ſome ſort, its common Gravitation: For inſtance, Water in its own conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency, hath a lateral Motion, a Motion <hi>per declivè,</hi> an Horiſontal Motion, within the compaſs of its own Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies; yea, and a Vertical Motion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, within the compaſs of its own Superficies: As if a Tube full of Ayr, ſtopt below, be immerſed into Water, and then unſtopped, the Water will heave as freely upward as it would otherwiſe downward, till it attain its own common level or Superficies; and ſutable to its Motion is its Gravitation, which is nothing elſe but <hi>motus,</hi> or <hi>cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ad motum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And beſides this appropriate Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Fluids, there is a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and connatural Texture in Fluids,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50395:16"/>and eſpecially in Ayr, whereby the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected parts do ſuſpend, and hold up conſiderably the Superior parts from any conſiderable Gravitation, ſo that no Body, or portion of ſpace leſs than the whole Baſe of the whole Fluid is conſiderably preſſed upon by any ſuch imaginary Column Commenſurated to the Baſe of the ſubjected Fluid, as hath been elſewhere obſerved, and will be further Illuſtrated in ſome of the following Chapters.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is a common and allowable difference beween the pure Ayr, ſuch as may be in the upper Region, and that which is now commonly called the Atmoſphere. The former is ſo pure and ſubtil, that the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Ayrs Gravitation that I have ſeen, do not take upon them to to determin, that it hath any Weight.</p>
               <p>The Atmoſphere, is that portion of the Ayr that is the common receptacle of Vapours, and the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth and Water, whereby it is leſs ſubtil than the pure Ayr.</p>
               <p>Though ſome, out of the confidence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50395:16"/>they have of their attaining the juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of weight between Water and Ayr, and the juſt proportion of weight between Mercury and Water, and upon the high confidence they have of the juſt <hi>Equipondium</hi> between 29 Inches ½ of Mercury, and a Column of Atmoſphere of the ſame thickneſs with the Column of Mercury, have undertaken, to define the juſt height of the Atmoſphere; ſome determining it to be juſt 7000 Fathoms, ſome 7 Miles; yet the Doctors much differ among themſelves in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; ſome telling us, they take it to be 22 Miles high, others 50, others above 100.</p>
               <p>And there muſt needs be an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding incertainty in this way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting it. For firſt, Though the juſt proportion of weight between the Quickſilver and Water is eaſily and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly diſcovered to be truly as <hi>Merſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and others, have accounted it, <hi>viz.</hi> that one Cubick Inch of Mercury will juſt counterpoiſe 13 Cubick Inches and ½ of Water; yet the proportion of weight that Ayr bears to Water, (if it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50395:17"/>have any real weight at all,) is not to be exactly Calculated, whatſoever Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments have been made thereof by <hi>Merſennus</hi> and others; the former tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, that the weight of Water to Ayr, is as one to about 1300; the others telling us it is as one to 1000, or at leaſt ſome ſmall proportion leſs. 2. Admit the proportion were juſtly known, yet thoſe that take their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the height of the Atmoſphere, or Gravitating Ayr, (if any ſuch be) by the ſuppoſed <hi>Equipondium,</hi> between 29 Inches ½ of the ſuſpended Mercury; and a Column of Ayr commenſurate in thickneſs to ſuch a Mercurial Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, have bottomed themſelves, as I think, upon a falſe Foundation. 3. But if it were true, as they would have it, yet even upon their own principles, it is extremely miſtaken and convinced by their own ſuppoſitions and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ſhall be obſerved in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters.</p>
               <p>And thus far to render my ſelf intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in my expreſſions in the future Inquiry.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50395:17"/>
               <p>I ſhall only add ſome Matters that will be uſeful as to the point of Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>The weight of Water is various, according to ſeveral places; <hi>Stevin</hi> tells us, that in ſome parts of <hi>Holland,</hi> a Cubique Foot of Water weighs <hi>63</hi> pound; as I remember, Mr. <hi>Sinclere</hi> Computes it to <hi>56</hi> pound, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, a Cube of Water <hi>6</hi> Inches ſquare, weighs 7 pounds; and I have by tryal found, that it weighs 7 pounds wanting two Ounces; but the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of <hi>56</hi> pound and 7 pound, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſutes the proportion of weight of thoſe two Bodies: Upon tryal, I have found the proportion very little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>viz.</hi> a Cube of <hi>6</hi> Inches ſquare of Water to weigh 7 pound wanting two Ounces, and conſequently a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bical Foot to weigh 55 pound 4 Ounces.</p>
               <p>The readieſt way to avoid Fractions and the long proceſs of Arithmetical Calculations, is by immerſing any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or other Solid Body into a Veſſel full of Water, and to ſave that which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50395:18"/>is impelled over by the immerſion of the Solid Body, to diſcover the proportion of weight between ſuch a Solid, and a Fluid of the ſame Moles or Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The meaſure of a Cubique or Square Body, is by Multiplying the one ſide into the other, to find the Area of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and by Multiplying the Area by the meaſure of Inches in profundity.</p>
               <p>The meaſure of a Cylinder is by multiplying half the Diameter into half the Circumference, which yields the Area, and Multiplying the Area (of Inches) into the number of Inches, in the depth of the Cylinder: I mention theſe Figures, becauſe the moſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and uſeful in Hydroſtatiques.</p>
               <p>Mercury is thirteen times and an half and ſomewhat more heavier than the like quantity of Water, as I have found upon tryal: If it be taken four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times heavier, it will not be much out of the way, and avoids Fractions. And therefore upon that computation, if a Cube of ſix Inches Square of Water weighs ſeven pound, a like
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50395:18"/>Cube of Mercury will weigh 98 pound Averdupoiſe.</p>
               <p>The often uſe of Mercury even in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, where there is occaſion of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Superfuſion or Infuſion of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the operation, will certainly much alter its Texture, Weight, and Uſe, as I have Experimentally found.</p>
               <p>It is a matter of great difficulty to avoid the immiſſion of Ayr in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, which will much diſorder the operations.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the Gravitation of Bodyes; and firſt, concerning the Gravitation of Fluids, in relation to Fluids of the ſame kind and conſiſtence: And therein alſo, firſt of the Gravitation of Water upon water.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALL heavy Bodyes have a Phyſical Gravitation belonging to them, as the natural effect of that Gravity; for Gravitation is either Motion, or <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> which is the natural effect or action of Gravity.</p>
               <p>And yet although the parts of all continued Homogeneal heavy Bodies participate of the ſame common Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that is common to the whole <hi>continuum;</hi> Thoſe parts are impeded in their actual or ſenſible Gravitation one upon another, by the ſupport that each inferiour part gives to the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parts, as the upper parts of a Cube of Lead do not actually Gravitate upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50395:19"/>the inferior parts, becauſe the upper are Mechanically impeded by the lower, from their actual Gravitation upon them; yet every Atom thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the Gravitation of the whole upon the Scale.</p>
               <p>But if the Solid Body be not all of the ſame conſiſtence, but the lower are of a lighter or more laxe Texture, or conſiſtence than the upper, there the upper parts will not only Phyſically and really, but Mechanically and ſenſibly Gravitate upon the lower, according to the meaſure of their exceſs of weight and ſolidity above the lower, as if the upper part of a concrete Cube conſiſts of Lead, and the lower parts of Clay, in proceſs of time, at leſt the upper will crumble away and decay the lower, by their more prevalent Gravitation, and the impority of the reſiſtence and ſuſtentation of the lower.</p>
               <p>Touching the Gravitation of Fluids upon Fluids, of the ſame kind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, I ſhall premiſe ſomething; and firſt, concerning the Gravitation of Water upon Water, and then of Ayr upon Ayr.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:50395:20"/>
               <p>It ſeems clear, that the upper parts of Water do not actually or ſenſibly Gravitate or preſs upon the lower parts of Water; They do indeed Gravitate <hi>ad pondus</hi> and Phyſically upon the lower, ſo as to make the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, but they do not. Gravitate <hi>ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or ſenſibly: That which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades me hereunto is Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or Obſervation.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Fig.</hi> 2.) For Reaſon, I alledge, that if the upper parts, ſuppoſe the Cube of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>C</hi> ſhould Gravitate ſenſibly upon <hi>D,</hi> and conſequently upon <hi>E,</hi> in the Veſſel of Water <hi>A B,</hi> it muſt either be by diſplacing of <hi>D</hi> and <hi>E</hi> from their poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo <hi>C</hi> to ſubſide in the place of <hi>D,</hi> and after in the place of <hi>E,</hi> or elſe it muſt be by Compreſſing of <hi>D</hi> into a ſhallower ſpace; but it can be neither of theſe, and therefore it cannot ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or <hi>ad motum,</hi> Gravitate upon <hi>D,</hi> and conſequently upon <hi>E.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt Propoſition, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, that I know of, think of a third; It is true, it hath a Gravitation <hi>ad pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> becauſe it adds the weight of a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50395:20"/>Cube of Water to the common weight of the Water, but as to any ſenſible Gravitation, or Gravitation <hi>ad motum</hi> it is otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>As to the minor Propoſition, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of two Parts; 1. An Excluſion of the diſplacing of <hi>D:</hi> 2. An Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its compreſſion or contraction in height.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cannot remove <hi>D</hi> from the place it holds, becauſe the Cube of Water <hi>C</hi> is of equal weight and ſolidneſs with that of <hi>D;</hi> and it muſt be either a Body intrinſecally or at leaſt extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally heavier than <hi>D,</hi> that muſt make <hi>D</hi> give place to it.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that <hi>D</hi> may get out of either ſide, and ſo give way to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>C;</hi> that cannot be, for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral or Tranſverſal Column of either ſide, as ſtrongly compreſſeth <hi>D</hi> as the Cube <hi>C,</hi> becauſe each ſide is not only preſſing with its lateral preſſure againſt the ſides of <hi>D,</hi> But there impends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that lateral Column a Cube or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, of equal hèight with <hi>C,</hi> and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as hard upon it.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:50395:21"/>
               <p n="2">2. Again, if <hi>C</hi> ſhould actually and ſenſibly Gravitate upon <hi>D,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> upon <hi>E,</hi> and ſo <hi>C</hi> ſhould ſubſide, that which is driven up would poſſeſs the place of <hi>C,</hi> and then that ſhould ſubſide again, and other ſhould ſucceed in its place, and ſo the Body ſhould be in perpetual Motion, which is not only contrary to common Senſe and Experience, but to Reaſon alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, (which is but a various Explication of the firſt inſtance) it is not poſſible for a Body of equal weight (ſuch as <hi>C</hi> is to <hi>D</hi>) to impel or drive out of its place a Body of the ſame equal weight, for the reſiſtance is as ſtrong as the power that ſhould move it, which neceſſarily muſt give reſt; for if the Cube <hi>D</hi> be driven out of its place unto a higher Superficies, it muſt be driven up by a greater weight than it ſelf, otherwiſe it will never obey it, nor yield to it.</p>
               <p>Some therefore finding theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, have reſorted to the ſecond part, namely, That the Cube <hi>D</hi> is compreſt into a ſhallower conſiſtence: But this can not be neither.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50395:21"/>
               <p>Firſt, if it be compreſſed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; namely, between <hi>C</hi> and <hi>E,</hi> and alſo <hi>E</hi> between <hi>D</hi> and the Fund, then it muſt be compreſt narrower alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the reaſon before given, the lateral preſſures againſt the ſides of <hi>D</hi> muſt be as effectual as that upon the upper Baſe of <hi>D;</hi> which would make ſtrange work.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though the quality of Ayr be ſuch, as it may be capable of Compreſſion, yet Water is utterly uncapable of it; if we lay a weight of a hundred pound upon a Veſſel of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, indeed if it do not compreſs the whole Superficies of the Water entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will drive it up where it doth not preſs; but if it ſtrictly cover the whole Superficies of the Water, it will never preſs it ſhallower.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is more evident to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the lower parts of the Water are not preſſed by the upper: For firſt, If it ſhould be ſo, a Tube of Water, ſuppoſe ten Foot long, filled and cloſely ſtopped at both ends, would break the Glaſs, if it lay Horizontally,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50395:22"/>or if a reclined Tube were exactly fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet being ſet up perpendicularly, it would leave a vacancy, which it will never do, notwithſtanding the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Acceſſion of the Gravitation of Ayr to boot. Again ſecondly, Let any man try it in a Tube of Water of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length, and put in a little button of Wax, incloſing a peece of Lead to make it ſink, it will ſink to the bottom of the Water, rather with ſome little degrees of Acceleration, the lower it deſcends; which could never be, if the Water were more compact and preſt below than above.</p>
               <p>As to Experiments and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is agreed by all perſons, that have treated of Hydroſtatiques, that I know, only one excepted, That if a Solid Body, ſuppoſe of Wood, of equal weight with the like quantity of Water, be placed in Water, it will reft in all Poſitions under the Superficies of the Water, which could not poſſibly be, if the Water to wards the bottom were more compreſſed than it is towards the Superficies: This is agreed by <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:50395:22"/>the Maſter of Hydroſtatiques, in his Book, <hi>De Inſidentibus Humido;</hi> by <hi>Stevin,</hi> in his <hi>Hydroſtatical Elements,</hi> Prop. 4. By Mr. <hi>wallis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Only a late Author, in his <hi>Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Theorems,</hi> tells us, that ſuch a Solid will emerge ſo, that its upper Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies will be contiguous to the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Water; And this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, not ſo much upon his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Experience, for ought I can find, as upon this very ſuppoſition, that the Water below is more compreſſed than that above.</p>
               <p>It is a difficult matter to find any Solid by its own ſpecifical uniform weight, to be juſt equal to the weight of a bulk of Water of an equal dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to it, without application of ſome ſubſidiary ſupplyes to equal it, which poſſibly may make the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf uneffectual; yet upon the beſt tryal I could make by ſuch ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary applications, I rather find ſuch an Equiponderating Solid rather to be apt to ſubſide to the bottom, than emerge to the top.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:50395:23"/>
               <p n="2">2. Again, the next Experiment which I ſhall mention, ſhall be that of the ſame Author, in his ſeventeenth Experiment, wherein, if I underſtand him aright, he contradicts what he had delivered in his fifteenth Theorem: <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>If a Glaſs bubble with a long ſtem turned up, heated, and then the ſtem Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically ſealed and depreſſed into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by a convenient weight of Lead, and the Bubble tyed with a ſtring to the Beam of a Ballance, with ſo much weight as might counterpoiſe the Bubble, then the ſtem bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a Forcept, whereby the Water entred and half filled the Bubble, the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubſided and required an addition of a farther counterpoiſe of</hi> 4 <hi>Drams and</hi> 38 <hi>Grains, to reduce it to an</hi> Equilibrium, <hi>then the Bubble taken out, and the Water driven out of it, weighed</hi> 4 <hi>Drams and</hi> 30 <hi>Grains:</hi>
                  </q> This inſtance being given by a worthy Perſon, to prove, that Water weighs in Water: But the Author, in anſwer thereunto, clearly evinceth, that the Water in the Bubble is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the ſubjacent Water, and concludes evidently thereupon, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50395:23"/>Water weighs not in Water.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, if Water ſhould ſenſibly Gravitate upon Water, it muſt as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly Gravitate upon any Body ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in it, eſpecially if it be at the Baſe or fund of the Water: But the Experience of divers, of the agility of Fiſh of a great breadth, lying at the bottom of the Water, and infinite more, do ſufficiently evince, that the weight of the ſuperior parts of Water Gravitate not upon the inferior parts, with any ſenſible preſſure, for if it ſhould, it muſt of neceſſity Gravitate upon the interjacent Water, lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the uppermoſt Cube and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and if it ſhould do ſo, if muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably Gravitate upon the ſubjacent Body.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Non-gravitation of Water upon Water, or upon ſubjected Bodies, and the reaſons thereof,</hi> I have elſewhere examined.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Fig.</hi> 3.) An excellent Perſon, in the firſt, ſecond, and laſt Chapters of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Paradoxes,</hi> hath endevoured to prove the actual Gravitation of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50395:24"/>ſuperior parts of Water upon the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, by three inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> If in the third Figure, the Veſſel <hi>AB</hi> be filled with Water unto the Superficies <hi>c d,</hi> and then the Tube be by ſuction filled with Oyl of Turpentine (a Body ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſo much Water) be ſtopped nimbly at the top, whereby the Oyl remains ſuſpended, and then the lower open end be immerſed in the Veſſel of Water unto any depth, ſuppoſe <hi>H,</hi> and then the Finger be removed from <hi>G,</hi> the Superſicies of the Tube, the Oyl will be kept up to ſuch a height as may counterpoiſe the like Column of Water in the Veſſel; and if it be immerſed lower, the Oyl will riſe in the Cube conſiderably higher, and if it be lifted up higher, nearer to the Superficies of the Water, the Oyl will ſubſide lower, and diſcharge part of it ſelf into the Water, becauſe then the like Column of Water in the Veſſel grows ſhorter, and hath a leſs counterpoiſe to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Oyl in the Tube, which he concludes to be a concludent evidence of the various degrees of Gravitation
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50395:24"/>of the Water upon the various imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Superficies thereof. The ſecond inſtance is like it, namely, That if the ſame Veſſel were filled with Oyl to the Superficies <hi>C D,</hi> and the Tube <hi>g</hi> filled three or four Inches with Water by ſuction, and the upper end <hi>g</hi> nimbly ſtopt with the Finger, and then the lower end <hi>H</hi> immerſed in the Oyl, the deeper it is immerſed, the higher the Superficies of the Water in the Tube will remain ſuſtained, and the nearer it is brought to the Superficies, the lower it will ſubſide, by reaſon of the various degrees of Gravitation of the Oyl in ſeveral imaginary Superficies; though at the higheſt elevation of the Tube of Oyl, in the firſt inſtance, the Oyl, in reſpect of its leſs Gravity than Water, will ſit ſome what higher in the Tube than the Superficies of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Water in the Tube, in the ſecond inſtance, will ſit lower than the Superficies of the Oyl, becauſe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, quantity for quantity in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Gravity. 3. The third is that of the valve, which deeply immerſed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50395:25"/>in Water, the cover of the value will be ſuſtained by the Gravitation of the Water, with a conſiderable weight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended to it.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems to me, that theſe Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments concludes nothing to this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; but only evidence a reſiſtence of the Water to that Body which will raiſe its Superficies. For it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that there is required a preſſure, or force, to raiſe the Body of Water to a higher Superficies, exceeding the weight of ſo much Water as is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled higher than before, or at leaſt equal to it.</p>
               <p>Now the preſſing down of the Tube of Oyl into the Water, or the Tube of Water into the Oyl, raiſeth the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Water or Oyl ſo much as the Tube is impreſſed into the Water, namely, a quantity of Oyl or Water in the Veſſel, equal to the Body impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and immerſed in it, is raiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and put out of its former place, which it contents againſt, by a Reni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence reſiſtence, or contrary preſſure; and as the leſs of the Tube is immerſed,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50395:25"/>the leſs Liquor in the Veſſel is moved up; ſo the more of that Body is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed, the more is preſſed up, and conſequently, the greater preſſure is made upon the Water, the lower it is immerſed; becauſe it takes up more room in the Water, and a greater force is thereby exerciſed, to the elevation of a greater quantity of Water; and that Water, the more it is, hath the more accidental weight, or rather, reſiſtence, againſt that force which thus raiſeth it up above its common ſuperficies, which before it obtained.</p>
               <p>And that this is the true reaſon of it, and not the various Gravitations of the ſuperior parts upon the inferior, ſeems evident by this one inſtance, which becauſe it will be uſeful hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, upon other occaſions, I ſhall here inſert more largely, though the thing be commonly known.</p>
               <p>I filled a Tube of Lead of ſix Inches Diameter, and four Foot deep, and cloſe at the bottom with Water; And took a Porringer of Pewter, five Inches Diameter, and about two Inches deep,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50395:26"/>and filled it with leaden Shot, and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Water into it, to fill up the chinks, and making four holes, I ſuſpended it with a Packthrid, like the Diſh of a pair of Scales, and exactly weighing it, and the Shot, Thred, and Water, it weighed all exactly 78 Ounces, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ⅛ of an Ounce; then ſuſpending the Diſh with a Packthrid, to the end of the beam, I ſet it down 40 Inches deep into the Water, below its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, and it loſt its weight, by the reſiſtance and craſſitude of the <hi>medium, viz.</hi> the Water <hi>9</hi> Ounces ½ of its weight in Ayr; and ſo weighed 68 Ounces, and near about ½ of an Ounce; and juſt the ſame weight it held, when raiſed 15 Inches, when raiſed 28 Inches, though it was then within 12 Inches of the Superficies; but at laſt, when I raiſed it 12 Inches higher, ſo that the Superficies of the weight was equal with it, and yet it loſt not above ⅛ of an Ounce; which I decrement, was, as I think, becauſe poſſibly the four ſtrings that ſuſtained it were not now under Water.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:50395:26"/>
               <p>What then is the reaſon why, when the Tube of Oyl or Water is ſunk lower, the preſſure of the Water is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal? and why in this inſtance, the weight of the Diſh is no more charged with the weight of the Water, at 40 Inches, than when juſt even with the Superficies of the Water: I ſay it is not the Gravitation of the ſuperior parts of the Water upon the inferior, for then my weight of 5 Inches Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter could never keep the ſame weight at 40 Inches depth of Water, at 12 Inches depth, and juſt at the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies; but the true reaſon is, becauſe in the weight of the Porringer and Shot, being the ſame bulk at 40 Inches deep, as at the very Superficies, drives up no more Water out of its place at one ſtation, than another; namely, a bulk commenſurate to the bulk of the Porringer, Shot, and included Water, which is the ſame, both at the fund of the Tube, and when its Superficies is contiguous to the Superficies of the Water: But in the inſtances of the Tube, if it were ſuppreſſed an Inch
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50395:27"/>Diameter, when it is immerſed an Inch its <hi>potentia,</hi> lifts up but a part of Water commenſurate to that Inch; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſiſtence, or Renitence between the Tube, and the Water, is but little; but when it is immerſed ten Inches, there is ten times more Water driven up, and therefore the Renitence is the greater, and impels the Liquor included in the Tube the higher; But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns nothing the weight of Water in its quiet conſiſtence: His other Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, in order to the proof of the Gravitation of Water upon Water, I ſhall conſider in the fifth Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the Gravitation of the Ayr upon Ayr, or any ſubjected Bodies in it.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Queſtion in hand concernes not Ayr put out of its ordinary texture, but touching the free Ayr, wherein Men and Animals live and breath.</p>
               <p>And now to ſtate this Queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we muſt conſider, 1. What the Queſtion is not, and 2. What the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Queſtion is not whether Ayr compreſſed and thruſt together, hath a weight in it that may put it into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Gravitation upon other Ayr, either not compreſſed at all, or leſs compreſſed; for it ſeems very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Experiments of theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Men, <hi>Merſennus, Shottus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> and others, that have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto tryals, in order to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50395:28"/>that ſuch a Gravitation may and doth happen by the compreſſion of Ayr in AEolipiles and Wind-guns, that ſuch Ayr may have a pretty evident prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to ſo much free and common Ayr.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is it the Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there may not be, or are not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſions of Vapours <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> or other <hi>Moleculoe</hi> even in the free and common Ayr, that conſidered in themſelves, have a preponderation even to the Ayr it ſelf; for although the ſtrict intermingling, interweaving, and contiguation of ſome Vapours and <hi>Effluvia,</hi> groſſer and weightyer than the Ayr it ſelf, may enable the Ayr to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain and bear up many of theſe groſſer Bodies, (as Water oftentimes ſuſtains minute Bodies, or Gravels of Sand ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically heavier than the Water) yet we every day ſee, that if theſe portions of interſperſed Vapours or <hi>Effluvia,</hi> grow too heavy for the Ayr to ſuſtain them, they are precipitated out of it, and diſcharge themſelves upon the Earth, as we ſee in Hail, Snow, Rain,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50395:28"/>and Miſts. 3. Neither is the Queſtion, whether a portion of the free Ayr, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and disjoyned from all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the foreign Ayr, hath any Gravitation or no, for it ſeems to me, that it may have, by ſuch a ſeparation an actual Gravitation, which is not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it acquires any new quality or acceſſion of weight, than it had before, but by reaſon of ſuch ſeparation it doth <hi>Removere prohibens</hi> of its actual Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; namely, the contignation that it hath with the common Ayr, into and with which it was in continuity, it was interwoven, and that little inconſiderable Gravitation that it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſimply conſidered hath, is overmatched and broken by thoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veining Filaments of the reſt of the Ayr, with which it is in continuity.</p>
               <p>And therefore I do think, that if Ayr of the ſame conſiſtence with the Ayr we live in, were freely let into a Bladder, which we will <hi>per impoſibile</hi> ſuppoſe to be deſtitute of all weight, ſuch a Bladder of Ayr, thus filled, (though without the help of <hi>inflation,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:50395:29"/>by our <hi>longes,</hi> which muſt needs carry with it ſome fuliginous Ingredients;) I ſay, ſuch a Bladder of Ayr would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the ſame common Ayr out of which it was taken, and would Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the Ballance, more than the like quantity of free and open Ayr incumbent upon the other Ballance.</p>
               <p>Nay farther I dare adventure to ſay, That if we could ſuppoſe a Tube, open at both ends, ſo long, as to reach from the top of the Atmoſphere, unto this Earth, ſuch an included portion of Ayr, ſevered from communion with the Atmoſphere, would have ſome Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more conſiderable perchance, than we have ever felt from the open Ayr.</p>
               <p>For I do much attribute the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all ſenſible Gravitation of the free Ayr, to that mutual interweaving of the Filaments of Ayr one into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like a vaſt Net, with ſmall Maſhes or <hi>interſtitia,</hi> filled gradually with parts more and more ſubtil; and this contig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſuſtains and keeps the parts of it from that ſeparation, that otherwiſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50395:29"/>the interpoſition of a groſſer body would intercept: And although Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in reſpect of its weight and texture, be more ſubject to disjoyn from the reſt of its body, than Ayr is, we ſhall find in the next Chapter ſomewhat Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to this, even in a conſiſtent Body of Water.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither is it the Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even the free Ayr it ſelf may have ſome intrinſique Gravity, though ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably little and inconſiderable; for if we do ſuppoſe the compreſſion of divers Particles of Ayr may render that compreſſed Body of Ayr ſenſibly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, we may not wholly exclude thoſe Particles from all kind of Gravity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compreſſion, for no weighty Body can ariſe from the coalition of ſuch parts as had no manner of Gravity before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay, yet farther, the Queſtion is not, whether as the free Ayr hath ſome intrinſique Gravitation; ſo neither is it the Queſtion, whether this free Ayr hath not ſome, though very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable meaſure of actual Gravitation;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50395:30"/>it is not impoſſible but it may have ſome, though ſcarce perceptible to ſenſe, notwithſtanding all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpertions and mixtures of Vapours and <hi>Effluvia</hi> from the Earth and Water.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is, whether the free and common Ayr, wherein we live, which is commonly called At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, extending upwards about ſeven Miles or more, hath any ſenſible actual Gravitation upon the lower World. 2. Admit it have, whether any determinate portion of that Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, as a Column or inverted Cone, for the purpoſe, of ſix Inches ſquare at the Baſe, hath any actual Gravitation upon the ſubjected Baſe, upon which it is ſuppoſed to reſt. 3. Admit it hath, whether that Gravitation be of any conſiderable, and of what moment.</p>
               <p>Before I come to diſcuſs the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelves, it will be neceſſary to repeat ſomewhat that I have before ſaid, touching the proportion of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, that is alloted to a portion of, for inſtance of ſix Inches ſquare of the Atmoſphere, when it pertingeth near to the Superficies of the Earth.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50395:30"/>
               <p>A Cube of Water, ſix Inches ſquare, contains 216 ſquare Inches, and upon the exact Calculation of thoſe that have tryed it, weighs juſt ſeven Pounds, and a Cube of twelve Inches ſquare of Water weighs 56 Pounds.</p>
               <p>A Cube of Quickſilver weighs four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times as much as the like quantity of Water, though <hi>Merſennus,</hi> and ſome others, nearer to the truth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to be thirteen and ½; but I will make my Calculation by fourteen, to avoid Fractions.</p>
               <p>The conſequence whereof will be, that a Cube of ſix Inches ſquare of Mercury, will weigh 98 Pounds, which is fourteen times as much as the like Cube of Water.</p>
               <p>The conſequence whereof is, that fourteen ſuch Tubes of Mercury weighs 1372 pound.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, the Mercury is ſuſtained to the height of 29 Inches ½; to avoid Fractions, let us reckon it 30 Inches, be the Column never ſo large.</p>
               <p>If the Column of Mercury be ſix
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50395:31"/>Inches ſquare at the Baſe, then there will be five ſuch ſquare Cubes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in that Column will weigh 490 Pounds: According to the late Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, this Column of Mercury is counterpoiſed with a Column of the Atmoſphere of ſix Inches ſquare, and extending from the reſtagnant Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the upper ſurface of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere.</p>
               <p>And conſequently, this Column of Ayr or Atmoſphere, doth actually gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate with a weight of 490 Pounds, upon the reſtagnant Mercury, and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and actually weighs as much as that comes to; and conſequently, when I hold a Trencher in my hand of ſix In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſquare, there is incumbent upon it 490 Pound weight of Ayr, though there be found a help in that caſe to ſupport it, by the recoyling Column of Ayr, commenſurate to it; whereof in its due place.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſuppoſition I contend againſt in this paper, <hi>viz.</hi> that 1. The whole Body of the Atmoſphere hath no conſiderable Gravitation either upon its
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50395:31"/>own parts, or upon the ſubjected Body of the Terreſtrial Globe, much leſs ſuch a prodigious Gravitation as is here ſuppoſed. 2. If it had, yet any given portion or Column of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, hath no ſuch Gravitation.</p>
               <p>Touching the Gravitation of the whole Atmoſphere in general, upon the Terreſtrial Globe entirely, I ſhall not ſay much, becauſe it is not capable of Experiment, only my reaſon and ſenſe ſuggeſts it to me, that it is neither evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nor likely to be of ſo vaſt a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation as the late Philoſophers affirm.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I confeſs I am none of thoſe Adepts in Philoſophy, that can tell us how to ſolve all the effects in Nature, without recourſe to the infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, and Goodneſs of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, who certainly knew better how to frame the World, and fix the Laws of Nature, than the wiſeſt of Men or Angels. I muſt confeſs, I know not how to reſolve the reaſon of the Motion of weighty Bodies downward nor why or how either the Sun holds his regular Motion, if the Hypotheſis
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50395:32"/>of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> be true, or why the Earth, as other Planetary Bodies, holds its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Motion, if the Syſteme of <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> and <hi>Galilaeus,</hi> be true, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch inſtances; but into the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſpoſition and ordination of the Moſt Wiſe, Powerful, and Soveraign Lord and Maker of the World, who hath fixed the Order and Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by his Soveraign <hi>Fiat,</hi> with the moſt exact accommodation of it to the concerns of the Univerſe, and all the parts thereof, and with moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Congruity. This Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Architect, that hath made all the parts of this <hi>Mundus aſpect abilis</hi> in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Weight, and Meaſure, and deſigned the Earth and Ayr, for the habitation and uſe of Men, and all other breathing Animals, and likewiſe for Vegetables, hath ſo ordered and digeſted the texture of the Ayr, that the inferior part is more groſs than the ſuperior, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for nouriſhment and reſpiration; the upper parts more ſubtil, and pure, and light, and deſtined to other uſes, hath ballanced the Ayr, ſo that the more
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50395:32"/>light and ſubtil parts are inclinable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, more to aſcend; and the lower parts gradually more laden with Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of a groſſer allay, and ſo poſſibly thereby inclinable to ſubſide; and he hath connected the more ſubtile, and the more Feculent parts thereof, ſo together, that they hold an <hi>Equilibrium</hi> as a ſtate and poſture more ſerviceable to the ends and uſes he deſigned for it, and for which they ſerve: The procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Soveraign Architect in the Frame of this great Building of the Univerſe, not being like to the Architecture of men, who begin at the bottom; but he began at the Roof, and Builded downwards, and in that proceſs, ſuſpended the inferior parts of the World upon the ſuperior. But this kind of reaſoning, I know, is not grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the palate of the preſent Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; I therefore proceed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Therefore I ſay, that the common appearances of the World, ſo far as they are obvious to our common ſenſes, contradicts this immenſe, nay, or any conſiderable Gravitation of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50395:33"/>Atmoſphere upon ſubjected Bodies; It is hardly conceptible, how Birds could raiſe themſelves upon their wings, and keep themſelves in free Ayr, if a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then perchance of above 1000 pound weight ſhould lie upon their Wings and Bodies; it were not poſſible for me to breath, to walk, to ſtand upon my Feet, if at every time I open my Mouth, a Column of Ayr of three hundred pounds weight were preſſing into it, it would tare open the valves of my <hi>Larinx,</hi> and blow up my Stomach and Intrals, like a Bladder, and break my Ribs, if it had an admiſſion; and if it had not the circumjacent preſſure of the Ayr, would preſs me to death: Theſe and the like inſtances render this prodigious Gravitation of the Ayr incredible to us vulgar Souls, that are apt to creditour ſenſes.</p>
               <p>But I very well know, that theſe will be ſaid to be vulgar common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that they have many hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Solutions of theſe common diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p>And it is true, I very well know,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50395:33"/>they have colourable Solutions for thoſe ſenſible occurrences, as the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed counterpoiſe of included Ayr, and of the recoyling Columns of Ayr; which I ſhall in due time conſider.</p>
               <p>But I do reply, that though theſe common inſtances perchance amount not to demonſtrations of the untruth of the Hypotheſis, yet they do require a very great and very clear evidence to encounter even thoſe vulgar experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therefore, if any Solutions offred of them, are not perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent, but ſtrained, and the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they give in their favour, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any other Solution, than this which is ſo viſibly and apparently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our ſenſe; ſuch Solutions and ſuch inſtances are too weak and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to build ſuch uncouth concluſions upon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Therefore I ſay, there is not any one inſtance or experiment, that ever I yet heard of, for the evincing of this imaginary Gravitation of the free Ayr, but is readily capable of a more ſutable Solution more adequately
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50395:34"/>fitted to the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> and leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with difficulties than this new Solution, by the Gravitation and Elatory of the Ayr. I ſhall refer my ſelf herein to Mr. <hi>Linus</hi> his Tract <hi>De In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperabilitate Corporum:</hi> And <hi>Honoraly Fabri,</hi> in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of his late <hi>Philoſophical Conferences,</hi> wherein all the inſtances given from the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Engin, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ayr Pump, and particularly the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and much more ſatisfactory and naturally ſolved, without recourſe to this imaginary Weight or Spring of Ayr.</p>
               <p>And there are above an hundred Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of this kind and nature, which can never by this ſolution be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated (without intolerable torture of them) ſome inſtances whereof we ſhall in due time remember.</p>
               <p>But omitting more that may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in general to the common Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the Ayr; I ſhall more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and cloſely apply my ſelf to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>2. Therefore, admitting it were
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50395:34"/>poſſible to ſuppoſe the whole Body of the Atmoſphere might Gravitate upon the Earth in general, yet no one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular portion of the free and common Ayr, impending upon any one determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Superficies, can at all or at leaſt can ſenſibly or conſiderably Gravitate upon any determinate <hi>Baſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon ſeems to me to be this, becauſe although we ſhould admit a conſiderable Gravity of a portion of Ayr taken, divided and ſeparated as one intire ſeparate Groſs Body (as in a Bladder, a Glaſs Bubble, or the like) ſo that it partakes of the common quality of heavy Bodies, yet there is a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar preſſure or Gravitation belonging to this ſubtile Fluid Body, which hath its lines of direction every way within the compaſs of its own extream Superficies, whereby that perpendicular Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is common to all Bodies, is corrected, abated, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſuſpended. 2. Becauſe that if there were no ſuch allay given to its common perpendicular Gravitation, by its proper Motion or Gravitation of its
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50395:35"/>own; yet the Ayr being one continued Body, and ſo interwoven and mortaiſed as it were, one part in another, the other parts of the Ayr that are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous every where to the Earth, do ſuſtain and bear it up, like the ſides of an Arch, from any ſenſible preſſure or Gravitation upon any determinate or particular Body, that is within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of its preſſure; as I have elſewhere inforced the Argument in relation to the Gravitation of Water upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Bodies, narrower than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Baſe that ſupports ſuch Water.</p>
               <p>And although the Ayr hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingling with it of Vapours and Terreſtrial and Aqueous <hi>Efftuvia</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than it ſelf; yet they are ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in the very Webb and texture of the Ayr, that it ſupports many of them, and thoſe that are too heavy for it, or much diſunited and ſeparate from it, are precipitated upon the Superficies of the Earth, and the Ayr diſcharged of them, as in Rain, Snow, Hail, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding Gravel Sand, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although the inſtance that I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50395:35"/>am now giving, is more proper for the next Section, yet it is in ſome kind ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the explication of what I intend.</p>
               <p>Of all hands it is agreed, that the Water, though a Fluid Body, is, ſome ſay, thirteen hundred times heavier than the like portion of Ayr; others, that it is a thouſand times heavier; they that ſpeak leaſt, ſay it is above nine hundred times heavier than Ayr: And it is obvious to any that attends it, that there is not the ſame ſtrict Coheſion of one part of Water with another, as is of one part of Ayr with another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs divided by a more firm and ſtable Body then it ſelf: And therefore there is far more reaſon, that one part or Column of Water in its conſiſtency ſhould Gravitate upon a ſubjected Body, than there is, that a Column of Ayr ſhould in the free and open Ayr, Gravitate upon a body ſubjected to it; And yet it will be found, that in <hi>libera aqua,</hi> that Gravitation that it exerciſeth upon a Body ſubjected to it, and capable of it, is not above one half ſo much
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50395:36"/>as the weight of ſuch a Column of Water, divided and ſeparated from the common conſiſtent Water.</p>
               <p>It is true, I had not ſo dextrous a Meſſenger, to make the Experiment in the bottom of the Sea, or 20 Fathom within Water, as <hi>Dromo</hi> is Poetically related to have done, though I believe he never made that tryal: But I will give an account of what I have tryed and found.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Fig.</hi> 4) I took a Glaſs Siphan of a quarter of an Inch Diameter, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger legg 32 Inches, the ſhorter 8. Inches long, open at both ends.</p>
               <p>I filled the ſhort legg with Mercury, which accordingly as it muſt, roſe to 8 Inches high in the longer legg; and then ſtopping the ſhorter legg with my Finger to avoid any violent preſſure by the fall of the Water upon the Mercury, I then filled the longer legg to the top with Water, and gently removing my Finger from the ſhorter legg, to avoid too violent an Exſilition of the Mercury, I found the Mercury to ſubſide in the longer legg two Inches and a quarter,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50395:36"/>and as much driven out of the ſhorter legg, by the acceſſion of the weight of 24 Inches of Water in the longer legg, (which I confeſs is ſomewhat leſs than the proportion of weight between Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Mercury; wherein, according to an exact calculation, 28 inches of Water counterpoiſeth 2 Inches of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. But then emptying the Water and Mercury out of the Tube, I again filled up the Tube with Mercury, to 8 Inches in both leggs, namely to the top of the ſhort legg.</p>
               <p>And then filling a glaſs Tube, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Inches diameter, and 32 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches long, with Water, I immerſed the Syphon with the Quick-filver to the bottom of the greater Tube full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And although the column of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the great Tube, impending upon the orifice of the ſhorter legg, was full 24 Inches, yet it drew down the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in the ſhort legg, and raiſed it in the longer legg, empty of Water, only one Inch, and no more, whereby it did riſe in the longer legg to 9 Inches, and ſubſided in the ſhorter to 7 Inches,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50395:37"/>as I could eaſily perceive through the great Tube, by a Scale of Inches, and quarters, fitted to each leg of the Syphon.</p>
               <p>I then tried it doubly, <hi>viz.</hi> pouring in the Water into the longer legg of the the Syphon, whereby the ſubjacent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury ſubſided in the longer legg two Inches, and as much thereof driven out of the ſhorter legg, and then immerſed the Syphon into a glaſs-veſſel, 32 Inches deep, filled with Water; the Mercury thereupon ſubſided in the ſhort legg ſomewhat neer an Inch, and no more, and accordingly impelled up the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury and incumbent Water in the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger legg neer an Inch: whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that there was no <hi>AEquipondium</hi> between the pillar of Water included in the Tube, and the imaginary pillar of Water in the open veſſel.</p>
               <p>And in this experiment I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the orifice of the ſhorter legg of the Tube, and the legg it ſelf, was of ſomewhat a larger diameter than the longer legg; and that might give ſome advantage to the preſſure of the Water in the veſſel upon the ſhorter
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50395:37"/>legg. But notwithſtanding that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the gravitation of the external Water, or any imaginary column there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was not half ſo much as the gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cylinder of Water included in the Tube; which is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the miſtake of thoſe that aſſign an equal preſſure to an imaginary column of free Air or Water, with an equal column of Air or Water that entirely preſſeth upon the Mercury, and hath no other circumjacent baſe to lean upon.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted, that although, as I have ſaid, a Cylinder of two Inches of Mercury doth really counterpoiſe a Cylinder of 28 Inches of Water, of the ſame diameter, yet in this inſtance of the Syphon, 24 Inches of Water drew down two Inches of Mercury, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as much out of the ſhorter legg. And the reaſon ſeems to be, becauſe the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury being <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> was more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a ſenſible preſſure by a leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water in this <hi>libra naturalis,</hi> than it would be, if both were weighed in their groſs conſiſtence in an artiſicial Scale.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50395:38"/>
               <p>And the reaſons why the preſſure through the Tube, is ſtronger than the preſſure by the open veſſel of Water, are theſe: 1. Becauſe in the Tube the Water included had no communion with any open or free Water, nor had any ſuſtentation thereby, but in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water there is a communication and mutual ſuſtentation of one part by another. 2. And principally becauſe when in the Tube the Water had no other Baſe but the Mercury, to which it was commenſurate, and therefore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly, and entirely, and adequatly preſſed it. But the Water in the veſſel had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baſe circumjacent to it, namely the bottom of the veſſel, from which it was built like an Arch over the ſhort legg of the Mercury, whereby the weight, preſſing upon the Mercury, was broken, abated, and intercepted. For Water will find the loweſt Baſe for its reſt.</p>
               <p>And ſurely if this be true in Water, as upon more than one tryal I found it, it will be much more ſo in the open Air, which will much diſorder the whole <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50395:38"/>of the Gravitation of the Air, and thoſe very ſubtle and fine Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are ſpun out of it, and built upon it.</p>
               <p>But I would not be miſtaken, as if I meant that the Column of 24 Inches of free Water did gravitate upon the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the ſhorter legg of the Syphon, to the weight of neer an Inch of Mercury, for That is wholly contrary to my Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: but only I hereby ſhew the great diſproportion of the appearing Gravitation of Water, where it hath no lower nor other Baſe upon which it leans, but only the body of the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and where it hath another or lower Baſe upon which it leans.</p>
               <p>For in this inſtance of the Syphon, there is another reaſon of the Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the free Water upon the cavity of the ſhorter legg of the Syphon: for here the preſſing or keeping down of the body of the Syphon into the free Water, diſplaceth and raiſeth up a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Water anſwerable to the bulk of the whole convex Superficies of the Syphon, which is far greater than its
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50395:39"/>cavity, and that Water ſo diplaced doth indeed preſs upon the Tube that diſplaceth it; and becauſe it can find no part yeilding to its preſſure but the orifice of the ſhorter Tube, it preſſeth there in ſuch proportion, as the whole bulk of the Water ſo lifted up by the immerſion of the Syphon, bears to about an Inch of included Mercury, and 24 Inches of the Water included in the Tube. But of this more diſtinctly and exactly, when I come to examin the reaſon of the Valve.</p>
               <p>2. But having thus offered my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt this prodigious Gravitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the imaginary Aery Cylinders, I ſhall proceed to ſome plain and home<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Experiments and Reaſons, which ſeem to me very much to encounter the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with that whereunto I am ſure they are furniſhed with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but ſuch an Anſwer as will give me the opportunity of a Reply, which poſſibly may be of more moment, than if the Experiment it ſelf were without an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Take a pair of Scales, the one Diſh of 12
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50395:39"/>Inches of diameter, the other of 3 Inches diameter, yet of that thickneſs, that it may be juſt of the ſame weight with the other, each diſh weighing for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe three Pounds. Theſe two Diſhes will yet exactly equiponderate, yet the one ſuſtains a Column of Air of above twelve times the weight of the other, yea and according to the proportion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove computed, poſſibly the greater Column impending upon the greater Diſh, may weigh above 4000l weight.</p>
               <p>But there is a common Anſwer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly fitted to this difficulty. For it is ſaid, there is a Column of Air below each Diſh, that hath a Superficies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to the lower Baſe of each Diſh, which though it be but 3 or 2 or 1 foot, nay but an Inch above the Earth, bears up each Diſh as ſtrongly as the Column of Air of 7 miles high bears them down, and ſo there is an <hi>aequipondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> between the <hi>pondus deprimens</hi> upon the upper ſide of the Scale, and the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientia ſuſtinens</hi> of the lower ſide, and the Pillar of a Foot of length, between the Earth and the greater Scale, is of a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50395:40"/>Foot diameter, and ſuſtains it as forcibly as the <hi>pondus deprimens</hi> of a Foot diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depreſſeth it, and ſo it is ſupported by an equal force impelling it upward, as it is depreſſed by the weight of Air incumbent upon it. And the caſe is the ſame with the leſſer Scale, and ſo the greater Scale, though it hath a greater weight than the leſſer impendent upon it; ſo it is recompenſed with a more forcible power than the leſs hath to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain it, and ſo there is an <hi>aequipondium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although this ſeems marvellous, that the <hi>potentia</hi> of a Pillar of Air from the Earth to the Baſe of the Scale ſhould counterpoiſe ſo vaſt a weight, as what is incumbent upon it, yet to ſerve the turn, and to give a Solution by the weight and power of the Air to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the coheſion of two poliſhed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles (<hi>de quo infra</hi>) this reaſon is given, that as there is a vaſt weight of Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere upon the Scale, ſo there is the ſame Gravitation of Air round about it all, but what is juſt under the Scale; and this impending Air round about the ſides of the Scale, as it is ſo much, ſo it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50395:40"/>is ſomewhat weightier than that which impends upon the Scale; for this reaches only to the Scale, and that reacheth ſomewhat farther in length, even by ſo much as the diſtance is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Earth and the Scale; and this doth ſo gird and help in that ſhort Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Air ſubjacent to the Scale, that it is as firm a Pedeſtal or <hi>potentia</hi> to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the Scale, and to preſs it up by the auxiliary Columns of Air, that ſupply and ſupport it, as the impending Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn is to depreſs it, and ſo between both there is an <hi>aequipondium.</hi> So that in all caſes, as well in Air as Water, the ſubjected Column ſuſtaining and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling upwards, and the <hi>potentia</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is of equal force to the <hi>pondus</hi> of the ſuperior Column, depreſſing the upper Superficies of the intermediate Body.</p>
               <p>And the ſame they ſuppoſe in Water, the inſtances whereof is the Valve, and ſome other inſtances; but of theſe in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>And now upon this Suppoſition of the <hi>potentia ſuſtinens</hi> of the recoiling Pillar, as I may call it, ſuſtaining and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50395:41"/>up the lower Superſicies of the body, they have raiſed moſt marvellous Paradoxes and Conſequences, namely, that if a Milſtone were by ſome art ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the Air, if it were poſſible that the Pillar of Air incumbent upon it were either wholly taken away, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all Gravitation, this Milſtone would be ſuſtained by the ſubjected Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Air, and poſſibly carried up much higher, yea, and if a long Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Braſs were let down deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough into the Ocean, they aſſign a depth, at which the Column of Braſs would ſink no lower, but be ſuſtained by that marvellous <hi>potentia</hi> of the recoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſubjected Column of Water: things that I confeſs are wittily dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and conſequential enough upon their <hi>poſtulata</hi> admitted, but ſuch as are warily enough propounded, becauſe impoſſible to be tried.</p>
               <p>But in anſwer to this Queſtion like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I ſay this will be found untrue, and therefore although the Conſequences are Logically enough inferred upon ſuch premiſes; yet the thing proving
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50395:41"/>falſe in the event, the Premiſes, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and <hi>Poſtulat a</hi> themſelves muſt needs be fictitious and vain.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe therefore two ſmall Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Braſs, each of 41 weight, but the one of two Inches diameter, the other of one Inch diameter, and therefore about double the length of the other, were weighed in a veſſel of Water by a pair of Scales, with the Superficies of each juſt even with the Superficies of the Water in the veſſel, they will each loſe a juſt equal portion of their weight by the thickneſs of the <hi>medium,</hi> and will ſtill hold their <hi>aequipondium,</hi> yet the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry column of Air impending upon the two Inches Cylinder above treble the weight to that impending upon the one Inch diameter, and here is no recoiling Column of Air to ſuſtain them.</p>
               <p>But I eaſily foreſee the Anſwer to this Inſtance, and therefore I gave it to let in what I have to ſay; for it will be ſaid, that the Gravitation of the Air upon the reſidue of the Water, gives a greater concrete weight to the Water, by ſo much as the Column of Air, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50395:42"/>to the Superficies of the Water, adds to it, and ſo both Air and Water make one common preſſure, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the recoiling or ſuſtaining Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Water, hath as great a <hi>potentia ſustinens</hi> as the weight of both put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can contribute. But to avoid this <hi>Effugium,</hi> ſirſt I took two Braſs Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, weighing each four pound, but one of double the others diameter, I took then two Laton-Tubes of 6 Inches dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, and about two foot in length, cloſed at both ends, only in the centre of the cloſe Cover of the one I cauſed a hole to be made, commenſurate to the Superficies of the Cylinder of Braſs of 2 inches diam. &amp; a like hole in the other, commenſurate to the cylinder of Braſs, of 1 Inch diameter, ſo that they might juſt play upon them without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtance between the weights, and the concavity of the holes. I then filled the veſſels brim full of water, &amp; weighed the Cylinders with their Superficies juſt equal with the Water and Cover. Here could be no Gravitation of the Air upon any part of the Water, but only upon
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50395:42"/>the Weights, ſo that the Column of Air, preſſing upon the greater Weight, being, as is ſuppoſed, above treble to what preſſeth upon the leſs, muſt needs drive it down, becauſe the recoyling Pillar of Water, could not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſuch a diſparity of <hi>pondus</hi> of Air.</p>
               <p>And yet I found not above one Grain odds in their Weights, the broader weighing about a thin Groat more than the narrower.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I would have no evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by ſuppoſing that that ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Weights and the Hole, might give ſome more help and ſtrength to the ſuſtaining Pillar of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by letting in ſome Air to lean upon the Water, thereby to enable it to keep the <hi>Equipondium.</hi> I took a very flat peece of Lead, with a hole in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, no bigger than would let through Freely that ſmall Packthrid that ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Weight, and letting the Thrid through the hole, and preſſing the Lead ſo exactly cloſe, that no Air can paſs to preſs upon the Water and Weight, but juſt that little paſſage for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50395:43"/>the Thrid which impended alſo in the very middle of the Weight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by covering the Orifice, fitted to the one Inch weight; yet the <hi>Equipondium</hi> between both, continued exactly the ſame, as when both holes were left open, one of two Inches, the other of one Inch Diameter, at both times, the Veſſels being perfectly full of Water.</p>
               <p>And yet according to the ſuppoſition, the ſuppoſed Weight of the Pillar of Atmoſphere impendent upon the two Inch Weight, could not be ſo little as 200 pound, and the weight of Air, preſſing upon the Centre of the leſſer Weight, and no where elſe, being not a quarter of an Inch Diameter, could not in proportion, weigh the 100<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of 200 pound, according to the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this new Philoſophy: And all this while the entire Superficies of the Water, diſcharged of all manner of Gravitation of ſuperior Air, by the cloſe cover that every where covered its Superſicies.</p>
               <p>I do not underſtand what evaſion can be made, unleſs they will ſuppoſe that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50395:43"/>the little hole for the Thrid, might by a ſtrange Contagion, infect the entire Body of Water, with a new Gravitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which nevertheleſs is ſo impoſſible, that it deſerves no other anſwer than what our common ſenſe allows; for this little pertuſe, letting in that little Column of Ayr of a quarter of an Inch Diameter, impends not upon the Water, but is wholly received by the Braſs Weights, upon whoſe Centres it leans.</p>
               <p>So that the imaginary repercuſſive Column bearing up the Body into an Equilibrium, with the impendent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Air (admitting the Air ſhould have ſuch a Gravitation downward) muſt needs be a fiction upon a fiction, and therefore upon the whole matter laid together, both are fictions, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet farther, if ſuch a preſſure upward of the inferior, or (as I have called it) the recoyling Column of Air ſhould be admitted, it doth wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſuppoſition of Gravitation of the ſuperior Column of Air, becauſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50395:44"/>in truth it renders the ſuperior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Columns of Air in a perfect <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium,</hi> every lower portion of Air checking and counterpreſſing the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, with the ſame ſtrength or <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ſuſtinens,</hi> that the ſuperior portion chargeth the inferior with a <hi>pondus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(<hi>Fig.</hi> 5.) For ſuppoſe in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure <hi>A B</hi> were a Cylinder or Column of Air, reaching from <hi>A</hi> the Superſicies of the Atmoſphere, to <hi>B</hi> the Superficies of the Earth, and of 12 Inches diameter. If the portion <hi>B E F</hi> preſs with an equal <hi>potentia</hi> upward to the portion <hi>A E F,</hi> preſſing with an equal weight down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; then theſe two portions of Air muſt be at reſt, and <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> and ſo far every diviſible part of every other portion of the entire Column. And if the ſuperior and inferior parts of the Air be by this means <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> there can be no more Gravitation downward than upward; for all motion muſt ariſe from a diſparity of weight and weight, or power and power, or power and weight. And therefore it is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50395:44"/> one Scale be charged with a hundred pounds weight, and the other Scale be charged with as much, the Scales will be at reſt, becauſe <hi>in aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio;</hi> and by the advantage though but of a Grain of weight, added to one Scale, they will be put into motion, but not 'till then.</p>
               <p>But then it will be required to make out that, upon the Suppoſition, that in our firſt Inſtance the greater Scale is kept <hi>in aequilibrio</hi> by the <hi>pondus</hi> of the ſuperior, and the <hi>potentia</hi> of the inferior Air; that there will be the ſame <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium</hi> between the <hi>pondus A E F,</hi> and the <hi>potentia E F B,</hi> upon or in every ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Superficies of the Column of the Atmoſphere; as <hi>E F C D,</hi> or any other imaginary ſuperficient, interja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent between the top of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere <hi>A,</hi> and the Superficies of the Earth at <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſurely there need not be much pains taken to prove this: for it is not the interpoſition of the Scale that makes the <hi>aequilibrium,</hi> but it is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreſſure of the ſuperior and inferior
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50395:45"/>part of the aerial Cylinder, which muſt needs be as effectual, and of the ſame kind and ſtrength, if that Scale were removed out of the way; for though the interpoſition of the Scale hinder the contiguity of the upper and lower Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder, yet it contributes nothing to the Gravitation of the one, or preſſure upward of the other.</p>
               <p>Upon all which large digreſſion, it ſeems to me that their very anſwer given, that the equal Gravitation of each Scale, the greater and the leſſer, is by the equal preſſure, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon the greater Scale as it is preſſed by a greater aerial Cylinder, is alſo ſupported by a reverſed or recoiling Cylinder of Air of equal ſuſtaining force, though not of equal length with the ſuperior, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys totally their whole Suppoſition of the Gravitation of the Air, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their contrivance of the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the weight of the Atmoſphere, by the <hi>aequipondium</hi> thereof, to a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of 29 Inches of Mercury, utterly ineffectual.</p>
               <p>And this it ſeems to me muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50395:45"/>namely that the inferior Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Air recoiling and returning from the Earth, or any other ſolid Baſe, doth in truth ſuſtain the impending <hi>pondus</hi> of the ſame Cylinder, and ſo there is an <hi>aequipondium</hi> in any given or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Superficies of Air between the <hi>pondus deprimens</hi> and the <hi>potentia ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens,</hi> in the ſame perpendicular Pillar or Column: and ſo the Air becomes not heavy in it ſelf, but yet that it gravitates entirely upon the Baſe, which is as it were the common <hi>hypomoclian</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the impreſſion of the impendent Air, and remits the <hi>potentia</hi> upward in counterpoiſe to it.</p>
               <p>But then they ſay, that where in that Pillar of Atmoſphere the Contiguity between the ſuperior and inferior Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn is interrupted by ſome interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient body: as in the firſt inſtance, by the intervention of the Scale the <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondium</hi> between the <hi>pondus deprimens,</hi> and the <hi>potentia ſuſtinens</hi> of the aerial Pillar, is wrought by another means, namely the imaginary Pillars of Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere circumjacent to that intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50395:46"/>body: as ſuppoſe the three Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of Atmoſphere <hi>A M B N C O,</hi> and the Column <hi>B</hi> were cut off at <hi>D</hi> by any ſolid body (ſuppoſe the Scales, in the firſt inſtance;) yet the two adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Columns gravitate upon the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Pillar of Air (ſuppoſe it tranſverſe,) and ſo give it as vigorous a repercuſſion as if it were in the ſame perpendicular Column: as in the figure,</p>
               <p>Suppoſe <hi>B H</hi> be a Column of Air, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the cube <hi>H,</hi> of ſix Inches ſquare; <hi>H</hi> to be (for inſtance) a cube of Braſs, ſome way there ſuſtained; <hi>E N</hi> be the ſubjected Column of the ſame baſe, reſting upon the Superficies of the Earth at N. Suppoſe alſo <hi>A D m,</hi> and <hi>C F o,</hi> be two lateral Columns of Air, preſſing <hi>g</hi> upon a lateral or tranſverſal Pedeſtal of Air <hi>G I K L,</hi> upon an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Superficies, contiguous to the lower Baſe of the cube H, namely <hi>G D F I;</hi> here the Cylinders <hi>H D</hi> and <hi>C F</hi> preſs ſo ſtrongly upon the entire tranſverſal Baſe <hi>G D E F G K L M N O,</hi> that the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof <hi>E N</hi> is ſo ſtrongly bound together, compreſſed, and fortified by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50395:46"/>the columns <hi>A D</hi> and <hi>C F,</hi> that it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains the cube <hi>H</hi> as forcibly as it would have ſuſtained <hi>B H</hi> an entire Column of Air, and ſo makes an <hi>aequipondium</hi> and ſuſtentation of the cube <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(<hi>Fig. 6.</hi>) To examine the truth of this Suppoſition, let us ſuppoſe in this, <hi>A</hi> to be the baſe of the cube <hi>B C D,</hi> and <hi>E</hi> to be the baſes of four Pillars or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of Air, contiguous to the four ſides of this cube, equal in Baſe to it, and all theſe Baſes, both of the cube <hi>A</hi> and of the four collateral Pillars of Air, to be upon the Superficies of the Earth. If <hi>A</hi> be removed higher, as to <hi>H</hi> in the former figure, the intermediate ſpace between <hi>H</hi> (in the former figure) and the Superficies of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpace <hi>H N,</hi> muſt be furniſhed with Air; now the Air, that muſt ſupply that ſpace, cannot be immediately thruſt in from the Pillar ſuperior to the cube, <hi>viz. H B,</hi> becauſe the deſcent of that Pillar of Air is obſtructed by the interpoſition of the cube <hi>H,</hi> whereupon it is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed. Therefore of neceſſity each of the collateral Pillars of Air, <hi>B C D E,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:50395:47"/>muſt thruſt in an equal portion of their ſtock of Air, to ſupply the <hi>interſtitium</hi> of <hi>H n</hi> in the former figure; and then they will want ſo much of their Pillar, as will make good what they have thus contributed to fill that ſpace. And this they are to borrow from the Pillar <hi>H B,</hi> that lay perpendicular to the cube, which now at this Elevation is <hi>B H:</hi> for as the cube it gradually raiſeth from <hi>N</hi> towards <hi>H,</hi> the Pillar of Air incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon it muſt be diſplaced, and what is ſo diſplaced, muſt be thruſt into the lateral Pillars <hi>B C D E,</hi> to ſupply what they contribute to the relicted ſpace <hi>H N:</hi> and ſo in every Elevation higher of the cube <hi>H,</hi> ſo much ſpace as it leaves, muſt be immediately thruſt in from the collateral Pillars adjacent to the Tube, and muſt be made good in the ſame moment from the Air, thruſt out of the perpendicular Pillar <hi>B H,</hi> by the gradual Elevation of the cube to ſupply the collateral Pillars. By this proceſs of one part of the Air into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to accommodate the motion of its parts, it ſeems evident, that there is not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50395:47"/>that preſſure of one part of the Air upon another, nor of all upon the common Baſe, that ſhould be like ſo many Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to keep every portion of Air juſt in that place it hath; or by Gravitation of one part upon another, to keep all the parts ſo tight one to another, as the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> imports. For then certainly there could be no motion or tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of one part of the Air into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we ſee there is not only in the Inſtance above given, but in a thouſand more. The moſt forcible Winds could no more remove one portion of Air out of its place, then they could remove a Pyramid of <hi>Memphis,</hi> if this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were true.</p>
               <p>Therefore there ſeems to be very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ground for the late Maſters of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, to lay any weight of proof for their ſuppoſed Gravitation of the Air, upon the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment; which, by what I have ſaid, and ſhall hereafter ſay more at large, depends upon a clear other Solution.</p>
               <p>And thus far in general, touching the Gravitation of Air in Air, or upon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50395:48"/>any other Bodies; wherein I have been the longer, becauſe I ſhall perchance hereafter have recourſe to ſome of the things ſaid in this Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the Gravitation of heavier Fluids upon thoſe that are lighter.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere be thoſe that contend, that there is no Body poſitively light, but only comparatively; and that the Aſcenſion of any Bodies is not from the intrinſick nature or quality of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies themſelves, but becauſe others that are more heavy than thoſe are, and more vigorous in their deſcent, do drive up thoſe that are leſs heavy, by taking their places, and ſo force them to mount higher.</p>
               <p>Whatever may be ſaid in this reſpect, in relation to Air, yet ſurely it holds true in other groſſer Fluids, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ſolid Bodies alſo: Oyl is truly heavy, and yet driven higher by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50395:48"/>which is ordinarily heavier than Oyl. And the ſame is true in relation to Water and Mercury, the latter dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up the former though a heavy Body, becauſe not ſo heavy as Mercury. As I have before ſaid, there is a double Diſparity or <hi>aequipondium</hi> of heavy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; one in relation to their intrinſick of ſpecifical weight, another in relation to the external or quantitative weight. Water is ſpecifically heavier than Oyl, and Mercury than Water; whence it comes to paſs, that a bulk of Mercury weighs more than a bulk of Water equal to the bulk of Mercury; one ſquare Inch of Mercury, counterpoiſing neer 14 ſquare Inches of Water. But yet the bulk or quantity of Water may be ſo much, or ſo great, that it may overpoiſe the Mercury, two ounces of Water ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily being more, and weighing double to an ounce of Mercury, though ſpecifically heavier than Water.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the conſideration of the gravitation of heavy Fluids upon lighter, we are to take theſe two parts into conſideration. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:50395:49"/>
               <p n="1">1. The Gravitation of a Body, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically heavier, upon or in a Body ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically lighter; as the Gravitation of Mercury upon Water, or Water upon Oyl or Air.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Gravitation of a Body ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically lighter, yet in quantity or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically heavier than the Fluid it preſſeth; as two pound of Oyl upon a pound of Water, and the like.</p>
               <p>As to the former of theſe, there ſeem to be four ways, wherein the Gravitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or preſſure of a Fluid upon a Fluid, ſpecifically lighter, ſenſibly is exerciſed. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. By way of Penetration, 2. by way of perpendicular, or other deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Depreſſion, 3. by way of lateral Preſſure, 4. by way of Elevation of the lighter Body.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, if a cube of 12 Inches ſquare be filled 9 Inches with Oyl, and the other three be filled up with Water; though for the preſent the Water gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poured on will flote upon the Oyl, yet in a little time it will penetrate through it, and get under it, and the 9 Inches of Oyl will ſwim upon it, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50395:49"/>its Superficies equally every where.</p>
               <p>And ſo if a <hi>lumen</hi> be at the bottom of the cube, the Water firſt, and then the Oyl, will gravitate upon the Air, and preſs through it.</p>
               <p>But if the top of the cube be cloſely covered, ſo that Air cannot get in above the Water, the Oyl will not deſcend through the <hi>lumen,</hi> the reaſon whereof is hereafter explained.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, it is very plain, that the heavier Fluid will in ſome Inſtances preſs upon all the lighter, by a depreſſion where it can have way; ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, ſometimes mediately, <hi>viz.</hi> notwitſtanding the interpoſition of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other body. For inſtance,</p>
               <p>If an empty Bottle or Glaſs-bubble be placed in a veſſel of Water, at a ſmall depth, the Air included in the Bottle or Bubble, being a Body lighter than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will mount up to the top, if it be not kept down: for a ſmall preſſure of Water, though it preſs upon the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Air as much as it can, yet it cannot compreſs the Air ſo much, as to drive into it a quantity of Water, that may
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50395:50"/>make the Bottle and included Water equal in weight, or more in weight than the like bulk of ſimple Water; but if more Water be poured into the veſſel, whereby a weight of Water incumbent upon the narrow mouth of the Bottle or Bubble, is ſufficient to compreſs the included Air, to ſuch a contraction, as may admit Water enough to make the Bottle, with the admitted Water, to counterpoiſe more than a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſimple Water, the Bottle or Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will ſubſide, and ſink to the bottom again; if the veſſel be unladen conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of its Water, whereby the Air included in the veſſel being under a leſs preſſure, can expand it ſelf to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dimenſion, and thereby thruſt out of the Bottle ſo much of the included Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as may render the Bottle, with the included Water, lighter than a like quantity or bulk of ſimple Water, equal to the bulk of the Bottle, the Bottle will emerge again.</p>
               <p>This is the Experiment mentioned by <hi>Shottus,</hi> in his <hi>Magia hydraulica, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te 3, l. 5, problem. 3.</hi> and the excellent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50395:50"/>Author of <hi>Hydroſtatical Paradoxes, pag.</hi> 16, 53, 153. and elſewhere. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment is certainly true, but the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution thereof, and the Concluſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from it, of the Gravitation of the upper parts of the Water upon the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is as I think wholly miſtaken; for the reaſon of it is not from the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gravitation of Water upon Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but of Water upon Air, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lighter body than Water, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of compreſſion into a narrower compaſs, by the Gravitation of Water upon it, ſuſtains that weight of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and is compreſſed by it, and under it: it is not an effect of Gravitation of Water upon Water, which is of equal intrinſick or Specifical Gravity, but of Water upon Air, which is a lighter Fluid, and compreſſible. Again, this Gravitation of heavier Fluids upon lighter, though not immediately conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, is plain by this inſtance.</p>
               <p>If a Cylindrical veſſel of Water be of <hi>6</hi> Inches diameter, and there be a rundle of Wood ſpecifically lighter than Water of five Inches ¾ diameter
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50395:51"/>placed at the very bottom of it, the Water will drive it up to the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of it, becauſe it is a Body ſpecifically lighter than the Water. But if there be a hole of five Inches diameter in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of that veſſel, and the Rundle be placed upon that hole, ſo that it ſome-what overlaps the hole, ſo that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot paſs out of it, and then it be filled up with Water; the Rundle will gravitate upon that hole, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Cylinder of Water, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate in Baſe to that Rundle, ſo hard and cloſe, that it requires a weight in a pair of Scales, neer commenſurate to the weight of the impending Cylinder of Water, to raiſe it from the bottom; and the reaſon is, becauſe the Rundle being the <hi>Operculnm</hi> of that hole, through which the Water ſhould paſs into the lighter Fluid, the Air, and ſo is the impediment of the Waters paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, it gravitates upon it, becauſe it hath mediately a lighter Element upon which it gravitates, namely the Air. It is <hi>Stevinus</hi> his Experiment, in his <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Hydroſtaticks,</hi> upon his 10. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:50395:51"/>
               <p>And upon the ſame reaſon it is, that if a Glaſs-bottle filled with Sea-water, and ſtopped, be let down twenty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms into the Sea, it will not break, for it is filled with a Fluid of an equal weight, and ſo the external Water doth not ſenſibly gravitate upon it, for it hath within a ſufficient power to reſiſt the external preſſure. But if it be full only of Air, and ſtopt, and let down as deep by a weight appended to it, (as it muſt) it will be broken by the preſſure and weight of the Water immediately upon the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Air, which is lighter than ſo much Water, and ſo it preſſeth upon it, to drive it up, and cruſheth the glaſs into it.</p>
               <p>And this I take to be one reaſon, though not the only reaſon of the Experiment of the Valve, and likewiſe of Oyl thruſting up Water into a Tube, though of a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically heavier conſiſtence; and poſſibly may contribute ſomething to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the fourth Chapter, whereby a Syphon filled up with Mercury to the hight of the ſhorter leg, and immerſed in Water, the Mercury in the ſhorter legg will ſubſide a little, and aſcend in the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50395:52"/>leg, although the Mercury be a Body 14 times heavier than Water; for in theſe inſtances, though the immediate contiguity be of the heavier Body to the lighter, as Oyl to Water, and Water to Mercury, yet in as much as the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in both leggs is in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> and the Air is behind the Mercury in the longer legg of the Syphon, and behind the Water in the Tube, the Water in the one caſe, and the Oyl in the orther, doth in truth gravitate upon that Air mediately and effectively, rather than upon the intermediate heavier. Fluid, eſpecially if the body of the Air be any whit lower than the Superficies of the Water.</p>
               <p>And thus far touching the Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or preſſure of a Fluid ſpecifically heavier, upon a Fluid ſpecifically lighter. I ſhould now come to conſider the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a Fluid ſpecifically lighter, yet with an exceſs of extrinſick or quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive weight upon a Fluid ſpecifically heavier; as two pound of Water upon a pound of Mercury, or two pound of Oyl upon a pound of Water: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50395:52"/>this and ſome other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the better clearing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contained in this Chapter, may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the next, I ſhall remit it thither.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the Preſsure or Gravitation of lighter Fluids, upon thoſe that are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically heavier.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is certain, that every Body, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the fluid, or ſolid, incumbent upon another, though that Other be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times intrinſically and alſo extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically heavier than the incumbent Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth gravitate and preſs upon it.</p>
               <p>And therefore if we ſhould ſuppoſe the Air to have a weight, but a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times leſs than the like portion of Water, a portion of one ſquare foot of Air incumbent upon the Ocean, would have ſome preſſure upon it: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the Problem that paſſed in the Affirmative among Freſh-men in the Univerſity, <hi>That if a Horſe had as much as he could carry, the addition of the weight of the thouſandth part of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50395:53"/>would break his back.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not the preſſure or Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I am ſpeaking of, but ſuch a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation or preſſure, as would put the ſubjected heavier Fluid into a ſenſible motion, or change of place or ſituation.</p>
               <p>In a pair of artificial Scales, a pound of Feathers or Water, will equiponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a pound of Gold or Mercury, and 2 pound of Feathers will preponderate a pound of Gold or Mercury, not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great diſparity of their intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick weight.</p>
               <p>And ſo in a Ballance that ſeems more natural, if a Syphon of half an Inch dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, with one legg of ſix Inches long, and the other of thirty four Inches long, or more, be filled with Mercury to the height of the ſhorter legg, and then ſtopping the Orifice of the ſhorter legg with the finger, fill the longer legg with water, and then opening the Orifice of the ſhorter legg, the Water in the longer legg, though ſpecifically lighter than the Mercury, will drive out the Mercury out of the Syphon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the extrinſick or quantitative
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50395:53"/>weight of ſo much Water exceeds the extrinſick or quantitative weight of the ſubjacent Mercury.</p>
               <p>If a cubick veſſel be filled ſix Inches high with Water, and a Glaſs-pipe open at both ends be immerſed at one end in the Water, and then ſuperinfuſe gently (to avoid diſturbance) ſo much Oyl as will fill it up ten Inches, <hi>viz.</hi> four In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Oyl, and ſix of Water, the Pipe will be filled with Water neer to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of the Superficies of the Oyl, but not quite level to the Superficies of the Oyl, it will want ſo much, as the like quantity of Water in the Pipe, is heavier than the like quantity of Oyl.</p>
               <p>But if a Pipe filled with Oyl, and the upper end ſtopt with a finger, whereby the Oyl remains ſuſpended in the Tube, or Pipe, and then the open end be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in the Water, the Oyl, while it obtains a Superficies in the Pipe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably higher than the Water in the veſſel, will ſubſide 'till it come to ſuch an Elevation above the Superficies of the Water, as is proportionable to the degree of ſpecifical Lightneſs that it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50395:54"/>obtains more than the like quantity of Water. And 'till then it ſubſides into the Water, becauſe it hath a greater proportion of accidental weight by its ſo great Elevation above the Superſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Water: for the Elevation of one fluid body above another, gives the greater ſtrength and ſwifter motion to its deſcent: whereby though a ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter body, it conquers the reſiſtance of the Water of a lower Superficies.</p>
               <p>Which is the reaſon, why a Tube of Water, four foot high, caſts out more Water in the ſame portion of time, through the ſame <hi>lumen,</hi> than a veſſel of the ſame diameter, and but two foot high, as I ſhall hereafter more at large obſerve.</p>
               <p>And this is the reaſon, why if a ſmall Glaſs-Tube of ſix Inches long, be filled with Water, and the upper end being ſtopped with the finger, whereby the Water is ſuſpended in the Pipe, and then the lower end being immerſed in a veſſel of Water ſix foot deep, and then the upper end unſtopped, the whole Water in the Pipe will empty it ſelf,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50395:54"/>'till it attain a Superficies equal with the Water in the veſſel, and will not be kept ſuſpended in the Pipe by the reſiſtance of the Water in the veſſel, becauſe if it obtain never ſo little more height in the Pipe than in the veſſel, it hath a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force to preſs downward, than the Water in the veſſel hath ſtrength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it.</p>
               <p>If a Tube ſtopt at one end be filled with Mercury, and inverted in the open Air, the Air will aſcend and terebrate through the Mercury as faſt as that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends; ſo there is a kind of preſſure of the Air <hi>aſcendendo</hi> upon the Mercury, and thereby both the Air and Mercury obtain their ſeveral natural motions, this <hi>deſcendendo,</hi> and that <hi>aſcendendo,</hi> whereby Vacuity is prevented, and the continuity of the parts of the Univerſe preſerved.</p>
               <p>But if the Tube be very ſmall, ſo that the Air cannot make its way through the lower orifice, to gratifie the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with a deſcent, by that means the Mercury will remain ſuſpended in the ſmall Tube, and will not deſcend. The
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50395:55"/>like will happen, if ſuch a ſmall Tube be inverted into Water, the ſmallneſs of the orifice not admitting the aſcent of the Water to ſupply the ſpace derelicted by a deſcent of the Mercury, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury by force of the Catholick law of Nature will remain ſuſpended, and its natural deſcent will be thereby ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded.</p>
               <p>So that the preſſure or Gravitation of a lighter Body upon a more groſs and weighty, will be occaſioned, 1. Either by the Exceſs of the quantity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick weight of the Fluid ſpecifically lighter, or 2. by the advantage of its Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or Elevation above the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the groſſer Fluid, or 3. by the interpoſition of that common law of Nature, <hi>ut evitetur vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude theſe general Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, touching the Gravitation of Fluids, with that of the Valve, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Excellent Author of <hi>Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Paradoxes, cap. ultimo,</hi> which was certainly a moſt ingenuous Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though I am not at all ſatisfied with the Solution he gives of it, nor the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50395:55"/>Conſequences deduced by him from it, touching the Gravitation of Water upon Water, (I mean ſenſible Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) of the ſuperior parts upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior parts of the Water in free water.</p>
               <p>And I am as much diſſatisfied with that obſcure Solution that is given thereof by the Learned Author of the <hi>Enchiridion Metaphyſicum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe in this one Experiment duly obſerved and improved, many of the moſt abſtruſe Concluſions of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtaticks may be cleared even to ſenſe, I ſhall diſtinctly examine it, and the <hi>phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> appearing in it.</p>
               <p>The Inſtrument is thus made, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that form which I made uſe of.</p>
               <p>I took a hollow Tube of Laton, cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſodered at the Sides and joynts, of 39 Inches long, two Inches ½ in the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter from the top to the bottom, with a Braſs Valve at the end of it ſodered to it, and a braſs Sucker or Cover of the ſame faſhion with thoſe uſed in Pumps, only in Pumps the Cover or Sucker hath its head upward, in this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the head is downward, whereby
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50395:56"/>it being inverted it falls out about an Inch below the Valve, but cannot fall out more, becauſe ſtayed by the Frame of the Valve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> 7. This Sucker exactly covers the mouth of the Valve, that no water can come in, when the Sucker is cloſely ſtrained up, by a ſtring faſtned to it in the inward pin of it, and ſo conveyed up through the Tubes. The Sucker thus faſtned to the Valve or Box, and the Box ſoder'd cloſe to the Tube, and the ſtring conveyed up through the Tube to the open end of it, the Engin is formed according to the Figure in the Margin, repreſenting <hi>A</hi> the Tube, <hi>B</hi> the String, <hi>C</hi> the brazen Box of the Valve ſoder'd to the Tube, <hi>D</hi> the Sucker or Cover of the Valve let down as low as it will go, with a Hook to hold any weight appended to it; which Sucker being ſtrained up with the ſtring, cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtops the lower orifice of the Tube, and Box of the Valve.</p>
               <p>The Valve thus prepared, I ſtrictly weighed the whole Valve, Tube, Sucker, and Thrid, with the wooden
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50395:56"/>Nut upon which to roll the ſtring, which weighed in all three pounds, two ounces and a half, or 50 ounces and a half.</p>
               <p>The Sucker (for ſo I ſhall call the name of the Valve) weighed ſeven oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and one half: and I was curious in weighing theſe things, becauſe the great uſe of my Experiments conſiſted in the compariſon of weights of the Inſtruments themſelves, and the Water.</p>
               <p>I took then a great glaſs Tube, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five Inches diameter, and about two foot and a half long, and filled it with Water; though I uſed alſo a Leaden veſſel of ſix Inches diameter, and four foot long, for the immerſion of my Valve, which though it were deeper, yet the Glaſs veſſel was more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to my uſe, and ſerved as well, and therefore I uſed it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made thoſe ſeveral Trials.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Fig.</hi> 8.) 1. The Tube let into the Water, with the Valve open, would freely ſubſide to the bottom of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be it never ſo deep, the water get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up into the cavity of the Tube: for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50395:57"/>the <hi>moles</hi> of the Tube in that inſtance, is no more than the length and thickneſs of the Laton, the Braſs Valve and Sucker; but the weight thereof being more than ſuch a ſingle <hi>moles</hi> of water, it muſt neceſſarily ſubſide to the bottom of the water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Valve being drawn up, and ſuſtained by the Thrid wound about the wooden Nut at the top of the Valve, whereby no water could come into the Tube, and then left freely to ſubſide in the water, would ſubſide to a depth of one and twenty Inches, and ſo ſwim erect in that depth of water, one and twenty Inches being immerſed in the water, and eighteen Inches of the Tube being in the open Air, above the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the water.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe though the Laton and Braſs be ſpecifically hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than Water, and therefore will ſink, as in the laſt Inſtance; yet becauſe now the Tube ſits upon the water, as one entire Cylinder, and a Cylinder of Laton thirty nine Inches long, and two Inches ½ broad filled with Air only, is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50395:57"/>not heavier than a Cylinder of Water of one and twenty Inches long, and two Inches ½ diameter, but do equiponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; therefore the Tube ſinks no lower than one and twenty Inches to make an <hi>aequipondium</hi> between it ſelf and the like bulk of Water.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I therefore with all the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I could, meaſured the weight of the Water commenſurate to a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of two Inches ½ diameter, and one and twenty Inches long, (the quantity of the Tube ſwimming in the Water.)</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore filling my Glaſs Tube very full of Water, I immerſed the Valve open into one and twenty Inches deep; then at that depth lifting up the Sucker, and incloſing the one and twenty Inches of Water thus impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in the Tube, and ſo taking it out cloſed; and then when out of the Glaſs Tube ſetting it to run into a veſſel weighed before, I find the weight of the included Water weighed fourty and ſeven Ounces and half, or three pound wanting half an Ounce, which is about three Ounces leſs than the weight of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50395:58"/>the whole Inſtrument. And this abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it hath for the thickneſs of the Tube and Valve, becauſe the water that is preſſed upon by the Tube and Valve, and ſo raiſed out of its place, is preſſed up by the convex or outſide of the Tube and Valve, and commenſurate to it.</p>
               <p>Therefore again ſtraining up the ſtring of the Valve, whereby no water could get in, and filling my Glaſs Tube of reſtagnant water to the very brim or brink of the Glaſs, and then I immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Tube into the water to one and twenty Inches depth; the Valve ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up by the ſtring, and preſerved the water that was impelled up by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion, and thrown over: and this I likewiſe exactly weighed, and found to weigh near upon the point of fifty one Ounces ½, or three pound three Ounces and half, which is about an Ounce more than the weight of the Engine; which diſparity might happen for want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs. But the ſumme of it is, there is no conſiderable difference between the weight of the whole Engine, and the weight of ſo much Water, as will
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50395:58"/>countervail in quantity to ſo much of the Engine or mingled Cylinder of 21 Inches thereof immerſed in water.</p>
               <p>Which gives us a plain account, why and how much a Body lighter than the like quantity of water, will ſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove water, and why, and how it comes to paſs, that ſome Ships draw more water than others, and how much bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then they will bear, before they will ſink, <hi>viz.</hi> if the Ship or Barge with all its Cavities and Lading, be not heavier than ſuch a ſolid bulk of water, as equals the whole <hi>Moles</hi> and Cavity of the Ship or Barge, the Barge will live, though it draw water neer to the very top of the ſides of the veſſel. And if the Ship or veſſel be lighter than ſuch a <hi>moles</hi> of water as equals the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of the Ship or Barge, ſo much of the Ship or Barge will emerge above the water. For in the inſtance in hand, in as much as 21 Inches of immerſion of the Tube, was the product of its whole weight of three pound, two Ounces and half; and thoſe one and twenty Inches thus immerſed, were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50395:59"/>equal in weight to a bulk of Water, commenſurate to that Cylinder of 21 Inches immerſed, the reſt of the Tube <hi>viz.</hi> 18 Inches, did flote erect upon the Water; for if it ſhould have ſubſided, the <hi>moles</hi> of Water lifted up out of its place would have exceeded the weight of the whole Valve, <hi>viz.</hi> three pound, two Ounces, and half, which by the rules and Laws of <hi>Hydroſtaticks</hi> it may not do,</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Sucker be drawn up, and then immerſed ſo low, that the portion of Water impelled up by the Tube, do exceed the weight of the Sucker, <hi>viz.</hi> 7 ounces and half, the Sucker will be ſuſtained by the preſſure of the Water upon it: as ſuppoſe in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Figure it were preſſed even to <hi>L M,</hi> or <hi>N O,</hi> which is nine Inches below the Superficies of the Water. And the reaſon is, becauſe the Sucker is now the moveable Baſis of the included Column of Air, which is a light Body, and ſo gravitates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the Water; and the Sucker being as it were the Baſis of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, and moveable, weighs but ſeven
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50395:59"/>Ounces and half, and the Tube ſubſiding as low as <hi>L M</hi> or <hi>N O,</hi> preſſeth up a portion of Water of double that weight, and this portion of Water bears againſt the Baſe or Sucker more forcibly and powerfully than the Sucker can bear againſt it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if the weight of a <hi>moles</hi> of Water, commenſurate to ſo much of the Tube as is immerſed in the Water, be leſs than the weight of the Sucker, the Sucker by its own weight will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, notwithſtanding its immerſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water.</p>
               <p>By iterated Trials I found, that if I kept up the Sucker by the Thrid, and immerſed it to ten Inches, or more, and let go the ſtring, whereby the Sucker, though now at liberty, would yet not ſubſide, but remain ſuſpended by the preſſure of the Water upon it; yet if I gently raiſed it up, 'till it came only to an immerſion of four Inches and half, the Sucker would ſubſide; wherefore cloſing in the included Water at that depth, by lifting up the Thrid, and ſo cloſing the Sucker, I weighed that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50395:60"/>Water, and found it juſt weighed as much as the Sucker, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeven Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and half, and there could be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable odds here by the thickneſs of the Tube, the immerſed portion thereof being butſmall, and the ſides very thin.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But becauſe I would purſue the proportion to the uttermoſt, I kept up the Sucker with the ſtring, 'till the Tube came to the immerſion of four Inches and half, and then ſubſided; I then incloſed that four Inches and half of Water, and kept up the Sucker, and immerſed the Tube with the incloſed four Inches and half of Water, and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſing it up, it ſubſided at nine Inches immerſion.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is the ſame as before, for the included cavity of nine Inches, had in it four Inches and half of Air, which weighed nothing, and four In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and half of Water, which as before is ſhewn, weighs ſeven Ounces and half, and the weight of the Valve which weighs alſo ſeven Ounces and half, the whole weight of the included Air, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Valve, weighing only fifteen
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50395:60"/>Ounces, and a Column of Water of nine Inches high, and two Inches and half broad, equal to the cavity of the immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed nine Inches of the Tube, would have been of the ſame weight with the four Inches and half of included Water; and the Sucker, whoſe weight is now to make good the uppermoſt four Inches and half of Airy ſpace, and ſo there is and <hi>aequipondium</hi> between the included four Inches and half of included Water, together with the weight of the Sucker to a Cylinder of Water of nine Inches long, and two Inches and half broad, commenſurate to the like cavity of the Tube, and the like quantity of nine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Water, impelled out of its place by nine Inches of the Tube immerſed below the Superficies of the Water.</p>
               <p>And the ſame rule and proportion will hold upon the like quantity of more Water taken in, and a deeper immerſion, allowing the ſame thing for that thickneſs of the ſides of the Tube, which upon a deep immerſion is more conſiderable than upon an immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of four Inches and half.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:50395:61"/>
               <p n="7">7. And although I did not make an actual trial how much weight in an empty Tube, deeply immerſed, would be ſuſtained by the Sucker without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding; yet by this proportion it is eaſie to be calculated, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Tube be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept empty, and immerſed to any depth below four Inches and a half, the Sucker will ſuſtain without ſubſiding ſuch a weight, as is equal to a portion of Water commenſurate in bulk to ſo much of that empty Cylinder in the Tube, as is depreſſed below the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the veſſel of reſtagnant water.</p>
               <p>So that if the empty Tube will ſuſtain ſeven Ounces and half (the weight of the Sucker,) at four Inches and half im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion, it will ſuſtain fifteen Ounces at nine Inches immerſion, thirty Ounces at eighteen Inches immerſion, ſixty Ounces at thirty ſix Inches of immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for an empty Cylinder of thirty ſix Inches long and two Inches and half broad, will contain a Cylinder of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſixty Ounces weight, allowing ſomewhat as before, for the thickneſs of the ſides of the Tube.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:50395:61"/>
               <p n="8">8. In this it appears that the Water doth not gravitate upon the Water, but gravitates upon a Body lighter than it ſelf, though this Gravitation be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon a Body as heavy or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than it ſelf. When there is nothing but Air in the Tube, the Sucker is the moveable Baſis of that Air, and it gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitates immediately upon the Sucker, but mediately and remotely upon the Air above it, when there is a little co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Air in the top of the Tube, and below the Superficies of the Water, and under that a column of Water, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Sucker. If the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete be lighter than ſo much Water, it gravitates upon the Sucker, Water, and Air, becauſe though the Braſs be ſpecifically heavier than Water, and the Water over it ſpecifically of an equal weight with Water; yet the quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or extrinſick weight of both is leſs than the weight of ſo much Water as is equal to a Bulk or Cylinder of Water, entirely commenſurate to the quantity of the Air, Water, and Sucker, below the Superficies of the Water.</p>

               <p n="9">9. That when a Body lighter than ſo much water is within the compaſs of the Superficies of the body of reſtagnant water, the water preſſeth upon it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, impelling it up, as here upon an immerſion of the Valve laden with four Inches and half of water, and likewiſe with the weight of the Sucker, into nine Inches of water, an equal quantity of water to the <hi>moles</hi> of the immerſed Tube, <hi>viz.</hi> nine Inches ſuſtains the Sucker, notwithſtanding its own weight and the weight of four Inches and half of water incumbent upon it, becauſe thoſe two weigh but fifteen Ounces, and nine Inches of the exterior water weighs as much, and ſo there is an <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondium</hi> between the <hi>potentia ſustinens,</hi> and the <hi>pondus deprimens.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>HAving gone through the two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Conſiderations, prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to this Inquiry, I now come to the third General, namely what it is that fills the ſpace derelicted by the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Mercury in the Tube. And firſt I ſhall conſider, whether it be a Space purely void of any Body. 2. If it hath ſome Body that fills that Space, I ſhall conſider what it is not that fills it. 3. I ſhall conſider what it is that moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably may be thought to fill it.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore I ſay it is not Nothing, or a pure Vacuity, but it is ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal ſubſtance that ſucceeds in the head of the Tube, derelicted by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</p>
               <p>And here 1. I ſhall not enter into
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50395:63"/>any large debate touching the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or impoſſibility of interſperſed or coacervated vacuities in any parts of the Univerſe; neither 2. ſhall I inſiſt upon thoſe obſcure evidences of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence of a Body in that derelicted ſpace; as namely the communication of Sounds, or the reception of Light, or tranſmiſſion of Colours, or other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>ſpecies</hi> in or from it. But 3. I ſhall ground my Concluſion from thoſe more ſenſible and apparent <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which do evince it; namely, thoſe ſenſible plain Effects in that ſeeming empty Space, which could never be produeed but by the contiguity and preſence of ſome corporeal ſubſtance, filling that ſuppoſed empty ſpace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is moſt evident to any man's ſenſe that will but try it, that if the Tube be open at both ends, and filled up with Mercury, and then one end ſtopped with the finger, and the other end inverted and immerſed in the reſtagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, whereby it deſcends from the top of the Tube, a ſtrong and ſenſible At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction is wrought upon the pulp of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50395:63"/>the upper finger that cloſeth it, which continues and grows more and more forcible, ſenſible, and evident, the farther the Mercury is removed from the upper end, and approaching to its uſual ſtation of 29 Inches.</p>
               <p>This Attraction is impoſſible to be without the contiguity of ſome Body to the pulp of the finger, which cannot be the Mercury it ſelf, for That in a Tube of four Foot long is removed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Foot diſtant from the finger, by that time it comes to its ſtation; yet all this while the ſtrong ſuction upon the pulp of the finger continues.</p>
               <p>And they that go about to tell us, that it is not Attraction or Suction by any power within the Tube, but by the pulſion of the incumbent column of Air, need no other confutation than their own ſenſe to aſſure them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for moſt evidently the force that the finger feels is from within, and not from without: and this Solution by Pulſion, is given only to gratifie that imaginary Suppoſition that ſome have entertained of the Aery Column, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in due time.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:50395:64"/>
               <p n="2">2. The inſtance of <hi>Hanoratus Fabri</hi> in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of his <hi>Phyſical Dialogue,</hi> (though not tryed by myſelf, yet aſſerted to be tryed by him) puts it out of queſtion. If at the upper end of the Tube there be fixed a folded Paper, which may be extended by any force, but otherwiſe contracting it ſelf (in the manner of Paper-Lanthorns made by School-boys), this <hi>plicat a charta</hi> will by the ſubſiding of the Mercury be unfolded and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which could not be, but by the contiguity of ſome Body unto it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The inſtance given by <hi>Linus,</hi> and improved by <hi>Fabri, ubi ſupra,</hi> of an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Bladder cloſe tyed, and faſtned to the upper end and the inſide of the Tube, extended after the deſcent of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and again contracting it ſelf to its former dimenſion by the inclination of the Tube, makes it plain, that this Extention is the effect of ſome included Body in that relicted ſpace, which is not the bare groſs body of the Mercury, which is removed a Foot or more below it, and in which there is not ſo much as pretended to be any Magnetick qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50395:64"/>in relation to the Bladder.</p>
               <p>And they that tell us it is the Elatery of the Air included in the Bladder, that extends it by a natural expanſion, tell us an invention fitted to ſerve the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the prodigious natural Elatery of uncompreſs'd Air, whereof hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>It is true, that if this Bladder hath any little orifice, or hole open in it, the diſtention will not enſue; but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof is evident, (not upon their Suppoſition of the impediment of the natural Elater of the Air included in the Bladder,) but becauſe in that caſe the Attraction is made as well upon the inſide of the Bladder through the orifice, as upon the outſide, and ſo the Bladder obtains the ſame conſiſtence as at firſt; but where there is no orifice, the Attraction can only be but upon the outſide of the Bladder, upon which there neceſſarily follows an Extenſion of the Bladder, and a neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereof is a Dilatation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of that little particle of Air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in it, to the uttermoſt dilatation
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50395:65"/>that that attractive force can give it, or produce in it, which is not by natural Elaſticity, but by forcible Tenſion.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe and the like ſenſible and plain Inſtances it ſeems undeniable by any, that will not abandon his own ſenſe, that it is not Nothing that is in that derelicted ſpace, but it is ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſubſtance; for otherwiſe it were impoſſible that thoſe, and the like ſenſible effects could be produced: for regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all natural bodily effects are wrought by a contact of ſome Active body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Patient.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the Body ſupplying the derelicted Space in the top of the Tube, and firſt what it is not.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the former Chapter I have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it is ſome corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the ſpace derelicted by the Mercury in the top of the Tube, though not conſpicuous to the ſight: and now
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50395:65"/>I ſhall conſider firſt what it is not, and 2. what it ſeems moſt probably to be.</p>
               <p>There are two general Opinions touching it: one that ſuppoſeth it is ſome Body that comes <hi>de foris</hi> into that derelicted ſpace; and thoſe again fall into ſeveral Opinions; ſome ſuppoſe it to be the forreign Air that pervades ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pores of the Glaſs, or the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; others that it is <hi>Ather,</hi> or Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real matter, or (which is a differing kind of Explication of the ſame thing) that it is <hi>des Cartes</hi> his <hi>materia ſubtilis,</hi> or his Third Element, the <hi>ramenta</hi> or filings of Atomical Bodies. The other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinion is, that it is a bodily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not coming <hi>de foris,</hi> but ariſing from the included Mercurial Body.</p>
               <p>Now as to the former of theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Suppoſitions that it comes <hi>de foris,</hi> I ſhall diſcharge the queſtion from that Suppoſition of <hi>des Cartes</hi> his <hi>materia ſubtilis,</hi> for there is no probable evidence of any ſuch Principle, it being only an imaginary ſubſtitution; and if it be any thing beſides imagination, it ſeems to be but Air, or at moſt that ſubtler part
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50395:66"/>of the Univerſe called <hi>Aether,</hi> which poſſibly may be nothing elſe but the ſubtler and more refined parts of the Air, diſgroſſed of thoſe vapours or <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> which obtain ordinarily in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior parts of the Air, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>And therefore one method of diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this queſtion will poſſibly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to both theſe Suppoſitions, of the admiſſion of forreign Air or <hi>Aether</hi> into the derelicted ſpace in the Tube above the Mercury.</p>
               <p>If therefore it be forreign Air or <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> that occupies that place, it muſt be upon one of theſe accounts, <hi>viz.</hi> either that the Air or <hi>Aether,</hi> upon the account of its own ſubtlety and tenuity, freely and of its own accord pervades the Glaſs or the Body of the ſubſiding Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and ſo takes up the derelicted room; or elſe that although of its own accord it would not penetrate through either of thoſe two Bodies, yet that it is as it were forcibly ſtrained through the pores of the Glaſs or Mercury, and by the ſubſiding of the Mercury, and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50395:66"/>reſiſtence of Nature againſt Vacuity, percolated into that vacant ſpace.</p>
               <p>As to the former of theſe Solutions, it ſeems altogether unreaſonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any free or unconſtrained penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air, or <hi>Aether,</hi> into that ſpace: for although the Glaſs, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Mercury are not altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Pores, yet they do not run in a ſtraight uninterrupted line, but are croſſed and obſtructed by interpoſed filaments, that muſt neceſſarily ſtop the free paſſage of the Air or <hi>Aether</hi> through them, ſo that they are not wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to thoſe Bodies.</p>
               <p>And that this is ſo, appears by this one inſtance, which is as good as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
               <p>If it were true, that the Air or <hi>Aether</hi> did freely paſs through the ſuppoſed pores of the Glaſs or Mercury, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury would never be ſuſpended at twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine Inches, but would wholly ſink into the veſſel or reſtagnant Mercury; for the inſinuation of the Air or <hi>Aether</hi> through the Glaſs or Mercury, would ſupply the vacuity, as well below twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50395:67"/>nine Inches as above, and ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the derelicted ſpace in all its E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation, as well as in part, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would accommodate the Mercury in its natural deſcent without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience; and yet we find, that at twenty nine Inches the Meccury keeps up, and ſubſides not.</p>
               <p>And that which puts it out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that the natural irruption of the Air or <hi>Aether</hi> fills not this Space, is this: let but the leaſt orifice, no bigger than the point of a ſmall Needle be made in the top of the Glaſs Tube, the Mercury would entirely deſcend, and not be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained at twenty nine Inches, becauſe here is an admiſſion of forreign Air to ſupply the ſpace derelicted by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, as faſt as it deſcends. And the ſame effect would follow, if the Air or <hi>Aether</hi> did penetrate through the ſmall pores of the Glaſs or Mercury. And ſince we ſee it doth not obtain that effect, we have reaſon unqueſtionably to conclude, it hath not any admiſſion <hi>ab extra</hi> through thoſe ſuppoſed pores of either of thoſe Bodies.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:50395:67"/>
               <p>It remains therefore to be conſidered, whether that by the great contention of Nature againſt Vacuity, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible ſtreſs of the Mercury on its deſcent downward, there be not a kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible ſtraining of ſome Aery or Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Particles through the Glaſs, or at leaſt through the Mercury, which is partly expoſed to the external Air.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, as touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meating of Air or <hi>Aether</hi> through the Glaſs; it ſeems utterly impoſſible, for the reaſon before given. Indeed the vigor of Light or Fire penetrates the Glaſs, not (as it ſeems) by any tranſition of any Corporeal Subſtance, but only of a <hi>vis, virtus,</hi> or <hi>vigor,</hi> which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates the quality of <hi>lumen</hi> or <hi>calor</hi> to the Body that it finds there, but conveys not any Corporeal Subſtance tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Glaſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as touching the ſuppoſed ſtraining of the Air or <hi>Aether</hi> through the Mercury, and diſcharging it in the ſummity of the Tube: I muſt needs ſay, that in ſome inſtances the forreign Air will make a viſible perforation and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50395:68"/>tranſition through the body of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as well as of Water.</p>
               <p>If a Tube of Glaſs, ſealed at one end, be filled with Water, or Mercury, and then inverted in the free Air, (unleſs the Tube be extremely ſmall) the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury will ſubſide and deſcend by the ſides of the Tube, and the Air aſcend through it in a Pillar or Bubbles in the midſt, in the very ſame ſucceſſive order as the Mercury deſcends; the Mercury thus laterally deſcending, making way for the aſcent of the Air, and the Air in the ſame ſucceſſive moments aſcending, filling the room relicted by the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and this aſcent of the Air is evident and conſpicuous to the Eye.</p>
               <p>But in the matter in queſtion, there ſeems to be no ſuch pervading of the Air through the pores of the ſuſpended or reſtagnant Mercury.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if ſuch a tranſition of the Air were through the column and reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Mercury, it muſt needs (as in the former caſe) make a viſible appearance thereof in the Mercury, and raiſe ſome tumultuous <hi>phaenomena</hi> in it, but no ſuch
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50395:68"/>thing appears to the eye in the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Experiment!</p>
               <p>Secondly, the difficulty of the <hi>tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of the external Air through the Mercury in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment is infinitely greater than in the inſtance above given: for in that inſtance the Air hath but one motion upward, and is aſſiſted in it by the Mercury giving way to it. But here in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, there muſt be a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and motion of the Air, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. It muſt <hi>deſcendendo</hi> terebrate through the reſtagnant Mercury, and then when it hath paſſed that difficulty, it muſt tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate through the erect column of Mercury <hi>aſcendendo.</hi> And it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible that the pores of the erect and reſtagnant Quick-ſilver, croſſing one another in reſpect of their poſition and ſituation, can accommodate ſuch a crooked and contradictory motion of any particle of Air.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, again it cannot reaſonably be thought, but that if there were ſuch a tranſition of the Air through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnant, and ſuſpended Quick-ſilver,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50395:69"/>but it ſhould be as reaſonabe to continue after the ſubſiding of the Mercury to twenty nine Inches, as before, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage remaining ſtill open through the Mercury. The conſequence whereof would be, that the whole Tube would be ſupplied with Air, and conſequently the whole body of Mercury be emptied into the reſtagnant veſſel; as when a little Pin-hole is made in the top of the ſealed Tube.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, again if it were forreign Air or <hi>Aether</hi> that were admitted, it is not eaſily conceptible, how the finger ſtopping the upper orifice of the Tube, ſhould be attracted inward, or the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſtended, as in the former Chapter; for the immiſſion of forreign Air through the Mercury, or Glaſs, muſt rather contract than expand the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the acceſſion of an external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from it, as will happen upon the leaſt hole made in the Tube. Upon theſe and the like reaſons it ſeems to me altogether improbable, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relicted ſpace ſhould be filled with Air or <hi>Aether</hi> from without, by an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50395:69"/>of it through the Glaſs or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</p>

               <p>Since therefore I have concluded, that this derelicted Space in the Tube is filled with a Body, and that That Body comes not <hi>ab extra,</hi> and there is no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy within to ſuppply that room but the Mercury, or that which muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from it: and in as much as the Mercurial conſiſtence it ſelf is deſcended to twenty nine Inches, it remains neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that this Body that fills the dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>interſtitium,</hi> muſt be a ſubtle body extracted from the Mercurial body.

The ſecond is, when the Tube is above twenty nine Inches and half, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe four foot long, ſealed at the top, and filled up to twenty nine Inches and half, and then inverted, whereby the Air ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the top of the Tube, and the Mercury ſubſides not only to twenty nine Inches and half, but much lower, namely as far as that column of Air in the upper end of the Tube is by tenſion extendible by the force of the deſcenſion of the Mercury, which being about eighteen Inches of Air, poſſibly by the deſcent of the Mercury will be extended to above twice the length, whereby the Mercury may ſubſide it may be to about fourteen Inches, (I am not curious in the Calculation.)</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:50395:70"/>
               <p n="3">3. The third Inſtance is, where the Tube for the purpoſe is four foot long, ſealed at one end, filled with Mercury without any portion of Air admitted, whereby the Mercury inverted into a veſſel of reſtagnant Mercury, ſubſides to twenty nine Inches and half, and ſo leaves about eighteen Inches deſerted by the Mercury.</p>
               <p>And though in the purſuit of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe there will be uſe of the diſcuſſion of the two former Inſtances, yet in this place only the laſt of the three yeilds the Inquiry, namely what it is that fills that ſpace derelicted by the Mercury.</p>
               <p>And I adventure to conclude, that it is a ſubtle Corporeal Subſtance extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the groſs Mercurial Body, or forced out of it.</p>
               <p>The methods of this Separation are two, the one propoſed by <hi>Linus,</hi> the other offered by others.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Linus</hi> (if I underſtand him aright) ſeems to be this: namely that by the deſcent of the Mercury, and <hi>in obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium naturae univerſalis,</hi> for preventing of Vacuity, there are taken away ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50395:71"/>from the ſuperficies of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury certain ſcales as it were of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible profundity, and theſe are rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied into a ſubtle inviſible conſiſtence or vapor, which ſupply that deſerted ſpace, and make up a kind of <hi>funiculus</hi> that ſuſpends the Mercury to the Tube, and is coextended to the whole vacant ſpace gradually, as the Mercury deſcended.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be ſomewhat difficult, eſpecially conſidering the heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the Mercury, whereof ſome ſeem to be of that ſolidity, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of ſuch a ſeparation.</p>
               <p>Beſides it would be difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how theſe ſuperficies of this Body ſhould in a moment, by the inclination of the Tube, be rejoyned to the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial body and conſiſtence; and in a moment again, upon the re-erection of the Tube to its perpendicular poſture, be rarefied from ſo groſs a conſiſtence into ſo ſubtle and inviſible a nature; both which will be the effects, one of the inclination, the other of the re-ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Tube.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall rather chooſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50395:71"/>and, as I think a more accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Solution.</p>
               <p>It is plain to our daily obſervation, that all Bodies, eſpecially ſuch as are liquid or fluid, do continually ſend out from them certain ſubtle <hi>Effluvia,</hi> ſcarce perceptible to the Eye, but manifeſt in their effects. It is alſo evident, that all Bodies, eſpecially fluids, and ſuch as conſiſt even of Heterogeneous parts, by ſtrong agitation, by heat or motion, have many of their parts reſolved into a more ſubtle conſiſtence, than appeared before ſuch agitation. Thus Water by heat or violent motion reſolves it ſelf into vapours or ſteams.</p>
               <p>Mercury is of it ſelf an heterogeneous body, conſiſting of ſome more ſolid, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more fluid and moiſt parts. If any man ſhall take the pains violently to ſhake Water and Mercury together, and throughly waſh it, he ſhall find the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning parts that are the more fluid, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from little black or dark granules like Sand, which will gradually ſubſide viſibly in the water into a heap, before the nimble ſhining particles united
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50395:72"/>to them, and alſo certain Airy corpuſcles riſing to the top of the Water.</p>
               <p>And as thus by the ſeparation by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo by a ſtrong heat the Mercurial Bodies will be in a great meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into a fume or ſmoak, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs (as is ſaid) will coagulate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and aſſume the former Mercurial conſiſtency, at leaſt in a great meaſure.</p>
               <p>Mercury, though it be one of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Minerals, doth contain and ſend out from its body certain <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and noxious vapors, as they experiment that are converſant in Mines of that kind.</p>
               <p>If any man obſerve the deſcent of the Mercury from the top of a long Tube in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Engine, he ſhall find the deſcent not ſo quick and nimble, as if both ends were open, and (contrary to the uſual acceleration of deſcending heavy Bodies) more and more ſlow and faint, the nearer it comes to its ſtation; which is an evidence that there is a <hi>luct a</hi> and contention in Nature, while it extrates, ſeparates, and abrades the parts, that muſt ſupply the derelicted
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50395:72"/>ſpace, and likewiſe in giving them a tenſion or dilatation anſwerable to it.</p>
               <p>They that have exerciſed much the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiments, and thoſe of the like nature with Mercury, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently found that the frequent itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Experiments have much imbaſed the nature of Mercury, depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating it from thoſe ſubtle ſteams and <hi>Effluvia</hi> that naturally attend it, and thereby the very Mineral it ſelf becomes more vapid, diſcharged of its ſubtle Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or parts, and rendred leſs uſeful not only for Medicinal but Mechanical Experiments: whereby it appears that it loſeth ſomewhat of its more ſubtle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by iterated Experiments, and will prove more ſluggiſh. For this I call to witneſs <hi>Honoratus Fabri,</hi> in the latter end of his <hi>Philoſophical Dialogues,</hi> and ſome of our own Nation that have aſſerted the ſame, and in my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I have alſo found it true.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that when Mercury, or any other fluid falls in a Tube, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it falls, the more force it hath, and the greater compreſſion the lower parts
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50395:73"/>receive from the upper; for all Bodies that deſcend, deſcend with the greater force, according to the altitude of their deſcent, as I ſhall have occaſion hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obſerve.</p>
               <p>The deſcent therefore of Mercury in a Tube of ſix foot high, is much more powerful than a deſcent from four foot high; and That than a deſcent from three foot, or twenty nine Inches high, and conſequently the compreſſion of the inferior parts by the ſuperior; and in a greater deſcent than in a leſs. the agitation of all is the more vigorous</p>
               <p>And yet (as I before ſaid) it is evident in the deſcent of the Mercury from a Tube of four foot high, ſtopt above, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed beneath in reſtagnant Mercury, is not without a <hi>lucta</hi> or contention; and although the higher the Tube is, the deſcent at firſt is more quick, yet it gradually grows ſlower and ſlower, 'till it come to the common ſtation of its ſuſpenſion, <hi>viz.</hi> twenty nine Inches and half, or thereabouts. But yet even in the firſt efforts of its motion, it is not ſo quick or violent, as its own natural
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50395:73"/>motion would otherwiſe attain for it, receives a <hi>remora</hi> and impediment by the difficulty of ſeparating of its ſubtle parts.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are apparently true to any man's obſervation, and from theſe obſervations I frame theſe Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſubſtance that fills the head of the Tube, as the Mercury de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends, are the <hi>Effiuvia,</hi> ſteams, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vaporous parts of the Mercurial Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That theſe ſteams or vapors are ſeparated from the Mercurial body by a double immediate means. Firſt by way of Expreſſion, or driving them out by the ſtrong deſcending motion of the Mercury, the compreſſion of the inferior parts by the ſuperior, and the great agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of its parts; the groſſer Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial parts coming cloſer together, and driving out the more ſubtle and vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous parts. Secondly by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or ſtraining out thoſe parts that are more ſubtle and fluid, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Expanſion, and from hence ariſeth that <hi>lucta</hi> and <hi>mora</hi> in the deſcent
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50395:74"/>of the Mercury, by the ſtraining of the Mercurial vaporous bodies, and raking them out. And</p>
               <p n="3">3. That thoſe parts thus extracted are dilated and extended to as great an amplitude and tenſion, as the ſtrength of the deſcent of the Mercury, and the amplitude of the ſpace it leaves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; which tenſion alſo contributes much to the retarding of the ſwiftneſs of the Mercurial deſcent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And becauſe at twenty nine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and half, the weight of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury decreaſeth to ſuch a ſtate, as cannot work any farther ſeparation of ſubtle matter to ſupply any more room, it ſtays there, and deſcends no farther, not having ſtrength enough at that hight to ſeparate any ſubtle matter from it ſelf, to ſupply the ſpace it ſhould leave by ſuch deſcent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Although the immediate cauſe of the ſeparation of the ſubtle matter of Mercury, and the expanſion or dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, be the force of the deſcent, and weight, and preſſure of the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet this is performed <hi>in obſequium
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50395:74"/>univerſalis naturae,</hi> for the avoiding of the diſſolution of Continuity, or, which is all one, <hi>obfugam vacui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. And the ſame reaſon <hi>mutatis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis</hi> will be applicable to the ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of water in a Tube, which will be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended at 31 foot, or thereabout, as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury is at twenty nine Inches. For by the ſame means that ſubtle parts are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from Mercury, ſubtle parts are much more ſeparable from Water, by a ſtrong tenſion or compreſſion of it, as appears by the raiſing of innumerable Airy Bubbles out of a veſſel of Water, by the ſtrong tenſion of the Air in the Air-pump, large inſtances whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Mr. <hi>Boyle's</hi> Experiments, 19, 21, 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole proceſs and model of the ſuſpending of Water in a long Tube above one and thirty foot long, and how it ſubſides to about one and thirty foot, and no longer. <hi>vide apud Shottum</hi> in his <hi>mirabilia Vari lib. 3. cap. 2. in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimento Robervalli Magnani &amp; Bertii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now if it be ſaid, ſuppoſe the Tube were ſeven, eight, or ten foot
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50395:75"/>long, or if it were three or four foot long, and the upper end were a Bolts head, that ſhould contain three or four pound of Mercury, this would ſubſide to twenty nine Inches: where ſhould there be <hi>Effluvia</hi> to fill ſo great a ſpace?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: the more Mercury deſcends to twenty nine Inches, the more <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> there will be to fill that place that the Mercury left, and ſo the Supply will neceſſarily be as liberal, as the ſpace the Mercury took up before its deſcent to 29 Inches and half, becauſe there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtock of Mercury to yeild it, and a greater continuation of motion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it. And there ſeems no neceſſity of any great quantity of ſubtle matter to be driven, or driven out of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Maſs, becauſe it is a ſubſtance ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of dilatation to a greater expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion than its own natural conſiſtency, by the ſubſiding of the Mercury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merſennus</hi> tells us, that by experience he finds, that by a ſtrong tenſion of a particle of Air, it is capable to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of neer ſeventy times the ſpace of its ordinary conſiſtency, as in Aeoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piles,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50395:75"/>and the like Engins. And we ſee that if an Inch of Air be left in the top of the Tube, it will by the bare force of the deſcent of the Mercury be expanded to neer ten times its former ſpace. And upon the ſame account it will fall out, that the quantity of one Inch of thoſe Mercurial effluxes will, by the deſcent of the Mercury, be ſtretched out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded to fill the derelicted ſpace of the Mercury, far exceeding their common and ordinary extenſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fig. 9.</hi> The moſt conſiderable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt this Suppoſition ſeems to be this. That if the Tube of four foot long filled with Mercury, and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in reſtagnant Mercury, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Mercury ſubſides to twenty nine Inches, and leaves a ſpace of about 18 Inches ſeemingly empty, yet if the Tube be inclined, as in <hi>B,</hi> to an altitude pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to twenty nine Inches of vertical hight. The Tube <hi>B</hi> will be as at firſt filled with Mercury, drawn or driven out of the reſtagnant veſſel, and no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſpace left; and if again it be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted perpendicularly as before, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50395:76"/>will ſubſide as before, <hi>viz.</hi> to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine Inches; what becomes of the ſubtle exhalation upon the inclination of the Tube?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it is true, that by the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Tube the Mercury that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended out of the. Tube into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnant veſſel of Mercury, will be drawn up into the Tube, and the Tube filled again with it, the ſame by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Tube becomes of leſs accidental weight. But this doth no way croſs what I have ſuppoſed: I therefore anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by the inclination of the Tube at <hi>B,</hi> the Mercury doth not preſs ſo urgently upon the ſubjected Mercury, as it doth in its perpendicular poſition; for it is ſuſtained according to the laws of Staticks by leaning upon the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Tube, and preſſeth not ſo forcibly upon the fund or Baſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That therefore the pores or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of the Mercury in the inclined Tube are more lax and open, and regain more of that natural texture of its Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial conſiſtence, and receives into it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50395:76"/>again thoſe connatural ſteams or efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes, that were ſhot or drawn out of it by its former compreſſion, and the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made upon it by reaſon of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And by its re-erection unto its former perpendicular poſture, they are again thruſt or drawn out by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and compreſſion, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible attraction wrought upon it by that Catholick Law of Nature, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the continuity of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>And that which ſeems evidently to evince the truth hereof, is the inſtance given by the Excellent Author himſelf, in his 20, 21, 22, 23, but eſpecially in his 24<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h Experiment of the Air-pump; wherein the violent attraction of the Pump, and the ſtrong tenſion of the Air included in the Receiver, raiſeth from the bottom of an included veſſel of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Oyl, but eſpecially Spirit of Wine, great Bubbles to the top of the veſſels, (which is performed either by that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible extraction of the more ſubtle and Aerial Particles included in that liquor, or by ſubtilizing or rarefying ſome
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50395:77"/>parts of the liquor. But as ſoon as that ſtrong tenſion and attraction by the included Air is taken off, by the immiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of freſh Air into the Receiver, the Bubbles ſubſided, and the ſubtle parts included in it were again rejoined, and reunited to the ſame liquors from whence they were exhauſted, which by a new tenſion wrought by a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted ſuction of the Pump, might be again extracted.</p>
               <p>And thus far touching the third Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, namely what it is that is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſpace derelicted by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</p>

                  <hi>The enquiry touching the Cauſe that keeps the Mercury ſuſpended in the Tube at 29 Inches, or there about; and firſt what is not the Cauſe of this Suſpenſion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE conſideration of what it is that remains in the derelicted ſpace, in the upper end of the Tube, and the conſideration what it is, that keeps up the Mercury to twenty nine Inches, or thereabouts, are of two ſeveral kinds: for although the former Conſideration is neceſſary to be known, before we can arrive at a reaſonable diſcovery of the latter; yet it would not be ſimply of it ſelf impoſſible, that there ſhould be ſuch a corporeal ſubſtance, as I have above conjectured, in the derelicted head of the Tube, and yet the Mercury might wholly diſcharge it ſelf in the reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant veſſel, which yet we ſee it doth not.</p>
               <p>Therefore having in the former
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50395:78"/>Chapters finiſhed the former, which was the fourth general Inquiry, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what it is that fills the derelicted ſpace; I now come to the fifth and ſixth Inquiry, namely what is not the cauſe of this ſuſpenſion of the Mercury, and what ſeems to me the true cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>And among thoſe that are aſſigned for cauſes of this ſuſpicion, which yet are not cauſes thereof, I ſhall mention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe three; namely the renitence or reſiſtance of the Mercury in the reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant veſſel; 2. and the counterpoiſe of the impendent column of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, equal in baſe to the baſe of the Cylinder of Mercury ſuſpended in the Tube; and 3. the Elatery or Spring of the inferior part of the Air.</p>
               <p>Of the former briefly in this Chapter, of the two latter more at large in what follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stevinus</hi> in the Explication of the 10<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h Propoſition of his Hydroſtaticks, aſſirms, that the reſiſtence of the baſe of any fluid Body, is greater in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the <hi>pondus deprimens</hi> of a like
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50395:78"/>fluid: which <hi>Fabri</hi> in the ſixth of his <hi>Philoſophical Dialogues, pag.</hi> 480. and 493, goes about Geometrically to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: but I confeſs that it is performed with ſo much intricacy, and obſcurity, that I do not fully apprehend it.</p>
               <p>And if this be ſo, it may ſeem at firſt view, that the reſiſtance of the reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Mercury in the ſubjacent veſſel, which is as it were the baſe or foot of that Mercurial Column of Mercury, that is ſuſpended in the Tube, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomething to its ſuſtentation in that poſition.</p>
               <p>But upon due conſideration I find this is but an imagination, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes nothing to this <hi>phaenomenon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, if a liquid be impendent upon ſolid baſe, as Mercury upon Marble; or if a lighter or leſs compacted fluid be bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed or imbaſed upon a much more groſs and compacted fluid, as a Tube full of Air upon a Superficies of Water, or a Tube full of Water upon a Superficies of Mercury, though the Tube be open at both ends, the Baſe will ſuſtain the Column of the lighter or leſs compacted fluid.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:50395:79"/>
               <p>But if they are of the ſame kind and conſiſtence, the Baſe contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the ſuſtentation of the impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Column. But if there be no other impediment, it will wholly ſubſide. And therefore if a Tube, open at both ends, be filled with Water, and the lower end ſtopt with the finger, be immerſed under a veſſel of Water, and then unſtopped; or if an open Tube ſtopt at the lower end with the finger, be immerſed in a veſſel of reſtagnant Mercury; in the former caſe the Water, and in the latter the Mercury will wholly ſubſide to the level of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Water or Mercury in the ſubjacent veſſel, which would not be, not withſtanding the Tube were open at both ends, if a Baſe of the ſame fluid had any force or reſiſtance againſt its deſcent.</p>
               <p>Nay the truth is, the poſition of the Water or Mercury in the Tube, in any the leaſt degree higher than the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Water or Mercury in the veſſel, hath an accidental Gravitation upon a lower Superficies of the ſame
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50395:79"/>fluid, by reaſon of ſuch poſition or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the fluid in the Tube, above the Superficies of the fluid in the veſſel, and by that poſition preſſeth upon it, as ſhall be farther illuſtrated hereafter. And therefore the <hi>pondus deprimens</hi> of the ſame fluid in ſuch an elevated poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conquers and overmatcheth the <hi>potentia ſuſtinens</hi> of the ſubjected fluid, though it were an Ocean of Water. I therefore lay aſide this Suppoſition, as contributing nothing to this <hi>phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and proceed to the examining of thoſe, that with great pretenſion and patronage are ſuggeſted to be the Cauſe of this Suſpenſion.</p>

               <p>And it is admirable to ſee, how much this new opinion hath, obtained among the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of this latter Age; ſo that as a new faſhion is greedily entertained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gallants of the times, and an old faſhion deſpiſed and contemned; ſo this new <hi>hypotheſis</hi> is as greedily enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the great Wits of the times,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50395:80"/>and hath obtained the ſtile of a <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and the Old Peripatetical Learning, touching <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and the Inſeparabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Bodies, exterminated, under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>decantata fuga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay the theory is ſo much idolized, that ſome late Authors have ſtrangely contended for the dignity of being the firſt Inventers of it.</p>
               <p>And ſome that have defended the Peripatetical Solution of <hi>fugavacui,</hi> as <hi>Shottus,</hi> when he wrot his <hi>mirabilia Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draulica</hi> and <hi>pneumatica;</hi> yet whether overwhelmed and aſtoniſhed with the <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> Experiment and varieties thereof, or whether he was not willing to ſeem to perceive leſs than the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> that had eſpouſed the new Solution, becomes a Convert, and fairly retracts his former Opinion, and gives up the Solution of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment to the <hi>aequipondium</hi> of the like portion of the Atmoſphere, in his <hi>Technica Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſa, l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.,</hi> 6. §. 2.</p>
               <p>And 'tis pleaſant to ſee what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful progeny, and voluminous Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems of Theories, Conſectaries, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50395:81"/>Concluſions have been ſince built upon this Suppoſition! wherein though the Authors have ſhewn much wit, ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and learning, yet they have loſt the expence of much time, and invention, and pains, if at laſt when all is done, it prove but an imagination.</p>
               <p>The Suppoſition therefore ſeems to be this:
I. That the Atmoſphere or lower portion of the Air, ſome ſay ſeven, ſome twenty two, others fifty, others an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles high, hath a conſiderable Gravitation upon its inferior parts upon the Earth, and upon all Bodies in this lower world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That where a Tube, ſealed at one end, is filled with Mercury, and then inverted into a reſtagnant veſſel of Mercury, the Mercury will ſubſide to twenty nine Inches and half, and no lower, becauſe a column of Atmoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Air, of the ſame baſe with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Tube, and incumbent upon the face of the reſtagnant Mercury, doth juſt counterpoiſe ſuch a column of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury of twenty nine Inches and half
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50395:81"/>high: ſo that if the Mercurial Cylinder be of that bulk, as to weigh five pound, the Atmoſpherical Cylinder weighs juſt as much, and ſo as one artificial ſcale being charged with an equal weight with the other, ſtands in this <hi>aequilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> ſo in this natural Scale the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpherical Cylinder preſſing upon the reſtagnant Mercury with an equal weight, to the 29 Inches and half of Mercury in the Tube, ſuſtains and keeps it up in an <hi>aequilibrium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But if while the Mercurial Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder ſtands thus ſuſpended, there be any little hole made in the ſealed top of the Tube, the weight of the Air now preſſing in upon the Mercurial Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, takes away that <hi>aequilibrium</hi> which it had with that external column of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, while it was protected from the impendent column of Air by the ſealed top of the Glaſs; and now the Mercury is driven down by the equal weight of the Air, and wholly ſubfides into the reſtagnant Mercury; for now the Aereal Cylinder without the Tube, and that within and upon the Tube,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50395:82"/>have the ſame common weight or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation upon the Mercury. And upon theſe Suppoſitions they graft innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Concluſions, and among the reſt that the Air gravitates upon all Bodies; that the exact proportion of the weight of Air is herehence neceſſarily deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for if a column of Mercury, of half an Inch diameter, and twenty nine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and half high, weighs two pound (for inſtance,) then a column of Air of the ſame diameter, extending from the reſtagnant Mercury to the top of the Atmoſphere, weighs juſt as much. And from hence they meaſure the hight of the Atmoſphere, or ponderous Air; namely, Air being about a thouſand times lighter than the like bulk of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Water being fourteen times lighter than the like bulk of Mercury, it muſt follow by the rule of proportion, That if two pound of Mercury give a column of half an Inch diameter, to be twenty nine Inches high; then two pound of Atmoſphere muſt give a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of twenty nine times 14000 Inches high: (I am not curious in the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50395:82"/>proportion, but only ſhew the method of their inferences:) and abundance of ſuch fine Conſequences are built upon this Platform, which were too large to enumerate.</p>
               <p>Now as touching this Solution of the Suſpenſion of the Mercury in the Tube, by the <hi>aequipondium</hi> of a Cylinder of Air, of the ſame diameter with the Cylinder of Mercury, I ſay it ſeems to me an Imagination, and to be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.</p>
               <p>I will not repete what I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid againſt the Gravitation of the Air, in the fourth Chapter, which yet I take to be ſufficient to evince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth of this Suppoſition: but I will ſubjoin two or three homely Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which with the application of them will, as I think, detect the untruth and inefficacy of this Solution.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I will begin with one offered by the Aſſerters themſelves of this Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of a late learned Author, in the 11. Propoſition of his <hi>Hydroſtaticks,</hi> and the <hi>Scholium</hi> thereupon, which I ſhall agree to be a true Experiment, but the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50395:83"/>thereof too much diſtorted, to gratifie the <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> but in truth and reality utterly confounding it.</p>
               <p>Take a veſſel of reftagnant Mercury, of ſeven Inches deep; then take a Glaſs Tube of half an Inch diameter in the cavity, and of half an Inch thick in each ſide, ſealed at the one end, and of 3 foot long; whereby the entire Tube will be an Inch and a half in its whole diameter: Fill it with Mercury, and ſtop it with the finger at the open end, and invert and immerſe it to the bottom of the reſtagnant Mercury. It will then come to paſs, that about twenty nine Inches and half, the ordinary altitude of the column of Mercury, will be above the Superficies of the reſtagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and the whole Tube will thereby remain full to the top: but the Glaſs being lighter than the Mercury, will be impelled up by the reſtagnant Mercury neer to the Superficies thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there will remain about ſix Inches of the upper end of the Tube empty of the Mercury, but ſtill there will be about twenty nine Inches and half of the Tube
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50395:83"/>ſtill full of Mercury, namely, the uſual ſtation of its Suſpenſion.</p>
               <p>I will ſuppoſe the twenty nine Inches and half of Mercury, ſuſpended in the Tube, to weigh one pound, and that the Glaſs Tube of it ſelf weighs likewiſe one pound.</p>
               <p>I will now ſuppoſe, that the upper end of the Tube were fixed by a ſtring to the Beam of a pair of Scales, as in his 319th figure in that book. I ſay that two pound in the adverſe Scale will counterpoiſe this Tube with the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Mercury, and if any little advantage of weight, ſuppoſe an Ounce, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the adverſe Scale, that Scale charged with two pound and an Ounce, will preponderate it.</p>
               <p>And I ſay no more than what the Author ſays was determined touching it by the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> whereunto he ſubſcribes, <hi>pag.</hi> 727. in theſe words. <q>
                     <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus in adverſa lance contraponderans aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollebat ſuſpenſi hydrargyri cujuſounque al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinis, at que ſimul (quantum conjectando aeſtimabant) ſuſpenſi tubi ei parti quae ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantis in ſubjecto vaſe hydrargyri ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciei
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50395:84"/>ſupereminebat.</hi>
                  </q> Now it is certain that if the one pound of Mercury con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to this weight, it is not ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the adjacent external column of Air, preſſing the Superficies of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnant Mercury; for if ſo, it is ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>aequipondium</hi> of that Aereal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, and cannot affect the Scale with its weight; for it is ſuſtained by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counterpoiſe, and not by the two pound weight of the Scale.</p>
               <p>And again it is as certain, that if the Mercury do contribute to the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe of the Scale, it muſt by ſome means be as it were faſtned to the Scale, (we will ſuppoſe it to be <hi>Linus</hi> his <hi>funiculus,</hi>) for otherwiſe the Glaſs would only weigh as a ſeparate thing from the Mercury, which would of it ſelf contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute (<hi>ex ſuppoſitione</hi>) but one pound to the weight, which would be neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preponderated by the adverſe Scale charged with two pound weight.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is moſt clear, if the included column of Mercury contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes one pound weight to the ballance, it is not ſuſtained by the imaginary
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50395:84"/>column of Air equal in diameter to the Mercurial Cylinder, but by an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick connection or ligament to the Tube, whereby it weighs as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete Body with the Glaſs, which I call the <hi>Funiculus ex ſubtilibus Mercurialibus effluviis contextus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author, to avoid this difficulty, therefore tells us, that this thing <hi>primo aſpectu incautis nonnullis ad Staticam mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus attentis facile imponeret;</hi> and to avoid the impoſture, tells us, that all this while it is not the Mercury that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the weight, for that hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Suſtentation by the <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondium</hi> of the forreign Air; but it is another column of Air, that impends upon the upper end of the Glaſs Tube as its Baſe, and therefore commenſurate to the ſuſpended Mercury in weight. And this is the effect of the Solution, namely, that only the Glaſs, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Air impendent upon it, makes the counterpoiſe, and the Mercury con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes nothing to it.</p>
               <p>And indeed if the column of Air, charging the Tube, were of an equal
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50395:85"/>diameter with the Mercury, or the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Tube, the Evaſion were handſome and ſuitable to their <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> though untrue: but the inſtance in queſtion, as it is propoſed, quite ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters this Solution, and renders it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly untrue, but unſuitable to their very principles.</p>
               <p>For in this inſtance, the diameter of the column of Mercury is but half an Inch, but the diameter of the whole Tube is an Inch and half, which gives an <hi>area</hi> to the baſe of the Cylinder of Air impending on it, more than four times bigger than the Baſe of the Mercurial Cylinder. And therefore if a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Atmoſphere of half an Inch diameter, be commenſurate to the weight of the Mercurial Cylinder, and conſequently weighs a full pound at that ſcantlet; the Aereal Cylinder, commenſurate to the upper <hi>area</hi> of the Glaſs tube, which is an Inch and half diameter, muſt neceſſarily weigh above four pounds, and therefore would not be equiponderated by the two pound weight in the oppoſite Scale.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:50395:85"/>
               <p>This inſtance therefore which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with the memorial of the day, and place of its Exhibition, ſeems to make more to the diſadvantage, than the advantage of this new Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>But to this Objection there is a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered, namely, that let the Glaſs be of what thickneſs it will, That alters not the caſe; for the Mercury is preſſed up by the counterpoiſe of a Cylinder of Air, anſwerable to the cavity of the Tube, not to the craſſitude of its ſides: for Glaſs being a Body ſpecifically lighter than the Mercury, the Glaſs it ſelf is ſuſtained by the reſtagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, which is its Baſe, and ſupports it.</p>
               <p>But ſtill this Anſwer, though it be true, avoids not the Objection. For 1. let us ſuppoſe, in ſtead of a Tube of Glaſs, a Tube of Gold, which being ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically heavier than ſo much Mercury, would ſink to the bottom, and not be ſuſtained by the Mercury, but muſt be lifted up, and ſuſtained purely by the weight in the oppoſite Scale: 2. or ſuppoſe the Tube of Glaſs were charged in its cloſed end with a greater quantity
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50395:86"/>of Lead, that, though ſpecifically lighter than Mercury, would by its exceſs of extrinſical weight, depreſs the Tube to the bottom of the reſtagnant Mercury: or 3. though the Tryal were made by a Glaſs Tube filled with Water, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a veſſel of Water; for there the Glaſs Tube, with the incloſed Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of Water, would ſubſide to the bottom, being altogether in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete heavier than the Water, and could not be ſupported by the reſtagnant Water, but by the weight in the adverſe Scale: in theſe Inſtances the difficulty will not be ſalved.</p>
               <p>Therefore I took a Glaſs Tube, the cavity whereof was half an Inch diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the thickneſs of the Glaſs incircling the cavity <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>of an Inch; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from outſide to outſide the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the Tube was ⅝ of an Inch; the length of the Tube eighteen Inches, the weight thereof in the Air two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ¾ of an Ounce, and being heavier than the like bulk of Water, it would freely ſubſide perpendicularly to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a veſſel of reſtagnant Water
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50395:86"/>deeper than 18 Inches, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſuſtentation it had by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air, being empty, and ſo the Water contributed nothing to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Tube when it came to be weighed, but only the thickneſs of its <hi>medium,</hi> which yet was not able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it from ſinking.</p>
               <p>The Water which the Tube would contain, weighed one Ounce and three quarters, wanting about a Grain or two at moſt.</p>
               <p>The Tube was tied at the cloſed end with a ſtring to the Scale of a Ballance and filled with Water, and ſtopping it with the finger, inverted into a veſſel of Water 18 Inches deep, or more: and then the Tube with the included Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thus immerſed in Water, carefully weighed, the Water ſtill remaining ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the Tube, (as it will do as long as it ſtands ſo immerſed,) and the Events were theſe: When the Tube was full ſix Inches above the Superficies of the Water in the Veſſel, it weighed juſt two Ounces and three quarters of an Ounce, which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50395:87"/>weight in the oppoſite Scale kept it in an <hi>equilibrium;</hi> for now the reſt of the Water in the Tube, below the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Water in the veſſel, weighed nothing at all, becauſe it obtained ſo far the ſame common Superficies, and was therefore ſuſtained by the common weight which it had with the Water in the veſſel, and only ſix Inches of Water contributed to the counterpoiſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the weight of the Glaſs Tube it ſelf, though refracted by the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>medium:</hi> ſo that now theſe ſix Inches of ſuſpended Water, and the Tube it ſelf, weighed no more at this poſition in the Water, than what the Tube alone weighed in the Air.</p>
               <p>But when the Tube, with the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded column of Water was raiſed very neer eighteen Inches above the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the veſſel of Water, ſo that there was as little as could well be to keep the orifice of the Tube under Water, <hi>viz.</hi> about a quarter of an Inch, it then required an addition of very neer one Ounce ¾ in the oppoſite Scale, to hold the Tube in an <hi>aequilibrium</hi> which equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50395:87"/>the true weight of the Tube it ſelf and Water included, when in the free Air, <hi>viz.</hi> two Ounces and three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and one Ounce and three quarters, in all four Ounces and half; becauſe now the Water in the Tube had now in effect its due weight, which it had when divided from the Water in the veſſel, and ſo had its due Gravitation upon the Scale.</p>
               <p>Upon this Tryal of it with Water theſe things are obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Elevation aſſigned to Water, it would have been ſuſtained in a Tube of one and thirty foot high, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in this of eighteen Inches the Water had not attained a twentieth part of that height, at which it might in a Tube be kept ſuſpended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That according to theſe mens Suppoſitions, the Suſpenſion in the Tube, either of Water or Mercury, is ſuppoſed to be by the preſſure of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of the Atmoſphere upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Mercury in the veſſel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the column of Water or Mercury is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50395:88"/>by that counterpoiſe driven up in the Tube. This Tube being but of eighteen Inches long, the forreign Atmoſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal pillar ſtill will urge the Water or Mercury to riſe to an <hi>aequipondium</hi> with it, namely the Mercury to twenty nine Inches, the Water to thirty one foot, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And conſequently, according to their Suppoſition, the Cylinder of Water, in the inſtance in queſtion, within the Tube, preſſeth up the Tube, and would lift it up to one and thirty foot high, had the Tube been long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But as the Atmoſpherical Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der without the Tube preſſeth up the Water, ſo the Atmoſpherical Cylinder incumbent upon the head of the Tube, preſſeth it down; and ſo according to thoſe men it is not the Waten in the Tube, that gives any counterpoiſe to the oppoſite Scale, but the Atmoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Cylinder, anſwerable to the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Tube, that preſſeth upon the head of the Tube.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And that weight of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpherical
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50395:88"/>Cylinder upon the head of the Tube, is counterpoiſed by the forreign Cylinder, abating only ſo much, as the proportion of the Water thruſt or kept up in the Tube, amounteth to; which being in the inſtance in hand about a twentieth part of what the forreign At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical pillar weighs, the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpherical pillar incumbent upon the head of the Tube weighs juſt ſo much as the Water included in the Tube a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts unto. But upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this fine Theory appears to be but a handſom Imagination. For it is plain, in the inſtance in hand, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical Cylinder, incumbent upon the head of the Tube, is larger than the cavity of the Tube, and conſequently more weighty by far (if it have any weight at all) than that forreign Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Atmoſphere, which is ſuppoſed to ſuſtain the included column of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Tube it ſelf is not ſuſtained nor ſuſtainable by the Water in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but is wholly raiſed by the weight in the oppoſite Scale: and therefore the Suppoſition, that the weight that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50395:89"/>upon the Scale, is the weight of the Cylinder of Air upon the Tube it ſelf, is vain; for then it ſhould ſuſtain the weight, not only of the Tube, but another weight far greater than the forreign column of Air could counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe.</p>
               <p>And that which ſeems to me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this miſtake in the whole propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Theory, is this plain and obvious Experiment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> 10. I therefore took a Glaſs-tube of about half an Inch diameter, 18 Inches long, cloſed at one end; and weighing it exactly in the open Air, it weighed two Ounces and three quarters of an Ounce, and heating it very hot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the included Air was highly rarified, I ſuſpended the cloſed end upon one Scale of a Ballance, and let the open end ſink a little into a veſſel of Water, and counterpoiſed it in the other Scale with two Ounces three quarters; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the end of the Tube did but little more than touch the Water, it held the ſame weight as before upon the Scale, <hi>viz.</hi> two Ounces three quarters.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:50395:89"/>
               <p>As ſoon as the Tube was thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the Water, it attracted and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Water ſo, that in half a quarter of an hour the Tube was filled twelve Inches with Water, the Air contracting in ſelf to ſix Inches in the top of the Tube, whereby it appears it was rarified two thirds beyond its natural and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary riſe and ſtandard, which now againe it acquired by contracting it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Water which it attracted being carefully marked at its higheſt Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then ſtrictly meaſured, weighed one Ounce and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Now the things obſervable in this inſtance are theſe. 1. That the ſingle Tube, with the included rarified Air, did really weigh even in the external Air but two Ounces three quarters, and by that weight in the oppoſite Scale it was perfectly kept <hi>in aequilibrio.</hi> 2. That when it touched the Superficies of the Water, and thereby attracted the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it, it preſently grew more weighty, which it gradually increaſed, and accordingly more and more ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Tube and all, into the ſubjected
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50395:90"/>veſſel of Water, as it received into it more Water, and conſequently grew more weighty, 'till its full comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 12 Inches of Water drawn up into it 3. That when it was filled with twelve Inches of Water, then it weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the full weight of the Tube, and the Water <hi>viz.</hi> two Ounces three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the weight of the Tube, and one Ounce and a quarter for the weight of the Water <hi>intato</hi> four Ounces, and therefore four Ounces in the oppoſite Scale would keep it juſt <hi>in aquibrio.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care muſt be taken, either by depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Water, or raiſing the Ballance, that the Tube muſt only touch the top of the Water, for otherwiſe the Water will run out, and prevent the tryal. Now to diſcover what it is that thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the Tube gradually, as the Water riſeth up into the Tube, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the weight of the Tube, or the weight of the Water included in it, I will conſider, 1. What the external column of Air, which thoſe Maſters ſuppoſe to preſs up the Water in the Tube, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50395:90"/>to it. and ſurely according to this Suppoſition of theirs, this is ſo far from cauſing any acceſs of Gravitation to the Tube or Water included in it, that it rather preſſeth up the Tube, by preſſing and impelling the Water into it, and indeed it is that which they themſelves ſay, and build their Theories upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> that for this reaſon the Water in the Tube weighs nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What the column of Air impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the top of the Tube, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate in diameter to the cavity of the Tube, doth contribute, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Solution muſt be it that weighs down the Tube by preſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. But certainly this doth nothing in this caſe; for if the Tube it ſelf, filled with rarified Air, weighs in the open Air but two Ounces three quarters, it can never come to weigh four Ounces when in the Water, (where by reaſon of the thickneſs of the <hi>medium,</hi> it muſt loſe, and not gain weight,) and it had the ſame column of Air impendent upon its top, as well before its immerſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water, as after. And before its
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50395:91"/>immerſion (whether it were full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Air, or of Air thus highly rarified by heat) it ſtill weighed neither more nor leſs than two Ounces three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p n="2">3. Therefore it remains, that it is the weight of the Water, that thus creeps up in the Tube, and in its aſcent to twelve Inches weighed juſt one Ounce and a quarter that gravitates in the Tube, and renders the weight of the whole to be four Ounces, which in the oppoſite Scale holds both Tube and Water <hi>in aeguilibrio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Tube is ſuſpended to the Ballance by the ſtring or thrid, ſo the included rarified Air is ſuſpended to the top of the cavity of the Tube, by the powerful Laws of Nature, and lays hold upon the Superficies of the Water; and as it contracts it ſelf more and more, draws up the column of Water higher and higher; as a Lute-ſtring faſtned to a fixed Body above, and to a ſmall Weight below, after a high tenſion raiſeth the Weight by contracting it ſelf, and this to maintain the continuity of the parts of Nature.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:50395:91"/>
               <p>And this is a plain ſenſible and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Solution; and it ſeems to me, that thoſe that tell us, that it is only the Tube, and the incumbent Cylinder of Air only, that gives the weight, were impoſed upon, though not by ignorance of Statical Laws, yet by fondneſs and partiality to a new invented <hi>hypotheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Inſtance that I ſhall give, ſhall be this: Take a Glaſs Tube, cloſed at one end, of an Inch diameter in the cavity; fill it with Mercury, ſtop it with a ſmall Engine, and invert it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a veſſel of reſtagnant Mercury of an Inch and half diameter; then opening it by a contrivance which is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, after it is inverted in the Mercury, the Mercury will be ſuſtained at twenty nine Inches and half, as well as if the veſſel of reſtagnant Mercury were of ſix Inches diameter.</p>
               <p>And yet it is apparent, that the rim or round Superficies of the veſſel of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnant Mercury, is not above one fourth part in <hi>area</hi> of the Mercurial Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder, and cannot be preſſed with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Air commenſurate to the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50395:92"/>of the Tube; for the incircling co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Mercury is not a fourth part of the <hi>area</hi> of the Tube, neither can it be preſſed with a column of Air of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diameter or dimenſion than that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rim of Mercury that incompaſſeth the Tube. So that it is not the <hi>aequipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of the Atmoſpherical Column that ſuſtains the Mercury in the Tube, for if it ſhould; a column of Air of the fourth part of an Inch diameter, ſhould be as weighty as a column of Air of an Inch diameter, becauſe it muſt in this Inſtance make an <hi>aequipondium</hi> to a weight of Mercury, commenſurate to a column of Air of an Inch diameter.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not the <hi>aequipondium</hi> of the Air that ſuſtains the Mercury in the Tube, but ſomething elſe, and what that is, we ſhall here after examine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. My third Inſtance is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one: If the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Engine be put in practice, in a great Glaſs Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, wholly excluding any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the forreign Air, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury will be ſuſpended at twenty nine Inches and half, as well as in the free
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50395:92"/>Air. And yet here can be no Atomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpherical column, reaching from the top of the Atmoſphere to the reſtagnant Mercury, with its Gravitation, to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the Mercurial column, the ſame being intercepted and broken by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the Glaſs.</p>
               <p>And this plain obvious evident In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance had wholly deſtroyed the <hi>hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and utterly diſordered and ſcattered all the <hi>poriſmata</hi> and Conſequences built upon it, had not another ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental invention ſtept in to relieve it, namely the prodigious Elatery of the free Air, which upon a due examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will prove as great a miſtake, and as impotent to relieve this deficient <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> as the former; and if it prove ſo, I doubt our new Philoſophers muſt be fain to return to the <hi>decantata fuga vacui</hi> for a better Solution.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Come now to conſider that ſubſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary help, ſubſtituted by the New Philoſophy, for the Solution of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Experiments of this nature: and herein I ſhall conſider theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What Elatery or Spring is of all hands agreed to be truly found in the Air.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Elatery or Spring is ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the late Philoſophy, and how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by them to the Solution of <hi>phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of this kind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Arguments, Reaſons, and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that evince the miſtake of this new Elaterical Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as to the former of theſe, this is agreed of all hands, that the Air being a ſubtle Fluid, is capable of an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Elaſticity of very great efficacy and force: namely, when by accidental im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50395:93"/>upon it, it loſeth that common and natural ſtate or conſiſtence, that otherwiſe belongs to it.</p>
               <p>As I. by a great compreſſion of its parts together, ſuch as we ſee in Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guns, whereby it is compreſſed into a ſpace ſometimes ſeven times leſs than that which is natural to it, and then by a natural and ſtrange motion of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it hath an Elaſticity, whereby to regain its natural ſtate and poſition. 2. By conſtipation of its parts by Cold, whereby it is bound up ſometimes to a narrower room, and then by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of convenient heat, that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation is relaxed, and the Air regains its natural liberty, motion, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency: and 3. by Rarifaction by heat, whereby it is expanded beyond its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſize, and as it grows cold, it obtains a kind of Elaſticity in ward, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward endeavouring to contract it ſelf to its natural ſize and dimenſion. 4. In a ſtrong tenſion by an accidental or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral force, whereupon it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts it ſelf as much as it can to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, and reſiſts that tenſion
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50395:94"/>which diſcompoſeth and extends it; from whence follows that which is uſually called Suction, or Attraction, of which I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to write more at large.</p>
               <p>Again 2. it muſt be agreed, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Air in its natural conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence is by a great force compreſſible into a cloſe order, yet it doth reſiſt ſuch a compreſſion, and doth not eaſily yeild to it; and therefore take a Tube of any conſiderable length, cloſed at one end, and the open end inverted upon the Water, and preſſed down, yet the Air included will retain very much of its natural ſtate, and receives but a ſmall contraction by the counterpreſſure of the Water, poſſibly an Inch in two or three, or ſomewhat more, according to the depth of its immerſion.</p>
               <p>But theſe Elateries are not ſuch as concern the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>Therefore I come to the Suppoſition of the new Philoſophy, in relation to this buſineſs of Elaſticity of the Air, which the attribute to the common and free Air in which we breath and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50395:94"/>live; and if I miſtake them not, their Suppoſition is this: I. That the Air is a kind of Spungy Body, not much unlike (as to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to a Spunge or Fleece of Wool, capable of compreſſion, and under that compreſſion endeavouring to looſen and diſcharge it ſelf by that which we call Springineſs or Elaſticity.</p>
               <p>And herein we do not conſiderably differ, only they ſay that this Elaſticity is of a vaſt, and almoſt unlimited nature, that ſcarce hath any bounds to it; we ſay that it hath more contracted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined limits of its Elaſticity, and thoſe are ſuch as every portion of free Air obtains in a common and uſual ſtate of the temperament of the Weather.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again they ſay, that the Body of the Air, or at leaſt of the Atmoſphere, conſiſts of a great many little crooked filaments like Springes, which when extended to a greater ſtraightneſs than is ſuitable to them, as in its high tenſion or rarifaction, indeavour regaining of their natural curvitude; and when by any weight or force they are drawn cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50395:95"/>they, ſpring out to their juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and that gives a common Springineſs to the Air in ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence or circumſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the ſuperior parts of the Air gradually gravitate and compreſs the inferior parts, and therefore the higher the Atmoſphere or Air is, the leſs it is compreſſed, but the lower it is, the more it is compreſſed, the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts receiving and ſuſtaining the preſſure of all theſe parts that are above.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the actual Elatery, or Spring of the Atmoſphere, or Air, is the iſſue or effect of this Gravitation; and the more the Gravitation is, the greater the Spring of thoſe parts are, when they can but get liberty to expand themſelves; for the greater weight doth the more bind and incurvate theſe crooked filaments, which makes them fly out extremely, when they can get themſelves unfettered from the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing weight, and even while they are under that preſſure they have their <hi>cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us</hi> for their liberty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That becauſe the lower parts of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50395:95"/>the Air next the Earth are moſt preſſed upon by the ſuperior parts, therefore the lower parts of the Air have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Elaſticity and Springineſs, which it exerciſeth according as it gets liberty.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That therefore this inferior Air hath a natural vaſt propenſion to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and amplifying of it ſelf, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if we ſhould ſuppoſe any part of the Univerſe were free from any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or had a more ſubtle Body than that of the common Air, if a portion of the lower Air next the Earth were placed there, it would upon the account of its own natural Elaſticity, expand it ſelf as largely, and it may be much larger than thoſe Artificial Expanſions wrought by fire in <hi>AEolipiles,</hi> and other Engines, wherein nevertheleſs the Air may be ſo ordered, as to poſſeſs ſeventy times more room than before it had.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That therefore when we ſee a little portion of Air included in a Tube, in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the deſcent of the Mercury four, five, or ſix Inches, or into a larger room than it poſſeſſed upon its firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50395:96"/>this is no forced tenſion of the Air, but a free natural expanſion of it ſelf, having gained room and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by the deſcent of the Mercury, for its recception; and therefore this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expanſion of that included particle of Air, is one great help towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Mercury, 'till it comes to its ſtation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That in as much as the Elaſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Air, when contiguous to the Earth, or other ſolid Body, is impeded in its Elaſticity downward by the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Earth, it is as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberated upward, and laterally, where it may be exerciſed: which is a great means of that ſupport that the recoiling Aereal particles give to weighty Bodies, which is ſeen in the ſuſtentation of the lower of the adhering Marbles.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That every part of the lower Air is under the ſame compreſſion with the ſame region wherein it is, and therefore if a portion of the free or open Air be incloſed within a Glaſs-Receiver, cloſed on every ſide, yet it hath the ſame Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity that the portion of Air had, out of which it was taken.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:50395:96"/>
               <p n="10">10. And becauſe that Airin the Glaſs is on every ſide penned up, and its Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity being as it were reverberated from every ſide of the Glaſs, doth the more intenſely and forcibly recoil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and therefore it comes to paſs, that though the great Glaſs Receiver, compaſſing in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Engine on every ſide, be deſtitute of the weight of the column of Atmoſphere, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Mercury by its <hi>aequipondium;</hi> yet the included Air doth the very ſame thing by its Elatery or Spring upon the reſtagnant Mercury.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee how, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating of the <hi>Torricellian phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi> and ſome others of like nature, where the <hi>pondus Atmoſphoericum</hi> cannot be had nor acquired, what a laborious invention and proceſs is framed for the ſupply of that deficiency.</p>
               <p>Therefore I come to conſiderand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, whether this laborious proceſs have any thing of truth and reality in it, or whether, as that of the <hi>pondus cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dri Atmoſpharici,</hi> it be only a fine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to help and ſupport a lame and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50395:97"/>languiſhing <hi>hypotheſis</hi> or Solutions.</p>
               <p>Although whatſoever doth oppoſe the Gravitation of the commen Air, doth as neceſſarily conclude againſt this Elaſticity of the free and common Air; and although much of what I have written in the third and tenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, againſt the Gravithtion of the Air, is equally applicable againſt this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Elaſticity thereof, ſince the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity is by the <hi>hypotheſis</hi> ſuppoſed to be the effect of its Gravitation; yet I ſhall repete nothing, or very little, of what I have there ſaid, but apply my ſelf ſingly to the diſcuſſion of this Elatery or Sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſs of the common or free Air, both by Reaſon and by Experiments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spring of the Air is bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſuppoſition of the actual preſſure of the ſuperior parts of the Air or Atmoſphere upon the inferior, and the lower parts being under the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſſure, hath conſequently the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Elatery. But upon what hath been before ſaid, in the third Chapter, there is no ſuch Gravitation or preſſure of the Air or Atmoſphere, and conſequently
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50395:97"/>no ſuch Elatery in the free and open Air.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there ſhould be admitted any ſuch Elaſticity in a portion of the Air below in this inferior region, included within a Glaſs veſſel or Receiver, (the inſtance for whoſe ſake this invention was principally deviſed,) ſo as to ſuſtain the ſuſpended column of Mercury, then of neceſſity there muſt be the ſame Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity of the ſame or the like portion of the common Air, (for it is all ſuppoſed under the ſame common preſſure of the ſuperior parts:) the conſequence where of muſt needs be, that either the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of that Suſpenſion to the Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Column of the Air, and all the delicate Conſectaries thereupon, are more Fancies and Miſtakes, becauſe the whole <hi>phaenomenon</hi> is performable and performed by the Elaſticity of the Air, as well without as within this cloſe Glaſs veſſel; or elſe the joint power of the <hi>pondus,</hi> as well as the Elaſticity of the forreign Air, muſt raiſe the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Tube to fifty nine Inches, ſince the Elarery of the Air alone, without
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50395:98"/>the aid of the Gravity of the Atmoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Cylinder in the incloſed veſſel, is able to keep it ſuſpended to twenty nine Inches and half. But we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the Experiment tried, as well within as without the incloſed Glaſs; therefore either the weight of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical Cylinder, or its Elatery, muſt be laid aſide in this Solution, or, which is the truer Concluſion, neither the one nor the other are to be admitted, but both are to be rejected as croſſing one another, and alſo the truth of the Solution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, but yet farther, if this Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery be admitted, the whole Scheme of the Gravitation of the Air, or any part thereof, muſt be rejected as fictitious, and impoſſible; and on the other ſide, if the ſuppoſed Gravitation of the Air or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical Cylinder be admitted, the Elatery muſt be rejected, and the whole Air will be <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> in as much as upon this ſuppoſition of this New Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, the Elatery preſſeth as much upward, as the Gravitation doth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and <hi>è converſo</hi> the Gravitation as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50395:98"/>much downward, as the Elatery doth upward: ſo that after all this laborious <hi>apparatus</hi> of Gravitation, and Cylinders, and Atmoſphere, and Elatery, the Air is at quiet, at reſt, and <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> which is eaſily granted without all this difficult <hi>hypotheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For according to theſe mens ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if we ſhould admit it) the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere were ſeven Miles high, we muſt needs ſuppoſe that the greateſt Elatery is next the Superficies of the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there it is more charged with the weight of the ſuperior parts of the Air; and becauſe the rerreſtrial Globe checks the Elatery of it downward; the Elatery muſt diſcharge it ſelf by its motion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſo encounter the preſſure of the Air, by how much more its Springs and crooked Particles are charged. And a Mile higher in the Atmoſphere where is leſs preſſure, there is conſequently leſs Elatery or reſiſtance of that preſſure, and yet ſufficient to keep that rundle of Atmoſphere in an <hi>aequilibrium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is plain, that this Connter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the ſuppoſed Spring, or Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50395:99"/>and Gravitation of the Air, muſt by their mutual conflict, one cheok and refract the other.</p>
               <p>But then it is hoped, that the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of another groſs Body between the ponderous Air tending downward, and the reverberated, recoiling, Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Air tending upward, may part the fray; and thereupon in the inſtance of the two cohering Marbles, the upper column of impending Air may preſs down the upper Marble, and the lower column of recoiling Air may preſs up the lower Marble.</p>
               <p>But this will do nothing to help the buſineſs in hand, touching the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial column in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for as for the coheſion of the two Marbles, and the reaſon of it, I ſhall in its due place examine.)</p>
               <p>For it is plain there, that if there be any Elaſticity in the Air next the Earth, there is proportion for proportion as much Elaſticity in the Air next the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnant Mercury, upon which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, and which we may if we pleaſe, place even to the Superficies of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50395:99"/>the Earth; for the column of Air (<hi>ex ſuppoſitione</hi>) proportionable in baſe to the Mercury, is as really gravitating upon the Mercury, as upon the Earth, and conſequently there is the very ſame Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or <hi>ſurſum</hi> preſſure of inferior parts of that Atmoſpherical pillar incumbent upon the Mercury, that would break the Gravitation of that upper Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpherical Cylinder, and render it inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, as it requires a ſtrong Phantaſy to ſuppoſe this wonderful Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity of the Air, ſo it requires a much more potent phantaſy to keep the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity of it within the preciſe lateral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the Atmoſpherical pillar in a ſtraight line: for the Elaſtical par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Aereal parts, adjacent to that Atmoſpherical Cylinder, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach and break it upon this Cylinder, and diſorder and refract its preſſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what the concuſſion of Winds would effect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But ſuppoſe in the free Air the <hi>pondus deprimens</hi> of the Atmoſpherical Cylinder were too hard for its Elatery,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50395:100"/>ſo although in an incloſed Glaſs the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery doth the whole buſineſs in ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Mercury in the Tube, yet in the open Air the <hi>pondus deprimens</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers its Elaſticity, and the whole <hi>phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> ſhall be there performed by the <hi>pondus deprimens</hi> of the aereal Cylinder: I ſay ſuch a Suppoſition as this would render the lower parts of the Air unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable, and bind it up ſo, that it could never ſtir without an admirable relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by the violence of heat, which is contrary to all the experience of the World. For we ſee by the ſmalleſt winds the motion of Smoak, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Inſtances more, the lower parts of the Air are in a perpetual flux and motion, which it could never do, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo rigorous a conſtipation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion by its ſuperior parts. And though this immediately contradicts the great preſſure of the inferior Air by the ſuperior, yet by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it contradicts the ſuppoſed Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But as to the very inſtance before given, of the ſuſpenſion of the Mercury
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50395:100"/>in a Tube placed in a cloſed Glaſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, protected from the impendent aereal ponderous Cylinder; I ſay, that the ſuſpenſion of the Mercury is not cauſed either by the Weight or the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the Air. Not by its weight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Atmoſpherical column is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, and kept off by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Glaſs; it remains therefore that it muſt be done by the Elatery or Spring of the Air included in the veſſel: but that cannot poſſibly do it, for theſe Reaſons. 1. Becauſe that Elatery that muſt ſuſtain the column of Mercury, cannot be an Elatery preſſing upward or laterally, but it muſt be ſuch an Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery as muſt preſs downward, to bear againſt the excurſion of the ſuſpended column of Mercury, and thereby keep it <hi>in aequilibrio:</hi> and certainly if there be any Elatery of the Air, it muſt bear ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upward againſt what preſſeth it down, and cauſeth it, than downward. 2. But if it be ſaid that by the Receiver, or Glaſs incloſing the Air every way, the Elatery is as well turned downward as upward, and ſo counterpoiſeth the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50395:101"/>of Mercury, and ſo it is not like the recoil of the Spring of the Air from the Earth, which muſt be principally upward, becauſe checked and reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated at its baſe; but here the reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion is from all parts of the Glaſs, as well from above as beneath. I ſay this very objection renders it utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the Elatery of the Air in the Glaſs can cauſe this Suſpenſion, or in any meaſure contribute to it. For let us ſuppoſe the Glaſs Receiver to be ſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, the repercuſſion of the Elatery of the Air muſt be equal from all parts: the conſequence whereof muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be, than this Elatery preſſeth as well upwards as downward, and from every part of the Spherical cavity of the Glaſs, the conſequence whereof muſt needs be, that the whole Elatery is in ſuſpence, and one Elaſtical line breaks, refracts, and retunds, another; ſo that the tendency of this Elaſticity is neither upwards nor downwards, not from any point of the Compaſs, but all things are at reſt, as where Winds blow with an equal ſtrength every way, the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50395:101"/>Air is undiſturbed, and ſo no preſſure at all made upon the Mercury, but it is but a meer evaſion to ſhore up an <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</hi>

                  <hi>Certain Experiments, evincing that the common Air in its ordinary conſiſtence, hath no, or no conſiderable. Elaſticity or Spring, without an accidental or preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Compreſſion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the former Chapter I have given the reaſons againſt the wonderful Elaſticity of the Air, or Atmoſphere, and the inſufficiency of that Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to give a Solution to the <hi>phaenomena</hi> in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment. And I now come to ſome experimental Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, farther illuſtrating and proving what I have ſaid in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely that either there is no Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity at all in the common Air, nor in any part thereof incloſed in the veſſel, <hi>de quo ſupra,</hi> or if any at all, yet very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50395:102"/>and ſuch as is no ways able to keep ſuch a column of Mercury ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which may poſſibly weigh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the amplitude of the Tube two or three pounds, which yet we ſee ſuſpended in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
               <p>For it is a certain and demonſtrable truth, that if any <hi>potentia,</hi> be it what it will, ſuſtains a weight or <hi>pondus depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> the <hi>potentia ſuſtentans</hi> muſt be of an equal ſtrength to that weight, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it muſt give way, and yeild to it.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the <hi>potentia</hi> of the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity of the common Air (not compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or conſtipated accidentally) be not equal in this inſtance to two pound of Mercury, it can never ſuſtain or keep it ſuſpended: and this is that which I ſhall endeavour to make good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> 12. Take a Bottle-Glaſs <hi>A,</hi> fill it with Water to <hi>B,</hi> which may contain about ſix Ounces of Water, the reſt of the Bottle full of Air; then take the Bolts-head <hi>C,</hi> heat it very hot, that the Air may be in a great meaſure driven
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50395:102"/>out of it, and the reſt highly rarified and expanded: Invert it into the Glaſs Bottle, ſo that the free Air may come in, (though but at a Pin-hole,) as the Air in the Bolts-head grows cool, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently contracted neer to its natural ſize and ſtate: the Air thus rarified, the Water in the Bottle will be drawn up into the Bolts-head to ſupply the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, which otherwiſe would happen by the reſtitution of the Air. But if the fiſſure between the Bottle and Shank of the Bolts-head had been haſtily ſo clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that no Air could enter into it, ſome Water would ariſe as ſuppoſe to <hi>D,</hi> but the whole Water would never be driven up out of the Bottle by any Elatery of the Air included in it; but only the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Air in <hi>C,</hi> being ſo highly rarified by the heat, that one third part of the Air in <hi>C,</hi> as it ſtood unrarified, takes up the whole Bolts-head by rarifaction; and as the Air in the Bolts-head grows to its natural temper, and conſequently endeavours to retract it ſelf to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dimenſion, ſo having the fluid Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to work upon, it draws it up, and by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50395:103"/>the advantage of that attraction gives a tenſion or expanſion to the Air in the upper part of the Bottle, as much as is capable to be obtained by the ſtrength of the attraction and ſuction of the rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Air in the Bolts-head, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Water, and leaving leſs Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there than before, muſt needs expand the incloſed Air in the top of the Bottle, to ſupply that receſs.</p>
               <p>Now if the Air in the head of the Bottle, being taken out of the common Air, and of the ſame conſiſtence with it, had that ſtrong Elatery that theſe men ſuppoſe, ſo that it reacheth as it were after a dimenſion five, nay forty times larger than that it hath, it would thruſt up the whole Water in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as high as <hi>E,</hi> as it would have done if the fiſſure between the Bolts-head and the Bottle had not been ſtrictly cloſed.</p>
               <p>And this it ſhould have done the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe the ſuperior Air is ſo much rarified, that it takes up three times the room of common unexpanded Air, and ſo is capable of a more effectual impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Air in the Bottle, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50395:103"/>would not reſt at <hi>D,</hi> but drive up the Water as high as <hi>E.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any ſhall ſay, that the weight of the interpoſed Water is too great for its Elatery, to thruſt it up as high as <hi>E;</hi> certainly he that ſhall ſuppoſe that the Elatery of the Air, included in a cloſe Receiver, is able to thruſt and keep a column of Mercury to twenty nine Inches high, which column weighs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly a pound or more, cannot doubt but the Elatery of the Air in the top of the Bottle, if it were of that force that theſe men ſuppoſe, would thruſt up five or ſix Ounces of Water, about five or ſix Inches high, into the Bolts head.</p>
               <p>But the plain truth is, that in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, nor any of the like nature, it is neither the weight nor the Elatery of the Air included in the Bottle, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth up any drop of Water above its Superficies, but the powerful attraction of the expanded Air in the Bolts-head, endeavouring its own contraction when growing cold, and ſo attracting the Water to ſupply that <hi>caſma,</hi> that would otherwiſe follow upon its attraction.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:50395:104"/>
               <p>And therefore when by the deſcent of the Mercury a little portion of Air in the top of the Tube in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Engin, gains four or five times a greater extent than it had before; this is done by the tenſion of that little aereal Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the force of the deſcent of the Mercury, as ſhall be more at large ſhewn hereafter, and not as is groundleſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the natural Elaſticity or expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that portion of Air. For if that ſhould be the cauſe, it were neceſſary that the finger ſtopping the top of the inverted Tube open at both ends, ſhould be thruſt up, and not drawn in, and an empty Bladder ſhould be more compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed than diſtended by ſuch Elaſticity of the included Air, the contrary whereof is evident both to Senſe and Experience.</p>

                  <hi>The conſideration of ſome Arguments for the weight and Elatery of the Air.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall not ſpend much time upon Theſe arguments, but only note ſome general Obſervations upon them, and then ſingle out ſome Inſtances wherein I ſhall be more particular.</p>
               <p>In general therefore I ſay, 1. That all thoſe Inſtances and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments produced to prove ſuch a Weight or Elaſticity of the free Air, that may be capable of effecting the <hi>phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, yea or in the <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> Inſtrument, or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Air-pump, are all capable of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Solution, as appears by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that <hi>Linus</hi> hath given to them, which I need not repeat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the application of the Weight and Elaſticity of the Air to the Solution of theſe <hi>phaenomena,</hi> is forced, ſtreined, and in many inſtances contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50395:105"/>to the evidence of Senſe; ſo that though the appearances themſelves are true, yet thoſe Cauſes aſſigned are very inevident, full of difficulties and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and require ſuch a train of ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Suppoſitions to make them but Tolerably applicable, that no man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged from a party can eaſily ſubſcribe to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there are ſome Inſtances and Experiments that are ſo untractable to this method of Solution, that all the inventions of the moſt Mercurial wits and higheſt ingaged in the patronage thereof, cannot by any means relieve it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the plain and common So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of them by the inſeparability of Bodies, and the <hi>fuga vacui,</hi> (pleaſantly by ſome ſtiled <hi>decantata olim fuga vacui</hi>) doth moſt naturally, and without any ſtreſs offered to Senſe or Nature, anſwer all Inſtances and difficulties, and fails in none.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That it is moſt evident to any man, that without prejudice or partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall obſerve it, all or the moſt part of thoſe Inſtances and Experiments,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50395:105"/>which (to ſerve the <hi>hypotheſis</hi> of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation and Elaſticity of the common Air) are reſolved into Preſſion or Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity of the Air, are plainly performed by Suction and Attraction of the Air, when put under a great tenſion or rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which wholly ſubverts the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution by Preſſure or Elaſticity of the Air.</p>
               <p>Now as to ſome particular Inſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we are told that the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Engin, wherein at the bot<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of the hill, the Mercury riſeth to twenty nine Inches and half, carried up to the top of the hill <hi>Puy de dome</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> ſubſided three Inches: and ſome Inſtances of like nature given in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides neer two Inches. From whence it is inferred, that this variation ariſeth, becauſe upon the top of the Mountain, which was 3000 foot high, the column of the Atmoſphere was ſhorter, and ſo gravitated leſs upon the reſtagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, than it did at the bottom of the hill, which cauſed the diſparity of the poſition.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, admitting the fact true, yet
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50395:106"/>the cauſe aſſigned is <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa,</hi> or at leaſt we have no ſufficient evidence that this is the cauſe.</p>
               <p>The various Elevation or depreſſion of the Mercury is not in reſpect of the height or lowneſs of the place, where the Inſtrument is uſed, but in reſpect of the temperamont of the Air wherein it is uſed. The Excellent Author tells us, in his eighteenth Experiment, that the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Engin placed in his Chamb<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> window for a good ſeaſon, the Mercury had various Elevations and ſubſidings, according to the temper of the Air; and that this variation was conſiderable, namely two Inches, and that in cold weather, contrary to the uſe of other Weather-Glaſſes, it fell much lower than at other times. And if this beſo, it is no wonder, at the top of the hill, where the Air was much colder, it might ſubſide conſiderably from the height it had at the bottom.</p>
               <p>But whether it were colder or hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet certainly there is that difference of temperament in the various regions of the Air, that might make a various
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50395:106"/>poſition in the Mercury. What if we ſhould ſay, that the <hi>vis igneapenetrativa AEtheris</hi> is ſtronger there than below the hill, and ſo might ſtrongly dilate that ſmall portion of Air upon the top of the hill, though the ſenſe of heat be there leſs?</p>
               <p>But I cannot chuſe but obſerve, that if we ſhould aſſign this Subſidency of three Inches of Mercury to the ſhortning of the Atmoſpherical Cylinder, by 500 Fathoms of perpendicular height; we muſt neceſſarily conclude the great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in the computation of the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Air or Atmoſphere, and muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it of a prodigious height beyond all the Eſtimates of the latter Elateriſts, whereof ſome tell us it is ſeven Miles high. By others Computation that it is 33893 Feet, which is 5648 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, ſomewhat leſs than ſeven Miles.</p>
               <p>But if a Mile next the Earth ſhould abate but three Inches in the height of the Mercury, ſix Miles more would hardly abate three Inches more, <hi>viz.</hi> ſix Inches; nor twenty four Miles more
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50395:107"/>would abate nine Inches. For a Mile of Air next the Earth (if the gravitation of the Air ſhould be admitted) would more than ten times counterpoiſe the next Mile about it, becauſe it hath theſe advantages, 1. of the greater incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent weight of the ſuperior Air, 2. of the ſtubborn reſiſtance of the terreſtrial Globe, whereby it is more conſtipated and bound together the nearer it is to its reflexion and repercuſſion. 3. The great concrement and acceſſion that it hath of groſſer vapors, and terreſtrial effluxes, wherewith the lower parts muſt needs be more laden than the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſo that form the firſt gravitating particle of Air or Atmoſphere to the loweſt, it will increaſe by a Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Progreſſion in every part, as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or very near it, which will render the loweſt Mile prodigiouſly more weighty than any of the ſuperior Miles.</p>
               <p>But I diſmiſs this buſineſs of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the free Air as a meer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Inſtances to prove the Elaſticity of the Air, are for the moſt part ſuch as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50395:107"/>are endeavoured to be made out by the tenſion or rarifaction of the Air by the Wind-pump, or <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the anſwer to any one of them gives an anſwer to all, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them to the Elaſticity or Spring of the included Air is bottomed upon one common miſtaken ground. I ſhall therefore mention but one or two of them.</p>
               <p>The Excellent Author in his Book of <hi>Phyſico-Mechanical</hi> Experiments, <hi>Exp.</hi> 5. gives an account, how a dry Bladder well tied, and blown moderately full, and faſtned into the inſide of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the Air-pump, upon a ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtion of the Pump was broken; and in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experiment, a Glaſs included in the Receiver, broken by the exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the Air. And in the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of new Experiments, <hi>Exper.</hi> 7 and 9, the ſame Inſtance of breaking of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Bladders and Glaſſes is repeted, and attributed always to the natural dilatation of the internal Air included in the Glaſs and Bladder, the circumja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Air being rarified by tenſion.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:50395:108"/>
               <p>But the true Solution of both is quite another matter. The Bladder is dilated by the attraction wrought by the tenſed or expanded Air, upon the outſide of the Bladder, and thereby the included Air neceſſarily expanded by that force, ſtretching out the ſides of the Bladder that includes it, and when it is capable of no greater ſtretching it breaks, not by the natural expanſion of the included Air, but by the ſtrong tenſion wrought upon the Bladder by the attraction of rarified or tenſed Air in the Receiver, that tears the Bladder.</p>
               <p>And as to the Sealed Glaſſs-bubble, the fracture thereof with that violence is not by the natural Elaſticity of the Air included in it, but by the ſtrong at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction wrought upon every part of its external Superficies, by the tenſion of the ſtrongly circumjacent tenſed Air in the Receiver.</p>
               <p>And therefore if the Bladder or Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were filled with Water, and cloſed faſt, (which is not capable of any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Elaſticity) I make little queſtion but the ſtrong attraction of the expanded
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50395:108"/>Air in the Receiver would break the Glaſs and Bladder, eſpecially if it have any angles, (though I confeſs I cannot be very confident of what I never tried.)</p>
               <p>And yet if it ſhould ſucceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as I ſuppoſe, though the natural Elaſticity of included Air would be thereby convinced of untruth; I expect there muſt be another expedient inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Elateriſts to ſalve it, <hi>viz.</hi> as prodigious a weight in the included Water, as there is ſuppoſed an Elaſticity in the included Air.</p>
               <p>In the late Book intituled, <hi>New Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments about the Preſſure and Spring of Air upon Bodies under Water,</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſecond, I find this Experiment, which is to the effect following.</p>
               <p>Take a Bladder, and ſqueezing out the greateſt part of its Air, tye the neck very cloſe, and faſtning a competent Weight to it, place it in a great large Glaſs, and placing that Glaſs upon the Air-pump, fill it with Water, and then covering the Glaſs with a large Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well luted to the Pump, the Air pumped out of the large Receiver, the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50395:109"/>Bladder below the Water would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſwell, 'till by often pumping out the Air, the Bladder would be full blown. And the Suppoſition is this, that the Air being highly rarified and extended in the Receiver, whereby the ſtrength of its counterpreſſure or Spring was weakned and abated; the little portion of Air in the Bladder, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the interpoſition of the Water, having the advantage thereby of expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if ſelf, did accordingly fill up the Bladder.</p>
               <p>The truth of the fact is unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the Solution of it by the natural Spring of the Air in the Bladder, is an aſſignation of <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa;</hi> but the true Cauſe is, that by the ſtrong tenſion of the Air in the Receiver, it lays hold and attracts upon all the parts of the Water, and all that is included in it, and the Bladder being within the reach of that forcible attraction, hath its ſides thereby diſtended, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded portion of Air expanded and rarified by the tenſion upon the Bladder; not by any natural Elaſticity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50395:109"/>Air, but by the forcible attraction wrought upon the external Superficies of the Bladder, and pulling it aſunder, whereby the included Air by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of Nature is neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded to prevent a vacuity.</p>
               <p>And as if there had been no Water interpoſed, the Bladder would thus have been extended, and the Air inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it expanded, by the ſtrong attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the rarified Air in the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; ſo the ſame effect will as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily enſue, notwithſtanding the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the body of Water: for that <hi>vis attractiva</hi> of the expanded Air in the Receiver, though it immediately fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten upon the Superficies of the Water in the veſſel, yet thereby and there with it alſo pervades the whole body of the Water, which being a fluid body hath thereby a tenſion made upon it, and all its parts, and all that is included in it.</p>
               <p>And the truth of this appears beyond diſpute, for the Learned Author in his 19, 21, 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Experiments, tels us, and that truly, that by this pumping and rarifying of the Air in the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50395:110"/>Water, Spirit of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be raiſed to run out of a Glaſs included in it, &amp; that bubbles will thereby be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the bottom of the included veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Water: whereof the true cauſe (whatever be otherwiſe aſſigned) is the forcible attraction of the tenſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded Air in the Receiver upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Water, which ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the whole body of Water, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates to the very fund or bottom of it, and puts it altogether into a various agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>And therefore as this attraction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the whole body of water, ſo it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingeth to the included Bladder in the very ſame manner as it doth upon the Water, though with a more ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeſcence of the Bladder, becauſe more capable of it.</p>
               <p>We need not reſort to a more evident Inſtance than that common and ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous Experiment, yet taken notice of by <hi>Regius,</hi> of immerſing the ſmall end (<hi>Fig.</hi> 13.) of a lighted Tobacco-pipe <hi>B</hi> under Water in a Vial, and ſucking another Pipe <hi>C,</hi> not touching the water,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50395:110"/>the Glaſs being cloſely covered, the ſtrong attraction of the Mouth upon the one Pipe will, through the Water upon the orifice of the immerſed Pipe, draw the Smoak into the other, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the interpoſition of the Water, and will put all the parts of the Water, to the very bottom of it, and the granules of Sand lying at the bottom of the Water, into motion and elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in the Figure.</p>
               <p>And the very ſame Anſwer is moſt clearly to be given to the third and fourth Experiments in that place, and to others of like nature, without recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to an imaginary natural Elaſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a ſmall portion of included Air, whereby to expand it ſelf without any forcible attractions to ſuch a prodigious amplitude.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with what I have to ſay againſt the Solution of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, either by the Weight or Elaſticity of the Air or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere; which to me ſeems a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition contradictory to our very Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a Suppoſition attended with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50395:111"/>abſurdities and inexplicable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p>And yet, as I have before ſaid, it is wonderful to ſee with what tenacity, and with how great confidence it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and how marvellouſly it hath obtained among the <hi>gens literata,</hi> and what Syſtems of new Phyſicks, what rare trains of Conſequences, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, <hi>poriſmata, Scholia,</hi> it hath mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied! wherein if the Foundation it ſelf prove but a miſtake, men have ſpent much labour in vain upon it.</p>
               <p>Therefore laying aſide this Solution as untrue, I proceed to that which the more ſteady Modern Philoſophers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the ancient Principles, have given in this caſe, and ſeems to be moſt conſonant to truth.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the true Cauſe of the ſuſpenſion of the Mercury at twenty nine Inches and half, or there about, in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Engin.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Come now to conſider of that cauſe of the ſuſpenſion of the Mercury at twenty nine Inches and half, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Engin.</p>
               <p>They that aſſign the Diverſity of the Weights of fluid Bodies, tell us; 1. That although Air be intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally heavy, yet it is neer one thouſand times, or as <hi>Merſennus</hi> will have it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1300 times lighter than the like quantity of Water; and this they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to evince by Experiments. But this Concluſion is very doubtful and difficult.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Water is fourteen times, or very neer thereabout, lighter than Mercury, quantity for quantity, and this as it is eaſie to be tryed, ſo upon try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50395:112"/>I find it very neer the truth, though Water it ſelf in ſeveral places differeth ſomewhat in weight, and therefore it is not caſie to make this the common ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard for all Waters, though the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be not conſiderably great.</p>
               <p>Though Water be ordinarily four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times lighter than Mercury, yet this is not the juſt proportion of the ſuſpenſion of one and the other in a Tube.</p>
               <p>For if a Tube of Water, above one and thirty foot long, ſtopt above and immerſed at the other end in reſtagnant Water, it will ſubſide as is ordinarily ſaid to thirty and one foot, others ſay more, whereof ſee the Experiment <hi>apud Schottum in Technicis Curioſis, l. 3. cap. 2. Exper. 2, &amp; 3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the caſe of Mercury, if the Tube of above twenty nine Inches and half long, ſuppoſe four foot, be ſtopt at the top, and immerſed at the open end in reſtagnant Mercury, it will ſubſide to twenty nine Inches and half, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.</p>
               <p>But although in theſe two fluids, of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50395:112"/>this different gravity, the ſubſiding of either vary, yet the reaſon both of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding and ſuſpending of the one and the other will be the ſame.</p>
               <p>Therefore what I ſay in relation to the ſuſpenſion and ſubſiding of Mercury, will be in its reaſon applicable to the other, and therefore I ſhall here only treat of the ſuſpending of Mercury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Inſtruments to try the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment in Water are more maſſy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, but, as I ſaid, the reaſon of one will be the reaſon of the other.</p>
               <p>There be three Inſtances of the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the Mercury in the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Engin, which though they all are reſolvible into one common reaſon, yet that reaſon hath a various application ſeverally to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when the Tube exceedeth in length the ordinary ſtation of the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended Mercury, <hi>viz.</hi> twenty nine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and half, as ſuppoſe it be four foot long, and the Tube receive only thirty Inches of Mercury, or though the Tube be filled more than twenty nine Inches and half of Mercury, yet it is not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50395:113"/>ſo perfectly filled, but that there remains a portion of Air in the head of the Tube, upon its inverting into the reſtagnant Mercury.</p>
               <p>In this Inſtance, if the portion of Air be ſo great before its Expanſion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expanded by the deſcent of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, it can reach below twenty nine Inches and half, as ſuppoſe to 20, 23, 24 Inches or leſs, then the Mercury will ſubſide to that ſcantlet that the portion of Air is extendible unto.</p>
               <p>If the portion of Air be leſs than can be extended, below twenty nine Inches and half, or the diſtance be ſo great that the extenſion of that portion of Air can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by its expanſion ſupply a greater room than what juſt anſwers to that ſtation: as ſuppoſe the Tube were above 4 foot long, and filled with Mercury all but half an Inch, and then inverted into the veſſel of reſtagnant Mercury, whereby before its ſubſiding there would be about half an Inch of free Air in the head of the Tube; and by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Mercury to twenty nine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and half if that little portion of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50395:113"/>Air were yet ſo much as were capable of ſuch an extenſion, it would be extended to that length, <hi>viz.</hi> eighteen Inches and half; but if that task were too hard for ſo ſmall a portion of Air to be extended unto, then the ſame would be ſupplied by the ſubſidiary ſteams and <hi>effluvia</hi> out of the Mercury, to make a retreat for the Mercury, to a deſcent of twenty nine Inches and half, as hath been ſhewn, and ſhall now farther be declared in what follows.</p>
               <p>In this Inſtance theſe things are to be noted. 1. That by the deſcent of the Mercury there is no vacuity left in the place derelicted by the Mercury, as hath been ſhewn <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> That there is no new Air admitted into the Tube <hi>de foris,</hi> as hath been ſhewn before, <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> But that little portion of Air is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the very head of the cavity of the Tube to the ſubſided Mercury, if it be of that ſubſtance that is capable of ſuch an extenſion to the Mercurial ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of twenty nine Inches and half: and if it be too little for ſuch an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it is ſupplied by a ſuitable portion
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50395:114"/>of the Mercurial ſteams, as hath been ſhewn. 4. But that extenſion or dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that little portion of included Air, is not by any natural Elatery or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of its own, as hath been ſhewn in the two former Chapters, for it is a portion of the free Air; but it is a ſtrong tenſion of that portion of included Air, to prevent that <hi>caſma</hi> and ſeparation of Bodies without any thing intervening, or the <hi>fuga vacui,</hi> ſo often mentioned by the Ancients. 5. And conſequently, though in relation to the laws of the Univerſe, it be a natural expanſion or dilatation of the Air in this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>in obſequium naturae univerſalis,</hi> 01 yet in relation to the particular ſtate and conſiſtence of that portion of the Air thus expanded or tenſed by the ſubſiding of the Mercury, it is forced and violent. As the erect poſture of my Body is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to me, while it makes one common compoſition with my Soul and Spirits, and <hi>in Concreto,</hi> though it be violent in relation to the <hi>moles corporea</hi> of my Body, which would otherwiſe fall down to the Earth. 6. And the conſequence of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50395:114"/>this tenſion of the included portion of Air (conſidered conjunctly with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inſeparability of the parts of the Univerſe, which is all one with that which the Ancients called <hi>fuga vacui</hi>) is the ſuſtentation of the Mercury, that column of deſcended Air, which <hi>Linus</hi> not abſurdly calls <hi>funiculus,</hi> being inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably united, and adhering to the top of the Tube at one end, and to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Cylinder at the other end, and this <hi>funiculus aereus</hi> not being capable to be extended farther than to twenty nine Inches and half, being the Mercurial ſtation, by the force of the deſcent of the Mercury, ſuſtains and holds it up at that ſtation: and ſo the <hi>pondus deprimens</hi> of the Mercurial Cylinder is equal to the <hi>potentia ſuperne ſuſtinens</hi> of the Aereal deſcended Cylinder upon it, in a kind of <hi>aequilibrium,</hi> the Mercurial Cylinder by its natural motion endeavouring its deſcent downward, and the aereal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn by a motion of reſtitution to its natural ſize and ſtaple, retracting it as much as it may upward; and the ſame reaſon will hold of the portion of inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50395:115"/>Air, be ſo much as is capable of an extenſion below twenty nine Inches and half of the Tube: but not ſufficient by ſuch a force to be dilated to a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the Mercury out of the Tube, as poſſibly to 20, 15, 10, or 5 Inches from the reſtagnant Mercury, in which caſe the Mercury will ſubſide to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and no lower.</p>
               <p>The reaſon therefore, 1. Why the Mercury ſubſides ſo low as twenty nine Inches and half, its uſual ſtation, (or lower, if the portion of included Air be greater, as is before ſaid) is, becauſe the weight of the deſcending Mercurial co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn is of that ſtrength, to give the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air that tenſion or dilatation. 2. Why it ſubſides no lower, is becauſe when the Air hath attained its utmoſt tenſion that the deſcent of that column of Mercury can give it (which ordinarily is at the height of twenty nine Inches and half) that aereal deſcended Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der holds it there, and keeps it up to that height, the weight of the Mercury being now leſſen'd.</p>
               <p>And that this is the cauſe of its ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50395:115"/>appears evidently by theſe few Inſtances. 1. If the Tube of Mercury in this ſuſtentation be ſuddenly lifted up from the reſtagnant Mercury, there will be a ſtrong reſilition of the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry towards the top of the Tube, that will endanger breaking it; as we ſee a Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, if hanged upon a Nail, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharged with a Weight or ſtrength at the lower end, by which it breaks in the middle, the upper part of it will forcibly <hi>reſilire</hi> in its contraction to its ordinary ſize. 2. If the Tube be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Level in the ſame parallel line to twenty nine Inches and half of the erected Tube, whereby it loſeth its weight by the incumbence that it hath upon the ſides of the declined Tube, the Air will contract it ſelf to its former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, which it had before that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being by this inclination of the Tube delivered from it.</p>
               <p>And they that object againſt the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Air in this caſe; becauſe if it had a tenſion in length, as the Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring hath, it would have likewiſe a contraction in its bredth, and ſo would
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50395:116"/>not fill the Tube, muſt remember that the Air is a tenſible Body of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is at the ſame time tenſible in bredth as well as length, and in ſuch its tenſion as cloſely adheres to the ſides of the Tube, as it doth at one end to the top of the Tube, and at the other end to the Mercurial column.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here enlarge with Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to ſhew, that the tenſion of the Air, or any other tenſible fluid. Body neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily effects attraction on the Bodies to which it is contiguous, but ſhall reſerve that to the following Chapters: and I have been the longer in the explication of this Inſtance, becauſe it fully opens the reaſon of the ſecond Inſtance, which now next follows. Therefore, 2. The ſecond Inſtance is, where a Tube cloſed at one end, above twenty nine Inches long, ſuppoſe it four foot long, is entirely filled with Mercury, and no Air admitted into it, and then inverted into a veſſel of reſtagnant Mercury, without admiſſion of any Air into it, either upon its inverſion or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion, (which though it be difficult,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50395:116"/>may yet be done) in this caſes the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury will ſubſide to twenty nine Inches and half in the Tube.</p>
               <p>This derelicted ſpace of eighteen Inches and half, is, as I have before ſaid, filled with a Mercurial ſteam or vapor, extracted out of the Mercury it ſelf, and abraded from it by the deſcent and compreſſion of the parts of that Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial column, as I have before ſhewn <hi>Chap.</hi> and thereby likewiſe rarified or tenſed, as the Air is in the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>And this being either real Air inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the pores of the Mercury, and expreſſed from it, or elſe a ſubtle Ingredient into the Mercurial compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and extracted, and in its extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction dilated, as the Air is in the former Inſtance. It performs the ſame office in relation to the ſuſpenſion of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, as the included extended Air did in the former Inſtance, and therefore it need not to be repeated.</p>
               <p>Only I ſhall adde this farther, 1. That it appears the extraction of the ſubtle <hi>effluvia,</hi> and their dilatation, is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50395:117"/>with a great ſtreſs or ſtraining of them out of the Mercurial Body, and with little leſs labour extended; which appears by the ſlow deſcent of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, ariſing from the <hi>lucta</hi> or conteſt that grows between the weight of the Mercury deſcending on the one hand, and the ſtraining and abrading of thoſe ſubtle particles, and their tenſion or rarifaction of the other hand. And the like ſlow deſcent there appears in the firſt Inſtance, eſpecially as the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury more and more ſubſides; for then the Mercury having neer acquired its ordinary ſtation, grows lighter, and the ſtrength of its preſſure begins utterly to languiſh and decay too, being neer equally matched with the <hi>potentia ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens</hi> of the extracted ſubtilized particles in this Inſtance, and by the tenſion of the Air in the former inſtance; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof ſhall be farther enlarged, when I come to the third Inſtance. 2. Whereas in the former Inſtance, by the inclining of the Tube, the Air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains its former contracted extent, here by the inclining of the Tube theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50395:117"/>particles extracted out of the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and dilated, are not only contracted, but refumed into the Mercury from which they were extracted, as is ſhewn in the Chapter. 3. That upon the over ſudden Elevation of the Tube out of the reſtagnant Mercury, there will be the like reſilition of the Mercury into the top of the Tube, as in the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>funiculus ſubtilis materiae</hi> the Mercurial column is ſuſtained at twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine Inches and half, as in the former Inſtance of the <hi>funiculus aereus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now how it comes to paſs, that ſince there is yet remaining twenty nine Inches and half in the Tube, which doubtleſs hath a reſidue of ſubtle matter extractable out of it, to ſupply a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter room, that what is yet left above twenty nine Inches and half, how it comes to paſs that by the weight of that twenty nine Inches and half of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there is not more of the Mercurial effluxes extracted and dilated, which may give a total deſcent and evacuation of the Mercurial column into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnant
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50395:118"/>Mercury remains to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which ſhall be done in the third Inſtance which follows.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third inſtance is, when the Tube is but juſt twenty nine Inches and half, or ſhorter, ſuppoſe 25, 20, 10, or 5 Inches long, and filled entirely with Mercury, and then inverted into the veſſel of reſtagnant Mercury; in that caſe the entire Mercury will remain ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and remain contiguous to the top of the Tube, and no part will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, neither will there be any ſuch <hi>funiculus</hi> of Air or ſubtle Matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect it to the top of the Tube.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this is what in effect was given in the former inſtances, though the application be diſſerent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if in this inſtance the Mercury ſhould any whit ſubſide, either it muſt leave the <hi>interſtitium</hi> between it ſelf and the top of the Tube vacant of any Body, or it muſt yeild ſome ſubtle matter to ſupply the place it leaves abraded from it ſelf, as in the ſecond Inſtance. And if it can do neither of theſe, <hi>manet ſors tertia,</hi> only to continue its ſtation united to the top of the Tube.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:50395:118"/>
               <p>The former of theſe cannot be, for I have ſuppoſed, and ſhall further inforce the contradiction of the Law of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe to that Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>Therefore it remains, that either there muſt be a ſubtle matter extracted out of the included Mercury, or of neceſſity the Mercury muſt hold its entire poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the whole Tube.</p>
               <p>Although the remote cauſe of this extraction of ſubtle parts out of the Mercury, in the ſecond Inſtance, be that law of the Univerſe, to hold toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the continuity of its parts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to avoid a <hi>vacuum</hi> or <hi>caſme</hi> in the Univerſe deſtitute of matter; yet the immediate cauſe of this extraction and rarifaction is the deſcent of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury from the ſtation that it hath, and the weight of its Body is the cauſe of that deſcent.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it requires a ſtrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Mercury, either to drive or draw out this ſubtle matter, and as it were to rake it out of the bowels of the Mercury, and to extend it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a ſtrong weight to effect that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50395:119"/>compreſſion and extenſion, if that weight which it hath at 29 Inches and half, or under, be not effective of ſuch an abraſion or extenſion of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle matter ſo abraded; ſuch abraſion or extenſion not being effectible by that weight, the column of Mercury muſt hold its poſition, and becomes its own <hi>funiculus,</hi> and remain ſuſpended to the top of the Tube.</p>
               <p>Now it ſeems, that although a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Cylinder of a height above thirty Inches, as ſuppoſe three or four foot, hath ſuch a forcible preſſure, weight, and gravitation upon the reſtagnant Mercury, not only to drive down the Mercurial Cylinder to twenty nine Iches and half, but alſo to extract and ſtrain out of it, and extend a ſufficient portion of ſubtle matter out of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Body to ſupply the room it leaves; yet that the weight only of twenty nine Inches and half, or below it, will not be able to drive, or draw out, or extend a portion ſufficient for that Exigent.</p>
               <p>And that is the reaſon, why at twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine Inches and half, or under that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50395:119"/>gage, whether the Tube be juſt twenty nine Inches and half, or longer; yet the Mercurial Cylinder reſts there, wanting a ſufficient <hi>potentia</hi> below that ſtation by its weight, to extract or to rarifie any of its ſubtle parts, to ſupply the place which then it ſhould deſert or leave.</p>
               <p>And herein the bigneſs or ſmallneſs of the Glaſs Tube, or the Mercurial Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder included, makes no odds; though poſſibly according to the various dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters of the Tubes, one Cylinder of Mercury of 29 Inches and half high, may weight five times another Cylinder of the ſame height, and yet both would remain ſuſpended in the Tubes.</p>
               <p>But the diſparity of the <hi>potentia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primens,</hi> is from the diſparity of the height of the Tube. And therefore the cauſe why the Cylinder of Mercury, filling a Tube of 3 or 4 foot long, will ſubſide upon inverſion unto twenty nine Inches and half, and there ſtay, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before its deſcent to that ſtation, its <hi>potentia</hi> was ſufficient to abrade and extend the ſubtle matter, but at twenty nine Inches and half that <hi>potentia</hi> was ſpent.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:50395:120"/>
               <p>And therefore the reaſon why the Tube of twenty nine Inches and half, or under, doth not ſubſide at all, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains cohering to the top of the Tube, is, becauſe it hath not that <hi>potentia</hi> at that gage to abrade from it ſelf matter to ſupply that place, if it ſhould leave it.</p>
               <p>And for this purpoſe it will not be amiſs to take notice of what <hi>Galilaeus,</hi> and after him the Excellent <hi>Merſennus</hi> have given us in relation to the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>motiva poteſtas</hi> of the ſame fiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id in different poſitions of height or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>The acceleration of motion of heavy Bodies is <hi>ut quadr at a temporum,</hi> in which they move downwards; as if in the firſt Minute, a Body moves one foot, in the ſecond minute it will move four foot, <hi>viz.</hi> two times two; in the third minute nine foot, <hi>viz.</hi> three times three; or, which comes to all one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, heavy bodies in their deſcent, in every given portion of time, as a minute will percur portions of ſpace <hi>per numeros impares ab unitate;</hi> as if in the firſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50395:120"/>it deſcend one foot, in the ſecond it will deſcend three foot, in the third five foot, in the fourth minute ſeven foot, and ſo onward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merſennus</hi> partly upon this, Theory, and partly upon his own experience, makes two Concluſions, (which I have experimentally found true) that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to explicate what I mean in this matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if there be two veſſels of equal height, but of differing diameters, and with an equal <hi>lumen</hi> or hole in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of each of them, and both filled with Water; the ſmaller veſſel will in the ſame portion of time empty from it ſelf as great a quantity of Water as the greater, for the Gravitation of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the <hi>Lumen</hi> is <hi>ſecundum altitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem,</hi> not <hi>ſecundum latitudinem vaſis:</hi> and upon the ſame account it is, that if the <hi>lumen</hi> be at the ſide, and the veſſels be placed in the ſame horizontal paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, the Parabolical line made by ſalient Water out of each veſſel, will be of the ſame length and amplitude.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if there be two Tubes or
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50395:121"/>veſſels of Water, <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B,</hi> of the height of nine foot, containing nine Gallons of Water, and <hi>B</hi> were a veſſel of ſixteen foot containing ſixteen Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of Water, and each veſſel had a ſmall <hi>lumen</hi> in the ſide next to the Baſe, of equal bigneſs, and of that bigneſs, that were there but one Gallon in the Tube, it would empty that Gallon in one minute. In theſe Inſtances, <hi>A</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Water would empty five Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons in the firſt minute, three Gallons in the ſecond minute, and one Gallon in the laſt minute. Again <hi>B,</hi> if filled with Water, would empty ſeven Gallons in the firſt minute, five in the ſecond mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, and three in the third minute, <hi>viz. in ratione ſubduplicata altitudinis.</hi> And this I have experimentally found to be true.</p>
               <p>The conſequence whereof is, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very fluid Body the higher it is eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hath the greater and more effectual preſſure by its poſition upon its lower parts or other fluid, than what barely ariſeth from its weight: ſo that in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Mercury in a Tube of four foot
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50395:121"/>high, though the loweſt foot and the higheſt foot of Mercury be of an equal weight, yet the preſſure of the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt or fourth foot, which I call its <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia deprimens,</hi> is to the third as ſeven to five, and the third to the ſecond is as five to three, and the ſecond to the firſt as three to one, namely when it hath a liberty of deſcending motion, as the Mercury hath in this Experiment; for the intermediate weight contributes to the preſſure of the uppermoſt foot.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that the power to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſegregate, and ſtrain, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſubtle matter out of the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is vigorous and effective in a Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial column of 4 foot high, and gradually is leſs and leſs 'till it come to twenty nine Inches and half; and then though it hath a conſiderable Gravitation, yet it is not equal to effect ſuch a ſeparation, and therefore muſt needs ſtand ſuſpended at that height, or leave a <hi>vacuum</hi> behind it, which the Catholick laws of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe do not permit.</p>
               <p>And thus far touching the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Solution, which ſeems to me
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50395:122"/>to be the true Solution of the <hi>Torricelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Experiment.</p>
               <p>And in the next place I ſhall ſubjoin ſome Inſtances that ſeem to me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, and anſwer ſome Objections that are made againſt it.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the two Suppoſitions that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to maintain this Solution,</hi> viz <hi>Natures abhorrence of</hi> vacuum, <hi>and the Attraction of tenſible fluids, or other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies when under a tenſion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are two Suppoſitions that are neceſſary to be proved, to render the Solution above given evident or probable. I. The excluſion of a <hi>vacuum</hi> or ſpace in the Univerſe wholly empty of any Body. 2. That any Body, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of tenſion, or rarifaction by tenſion, (ſuch as are the Air and thin <hi>effluvia</hi> of Mercury) to be attractive upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous Bodies, when actually under that tenſion.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:50395:122"/>
               <p n="1">1. As to the former of theſe, I need not much labour for it, upon two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 1. Becauſe there have been large Tractates upon this Poſition, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them would be but <hi>actum agere.</hi> 2. Becauſe the excluſion of the Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Elaſticity of the Air, invented or ſubſtituted by the modern Elateriſts, doth neceſſarily conclude, that there can be no <hi>vacuum</hi> in Nature; for all thoſe Experiments and Inſtances, which they produce to prove that Gravitation or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticity, and by which they go about to ſolve them, muſt (if thoſe Solutions prove untrue, or ineffectual) of neceſſity maintain that ancient Peripatetical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, becauſe they are uncapable of any other Solution. And in my judgment that Gravitation and Elaſticity of the common Air is ſifficiently convinced by what hath been before ſaid touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>And when I meet with thoſe Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that I find uſed by Learned men, namely how the Mercury or Water comes to know there will be a <hi>vacuum,</hi> if they do not leave their natural Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50395:123"/>and ſo aſcend or remain ſuſpended to ſupply it, and how thoſe ſtupid inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Elements or Minerals come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that Nature ſo much abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a <hi>vacuum;</hi> are much of the ſame kind, as if a man ſhould ask the Sun, if it move according to <hi>Ptolemy;</hi> or the Earth, if according to <hi>Copernicus</hi> it move; how they came to know that when they come to the Northern Tropick, they muſt move again to the Southern Tropick? or when it hath touched the Southern Tropick, it knows that it muſt come back to the Northern, and ſteer its courſe accordingly? Or as if a man ſhould ask, how doth the Stone under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that he muſt deſcend, when yet all the men in the world can never give any ſatisfactory reaſon for its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Earth, more than to the Moon, but only Nature that is the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium motus &amp; quietis,</hi> or rather the God of Nature, whoſe ſtanding and ſtatumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Law Nature is, hath ſo order'd it, and ordered ſo in the beſt way for the uſe, beauty, and accommodation of the Univerſe. The plain truth of it is, the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50395:123"/>very conſideration of the many attempts that have been made to explicate the reaſon of the deſcent of heavy Bodies, is enough to let us ſee, that we tire our ſelves in vain to determine the clear reaſon of it, without reſolving it into the ſtatuminated Law of Nature: though the Stone and the Earth are ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate, or at leaft unreaſonable Bodies, ſuch kind of Objections therefore as theſe are fond and weak.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond, namely the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Bodies extended, whether by rarifaction or tenſion, eſpecially of the Air, or this ſubtle matter that ariſeth from the Mercury. This affection and effect is as natural as any thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is truly obſerved by the learned <hi>Fabri, in primo tractatu phyſico, prop.</hi> 205, 206, 208. For a ſtrict contiguity in all parts of ſeveral Bodies is a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of the Univerſe and all its parts; neither can I imagine how thoſe that are fond of the <hi>Epicurean hypotheſis,</hi> can better maintain the coheſion of the parts of ſolid bodies, their <hi>atomi hamati</hi> being but fancies of what men never ſaw in them.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:50395:124"/>
               <p>The Air is the common cement and connecter of the different parts of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior world at leſt, and ſtrictly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth between their fiſſures and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia,</hi> to maintain a kind of common continuity between the different parts of the Univerſe, and makes it as it were one continued Body.</p>
               <p>But to come to particular Inſtances, which ſhall not be laborious but familiar and common, to evince this coheſion of the parts of tenſed or rarified Air, and the contraction that it makes upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous bodies, in its endeavour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to its natural ſtate and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The inſtance of Cupping-glaſſes, where the Air is highly rarified or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by the included burning Tow, and applied to the fleſh, draws up the fleſh ſtrongly unto it, when by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the Tow the rarified Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts it ſelf to a narrow room, which can be no otherwiſe than by the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the particles of Air to the skin, and driving it in to the Glaſs, while it contract, it ſelf to a narrower
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50395:124"/>compaſs. And certainly they that tell us, that this is done by the preſſure of the ambient Air upon the contiguous fleſh, which thruſts it up into the Glaſs, either do not believe themſelves while they ſay it, or are ſo tranſported with a love unto or ingagement for their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> of the prodigious gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the free Air, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſay any thing in its behalf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qui amant ipſi ſibi ſomnia fingunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shottus</hi> (who while he wrote his <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilia hydraulica,</hi> was well ſatisfied with the Solution of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the common Solution of <hi>fuga vacui</hi>) was indeed afterward, when he wrote his <hi>mirabilia Magdeburgica,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the new Solution, being not willing it ſeems to be thought to ſee leſs in Nature than the new Tribe of <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> that were concerned in that Engine. But for all that, this Inſtance of Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſſes was too hard for that new Solution, and were fairly fain to have recourſe to the <hi>decantata fuga vacui,</hi> or elſe it muſt ſtand unſolved, and ſo muſt any elſe that means an impartial and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50395:125"/>unpreingaged ſearch into Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If an empty Bladder be tied cloſe about the neck, and faſtned to the top of the Tube, Hermetically ſealed in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding of the Mercury the Bladder will be expanded, not by the natural Elate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the little particle of included Air, but by the ſtrong attraction of the tenſed Air in the Tube, by the deſcent of the Mercury, whereof before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Inſtance given in the tenth Chapter, of the Tube heated, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended to a Ballance, ſo as it touch the Water, the Water riſing in the Tube, the Tube will be drawn down, which is only done by the adheſion of the two extremes of the incloſed rarified Air, the one Extreme laying hold upon the top of the cavity of the Tube, the other end laying hold of the Water, and drawing it up, and therewith neceſſarily drawing the Tube down, whilſt the included Air is contracting if ſelf to its natural and narrower dimenſions.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Experiment made by a wide-mouth'd Glaſs would yeild
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50395:125"/>ſome diſcoveries of this attraction by the rarified Air, which are not ſo viſible in ſo narrow a Tube, I took a Beer-glaſs, as in the <hi>Figure</hi> 14, and ſuſpended it by a Thrid to one Scale of the Ballance, and weighing it with a weight in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Scale, and found it weight two Ounces and half; then, as we uſed when we were School-boyes, ſticking up a Candle in a Baſon, I let down the Glaſs over the Candle contiguous to the Superficies of the Water, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle going out there was a portion of Water drawn up into the Glaſs, the Air upon the Candles going out, and the Glaſs drawn down into the Water, the included Air being under a cauſe of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifaction, namely by the heat of the Candle, and by the extinction of the Flame now gradually contracting it ſelf, and thereby drawing up the Water to ſupply that place.</p>
               <p>The water drawn up into the glaſs was about half an Inch; we marked exactly the weight that was required now to lift up this Glaſs and included water was an addition of 4 Ounces and ¼ ⅛ of an
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50395:126"/>Ounce; ſo that the whole weight that raiſed the Glaſs and Water incloſed, and ſevered it from the Water beneath, was ſix Ounces ½ ¼ ⅛ of an Ounce, and then, though not without reluctance, the Glaſs was raiſed out of the Water.</p>
               <p>Then taking the exact quantity of other Water, equall to that formerly included in the Glaſs, (which was not difficult to do by the help of the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mark) we weighed it, and found it to weight exactly three Ounces and half, and a very few Grains.</p>
               <p>So that the weight of the Glaſs and incloſed Water amounting to ſix Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there was requiſite an addition of about half an Ounce to ſever the Glaſs from the Superficies of the reſtagnant Water, which did apparently to the eye and touch adhere together, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the counterpoiſe of ſix Ounces, equal to the weight of the Glaſs and included Water.</p>
               <p>And this half Ounce of additional weight was due purely to the adheſion of the glaſs, Air, &amp; incloſed water to the Superficies of the reſtagnant Water.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:50395:126"/>
               <p n="1">1. It ſeems evident, that not only the Glaſs, but the Water included in it, gravitates upon the Scale, for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe of ſix Ounces in the oppoſite Scale, equals the weight both of the Glaſs and Water incloſed in it, which could not be, unleſs both contributed to the <hi>aequipondium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is impoſſible that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Water could gravitate upon the Scale, unleſs the rarified Air were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous and cohering to the top of the Glaſs, and alſo to all the parts of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the cavity of the Glaſs above the Superficies and whole body of the included Water, and alſo firmly adhered to the Superficies of the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Water, for they all make up but one common weight, and there muſt be a <hi>vinculum</hi> that muſt connect the Glaſs and the incloſed Water, and otherwiſe they could not gravitate together; ſo that the <hi>vinculum</hi> that binds the Water to the Glaſs is this <hi>funiculus</hi> (as <hi>Linus</hi> well calls it) of the rarified Air, as the Thrid is the <hi>vinculum</hi> that binds the Glaſs to the Scale: for otherwiſe the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50395:127"/>Glaſs would be only raiſed, and leave the Water to ſubſide into the veſſel of reſtagnant Water, and would never hold an <hi>aequipondium</hi> to more than two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and a half, which was the juſt weight ſingly of the Glaſs.</p>
               <p>But as for the fancy above mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. that it is not the Glaſs and Water that make up the weight of ſix Ounces, but the Glaſs and the column of Air incumbent upon it, the vanity of that imagination is ſufficiently convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that Chapter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That conſequently, the included rarified Air thus faſtning upon the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Glaſs and the included Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a ſtrict coheſion, according to the nature of tenſed fluids, contracting it ſelf as much as it can by its motion of reſtitution, draws up the Water in the veſſel into the Glaſs, and raiſeth it as high, 'till there be an <hi>aequilibrium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>pondus naturale deprimens</hi> of the Water, and the <hi>potentia ſuſtinens</hi> of the Air, thus now contracting it ſelf, and indeavouring its reſtitution to its juſt natural dimenſion.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:50395:127"/>
               <p n="4">4. As a <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of this coheſion of the Air and Water included in the Glaſs, there is alſo a coheſion of the Limb of the Glaſs and the included Water unto the Superficies of the reſtagnant Water, which requires half an Ounce of weight to break that continuity between the upper and lower Water. And no other imaginable cauſe can be aſſigned for it, but that <hi>Natura aegrè patitur disjunctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem partium continui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as with the hand you lift up the Glaſs towards the Superficies of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnant Water, the Water included will riſe with it much above the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the external Water, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be by the imaginary preſſure of the external Air, but by the adheſion of the column of Water to the included ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Air, and of that to the concave Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Glaſs <hi>per modum unius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinui,</hi> which any man's tryal will make more plain and evident to him, than words in writing can eaſily expreſs.</p>
               <p>But ſome exception is taken to the word <hi>funiculus,</hi> and we are asked what Grappers there are belonging to this <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus,</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:50395:128"/>that can ſo ſteadily lay hold of the Water and the Glaſs, and hold them thus tight togher?</p>
               <p>And I muſt confeſs, that I wonder, that any that approves the Atomical or Epicurean Philoſophy, can make that Queſtion, ſince all their pretence of the coheſion of the imaginary Atomical Particles in any the moſt ſolid <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> are certain <hi>atomi hamati,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlock one in another, which yet they never ſaw.</p>
               <p>But let it be: I anſwer, the power of the laws of Nature are ſo efficacious, that they can and do colligate ſtrictly parts even of moſt diſtantial textures and conſiſtences, without the help of Vellicle, Hooks, or Grappers. What are the Hooks or Grappers, whereby the Humane Soul and Body, yea the Souls and Bodies of Animals are knit together, whereby the Bloud and the Spirits are colligated, whereby the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone attracts the Iron, notwithſtanding an interpoſed Plate of Braſs or body of impervious Glaſs, and a thouſand more Inſtances of Attraction between Bodies,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50395:128"/>without the intervention of ſenſible Grappers and Hooks, or ſuch groſs Mechaniſmes.</p>
               <p>This, and ſome other as light as this, and ſome toying with the word <hi>funicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> are the greateſt Objections that I find againſt what <hi>Linus</hi> hath in this matter delivered, which ſeem to me of no moment. Words were made to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conceptions of things, and if they do that, they do their office.</p>
               <p>And thus far concerning the Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Engin. I ſhall adde a few words, as I promiſed, touching the coheſion of two poliſhed Marbles, and the inſufficiency of the Solution thereof given by the Elateriſts, and the truth of the ancient Solution thereof.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Concerning the Cauſe of the Coheſion of two poliſhed Marbles.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are two Experiments, for the Solution whereof the Gravitation and Elatery of the Air is by the late Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers applied, which in this laſt place I ſhall examine according to my premiſed method.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that of the coheſion of two poliſhed Marbles. For inſtance, take two poliſhed Marbles, of one dimenſion and figure, and exactly in the centre of each Marble let there be a Ring, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſuſpend the upper, and whereby a weight may be appended to the lower. Theſe two Marbles, eſpecially if their ſmooth ſides be a little oyled, and applied each to other, will adhere ſo ſtrongly together, that the upper being ſuſpended by its Ring to a poſt or frame, (<hi>Fig.</hi> 15.) the lower will ſuſtain a weight of 20, 30, or 40 pounds, though the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50395:129"/>Marbles be not above three Inches dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</p>
               <p>And as it will do this in the open Air, it will alſo perform the ſame, though the Marbles be incloſed within a cloſe large Glaſs-Receiver, whereby it is ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the common Air, or any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending column of the Atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that the vulgar Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were wont to give in theſe caſes are theſe: Firſt, as to the ſtrict coheſion of the two Marbles, they give this reaſon; that the coheſion is <hi>ob fugam vacui.</hi> For if they ſhould be ſevered by the appended weight, the ſeparation of them would be in the ſame indiviſible moment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do <hi>contingere in puncto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in as much as all Bodies move ſucceſſively, and not in an inſtant, it would be impoſſible for the circumam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air in the moment of the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe two Marbles, to pervade the whole <hi>interſtitium</hi> that would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon the firſt ſeparation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there would be a mean time wherein the <hi>interſtitium</hi> would remain
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50395:130"/>empty, therefore the coheſion is ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to prevent that monſter in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, namely <hi>vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to evidence that this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they ſay that if the aperture be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted at the ſides, either by pulling them at one ſide, or by appending the weight more to one ſide than the other, they are eaſily ſeparated, becauſe that aperture makes an Angle, (<hi>Fig.</hi> 16.) and gradually admits the Air into it; for then the aperture is not all at once, but is <hi>apertio continuata</hi> from the firſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For although if the Baſe of the acute Angle, <hi>viz. A,</hi> were but a hairs breadth, the Angle were diviſible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematically unto the uttermoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of it; yet it is not ſo Phyſically, it but gains a ſucceſſive latitude, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it gradually opens, and ſo is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated Phyſically to a ſucceſſive intromiſſion of the Air: but if the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were altogether, the ſeparation in all parts of the Superficies muſt be Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically as well as Mathematically in the ſame inſtant, which were too quick to give an admiſſion to the ſucceſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50395:130"/>of the aery body in the ſame inſtant.</p>
               <p>But now we will conſider what So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions the late Philoſophy gives in this inſtance.</p>
               <p>Namely I. That in the free and open Air there is an impending column of Atmoſphere, reaching from the ſummi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof to the upper Marble, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate in its diameter and circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>area</hi> of the upper Marble that preſſeth it, with an exceſſive weight downwards, and ſo upon the upper Hemiſphere if ſuſpended parallel to the Horizon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That again there is a returning or recoiling Cylinder of Air, reaching from the Superficies of the Earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, of as great a <hi>potentia ſuſtinens</hi> as the ſuperior column of Atmoſphere hath a <hi>pondus deprimens:</hi> and this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior or reſulting column is commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate alſo in its diameter and circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the lower Marble, or brazen Hemiſphere, and thruſts that as vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly up to the upper Marble, as the upper column preſſeth downward. And ſo the <hi>potentia ſuſtinens</hi> being equal to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50395:131"/>the <hi>pondus deprimens,</hi> the lower Marble is able to ſuſtain a weight equal to the weight of the upper atmoſpherical Cylinder; the reaſon of which admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable power (according to their Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) is opened <hi>ſupra cap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And in as much as there runs down as weighty and potent aereal Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders or Atmoſpherical portions by the ſides, as well as perpendicularly, therefore although the Marbles were not placed parallel to the Horizon, but vertically (as when each is drawn ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways) this lateral preſſure of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere is as effectual to hold the Marbles together in that cloſe poſture, as if they ſtood parallel to the Horizon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And becauſe they will have a Salve for all Sores, although theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins be placed in a cloſe Glaſs-Receiver, whereby the aereal Columns, as well ſuperior as inferior, are wholly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the interpoſition of the great Glaſs Receiver, the Elaſticity of the portion of Air included within that Glaſs Receiver, undertakes and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally performs the <hi>phaenomenon,</hi> by its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50395:131"/>Elaſticity or counterpreſſion both upward, and downward, and late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, upon the included Marbles or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres.</p>
               <p>And this is the Solution that now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains among the <hi>Virtuoſi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon theſe premiſes there are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable trains of Philoſophical Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences deduced with great induſtry and ſubtlety, in this particular inſtance of the Marbles, which a man may read at large in the late book of <hi>Hydroſtatical Experiments, Exp.</hi> 13, and elſewhere.</p>
               <p>And now for ought I know the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is brought to this iſſue, whether this or the former Solution be the truer, (for I know not a third) and if this prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true or uneffectual, the former of the Vulgar Philoſophy muſt obtain, 'till ſome third be found out.</p>
               <p>And therefore I will proceed in the examination of this new <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although I think I have ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt this whole Scheme of the Gravitation and Elatery of the Air, as it is propounded in the fourth, tenth, and eleventh Chapters; yet I ſhall here add
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50395:132"/>ſome things more ſpecifically applicable to theſe Engins and Experiments, and remit the Reader to thoſe Chapters, as to the general untruth of the entire <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, as to the coheſion of the Marbles I offer theſe conſiderations:
1. It is plain, that the lower Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if there were nothing elſe to ſuſtain it but the recoiling Cylinder of Air im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling it upward, it would certainly fall to the Earth, notwithſtanding that imaginary <hi>potentia;</hi> for if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it would be a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that though it were not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the upper, it would be ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by that <hi>potentia ſuſtinens,</hi> and ſo we ſhould have Milſtones floting in the Air, according to the fancy of the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Author of Hydroſtatical Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.</p>
               <p>But the help for this is, that in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the impending ſuperior column of Air being of equal ſtrength with the recoiling column of Air, there is an <hi>aequipondium</hi> between that <hi>pondus</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,</hi> and ſo the ſolute Marble or Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50395:132"/>having the advantage of his own weight, and the weight of the ſuperior column would conquer the inferior; but here the inferior Marble is protected from the weight of the ſuperior column of Air, and ſo hath nothing but his own weight to contend with the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior column, and its <hi>potentia,</hi> which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter overmatcheth it, and ſo keeps it ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>
               <p>But this will not cure the Sore; for ſuppoſe it were two pieces of Wood, or that the Marbles were not excellently poliſhed, ſo that they did not <hi>contingere in puncto,</hi> but ſome little fiſſure or <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia</hi> did let in any ſmall portion of Air, the Marble would fall off; and yet there the lower Marble is protected from the impendent column of Air by the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior piece of Wood, or unpoliſhed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as well as here.</p>
               <p>And to ſay theſe little filaments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed Air, which if all put together would not make a column of Air of a larger diameter than a ſmall pin, ſhould conquer the reflected Cylinder of Air, and its <hi>potentia,</hi> which theſe Maſters
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50395:133"/>ſuppoſe to be equivalent in power to thirty, forty, nay one hundred pound weight, renders the whole Suppoſition it ſelf to be but utterly improbable. Some what therefore elſe it is, that keeps the lower Marble ſuſpended to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and not the imaginary <hi>potentia</hi> of the reflected column of Air commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to the <hi>area</hi> of the inferior marble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the lower Marble were ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the account of the <hi>potentia ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinens</hi> of the inferior column of Air, and by force thereof it could ſuſtain (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) forty pounds weight, ſuſpended in the center of the Marble, it were not eaſily conceptible how if but an eighth part of that weight were hanged near the limb or circumference of the lower Marble, it would fall aſunder, as it will; for the <hi>potentia ſuſtinens</hi> of the ſubjected column of Air is applied equally to all the <hi>area</hi> of the ſubjacent Marble. And the ſeparation will follow, if the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles being oyled, the one may be ſlided off from the other without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; and then when they are ſo ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded off, they are eaſily thereby ſevered,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50395:133"/>becauſe no vacuity or inſtantaneous motion of the Air would follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: which could never be done, if they were ſo ſtrongly wedged up one to another by ſo ſtrong and powerful a counterpreſſure of the reflecting column of Air, which preſſeth up according to the new <hi>hypotheſis</hi> with a <hi>potentia</hi> able to ſuſtain neer a hundred pound weight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Stevinus</hi> tells us in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the tenth Propoſition of his Hydroſtaticks, that if a veſſel be made in the form of <hi>Fig.</hi> 17. with a hole in the bottom, and a piece of Wood lighter than Water, <hi>viz. B B.</hi> Cover that hole, and then let the veſſel be filled with Water; as great a ſtrength will be required by the ſtring at <hi>A</hi> to move that rundle of Wood from the hole it ſtops, as if a weight of Water commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to the <hi>area</hi> of the rundle, from <hi>B</hi> to <hi>A,</hi> were impendent upon it. And this the Learned Author of Hydroſtatical Paradoxes avouches to have tried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yet the Water included is not an half nor a quarter of that weight of Water. And the column of Air that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50395:134"/>theſe Maſters ſuppoſe to preſs the Water at <hi>A,</hi> can be no larger than the orifice of the Pipe at <hi>A,</hi> which is not one fifth part of the amplitude of the rundle <hi>B,</hi> nor of the hole which it ſtops. But if there were ſuch a reflected or recoiling column preſſing upward to the hole of the veſſel and rundle that covers it, which is five times larger than the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at <hi>A,</hi> to let in a column of gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Air; this rundle, and the Water incumbent upon it, ſhould be forcibly thruſt up by the recoiling column of Air: and yet Experience tells us, that it is ſo far from being thruſt up by the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia ſuſtinens</hi> of the inferior aery co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, that it is hardly to be raiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty by a Thrid.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, take a veſſel of Laton, of a cubical or cylindrical figure, about eight Inches diameter; make a round hole at the bottom of four Inches dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter. Then take a round piece of Braſs or Lead, or ſmoothed Wood, of ſix Inches diameter, which may weigh two Ounces; wax it well, and exactly, and cloſely cover the hole, that it may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50395:134"/>that no Air may go in or out by it, then rarifie the included Air, but not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable height, for then growing cold it will draw up the cover when clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Then cloſe the top very cloſe with Laton and Soder, that no Air can get in; the Air I ſuppoſe rarified may take up more room than its natural dimenſion by about two ſquare Inches, which is more than the dimenſion of the Stopper: ſo that the ſuppoſed Elatery of the Air hath no reſiſtence to its impelling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, becauſe it hath room for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. I ſay that this Stopper will not be impelled up by the preſſure of the recoiling Cylinder of Air, though it weigh but two Ounces, and will be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up by a force or weight of three Ounces. And yet according to theſe mens Suppoſition, this recoiling column hath a <hi>potentia</hi> to impell or keep up for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pound, nay an hundred pound weight, being commenſurate in power to an Atmoſpherical Cylinder of ſix Inches diameter, which according to their Suppoſition muſt weigh about 500l weight, namely a Cylinder of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50395:135"/>Mercury of ſix Inches diameter, and twenty nine Inches high, <hi>viz.</hi> 783 ſquare Inches of Mercury, which is near 500l weight. It is true I have not tryed this, but my obſervation of the third Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment makes me little doubt of this.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Concerning the</hi> Magdeburgh <hi>Hemiſpheres, and their Coheſion, and the reaſon thereof.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Air is capable of tenſion by force, and of rarifaction by heat; both which agree in this, that they both give a large expanſion of a leſs portion of Air into a greater ſpace than is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to it.</p>
               <p>But herein they partly differ, and partly agree; that the immediate effect of a ſtrong tenſion of Air by force (ſuch as are the Air-pump, and the <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> Engin, and the <hi>Cacabus Evacuatorius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Shottus</hi> in his <hi>Technica curioſa, lib. 1. cap. 5. &amp; ſequentibus</hi>) is attraction of the Superficies, to which the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded tenſed Air is contiguous.</p>
               <p>But the immediate effect of rarifaction
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50395:135"/>of the Air, which is performed by heat, is a laxation of the filaments of the Air at firſt; for the Air being dilated, takes up more room, is more relaxed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded: but conſequentially there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a contraction as the heat decays, and the Air endeavours its reſtitution to its natural texture, and ſo endeavours its contraction, and conſequently lays hold on the contingent Superficies, within which it is impriſoned, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts it with its own contraction. The inſtances of both which motions and effects we have in the <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres deſcribed by <hi>Shottus, ubi ſupra,</hi> and hereafter more fully explicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> 18, 19, 20. The Engin is thus deſcribed. Let there be two Brazen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Hemiſpheres <hi>AB,</hi> with rings in the Poles or center of the convex Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of each of them at <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> and a ring of Leather dipt in Wax to be placed between the two Hemiſpheres, <hi>viz. E,</hi> to keep the limbs or joints of them cloſe from admiſſion of any Air between the commiſſures or joints of the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres; and a Stop-cock in the lower
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50395:136"/>Hemiſphere at <hi>E K,</hi> both the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres conjoined with the Leather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Theſe Hemiſpheres thus joined, the Stop-cock at <hi>F</hi> to be left open, whereby in the <hi>Cacabus Evacuathius</hi> or <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> Engin, the Air in the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Hemiſpheres may be as much exhauſted as may be, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which remains being thereby put into a great tenſion, to be incloſed by turning the Stop-cock, that no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Air may be admitted. Theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres thus ordered, will cohere ſo ſtrongly together, that the ſtrength of many Horſes will not ſever them, if the Hemiſpheres be large.</p>
               <p>And the event is infallibly true, but the conteſt is touching the reaſon or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the <hi>phaenomena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The modern Philoſophers, with <hi>Schot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in his fourth Book of his <hi>Technica cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſa, cap. 7. <expan>

                        <ex>reversed §</ex>
                     </expan> 3.</hi> (being now a Convert to the Gravitation of the Air) tells us, that the reaſon hereof is, that the weight of a column of Air impendent uppon the upper Hemiſphere, and the reverſe column of Air preſſing upon
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50395:136"/>the lower Hemiſphere upward, is the cauſe of this coheſion.</p>
               <p>And that in caſe the Hemiſpheres be not placed erect, but laterally, with their Poles parallel to the Horizon, the lateral preſſure of the two adverſe columns of Air perform the buſineſs, and keep them ſtrictly together againſt a moſt powerful force indeavouring their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
               <p>But ſtill with this caution, that the ſeparating force work upon the centre of the Hemiſpheres, and ſo draw upon all parts alike: for if the <hi>potentia ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> be applied unequally, <hi>viz.</hi> at one ſide of each Hemiſphere, and not equally from the centre, then the ſeparation will eaſily follow upon the application of a ſmall ſeparating ſtrength, which is alſo moſt certainly true. Again, if but a little portion of Air be let into the Stop-cock, the ſeparation of them quickly follows, which is alſo true.</p>
               <p>But now the vulgar Speculators think, that this Solution is untrue, and that the true reaſon of the coheſion of theſe Hemiſpheres is, becauſe that the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50395:137"/>included portion of Air is not wholly exhauſted, neither is it poſſible by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power wholly to evacuate it. But a great part therereof is exhauſted, and that which remains incloſed is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very great and violent tenſion, and hath a ſtrong natural <hi>conatus</hi> of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its natural ſtaple and ſtandard, and that the filaments of the Air lay hold upon every point of the concave Superficies, and draw them inward, as it endavours its own contraction.</p>
               <p>That there is not, nor can be, any <hi>caſma</hi> or interval of empty ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the convex Superficies of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air, and the concave Superficies of the including Hemiſpheres, for that is contrary to the common law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and yet the Air by its intrinſick texture, and proper motion of reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to that juſt dimenſion that Nature hath aſſigned to it, affects its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction to its own ſtate, and with it draws together, and holds together the ambient body including it.</p>
               <p>Not much unlike the tenſion of Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings, highly wound up by their Pins,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50395:137"/>which have a tenſion and contraction of the extremes, to which they are faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, namely the Bridg and the Pins.</p>
               <p>That the reaſon why, if any Air be let in, even at a Pin-hole through the Hemiſpheres, it is greedily ſucked in by the tenſed and ſtretched Air, to relieve it from the Rack upon which it is ſtretched, and being taken in it relieves that tenſion, looſeneth its contraction, and takes off its forcible attraction upon the concave Superficies of the including Hemiſpheres, and gives the included Air a fair relaxation to its due ſize, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtandard; and ſo the coheſion ceaſeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> 21. That the reaſon why an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perture is eaſily wrought, when the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion is only of one ſide, is partly the ſame with the reaſon of the like divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the the two cohering Marbles. 1. Becauſe the aperture is angular, and not all at once. 2. The aperture is <hi>cunei formis,</hi> which every body knows is more forcible than a parallel aperture. And 3. by this kind of angular opening the filaments of the Air are broken ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50395:138"/>one after another; but in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel aperture all the filaments muſt be broken at once, and ſo make one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reſiſtance to the force. As a piece of Cloth may be torn with eaſe by one man, when thrid is broken after thrid, but cannot be torn by four men, when all the thrids are ſtrained together, and ſo have an united and uniform ſtrength and reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>And they ſay, that although this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is contrived with great pomp, yet in truth it is no more than that Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we practiſed with our Nutſhels when we were children, where by clapping half a Nutſhel to our lips, or the back of our hands, and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Air, they would ſtick ſo cloſe, that we could not eaſily fillip them off.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the two reaſons that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the Solution of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Gravitation of the Air or Atmoſphere of the one hand, and the <hi>motus</hi> or <hi>conatus reſtitutionis</hi> of the Air, and the natural inſeparability of Bodies without any intervening Body of the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50395:138"/>other hand. If the former be laid aſide as untrue, the latter needs no great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to prove it; for theſe be the only two Competitors for the Solution of this Inſtance, that I ever heard of.</p>
               <p>And I think it is very plain, that the imaginary gravitation of the Air, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath nor can have any thing at all to do in this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I had not thoſe Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Engins before deſcribed, and if I had had them, yet I would not have ſingly reſted upon them, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king trial by rarifaction by heat, I took the method hereafter following, for the full examination of this Inſtance.</p>
               <p>For it is obvious beyond diſpute, that that if there be a coheſion wrought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rarifaction of the Air by heat, in the Inſtances hereafter given, as there is when there is a tenſion of the Air by a forcible Evacuation, as in the former Inſtance; the true cauſe of each cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt be one and the ſame. And if the <hi>pondus externi aeris</hi> contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the coheſion of the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres after rarifaction of the included
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50395:139"/>Air by heat, it contributes as little to the coheſion of the Hemiſpheres forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly evacuated by an Air-pump, or the <hi>Cacabus Evacuatorius</hi> before mentioned.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, if the coheſion of the Hemiſpheres after rarifaction by heat be cauſed by the <hi>motus reſtitutionis</hi> of the included rarified Air, and by the ſtrict continuity (as I may call it) of the filaments of the Air to the cavity of the Hemiſpheres, to avoid that Vacuity which would otherwiſe happen by the contraction of the Air into a leſs room than would fill the whole cavity; the ſame is unqueſtionably the reaſon of the coheſion of the Hemiſpheres forcibly evacuated as above.</p>
               <p>The Inſtances therefore that I tryed are theſe that follow, which I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeverally, with my obſervation to each of them. For if I miſtake not, this one Experiment, duly improved, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſets aſide the imaginary Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air, ſo uſually applied to the Solution of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, the coheſion of Marbles, the raiſing of Water in Pumps, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50395:139"/>by Suction, and many more of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I cauſed two Braſs concave He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres to be caſt, each of ſix Inches and a quarter in the cavity, and about ſeven Inches diameter in the convexity, exactly cloſing one to another on their rim, and the lower let up into the cavity of the upper about half an Inch, for their more exact cloſure; and the outward rims of each about a quarter of an Inch in bredth, exactly cloſing one upon another, ſo that being cloſed they made one perfect Sphere, according to the form of the <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> Hemiſpheres above deſcribed.</p>
               <p>The lower Hemiſphere weighed ſix pounds, ſeven Ounces, and a half, <hi>viz.</hi> 103 Ounces, and half; the upper weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only ſix pounds.</p>
               <p>I then took a circular piece of Calf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin, a little above half an Inch broad, and in length ſufficient to compaſs the Hemiſpheres, and dipping it in melted Bees-Wax, with a very little Roſin, ſo that it might juſt lye between the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſures of the two Hemiſpheres, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50395:140"/>ſtop out all acceſs of the forreign Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, without any thing more done, I applied the two Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres each to other, with the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed girdle of waxed wet Leather, and preſſed them cloſe and hard together, that no commerce might be between the included and the common Air.</p>
               <p>And ſo there neither was nor could be any force of compreſſion uſed to the included Air, becauſe 'till the cloſure of the. Hemiſpheres it had a free inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the external Air, and when perfectly cloſed it was but juſt as much as the Hemiſpheres would freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and conſequently of the ſame tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the forreign Air.</p>
               <p>In this Inſtance, the upper Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere raiſed gently by the ring, there ſeemed a little weak coheſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, becauſe the rims were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cloſed, and the ſeparation was altogether in the ſame moment, but the coheſion ſo faint and weak, that it would not ſuſtain the hundredth part of the weight of the lower Hemiſphere, and ſcarce perceptible.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:50395:140"/>
               <p>And the reaſon of the diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the coheſion of theſe Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres, and that before mentioned of the 2 poliſhed Marbles, are theſe. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the contiguity of the two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Marbles is in all points of their Superficies, but here the contiguity of the rims of the Hemiſpheres was but in a circle of a quarter of an Inch broad, and ſo the forreign Air had a ſhorter journey to go in the moment of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Hemiſpheres, than in the moment of the ſeparation of the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Marbles. 2. Becauſe the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the poliſhed Marbles is without any interpoſition of Leather, which poſſibly would impede the firmneſs of the coheſion of the two Marbles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>But now if the preſſure of the aereal Cylinders either in the poliſhed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or in the inſtances of the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres, before and hereafter given, were the cauſe of their coheſion, what imaginable reaſon can be given why theſe two Hemiſpheres ſhould not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here as firmly in this Inſtance.</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:50395:141"/>
               <p>For though there be Air included be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Hemiſpheres, yet all communication between the included and forreign Air is perfectly excluded by walls of Braſs, and the impervious Leather girdle.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that the Elaſticity of the included Air reſiſts the compreſſion by the forreign Air, and ſo impedes the coheſion.</p>
               <p>I ſay if any ſuch Elaſticity were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Air, (which I do not) yet moſt certainly the included Air hath no greater Elaſticity than the common Air, whereof it was but juſt now a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath received no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion by the juncture of the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres, no more than Air in a Bottle covered with a flat Board or Paper.</p>
               <p>The conſequence whereof is, that the Elaſticity of the forreign Air is as ſtrong as the Elaſticity of the included Air, and muſt needs keep it in <hi>aequilibrio.</hi> And the conſequence thereof is, that if the <hi>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus externi aeris</hi> (if it were any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable) would have its free exerciſe upon theſe Hemiſpheres, though filled
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50395:141"/>with Air; for according to theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſuppoſition, the Cylinder of Air of each ſide preſſing each Hemiſphere, is above ſeven hundred pound weight, which it may freely exerciſe, the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Elaſticity of the included and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Air being <hi>ex ſuppoſitione</hi> equal. But the enſuing Experiments will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this more evident.</p>
               <p>Secondly therefore, I took a handful of flax, and leaving the mouth of the lower Hemiſphere upward, I put in the flax, and gave fire to it, holding the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Hemiſphere cloſe over it, whereby the Air in both was greatly rarified, and a conſiderable portion of the ſpace taken up by the flame of the flax. Then clapping the upper Hemiſphere upon the lower, with the interpoſed Leather girdle, I preſſed them together with all the ſtrength I had, neither were they poſſibly capable of a neerer or cloſer contiguity to the interpoſed Leather, though the imaginary Cylinder of the Atmoſphere had preſſed them, and hereupon the flame and fire was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently extinguiſhed.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:50395:142"/>
               <p>The Events were as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There grew a preſent coheſion of the two Hemiſpheres together, even while they were hot, and the included Air under a high degree of rarifaction by the heat, and ſo could not have any conſiderable tenſion while the heat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon of this coheſion was plainly this. That the fire and flame had not only rarified the Air included within the compaſs of the Hemiſpheres, to an expanſion far greater than was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to it; but alſo the flame and fire took up a conſiderable portion of the ſpace between the Hemiſpheres, which being extinct in the moment of their juncture, that very rarified Air that was within, was forced to take up ſo much more ſpace as the flame took up before its extinction. And from thence grew neceſſarily an attraction upon the cavity of the Hemiſpheres, though that very Air was under a rarifaction by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing heat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this coheſion was but weak, becauſe the Air was then under a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50395:142"/>ſtrong dilatation by the continuing heat, and therefore the upper Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere lifted up by the ring, would not ſuſtain the weight of the lower Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But when the Hemiſpheres thus hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the included Air greatly rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby, were permitted to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue together cloſed 'till they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cold, and thereby the Air had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to contract it ſelf, or at leſt to endeavour it as much as it could. Now the coheſion of the Hemiſpheres grew ſtrong, ſo that the upper lifted up would raiſe the lower in conjunction with it, with the addition of ſome weight appended to the lower ring. And the reaſon was, becauſe the heat which was the cauſe of the great dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the included Air was now cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Air by its motion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution endeavoured to contract it ſelf to its natural Expanſion.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the included Air (it may be) was expanded to above four times its true natural ſize and dimenſion, and now endeavoured to contract it ſelf
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50395:143"/>into that ſpace, but could not attain it, unleſs three fourths of the ſpace inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the Hemiſpheres ſhould have been left perfectly empty, the Air en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring its contraction, according to the particular inclination of its own motion; yet by the common law of the Univerſe was kept under its former Expanſion, to prevent the <hi>caſma</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Air and the concave Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Hemiſpheres, and ſo as much as was poſſible attracted upon them, and kept them together, no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Air being admiſſible for the relief of the included Air, to help to reſtore it to its due ſize and texture: as a living Oyſter contracts its ſhell together by its own contraction within its ſhell, when a perſon is opening in. The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is homely, and ſuits not in all things, becauſe the Oyſter is a vital Being, but yet it ſerves to explicate the method of this attraction, by the filaments of the Air upon the contiguous concave Superficies.</p>
               <p>And from this inſtance of fired flax (reſembling very much the common
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50395:143"/>inſtance of Cupping-glaſſes,) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly, that in thoſe Glaſſes the fleſh is not driven up by preſſure of the forreign Air upon the glaſs or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous parts of the fleſh; but purely by the attraction of the included reſidue of Air upon the extinction of the flame. For the Hemiſpheres were at firſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together as cloſe as they could be, and no man can imagine that the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air can have any influence through theſe Brazen Walls, that are neer half an Inch thick, where yet the Attraction upon the included Superficies is viſible and apparent; and in this and my other Experiments it was not poſſible for the Hemiſpheres to receive a greater or clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer contiguity than I gave them on their firſt union: and therefore I do not wonder, that <hi>Schottus,</hi> though too haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſcribing to the preſſure of the Air, as a Solution of ſome Experiments, yet in his <hi>Technica Curioſa, l. 4. cap.</hi> 12. § I. is forced to confeſs <q>
                     <hi>carnem &amp; ſanguinem ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intrare cucurbitas, nec preſſione Aeris ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terni carni circum illas incumbenti, nec preſſione aeris illas incumbentis &amp; depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50395:144"/>ac intra carnem mergentis, ſed ſuctione &amp; attractione.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe I would improve the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment to the uttermoſt, I made a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with a ſtronger heat. I therefore put burning Coals and red hot Iron into each Hemiſphere, 'till they were hot as I could well touch them, and then ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out the Coals, the Air within the cavity of each Hemiſphere was highly rarified; then clapping the Leather gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle about the rim I cloſed the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres very cloſe, as my ſtrength could force them together; the Events where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. While the Hemiſpheres were hot, and ſo the included Air under a high degree of rarifaction, there was very little or no coheſion, for the Air was under the ſame laxation as at firſt, and therefore they would preſently fall aſunder, the upper being raiſed by the ring.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the heat decayed, and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres grew gradually colder and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and conſequently the Air more and more endeavours to contract it ſelf, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50395:144"/>as a conſequence thereof attracted more forcibly upon the cavity of the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres, the ſtronger was there cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; becauſe as the Air grew colder, it endeavoured more and more to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire its juſt natural dimenſion and tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. At laſt, when the heat was quite extinct, and the Hemiſpheres grown perfectly cold, the coheſion was ſo ſtrong, that the upper Hemiſphere ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon a hook, did not only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the lower Hemiſphere, which weighed neer ſeven pounds, but alſo a weight of twenty eight pounds more, in all about thirty five pound weight, before they would be disjoyned.</p>
               <p>For now the Air being diſcharged of that heat that kept it laxe, and without a bent, or tenſion, or contraction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, did now endeavour its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſtrongly, and therewith pulled inward the Hemiſpheres, from which it could not be ſevered, by reaſon of common Natures declination of a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. My fourth Tryal was this, that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50395:145"/>when the Hemiſpheres were firſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and clapt together, and thereby when they became cold, cohered excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtrongly; yet when they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſtrong coheſion, that they would ſuſtain a conſiderable weight as before, without parting aſunder, yet if afterwards they were brought but to a moderate heat, either by a chafing-diſh of Coals put under them, or by holding them neer the fire, they would ſuddenly fall aſunder of themſelves, without any weight appended to ſever them.</p>
               <p>The reaſon whereof is apparent, namely that by the heating of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres the included Air is again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, and its tenſion laxed, and the filaments thereof which were before under a tenſion and contraction by the Air, ſtriving to gain its natural tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, are now let looſe, as a Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring is let down by the unſcrewing of the Pins. And conſequently the ſuction and attraction of the Air upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Superficies of the Hemiſpheres, which before held them together, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed and diſcharged.</p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:50395:145"/>
               <p>And thus we have the true <hi>phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of this Engin, and, as I take it the true reaſon and ſolution of them.</p>
               <p>And upon theſe Inſtances I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That men have had very little reaſon to conclude the Gravitation or Preſſure of the Air upon the inferior World, or the parts thereof; for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion of theſe Engins is moſt plainly upon another reaſon, as appears by what is before declared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this inſtance is ſo far from concluding the Gravitation of the Air in that meaſure, that the late Maſters contend, that plainly that Suppoſition neither hath nor can have to do in the ſolution of theſe Inſtances.</p>
               <p>For moſt unqueſtionably, the Air doth as much gravitate (if at all) upon the Hemiſpheres, when the included Air is rarified by heat, in theſe Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as it doth when the Hemiſpheres are grown cold; and yet in the former caſe there is no coheſion, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſeparation of the cohering He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres if again they are heated.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:50395:146"/>
               <p n="3">3. That the cauſe of the coheſion therefore is not <hi>ab extra,</hi> or <hi>de foris,</hi> but <hi>ab intra;</hi> namely, one ſpecifical to the Air, whereby becoming cold after a great expanſion by heat, it endeavours its contraction to its due ſpace and tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by a motion of reſtitution; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common to all parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that common law of Nature that preſerves contiguity, or indeed rather continuity of the parts of the Univerſe: and therefore ſuffers not the Air to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it ſelf, ſo as to leave an empty ſpace between it ſelf and the concave of the Hemiſpheres, whereby it comes to paſs, that the Air endeavouring to contract it ſelf, layes hold upon, and endeavours to contract and hold together all parts whereunto it is contiguous, when no acceſs of forreign Air is admitted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the leaſt admiſſion of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Air, though through a Pin-hole, in the Hemiſpheres, gradually gives a relaxation of the tenſion of the included Air, which greedily ſucks it in, and thereby is delivered gradually from its tenſion, and lets go its hold of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50395:146"/>Superficies, which is the natural and neceſſary effect of that tenſion.</p>
               <p>I cannot eaſily perceive how theſe Concluſions againſt the imaginary Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the Air can be evaded.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, that the reaſon why the Hemiſpheres cohere not when they are hot, is, becauſe the convexity likewiſe of the Hemiſpheres are alſo hot, and ſo retund the Gravitation or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Air upon them by their heat, which is not ſo done when they are cold.</p>
               <p>I anſwer 1. That though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex Superficies were admitted to be as hot as could be indured, yet the Sphere of that Activity is not two foot in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, which could never break the preſſure of a column of Air of at leaſt ſeven Miles high, and near a thouſand pound weight, according to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. 2. Neither is the heat requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make ſuch a disjunction of that Extremity, as to make any ſuch impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Air; for if the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres be made but bloud warm after their coheſion, they will fall aſunder.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:50395:147"/>
               <p n="3">3. But wholly to prevent this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the Hemiſpheres be caſed over with a flat or ſpherical Cover of Wood, Lead, or Braſs, which may receive the ſuppoſed Gravitation of the Air, yet the coheſion, while the air is hot within, will not laſt; for it is the laxation or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation of the tenſion of the Air within that, gives the ſeparation, or eaſie ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability of the Hemiſpheres.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the raiſing of the Water by Pumps or Syringes, and the Cauſe thereof.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the two former Chapters I have conſidered the coheſion of poliſhed Marbles, and the <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres, both in truth reſting upon So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions ſomewhat of the ſame nature. And therein I have as I think excluded the Gravitation of the Air, or Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, or aereal Cylinders, from any contribution thereunto.</p>
               <p>I have choſen in this Chapter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50395:147"/>the Elevation of Water in Pumps and Syringes, both which are in truth but the ſame Engin, though circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially varied.</p>
               <p>And although I ſhall herein have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſay ſomething touching the Gravitation of the Air, and ſhall in ſome meaſure evidence, that the Water is not raiſed in theſe Engins by the weight of the Air, preſſing upon the reſtagnant Well or other veſſel of Water, yet I ſhall not labour that, much, in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, becauſe enough hath been ſaid thereof before.</p>
               <p>But my principal ſcope herein is to diſcover, even to ſenſe, that there is no ſuch Elaſticity in a ſeparate portion of common Air as the Elateriſts ſuppoſe, whereby to ſalve the ſuſpenſion of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>column of twenty nine Inches of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, when the ſame is pent up in a cloſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or room, every where excluding the imaginary preſſure of the Atmoſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cylinder; and conſequently that the Solution of that Experiment, either by the Weight or by the Spring of the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50395:148"/>Air, is a miſtaken Solution, and hath no reality in it.</p>
               <p>The raiſing of Water by common Pumps or Syringes (eſpecially as it is this day ordered, ſometimes with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſometimes with ſingle Valves, to hinder the regreſs of the Water) is ſo well known even to ordinary Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, that it needs no accurate deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But the reaſon of this Elevation of the Water is variouſly rendred, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different <hi>hypotheſes</hi> that men have entertained.</p>
               <p>The ancient and common, and I think the true reaſon thereof, is this:</p>
               <p>The lower end of the cavity of the Pump or Syringe being immerſed below the Superficies of the reſtagnant Water, there is a Cylinder of Air in the cavity of the Pump or Syringe, between the Superficies of the Water and the bottom of the Bucket and upper Valve of the Pump, or between the Superficies of the Water, and the bottom of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus</hi> of the Syringe cloſely penned up.</p>
               <p>That by the Elevation of the Bucket
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50395:148"/>in the Pump, or <hi>Embolus</hi> in the Syringe, that portion of intermediate Air is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a tenſion, and draws vigorouſly upon the Superficies of the reſtagnant Water, and that again upon the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Water, and ſo the tenſed <hi>funicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> of the Air raiſeth a <hi>funiculus</hi> of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, commenſurate to the cavity of the Pump or Cylinder, which again by depreſſion of the Bucket riſeth through the Leather-valve that covers it, and by an iterated elevation of the Bucket or <hi>Embolus</hi> draws up more, whereby there is a continued ſupply of a <hi>funiculus aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> which is finally thrown out at the orifice, or noſe of the Pump.</p>
               <p>That it is a certain truth, that Water is raiſed either by a <hi>pondus</hi> or preſſure, that is equivalent to the weight of the Water that is elevated, as in the Engins where Forcers or preſſures are uſed to raiſe Water; or elſe by an attractive <hi>potentia</hi> equal to the weight of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drawn up, as in Pumps and Syrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>That conſequently, the <hi>vis</hi> or <hi>potentia ſuctoria</hi> or <hi>attractiva,</hi> will raiſe ſuch a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50395:149"/>weight of Water as is leſs than this <hi>vis</hi> or <hi>potentia,</hi> (for whether the Elevation of Water be by a <hi>vis deprimens</hi> as in preſſing Engins, or <hi>vis ſuctoria</hi> or <hi>attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiva</hi> as in Pumps or Syringes, or the preponderation of the <hi>potentia</hi> to the weight of the Water) thus it ſuſtains, imples, or attracts, and therefore they are all reducible to the reaſon of the <hi>libra</hi> or Ballance.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, if the weight of the Water exceed the <hi>pondus</hi> or <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> which muſt raiſe it, it cannot either draw, or impell, or keep it up beyond an <hi>aequilibrium</hi> with that <hi>pondus</hi> or <hi>potentia impellens</hi> or <hi>attrahens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore if there be an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive diſtance between the Superficies of the reſtagnant Water, and the bottom of the <hi>Embolus</hi> or Bucket, ſuppoſe it 50 or 60 foot of perpendicular height, whereby the <hi>potentia attractiva</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched with a <hi>pondus</hi> of Water more than its ſtrength, it will not raiſe it to a due height. For ſtill as I ſaid, where any weighty body is raiſed out of its place, it muſt be by a greater weight, or
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50395:149"/>at leſt by a <hi>potentia,</hi> exceeding that weight of the Body to be raiſed.</p>
               <p>But the modern Philoſophy tells us, that the raiſing of the Water in the Pump or Syringe, is not by a <hi>vis attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiva</hi> or <hi>ſuctoria</hi> of the Bucket or <hi>Embolus,</hi> but that it is forced up by the weight of a Cylinder of Air, commenſurate to the cavity of the Pump or Syringe.</p>
               <p>And that the Elevation of the Pump or <hi>Embolus</hi> of the Syringe, attenuating the Air incloſed in the cavity of the Pump or Syringe, and thereby diſabled by its laxity to reſiſt the preſſure of the external Cylinder of atmoſpherical Air, the Water is driven up into the cavity of the Pump or Syringe.</p>
               <p>And becauſe a Cylinder of Mercury of twenty nine Inches and half, is by them ſuppoſed to be of equal weight to the Cylinder of Air of like diameter, reaching from the top of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere unto the veſſel of reſtagnant Mercury in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, and a Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> of twenty nine Inches and half high, countervails in weight a Cylinder of Water of like
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50395:150"/>diameter of about thirty three foot high, and conſequently a Cylinder of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere counterpoiſeth a Cylinder of Water of about thirty three foot high, therefore the Water in a Pump will be raiſed but juſt to that height, <hi>viz.</hi> neer thirty three foot, and no higher, becauſe ſuch a column or Cylinder of Water is counterpoiſed by an Atmoſpherical Cylinder of like diameter. Thus I think it is rendred by <hi>Schottus</hi> in his <hi>Technica Curioſa, l.4.cap.8.§.4.</hi> and by the Excellent Author of <hi>Hydroſtatical Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, n.5.</hi> and by other learned men of this latter age.</p>
               <p>But under their favour I think this is not the true Solution of the inſtance in hand, but the firſt is the true Solution thereof.</p>
               <p>If the elevation of the Water in the Pump may be more conſiderably higher than 33 foot, certainly this latter Solution cannot ſerve. And though this poſſibly hath not been fully tryed, and requires exact Engins to effect the Tryal to the uttermoſt; yet there are many that do experimentally affirm,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50395:150"/>that a Pump or Syringe well ordered will raiſe Water above forty foot perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular height; and if ſo, the counterpoiſe of the aereal Cylinder will not do the buſineſs. But this I have not tryed, I will therefore apply my ſelf to what I have tryed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> 22. I took therefore a great and ſtrong globular glaſs Bottle, <hi>ABC,</hi> holding five Quarts of Water, of about nine Inches Diameter, with a double orifice, <hi>viz.</hi> one at <hi>A,</hi> wherein to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten my Pump hereafter deſcribed, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>B,</hi> to let in or pour out Water, to leave open or cloſe, as I ſaw cauſe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>A</hi> the neck of the Bottle I faſtned a Laton Pump or Syringe, or about an Inch and a half diameter, marked <hi>D,</hi> with a ſmall Pipe about half an Inch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter; reaching neer the bottom of the Glaſs, <hi>viz. E;</hi> an <hi>Embolus</hi> at <hi>G</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down neer <hi>H,</hi> and a little crooked Pipe at <hi>H</hi> to drive out the Water by the depreſſion of the <hi>Embolus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Pump was faſtned and ſtrongly luted in the neck of the Glaſs with a double Valve, one about <hi>A</hi> to receive the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50395:151"/>Water into the Pump, and to ſuſtain it from returning, by depreſſing the <hi>Embolus,</hi> another at <hi>K</hi> the top of the orifice, to keep the Air from entring upon raiſing the <hi>Embolus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now the Bottle was the Well, which I filled up with Water.</p>
               <p>Therefore leaving open the orifice at <hi>B,</hi> whereby the Air had free acceſs into the Bottle, by lifting up and depreſſing the <hi>Embolus G</hi> the Water was freely and eaſily without any difficulty drawn out at the orifice <hi>K,</hi> through the Valve there placed, and ſo I emptied half the Bottle of Water, namely to <hi>I</hi> the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior half, being full of free uncompreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and common Air; and the lower half at <hi>I</hi> being full of Water.</p>
               <p>The Pump being in this poſture, I took a ſhort piece of Cork, firſt boyled and then dipt in melted Bees-wax and Roſin with it, I cloſely luted up the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at <hi>B,</hi> ſo that no air could poſſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And then I lifted up and depreſſed the <hi>Embolus</hi> ſeveral times, ſo long 'till I could ſee the whole ſucceſs of this Tryal.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>Embolus</hi> was raiſed, but not
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50395:151"/>with equal facility, as it was done when the orifice <hi>B</hi> was open.</p>
               <p>The reaſon whereof is, becauſe every elevation of the <hi>Embolus</hi> gave a violent tenſion to the Air in the ſuperior cavity of the Glaſs, which upon every portion of Water drawn up muſt neceſſarily be expanded into a larger ſpace to ſupply the ſpace left by the raiſed Water. So that the expanſion of the Air was not natural, or of its own accord, but by a violent attraction wrought upon it, and tenſion of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, yet notwithſtanding the excluſion of the Air, I did freely pump out above a quart of Water, whereby the Water ſubſided an Inch and a half below <hi>I,</hi> and conſequently the Air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded and dilated to ſo much more ſpace than it had before, <hi>viz.</hi> whereas the ſuperior cavity of the Glaſs held by the Air was two quarts and half, now it took up the room of three quarts and half, and ſomewhat more.</p>
               <p>So that here was a quart of Water raiſed up by the ſuction of the <hi>Embolus,</hi> and yet no poſſible Gravitation of that
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50395:152"/>imaginary atmoſpherical column to preſs or drive it up; ſo that ſurely the aſcent of the Water in the Pump is not by the Ballance, <hi>aequipondium,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation of a column of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere to the column of Water raiſed in the cavity of the Pump, for here was no acceſs for any ſuch column: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the imaginary Elaſticity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded portion of Air may be called in to help the matter, we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, but when I had raiſed up this quart of Water, and emptied ſo much out of my Bottle, all my iterated tractions and truſions of my <hi>Embolus</hi> could raiſe not one drop more.</p>
               <p>But all that was done by theſe repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red motions, was only the rarifying of the Air included in the Pump, when the <hi>Embolus</hi> was lifted up, and conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it again as the <hi>Embolus</hi> was depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but no Water raiſed.</p>
               <p>Now in this inſtance, the reaſon why a quart of water was raiſed, though the orifice at <hi>B</hi> were ſtopped, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>potentia ſuctoria</hi> or <hi>attractiva</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:50395:152"/>of the Pump was ſtrong enough to give a dilatation of the Air to a greater ſpace by a quart than it had before.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why it could raiſe no more, is this, namely, in as much as every portion of Water raiſed out of the veſſel, muſt of neceſſity leave a ſpace devoid of ſo much Water as is ſo raiſed up, and that derelicted ſpace muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be wholly vacant of any Body, which by the univerſal law of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is prohibited, or elſe the Air muſt expand it ſelf to fill it. And in as much as the Air having undergone as great an Expanſion already (by the evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt quart of Water) as this <hi>potentia</hi> or <hi>vis attractiva</hi> was able to effect. The included Air thus expanded reſiſteth any further expanſion with an equal ſtrength to the attractive power of the Pump, and ſo renders it <hi>conamen irritum,</hi> to give it a larger expanſion, and conſequently no more Water is raiſed.</p>
               <p>But if a greater ſtrength were applied, ſtrong enough to maſter that reſiſtence, as if the Pump were longer, that it
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50395:153"/>might give a ſtronger ſuction, that might overmatch the reſiſtence of the included Air againſt a higher degree of tenſion; yea or if the ſuperior Air, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this quart of Water was evacuated, had a ſtrong external heat applied to it, whereby it might be capable of a larger expanſion, the Water (while the Air was under this forcible expanſion) would be as eaſily raiſed by the Pump as at firſt. But this I durſt not try, for fear of breaking my Glaſs, or unluting of it.</p>
               <p>Upon this conſideration and tryal it is manifeſt,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Gravitation or preſſure of the external Air is not the cauſe of raiſing the Water in the Pump; for here it is raiſed where there is no Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the orifice at <hi>B</hi> being perfectly ſtopt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the common Air hath no ſuch Elaſticity, as the modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy aſſigns to it; for here a portion of Air included in the Glaſs is of the ſame texture with the common Air, and a portion of it, and yet evidently there
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50395:153"/>is no ſuch Elaſticity in it as is ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>And this appears, 1. becauſe it is not expanded to one third part of greater ſpace than it had before, without a force offered to it, as above is ſhewn. 2. When it is expanded to a third part of ſpace more than it had, it is ſo far from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural expanſion of it ſelf farther, that it refiſts the <hi>attractiva potentia</hi> of the Pump to give any larger expanſion. And 3. if it had yet a natural expanſive power without force or violence added to it, it would certainly drive up the reſt of the Water that remains, eſpecially when the Air in the Pump is rarified or extended by the elevation of the <hi>Embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and yet no Water follows it, in this inſtance, which yet it would do, if the Air had a continuing Spring or Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to drive it up.</p>
               <p>It is true, that naturally all the ſpaces of this lower World (at leſt) are and muſt be filled with ſome body or other: and as one body moves or is moved out of one ſpace to another, ſome other body ſucceeds in that ſpace that is ſo left, and fills it. And the fluid Bodies of Air and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50395:154"/>Water, or ſome fluid bodily ſubſtance, equivalent to either of them, are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their fluidity fitted more than other ſolider Bodies, to ſupply and make good the <hi>interſtitia</hi> of other Bodies; and if they be contiguous unto them, to ſlip into the ſpaces deſerted by their motion into other ſpaces, and accordingly will do it, if they are not impeded by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance or interpoſition of other more ſtubborn and untractable Bodies. And by this means upon the ſucceſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Bodies, there is maintained a ſucceſſive and continual circulation in the motions, eſpecially of thoſe Bodies that are fluid, and ſo more ready and apt for motion.</p>
               <p>In the Inſtance of my Pump, ſuppoſe that the orifice at <hi>B</hi> be left open, and the veſſel or Bottle have a Gallon of Water in it, and there ſtands by it an empty veſſel, ſuppoſe <hi>M,</hi> that contains a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon of Air: if I pump out a Gallon of Water out of the Pump into the veſſel <hi>M,</hi> as the Pump is gradually emptied of the Gallon of Water into <hi>M,</hi> the Water leaves its place in the Pump, and takes
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50395:154"/>up as much room in <hi>M,</hi> and the Air in <hi>M</hi> leaves as much ſpace there, and takes it up in the Pump, to which it hath a free acceſs; ſo that the two Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments change their ſtations, and while they hold their natural texture, hold the ſame extenſion of ſpace, though not the ſame ſituation. And thus a circulation is naturally conſequential upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eſepecially of fluid Bodies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Water leaves its place in the Pump, and diſpoſſeſſeth the Air in the veſſel <hi>M,</hi> and the diſpoſſeſſed Air gradually ſucceeds into the ſpace left by the Water, as faſt as the Water leaves it, and takes up another room equal to what it had before, though in another <hi>ubi;</hi> here is no Gravitation of an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical column upon the orifice <hi>B,</hi> but only a natural motion and ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the like portion of Air into the place relicted by the Water, and a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſertion of that ſpace which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had in the veſſel <hi>M,</hi> which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not retain againſt the weightier and more prevalent Element of Water tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up. So that it is neither a Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50395:155"/>of the atmoſpherical Cylinder upon the orifice <hi>B,</hi> nor any great Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity of the Air that drives up the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but a natural circulation of the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Air into the ſpace derelicted by the Water; and the immiſſion or inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Air into that Cavity, is the Effect not the Cauſe of the receſſion of the Water.</p>
               <p>And now to reduce all this long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the thing I principally intended, we are told by the late Philoſophy, that the ſuſpenſion of the Mercury at twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine Inches height in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, is cauſed by the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe of the weight of an external atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpherical Column, commenſurate in its craſſitude and weight to the Mercurial Cylinder ſuſpended in the Glaſs Tube.</p>
               <p>And when it is replied, that the like ſuſpenſion happens, if the Mercurial Engin be placed in a cloſe room, yea or in a Glaſs every way cloſed, that admits not any ſuch Mercurial column, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepts it and its preſſure by its cloſure every way. We are again told, that that little portion of Air included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50395:155"/>that room or Glaſs, hath ſo potent an Elaſticity, that it will as effectually ſuſpend the Mercury in the Tube, as that tall Atmoſpherical Cylinder of at leaſt ſeven Miles long. This I ſay ſeems to me utterly incredible for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Air included in a cloſe room or Glaſs, hath only the advantage of its imagined Elaſticity, but not the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ſtupendous weight aſſigned by this New Philoſophy to the external aereal Cylinder.</p>
               <p>The external Air hath the ſame Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity attributed to it, as the Air inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the cloſe room or Glaſs, and alſo the ſuppoſed advantage of the weight of the Cylinder of the Atmoſphere beſides.</p>
               <p>If the bare Elaſticity of incloſed Air be ſufficient to ſuſpend the Mercury at twenty nine Inches and half, within the room or Glaſs; the ſame Elaſticity in the external Air, with the advantage of its weight, ſhould ſuſpend the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury to fifty nine Inches high, which was never yet done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Elatery of the Air cannot
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50395:156"/>drive up a ſucceſſive portion of Water of half an Inch diameter into my Pump, without the attraction of the <hi>Embolus;</hi> nor yet is that attraction alſo effectual to raiſe the Water, when it hath expanded the Air to about a fourth part of ſpace more than is natural to it. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Elaſticity of the Air, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a cloſe room or Glaſs Receiver, can drive and keep up a Cylinder of Mercury twenty nine Inches high, which yet according to the amplitude of its diameter may weigh, two, four, or ten pound.</p>
               <p>I do therefore conclude upon the whole matter, that it ſeems to me, the new <hi>hypotheſis</hi> of the Weight and Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Air, as it is delivered by the late Philoſophy, is an Ingenuous Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but wants Reality to ſupport it ſelf, or to give a right and true Solution to the <hi>Phanomena</hi> wherereunto it is applyed.</p>
