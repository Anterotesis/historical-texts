            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now I only undertake to be your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer, and my own Monitor in these two main things: <hi>1.</hi> That we would often consider the <hi>Great End</hi> of our worthy Ministry, which is not, to please men, but <hi>Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> the Lord; not to obtain applause from the Vulgar, or respect from Great Men, or to make ample world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provision for our selves, but we are purposely sent from God, to save mens souls from death, and to carry (if it be possible) all our flock with us to Heaven. Let us revive this often upon our souls, especially when we are casting the Net of the Gospel among a Sea of Sinners in our actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb facs="tcp:47672:3"/>
Ministration, wherein we must consider that our Husbandmans soul is as precious to God, as the soul of a greater man, and should the rather be holpen, because he wants often the benefit of Education, Learning and Ingenuity to help himself. O let's think before their Passing-bell do startle us, whether we have done our utmost for the saving of the Man or Woman that is now sailing for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>2.</hi> That in our retired throughts we duly weigh, and then put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the <hi>fittest Means</hi> to accomplish this great End. <hi>1. In Sermons,</hi> what Texts and Subjects are most needful to ground them, to awaken them, to convert them, and to strengthen them; what Method is most useful to clear the will of God to them, and settle it in their memories, what words and affections are most effectual to declare their duty, and
<pb facs="tcp:47672:4"/>
perswade them to it: In short, how we may so paint to the life Grace and Glory, that the people may fall in love with them, and purchase them at any rate; and then so describe Sin and Hell, that they may tremble to think of them, and go from the Ordinances with their hearts penetrated, ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, melted and changed. That we may not fill our Sermons with sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less niceties, impertinent quotations, cholerick reflections, or with that unquiet controversal Divinity (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially about points less momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous) which hardly ever produce any effect, save Exasperation. And for as much as experience hath taught us, that private and particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Reproof doth catch many, that have slipped through more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral means; let us labour as far as we are able to take a particular care of each member of those flocks, where
<pb facs="tcp:47672:4"/>
any of us are Overseers; that we may warn <hi>every</hi> man, and teach <hi>every</hi> man, that we may present <hi>every</hi> man perfect in Christ Jesus. How many Drunkards, Swearers, Covetous, Trouble some persons are there under our charge, that either know not, or mind not the evil of their way, whom one quarter of an hours seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Advice might cure, and how well (generally) do men take such Counsels from us, because we are doing the Duties of our Office, and their faithfullest part, to wit, their Consciences are on our side? If it be possible therefore let us spare some time to go among them, to see how our Husbandry prospers, so shall we best be acquainted with their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and soonest gain their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Alas! if we do not know them, we must shoot our Arrow at adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if they do not love us, they
<pb facs="tcp:47672:5"/>
will hardly heed what we say. And then 2. In <hi>our Lives;</hi> O that they may be a Commentary on our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, full of Gravity, Humility, Piety, Peace and Love. Let our words and waies savour of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons we preach, that our Lives may convince those whom our Lips can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perswade; Alas we see that one irregular practice doth undermine &amp; throw down, that which many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have been building; they will not believe that, which we plainly show, we do not believe our selves. Though this be their mistake to take sanctuary in our sinnes, who must be judged by our Sermons; yet 'tis a distemper that will not easily be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and wo will be to them <hi>by whom</hi> offences come, as well as wo to them that are offended with the Truth. Let us remember Excellent <hi>Mr. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Advice (whose Tract called,
<pb facs="tcp:47672:5"/>
the <hi>Country-Parson,</hi> is richly worth our frequent reading) that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister should be a pattern of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to all the Men in the Parish, and his Wife to all the Women in the Parish, and his Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to all the Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Parish, and particularly that we be far from Prophaneness, Covetousness, Contention, direct or indirect opposition to serious Piety, or the Professors thereof. And lastly, 3. For our <hi>Inward Affections,</hi> that we may keep alwaies flaming in our hearts a sincere and Paternal Love to all our Flock, that our counsels, reproofs and Sermons may flow from a real and dear Love to them, and then they can hardly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in their effects upon them; that our Real and Visible design may not be to seek <hi>theirs</hi> but <hi>them.</hi> That our Behaviour degrade us not from that
<pb facs="tcp:47672:6"/>
Authority, wherewith we are vested; nor Pride keep us from that seasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention, that is so necessary among the people. But that we may be wholly taken up with our great work, and make our other circumstances attend and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this; that by any means we may save our selves, and them that hear us. And let's not think much of all this work, for we were told it before, and we shall be richly rewarded for every drop of Spirits, yea, for every drop of sweat, yea, for every drop of ink that is spent right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Masters Service; and doubly damn'd, if persons of our Knowledge and Implo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="1">1. Because the number of Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is great; the company of Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being the greatest of all others in this huge Corporation of the World,</p>
            <p>And 2. There being no particular Book to Direct or Encourage them therein that ever I could meet with in our Tongue.</p>
            <p>And 3. I confess also another Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to wit, a desire to be doing some good, which I trust (through the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, which I do humbly crave) will be attained hereby, and especially to those that were Hearers hereof, to
<pb facs="tcp:47672:7"/>
whom I owe my self, and all I can do.</p>
            <p>The matter herein is but ordinary Practical Divinity applied to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Calling of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The stile familiar and plain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their capacity; the method also fitted, as well as I could, to the most usefull things to be handled. In describing the Excellencies and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Calling, I have rather brought in the Husbandman doing what <hi>he ought,</hi> than what ordinary <hi>he doth;</hi> for you consider, I am not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an History, but Rules, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no honest heart be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for his coming short in these passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, provided he aime at them. The Rule must be exact, and our life as near it as we can. When I discourse his Sins and Temptations, and bring him sometimes on the stage under great disadvantages; understand it rather a Disswasive from that evil, than a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative thereof. I am very conscious of many weaknesses, but know not of any Errours or Reflections herein. It will suffice me, if it shall obtain pardon of the more acute, acceptation of my
<pb facs="tcp:47672:7"/>
friends, and amendment of heart and life of the poor Husbandman, for whom it was chiefly compiled.</p>
            <p>Though it accost onely the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, yet the matter thereof for the most past is applicable to every good Christian; and it were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the like particular Tracts were written about other Callings. And provided it hinder no man from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bible, and other more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Books, I believe the humble and diligent perusal hereof will quit any man the Cost, much better than trifling of his time away: But see you joyne Meditation and Prayer with your Reading; One leaf so digested being more likely to do your Soul good, than many without them. And remember still, that you be as ready to practise what is plain, as to censure what is doubtful, and bless the Lord for what is <hi>worthy,</hi> as well as blame the Pen-man for what is <hi>weak.</hi> If you receive any profit hereby, I am made, (for doing good is the greatest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment) and in that case let God alone reap the praise; and Me his unworthiest Servant your Prayers.
<pb facs="tcp:47672:8"/>
The Blessing of God accompany this Endeavour for the Husbandmans Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Comfort and Salvation! <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>First</hi> Chapter of this Book is a most certain History of the Ancient Things: the <hi>Author</hi> infallible, the <hi>Matter</hi> important, the <hi>Style</hi> majestick, the <hi>Method</hi> exact and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, the <hi>Pen-man</hi> learned and honest: A Chapter to be often read, with much Faith and great Thankfulness.</p>

This <hi>second</hi> Chapter reviews and dilates upon the latter part of the former; for all that is said herein, must needs be done in the sixth day: And a great dayes work it was; in that day our Mother <hi>Eve</hi> was made, <hi>Eden</hi> planted, and our Father <hi>Adam</hi> put into it, to dress it and to keep it. Well for us if there had been no more work done that day; but the best of it is, the bones our Father <hi>Adam</hi> broke, our brother <hi>Adam</hi> (the <hi>second</hi> of that name) hath so pieced, that they are stronger than before.</p>
               <p>But to be short; (as our <hi>Historian</hi> is) when <hi>God</hi> had instituted a Sabbath, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. 3. reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated some of the Creation, <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. and described the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which, in order of time, the subsequent story of the womans creation, should come in) He brings our first Parents in this <hi>Text,</hi> and settles them in a calling.</p>
               <p>So that, this Scripture is a narrative of the first imployment of the first Man in the world. Ancient matters are the Subject of mens scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny. <note n="*" place="margin">1 Chro. 4.22, 23. <hi>And these are ancient things.</hi> Speaking of those that dwelt among Plants and Hedges for the Kings work.</note> Here is a piece of Antiquity.

                  <hi>should have a Calling.</hi> It is a dangerous condition to be destitute of a Calling. If any man might have claimed freedome from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, sure our father <hi>Adam</hi> might. For his Descent and Blood, He was, saith the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist</hi> (Luke 3. last) <hi>the Son of God;</hi> For his Quality, He was, saith the <hi>Psalmist</hi> (Ps. 8. 5.) but <hi>little lower than the Angels, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory and honour:</hi> For his Estate <hi>(ver. 6.)

If happiness had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in doing nothing, Man had not been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. All his delights could not have made him happy in an idle life; Man therefore is no sooner made than he is set to work; neither <hi>Greatness,</hi> nor <hi>Perfection</hi> can priviledge a fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hand <note n="*" place="margin">Bp. <hi>Hall</hi> Contempl.</note>.

Kind of life by his <hi>Desoent, Quality, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, Parts</hi> or <hi>Graces.</hi> When <hi>God</hi> Almighty had but one Child in the world, he bestowed him in a Calling. The Angels themselves must have a Calling, They are <hi>ministring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> yea our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> himself, though the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily, yet it is most probable, he was conversant in some imployment, until he entred upon the exercise of his Ministry.</p>
               <p>A man may be said to be <hi>without a Calling,</hi> when he wants good imployment to fill up his time. No man hath one hour to spare in all his life, but should be spent either in doing or receiving Good; And therefore when Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is used for <hi>Pass-time,</hi> it loses the true end of it. Sure I am, we are commanded in the Scripture to <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 5.16</note>

And in general, when a man brings no good or profit to the Church or Commonwealth, That's one of no Calling.</p>
               <p>For every man should be of some use in the <hi>Body Politick,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Body Mystical,</hi> or else he is but an Artificial member, a meer wooden legg. Though we are <hi>Of</hi> another world, yet we are <hi>In</hi> this world at present, and we must see that it lose nothing by us: As we are the better for it, and have our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence out of it, so we must make a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it be the better for us, and be prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up by us. And indeed it is our <hi>Safety,</hi> as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47672:16"/>
well as <hi>Duty,</hi> to be some way well imployed For he that is out of a Calling, is under the <hi>Devils Temptation,</hi> and from under <hi>Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</hi> If our Mother <hi>Eve</hi> had been as busie as our Father <hi>Adam, Satan</hi> had not so easily intrapped her in his temptation. Sometimes <hi>non vacat</hi> is as good a remedy against a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as <hi>non licet,</hi> I have no Liesure will cut the tempter off, as well as I have no Leave.

                  </note>, <hi>God</hi> took him by the hand and led him into his Calling.

               <p>Now you are led into a Calling by the <hi>Lord,</hi> when <hi>your Prayers</hi> and <hi>his Providence</hi> have made the way. When good <hi>Jacob</hi> was turned into the wide world, he goes straight to Heaven, and there vowed this vow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I go,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then shall the Lord be my God.</hi> Was this vow in vain? In no wise; for his God kept him, and disposed of him well as heart could wish, and sent him back in two Bands, though all his stock when he went abroad, was his Staff. He that ventures into a Calling without God, goes without his guide, who hath said, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>In all thy wayes acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so when His <hi>Providence</hi> hath led the way. We have, in the disposing of <hi>Isaac</hi> into the world, both these together, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 14. Prayer went before, and Providence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after. And <hi>vers.</hi> 50. It is agreed, saith <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> and <hi>Bethuel, The thing proceedeth from the Lord, we cannot speak a word against it.</hi> It is a sweet thing to sail with the gale of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47672:18"/>
and sharp to sail against it.</p>
               <p>And then, when thy Calling is lawful, and thy ends right, it strongly argues that God leads thee into it, and this is a sweet thing.</p>
               <p>For then you will bring honour to God, and that is the honour of a Calling; For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we live, we live unto the Lord, and whatsoever we do, it ought to be done to the glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>God</hi> hath a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Rent of glory from a poor Thresher, then from many a Prince in the world.</p>
               <p>And then when you are led into your Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by the <hi>Lord,</hi> you will better brook the inconveniences thereof: for every Calling hath some of these, which you will digest the better, when you are led into them by such an hand. The Cup which my Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me shall I not drink? who can but cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully drink the Cup that comes out of so good an hand? Lord! Here thou hast put me; though my work be hard, fare hard, usage hard, yet here I'le stay, till the same hand fetch me off again. And so holy <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 31.40. <hi>In the day the drought consumed him, and the frost by night, and his sleep departed from his eyes,</hi> and yet <hi>twenty</hi> years he stuck to it. <hi>God</hi> had disposed him there, and his <hi>God</hi> should dismiss him thence, for so saith the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.3. And the <hi>Lord</hi> said unto <hi>Jacob, Return to the Land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, let me advise all that make any reckoning of <hi>God</hi> or of his blessing, Let him
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47672:18"/>
carve out Callings for you, and not carnal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy or carnal friends without him. Crave his direction and benediction, your wisest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances he can blast with a breath, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molish your Castles in the Air with half a word; whereas if thou acknowledge him, though thy beginning be small, thy latter end he will make great, and they that are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him, he will never see them want.</p>

               <p>I shall take him here in his largest Capacity; for since our Father <hi>Adams</hi> time, divers other Callings have been cantelled out of it, but he had it intire; and as he left it, I shall take it in this place.</p>

                  <note place="margin">II. The lawfulness of Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.</note> 
                  <hi>Lawfulness of his Calling.</hi> It stands men upon to be well assured of the lawfulness of their Callings, else every stroke they take in them is Sin. In the choice of Callings, think of this, Is my Calling lawful? And am I law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called into it? No Calling on earth hath precedence to this for lawfulness. Its true, the lawfullest Calling may be abused by a graceless man. That transcendent Calling of the Ministry, the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17. did so abuse, that <hi>men did abhor the offerings of the Lord.</hi> Wo, wo for ever (if they repent not) to all such <hi>Hophnites,</hi> that drive the <hi>Lords</hi> people from the <hi>Lords</hi> offerings. But this can lay no imputation upon that worthy Calling, A Spider can suck poyson from the sweetest Flower; and so a bad Husband may make
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47672:21"/>
shift to grow bankrupt on the best Calling in he World; but yet in its self the Husbandman hath as much to say for the lawfulness of his imployment, as any man under Heaven. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>Calling of Gods choyre,</hi> and that is the best Portion that <hi>God</hi> carves; If there had been the least sin in it, he would never have disposed our Father <hi>Adam</hi> into it. He <note place="margin">In old <hi>Rome</hi> if a man were degraded from the <hi>Rustick</hi> to the <hi>Urbane</hi> Tribes, consisting of Artisans &amp;c it was thought a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. <hi>Plin l.</hi> 18. c. 3.</note> that knew all the Callings that men would invent, he pitcht upon this: And he chose it for his eldest Son, and you know men will serve the first, best. God tells his people <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> he would bring them to a Land, that he had spied out for them; and if there be an happy place on earth, <hi>God</hi> can spy it out: why, this was a Calling, that <hi>God</hi> had spied out for his Eldest Child <hi>Adam;</hi> Therefore lawful no doubt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>a Calling of mans industry,</hi> and so the more lawful. When a Calling is driven on only by Art and Cunning, there is sin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in such Callings; but the <hi>Hand</hi> is more innocent than the <hi>Head.</hi> There is no guile in innocent labour. The sweat of the Browes is harmless sweat. If there be any flaw, it is in the Man, not in the Husbandry, which is as innocent as the state of Innocency it self.</p>
               <p>Indeed most other Callings are lawful too in themselves, but they border more nearly upon sin and temptation, than this doth. They may be more profitable, but cannot be more lawful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:47672:21"/>
Think of this, Poor Husbandman, to thy comfort; when thou art sweating at thy Plough, This is heavy cheer, But I am in my Calling, my lawful Calling. This Sweat needs not to be repented of, I need not wash this <hi>sweat</hi> with <hi>tears.</hi> Though this be painful, yet it is not sinful. The lawfulness of it will make amends for the painfulness thereof. And that is the <hi>Second</hi> Head, namely the <hi>Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the Husbandmans Calling.</p>

            <p>ANd now let us advance a step higher, <note place="margin">Some things premised.</note> and for the Glory of God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Husbandman, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Excellencies</hi> of this Calling; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed I would lay down these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it hath Inconveniences also; for the wise <hi>God</hi> hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. The imployment without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is in Heaven: There's Harvest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out VVinter, a fair Crop and no sweat, an House without decayes, and Ground paved with Rubies.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47672:22"/>
2. Upon some Callings <hi>God</hi> hath set a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er stamp of Honour, than on the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Though his first <hi>created</hi> Son were a Tiller of the ground, yet his first <hi>Begotten</hi> Son was an Husbandman of Souls, and did sow for Heaven. And the Husbandman will now wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly give precedence to the <hi>Magistrate</hi> and <hi>Minister,</hi> for the <hi>Authority</hi> of God vested in the one, and the <hi>Work</hi> of God managed by the the other; as considering that the Magistrate is a more publick good than he, and the Soul (wherein the Minister labours) more worthy than the body.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Difficulties of a Calling do not prejudice the Dignity thereof. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>We then as workers together with him</hi>]. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is a most difficult work, able to tire an Angels arms; but yet being workers together with <hi>God,</hi> this dignifies the Calling again. It is a worthy attempt to seek out the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> Stone, which would convert Dust into Gold, but no attempt is harder. In a pit of Marle or Limestone the Husbandman finds it, and makes a quicker return of gain by that, than the Chymist doth by the other; The poorest things are fullest of ease, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the more honourable, the more hard.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I must premise further, That the most profitable Callings are not alwayes the best. The <hi>Merchant</hi> fetches home greater riches, but he brings a Disease oftentimes with them; The <hi>Lawyer</hi> makes greater purchases; but somtimes purchases a curse with them; The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47672:22"/>
               <hi>Tradesman</hi> somtimes leaves a greater Estate behind him, but then often takes a wounded Conscience with him. <hi>Lot Gen</hi> 13. 10. had a Plain to live in, that was <hi>even as the garden of the Lord,</hi> yet was it the sink of sin, and shortly after a Lake of Brimstone. The sweetest meats are not alwayes the wholsomest; <hi>Profit</hi> is not the measure of <hi>Goodness;</hi> That is a rich Calling that inriches God himself, that is, which most glorifies him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Though Husbandry be a brave Calling, yet the Christian Husbandman makes it much better. In this sence also that is true, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. For bodily increase profiteth little, but <hi>Godliness</hi> is profitable unto all things. Thy weary dayes and pamful nights profit but a little, and for a little while; but Godliness with them brings universal and eternal profit. As he that makes <hi>Instruments of musick,</hi> hath a fine imployment, but he who hath the <hi>Art of Musick,</hi> that can tune and use them, far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strips him: So naked Husbandry is a worthy Calling, but the <hi>Christian Husbandman</hi> that knows how to use it to the best, and makes heavenly Musick out of it, hath a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. <hi>Caius Sejus bonus vir, et eo melior quod Christianus.</hi> The meanest Calling is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, if <hi>God</hi> be in it. <hi>Christ</hi> in the lowest heart, and <hi>Christ</hi> in the lowest Calling makes it happy.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Yet no man shall be saved by his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. You must not conclude from any thing said, or to be said, that a man of such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47672:23"/>
imployment must needs be saved. No, no; thy harmless Calling without an holy heart will not save thy soul; It is <hi>Christ</hi> in you, that is the Hope of Glory. The Crown it self cannot keep from death, nor can your Calling save you from hell, without the grace of God.</p>
            <p>The Ministers Calling (one would think) were sure to save him, one purposely imployed to describe Heaven and Hell to the life, whose proper Subject is <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Soul, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world; yet alas! all they are not saved, <hi>Mat. 7. 22. We have prophesied in thy Name,</hi> [VVe have opened the Gates of Heaven to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and must we be shut out our selves?] <hi>And in thy Name we have cast out Devils,</hi> [and must we be cast to the Devil?] yea, sayes Christ, I do not know you, nor never did, if you have been workers of iniquity. The poor <hi>Prophet,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.24. that had substantially warned others from the <hi>Devil,</hi> could not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape himself from the <hi>Lion,</hi> when he disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore how excellent soever the Husbandmans calling is, yet he may go to Hell from the Plough, if he have not saving Grace. And these things to prevent mistakes being thus premis'd, let us view the Excellencies of this Calling.</p>

Let us advise, sayes <hi>God,</hi> what Calling shall we pitch upon for this worthy Creature? How shall we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose most nobly of him? what imployment is worthy of him that wears our Image upon him? Then falls in this excellent way of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; He shall be an Husbandman. Now it is a maxime, <hi>A summo Bono nil nisi bonum.</hi>

and cunning in the Husbandman, as in other men. In many Callings, deceit is half the Trade; but plain dealing is the genuine frame of the good Husbandman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 27. <hi>Esau, he was a cunning Hunter, but Jacob</hi> was <hi>a Plain man, dwelling in Tents;</hi> void of dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and deceit; And he, we must not lose him, he was an Husbandman in our large acceptation, for our Father <hi>Adam</hi> was not set only to dress the earth, but to keep it too, and all that fed thereon. A plain man is the very description of an Husbandman. The States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deals in policy, the Souldier in cruelty, the Trades-man in dissimulation; the deepest policy of the Husbandman is to get bread for his Family, and pay his Rent; his greatest cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty is to dig into the Bowels of the earth, his cunningest dissimulation is in fraying the fowls from his Corn, and to trappan and draw in a Rivulet to water his Medow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>eap where he did not sow. And so though his income be not great, yet it is as solid as it seems; he hath <hi>shorter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> but others have a <hi>larger reckoning;</hi> and that estate which comes <hi>too soon,</hi> seldom stayes <hi>too long</hi> with any man.</p>
               <p>Indeed in this Iron Age, too much fraud is stollen under this coat offreeze, but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was not so; nor yet can the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman

cogg and flatter and circumvent with that impudence which others have: he Plowes not with the subtle <hi>Fox,</hi> but with the laborious <hi>Oxe;</hi> and if he cannot thereby reach a livelihood, hee'l rather <hi>fare</hi> hardly, himself, than <hi>deal</hi> hardly with his Brethren. Here, says he, I might sell bad for good, or less measure for full measure, but so might my next Crop be blasted; and if I deal deceitfully with men, my Kine and Sheep might next time cast their Young, and deceive me. I will be just and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, sink or swim. Plain dealing is my only Jewel, and though by using it I dye a beggar, yet shall I be one of Gods poor, and then I care not.</p>

Now his labour keeps down his lust, and his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty helps to quell down his pride, and sure his worldly Desires cannot compare with those of vaster Estates, seeing the more a man hath, the more unsatisfied are his Desires. <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> were own Brothers, but <hi>Joseph</hi> is exalted at Court, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> is seated in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47672:28"/>
the Country; and now whether proves the safer? why, <hi>Benjamin</hi> he comes to <hi>Egypt</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and modest, and sober; but <hi>Joseph,</hi> though 'tis like the better man, yet he is gotten into the Court fashion, and hath <hi>by the Life of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> at his tongues end. Nay one and the same man, holy <hi>David,</hi> who more chast and innocent in the Countrey, among his Sheep? but he was not so at the Court: So that as many great Oaks and Cedars fall, when Shrubs do keep their standing in a storm, so the great and rich and mighty ones of the world are often entrapped in lust, envy, pride, and Atheism; when the poor honest Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman is kept innocent and cleer.</p>
               <p>I do not say but he hath an Heart too like other men, and perhaps would be as bad as they, if he had wherewith: But he hath not so great temptations, his God doth not give him Wind and Tyde, least he should drown himself: The Lace on a proud Tradesmans Cloak, would suit the Husbandman all the Year, and one of his Dinners would find his house the Month about; but yet he is adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the orient Jewels of Grace within, and tasts more Covenant comforts at an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, than the other doth in seven years. He hath not his Beauties in the Windows to allure him, nor the sparkling Wine to entice him, the newest Fashion is so far from entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling him, that it's ugly in his eyes; the charms of Musick do not inchant him, he is more taken with the musick of his Bees than

any other. His Children are his usual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, and his spare time he spends with them. And his Dinner of herbs with the love of <hi>God</hi> feeds him more safely, than a stalled Oxe, and <hi>Gods</hi> hatred with it.</p>

That food is best, that makes a man neither too lean and languid, nor too fat and foggy; and that state is best, that gives a man food convenient for him.</p>
               <p>For as for Riches, they are mercies, but they are dangerous mercies; Sin never prospers more then in prosperity; it doth emasculate and effeminate the spirits, and nourisheth so many weeds, that the winter of affliction hath much adoe to master them: <hi>How</hi> loth are men
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47672:30"/>
to deny themselves, when they have a <hi>great self</hi> to deny? how loth to dye, that have so much to leave? what cares must needs invade their prayers, and break their Rest, that have abundance? And how hard is it to be full and not forget the <hi>Lord,</hi> grow lazy in Religion, and love the present world? So that a wise man will be as much afraid to be rich, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are to be poor.

               <p>And then on the contrary, Poverty is a wofull Disease, makes a man unuseful, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and burdensome, and hazzards him on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull courses; He may be tempted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust providence, and so steal, and take Gods name in vain; and except mens hearts were softer, more will pity him than relieve him: Now the Husbandman, though his fare be be hard, and his rayment course, yet he is kept from stealing; instead of begging he relieves the beggar, and makes amends for the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Alms, with the smiles that go with it.

Some callings serve the <hi>Delight</hi> of man, some his <hi>Fancy,</hi> some his <hi>Lust,</hi> but this serves his <hi>Necessity.</hi> Now Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity sets the price on things. <hi>Sole &amp; Sale nihil utilius.</hi> The Commonness of the Sun in Heaven, or the Salt upon Earth, doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish from the worth of them, because they <note place="margin">This is a good <hi>work</hi> for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary uses, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 14.</note> are so necessary: So the multitude of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen abates not their excellency, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without them. You would read but faintly, nor I write this that you are reading, but for some. Husbandmans sweating last har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest. How should <hi>God</hi> have his Rent for all these creature comforts, but through his help? Or how should man have a livelihood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his fore-cast? The Earth would quickly return to her bryars and thorns without his culture. Instead of Roses we must have Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and instead of Corn, brambles: And therefore let him have his honour, we cannot live without him.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Grace</hi> is the one thing needful for the Soul, it lives not a day in a true sence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; so <hi>Bread</hi> is the one thing needful for the body, and it dyes without it: without the

The King was delighted with the deceit, till being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hungry, he called for real meat: Nay, (says she) if you imploy all your Subjects in your Mines, you must expect to feed upon Gold, for nothing else can your Kingdome afford. So that the digging in the mines must give place to the Husbandmans digging in the ground, else they'l dig but a while. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that pretty Fable, of all the members mutinying against the Belly, for that they did all the work, and she devoured all the meat; wherefore they resolved to cut her short, she should labour as well as they, or fast for it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they deal with her, all the members refuse to help her: but e're long the hands lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, the legs grow feeble, the eyes dim, and the head light, and soul and body had like to have taken leave: At length they see their errour, and perceive that the belly maintain'd them all, and for all its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

even so, though the Husbandman have but a low situation in the body politick, yet' if he be discouraged, neglected, or should surcease, all degrees of men would be at a loss, and from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, the body politick would be sick.</p>

As if a mans house stood in his Enemies garrison, it were a great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience; though his house were never so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, yet to enjoy it he ventures his life. The world is now an Enemy to our souls, yet in the mid'st of it stands the Husbandmans call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And therefore if he will be safe he must do, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 4. 17. with one of his hands work in his calling, and with the other hold a weapon.</p>

The Best Remedy against this Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, <hi>To be crucified to the world, Gal.</hi> 6. 14.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47672:36"/>
least of all to meditate, unless it be occasionally among his work. And his Life is divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween labour and rest, and but that he is fully resolved, the main chance shall not be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, his soul would be forgotten. He hath <hi>many dayes,</hi> and yet but a <hi>little time;</hi> his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness calls him out, and the night calls him in again; And so he is apt to doubt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by fits, because it is said, <hi>Psalm</hi> 1. 2. The Godly mans delight is in the law of the Lord, <hi>and in that law he doth meditate day and night.</hi> He longs to read such a good Book, but Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest or Business calls, and he must away, longs to go and confer with his Minister about his poor soul, but can seldome get leave of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, either his poor soul, or his poor family must suffer. And he finds it very much adoe, to live in this world, and yet provide to live for ever. And how shall the honest Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man remedy this matter?</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Remedy</hi> must be this, you must Work the harder, and sleep the less, that you may pray and read the more. If the Heathens can produce a Philosopher, that used to work most of the day, that he might be sustained to study most of the night, how much more may you that hope for better things than they, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the body a little as it will bear, to furnish the soul as it hath need? How late and early can you sometimes be at a gainfull market; and is there any market where Grace is sold? Remember still that One thing, and only that one thing is Needful in comparison, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47672:36"/>
42. And then, be sure the little time you can spend for your souls, improve it well. The shorter you must be at prayer, see you be the more serious. They who can do little, had need to do it well. And then you may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that as the Lord blesseth your short Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and thin meals, to as much health and strength of body, as they who have their plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous variety, so will the same God bless to you your pulse and water, your few, but live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties to feed your souls, as if you had larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er opportunities.

And in the mean time, among other provision in his house, he provides 2.

He hath his house to build or to repair, that almost ruines him; then his ground to manure, that costs him much trouble and care; then his Rent or Fine to pay, this falls heavy on him, and comes oft; he hath hardly got up his back, but the half year returns, and his Rents squeeze him down again, so that between the cares of his mind and the pains of his body, he hath load enough for one.

The one may have as long life, as good health, as much comfort in the Creatures, as cheerful an heart, and as happy a life as the other, with less danger here, and a less account hereafter; but here is the Husbandmans disadvantage, he can but little promote any publick good, nor hinder little publick evil; he cannot build Hospitals, endow Churches, erect Schools, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act good Laws, preach Sermons, nor encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage piety: Nor on the other hand can he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Sin, if his life lay on it; he sees them drunk when he goes to Market, and he hears them swear, and beholds the Sabbath broken, but he cannot remedy it, he doth as far as he can; he, where he sees it likely, attempts to

He sees much amiss every where; and though he be not so conceited, as to think (were he in place) he could amend it, yet he refers it to <hi>God,</hi> and earnestly presses him to mend it. And <hi>God</hi> will do much at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of an upright Husbandman, and when

            <p>WE are now arrived at the Fifth Head, which is to inquire into the <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> incident to this Calling. Paradise it self was not without them, and in every Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he must expect them. There are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations <hi>to suffering,</hi> and Temptations <hi>to sin;</hi> the one mentioned <hi>James</hi> 1. 2. The other, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. It is cause of joy when we fall into temptations of suffering, especially for Christ; many account it all joy when they escape such
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47672:41"/>
temptations, but we should rather account it all joy when we meet with them. It's cause of sorrow when we are tempted to sin, though we are apt to think our selves made with such Temptations: And many of these have inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the harmless Calling of the Husbandman. But to be forewarn'd is the way to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd; and though he be assaulted, yet he is not forsaken. He hath a Father that will <hi>not lead him into temptation;</hi> which is not only his daily prayer, but his chiefest care; That though his Mothers children have him Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Vineyards, yet his own Vineyard may be kept.</p>

               <p>THe First Temptation of the Husbandman <note place="margin">§. 1. Earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> is, <hi>Earthly-mindedness.</hi> The Earth is his Element, therein is his business, and there he is in danger to lose his heart, as it is said <hi>John</hi> 3. 31. <hi>He that is of the Earth is earthly, and speaketh of the Earth.</hi> The Husbandman is sprung as it were out of the Earth, and the frame of his heart is prone to be earthly, and his words are much of the same subject. As it is impossible to behold the Heavens above us with one Eye, and Earth under our feet with the other; so it is a very hard business, to have the Eye of the Soul upward, and the Eye of the Body, downward at the same time. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e World looks little when one is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a great way off it; but while on it, it looks
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47672:42"/>
vast and great. On a Mountain, whole Fields at a distance look no bigger than a leaf of this book; but he that is at them finds them big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And a small <hi>Hatt</hi> held near our Eye, will hinder our sight of the Sun, more than a great Mountain at a distance. O Sirs, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman is near the Earth, and it looks great in his eye, and indangers to fill the heart and all; it swallows up his heart, and devours his time, and dulls his spirits; he is ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count these things the greatest things, because they are next him, and he lives in them and upon them; he looks on his money, and sees more beauty in it, than in the Sun that shines; and the face upon his Silver, he thinks the beautifullest face in the world: The lowing of his Cattel, is better Musick to him, than the best Musick, and a good Crop more welcome (suppose him yet without an Eye of Faith) than all the Promises in the Bible. <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>Deliver me from men of this world, which have their Portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with hidden treasures.</hi> When the <hi>Belly</hi> is full of the hid treasures of the Earth, the <hi>Heart</hi> is often empty of the hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Described again, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Who mind earthly things.</hi> To have earthly things is a mercy, but to mind earthly things is a curse. And this is his Temptation-; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is his Calling, and herein is his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You know, it is hard to touch pitch without defilement; where both hands a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> full, much adoe to keep the heart empty; and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47672:42"/>
especially when Riches increase, the heart is set on them. O what carnal delight hath a man of the world, to see his stock of Cattle stand and increase, when his fields are well grown, and his barns filled: The comforts of heaven only exceed it. Thou hast put glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness into mine heart, more than when their corn and wine increased, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>The choicest of his thoughts are prone to be spent on these things, and his Soul cleaveth to the dust. Poor man! though he be never likely to have great things in the world, yet his head is full of <hi>Proclamations</hi> (as we say) and his heart of distractions. Much adoe to dwell on Earth, and live in <hi>Heaven</hi> at the same time, or for him to have the heart set on the other world, that hath this world set in his heart.</p>
               <p>But that I may not discover the <hi>diseases</hi> of this Calling, without prescribing some <hi>cure</hi> thereof; I shall add to each Temptation an <hi>Antidote</hi> or two, if you will resolve not onely to <hi>approve</hi> them, but <hi>apply</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One Preservative from this Temptation <note place="margin">1. <hi>Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
                  </note> will be, to consider the Nature of your souls; So excellent, that they are capable to know and enjoy <hi>God</hi> himself; they are company for an Angel, they are Nobly Descended: Now to degrade these, to bury them in a furrow, to make them stoop to the slavish service of the world, is unworthy and unreasonable; <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rebus non me trado, sed commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> Senec. de Benef.</note> As if a man had Golden Mills to grind nothing, but for Horse-bread, with them. It's enough for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47672:43"/>
the Serpent to eat the Dust all his dayes, your souls are created for an higher end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And then, consider the uncertainty of <note place="margin">2.</note> all these Earthly things you set your hearts upon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Wilt thou set thine heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is not?</hi> Mark, it's not worth looking at, much less setting thy heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on [<hi>that which is not</hi>]; things that fade, <hi>are not,</hi> they have no being worth speaking of. And it follows, <hi>For riches certainly make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wings;</hi> if no body steal them, or take them away, yet they make themselves wings; <hi>certainly</hi> they will away, and <hi>flee;</hi> not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part fairly, or run in haste from you, but <hi>flee</hi> from you; and who would mind such fading trasn? They will sing you a sweet song, like the bird by your window, but they are gone, you have them not in a Cage: And who will fall in love with a Sparrow on the house top?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be often in the Scriptures. That's an <note place="margin">3.</note> Heavenly Book, and will best cure an Earthly heart. To converse with the world, will make you worldly, but to converse with <hi>God,</hi> will make you heavenly. There <hi>God</hi> will tell you the vanity and vexation, that is in all earthly things; There he will shew better things, yea, durable riches and righteousness. The Devil can shew you on a Mountain all the Glory of the World; but on the <hi>Pisgah</hi> of the <hi>Bible, God</hi> can shew you all the Glory of Heaven: You can hardly come out of the Scriptures without a divine frame, if you will read them withall your heart. The law of thy
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47672:43"/>
mouth is better to me, than thousands of Gold and Silver. Two or three <hi>Scriptum est's</hi> dash't and disgraced all the Glory of the World, and the God of it also.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be exercised oft in Meditation. As til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage <note place="margin">4. A Saint should go through the world like one in a deep stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Mr. <hi>Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ck. Meditatio quasiment is ditatio.</hi>
                  </note> changes the nature of some barren grounds, and makes them better; so Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion changes the complexion of the soul, finds it poor, and leaves it rich, lifts up the soul to converse with God, familiarizes the invisible things of <hi>God</hi> to the soul, and makes a man at home in Heaven, and a stranger on Earth. He that will think with all his heart on <hi>God,</hi> can think but with half an heart on any thing in the world. When the Soul hath been a while above, what's a house or field in comparison of <hi>God?</hi> what's a Crown or a World to Him that sitteth on the Throne? Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there's none on Earth I can desire like thee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25.</p>

The Second Temptation of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman <note place="margin">Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> is, <hi>Discontent.</hi> He hath divers crosses, and these provoke him to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure against <hi>God.</hi> He hath but narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life, and this occasions some grudgings at his own Condition. His shoe pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches him, and he cannot hide it. Unless he be Master of much Grace, he frets, he fumes, he thinks the world is unequally divided; he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47672:44"/>
takes himself something neglected, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. His house is ready to fall, his children want cloaths, his rent day is near, and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney far off; his comforts are discomforts, his things are nothings, and thus he grudges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is not satisfied; <hi>God</hi> himself can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly please him. The <hi>Lord</hi> hath helped him in forty things, but he is in a strait again, and now that is forgotten. <hi>God</hi> takes no care of poor men, his Lot is worse than every ones; never man had such a life, would he were in his grave, he should then be quiet; and thus poor man he thinks he hath reason on his side, and that he hath cause to be angry.</p>
               <p>And then, the injuries, calu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

A Thief goes away with a sheep or an horse <hi>this</hi> way, the Fowls and Mice they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loine away his corn <hi>another</hi> way.

But these things meeting with a weak Christian, weary with labour, tempt him sometimes to say, <hi>My soul is weary of my life—I will speak in the bitterness of my soul, Job</hi> 10. 1. and alas! so he does, if Grace prevent not: his wife she is chidden, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren beaten, his servants turned out of doors, his neighbours reviled; and then after all he

               <p>
                  <hi>Preservatives</hi> against this Temptation to Discontent are, Discretion, Supplication, and Consrderation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Discretion.</hi> Most of your vexations are the effect and consequence of your indiscretion; hence many of your straits come; had you or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered business wisely, you had never been in them; hence many of your losses, many tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, and the vexations from them have flowed; and therefore you must study to be wise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 112. 5. <hi>A good man guides his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with discretion,</hi> and so comes to be able to <hi>shew favour and lend.</hi> A wise man discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth time and judgement, orders things in their season, and so layes in little fuel for discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, whereas the foolish man by his rashness leaps into troubles and straits, and then fumes and roars like a wild Bull in a net, all the house cannot hold him. And especially, young House-holders, that have leapt into that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hand over head, erre herein; The rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their youth, layes up for the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of their old age. And Parents are too blame herein, that do not fill their children with advise, and all kind of wisdome, before they lanch out into this sea of worldly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: They send them away with Portions and Estates; but how few are they that spend a day or an hour in directing them with wise counsel, whereby they may live well here, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47672:45"/>
better hereafter. A little wisdom would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a great deal of Discontent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Supplication.</hi> Beg of <hi>God</hi> a meek and quiet Spirit, which is of so great price in the fight of <hi>God;</hi> and watch after your Prayers, not only how the Lord answers, but how you endeavour: He that prayes against Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, binds himself to watch and strive against it, or else his prayers are sin. Beg an humble heart of <hi>God:</hi> The humble man is seldome dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; he thinks the least of mercies, is good enough for the chief of sinners. Here's a poor house, course fare, hard lodging, unkind usage; but 'tis good enough for me: Any thing that's abated of Hell is meer courtesie: If I may have but bread to eat, and rayment to put on, it's fair for such a one as I. And then beg a mortified heart to all that is in the world. When the heart is dead to the world, worldly troubles do not trouble him. When the Souldiers saw <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord was dead, they would not break his bones. He that's dead to the world, will save his bones whole: when crosses, straits and troubles come upon him, why, they return to <hi>God,</hi> saying, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der man is dead already to the world, his heart is crucified to it, he feels nothing, so as to be distempered by it. When they strip dead men, they struggle not; you may take all, they trouble not at it. O beg such an heart, that <hi>God</hi> may do what he will with thee, That <hi>his will may be done;</hi> and this prayer will procure patience, and help against Discontent.</p>

3. <hi>Consideration;</hi> of the <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of this Sin: It strikes at the Soveraignty, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Power and Love of God, at one blow. Against his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> as if he rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d not things well, or knew not what to do with his own. Hence this sin is call'd Rebellion, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 14. with 17. 10. There <hi>God</hi> calls them Rebels; and why? because, said they, thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritances of fields and vineyards. Thus thousands in their hearts reproach <hi>God,</hi> and say, Alas! my lot is fallen ill, I have neither house nor ground, nor clothes, as are fit for me. Take heed, go on no further in thy complaint; This is Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
               <p>It wounds the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as if he knew not what to do for us and with us. We would abhor to say this of <hi>God,</hi> but in effect we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it by our Discontent. His wayes are sometimes <hi>dark,</hi> but alwayes <hi>just;</hi> sometimes intricate, but alwayes wise. <hi>Naomi</hi> thought that she and hers were quite undone: but even then <hi>God</hi> was providing a stay for her in her old age. No, sayes the male-content, if things had sorted to my mind, it had been far better than it is; as if you should say, If <hi>God</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my way, he had hit it.</p>
               <p>Also this puts a check upon the <hi>Power</hi> of God: <hi>Can God give flesh?</hi> Can he help me in this or that strait? O I am undone, there is no remedy: As if his wayes and his thoughts were like thine and mine. How oft hath he

               <p>And then it strikes at the love of God. No Father can be so carefull of the good of his Child, or Husband of his Wives happiness, as <hi>God</hi> is of each of you that belong to him. And why will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hear what he saith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 47. <hi>I will rejoyce over you to do you good, and will plant you in this land assuredly, with my whole heart, and with my whole soul:</hi> as if he should say I am glad in my heart, when I can have a fit opportunity to do you good, and I do it with my whole heart and soul. Nay, sayes the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented man, Things falls out with me to the worst, spite it self could not order worse for me, such unexpected, such intollerable troubles and vexations. How doth this grieve Love it self, that is ordering every thing for thy Good, and thou cryest, All these things work against me. And here's the evil of it.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Folly</hi> also of Discontent is manifest; for it produces no good, and procures much evil: No good comes of it; I report me to your experience, whether ever your Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent did mend the matter?

There are many in the world, that have little else to do, but think of <hi>God</hi> and their Souls; but the Husbandman he hath many things to think on, many things to care
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47672:47"/>
for besides: and the Moon of the world doth interpose and hide from him, the sight and beams of the Sun of Righteousness: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>God</hi> is out of sight, he is too much out of the mind of the Husbandman. If the year be fruitfull, he is ready to give the honour thereof to the goodness of the Ground, or to the skilfull husbandry thereof. If it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, he is apt to conclude such and such a thing was the cause, not looking to the <hi>First Cause,</hi> the Mercy, or Justice, or Providence of <hi>God,</hi> which doth order and govern the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every grasse pile, and the blasting of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very single ear of corn upon the earth: But none saith, where is God my maker, who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Songs in the night? <hi>Job</hi> 35. 10. When the rain distills, and makes the fields to smile, dow readily does the Husbandman cry out, O the sweetness of this rain! but how unready is he to break forth and say, O the sweetness of that <hi>God</hi> that gives it! And to help on this neglect of <hi>God,</hi> most languages have made those words <hi>Impersonals,</hi> that signifies Rain, Snow, and the like, which must have no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative case;—<hi>It Rains,</hi> it <hi>Freezes, &amp;c.</hi> as if men were loth to acknowledge <hi>God,</hi> in those peculiar works of his Providence. When this part of his field misses, he is far proner to take notice of the badness of the Earth, than of the Anger of Heaven. When his Cattle mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marry, his eye is quicker upon the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Servants, than on the Providence of his Master in Heaven. But none saith,

               <p>Thus the Honour also which is due to <hi>God,</hi> is often laid at the feet of second Causes, and men blesse the hand that reaches, and not the Hand that sends it.

               <p>As the Wife therefore is somtimes angry with what the Servant is doing, till he tell her, that his Master appoynted him; then she sayes no more: So when cross Accidents fret thee, and second Causes walk contrary to thee, remember the <hi>First Cause</hi> hath bidden them, and rest content.

               <p>Learn then to see <hi>God,</hi> to seek <hi>God</hi> in all things. Satan cannot enter into an Hogg without divine appoyntment.

wisdome; so wilt thou meet <hi>God</hi> every step, and keep correspondence with him, though mediately, all the day long. As it was with <hi>Saul</hi> and his fellow travellers, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 7. They all heard a voice, but none, save <hi>Saul,</hi> saw <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> So any man perceives the external sensible effects of providence, but it's the Christian Husbandman, that sees <hi>God</hi> in them, and adores him. Every Rivulet guides him up to the fountain; and seeing his works he presently ascends to the workman, and finds his <hi>God</hi> in all things, and all things in his <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A second Antidote is, the Consideration of the folly and danger of depending on Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Causes. <hi>Folly,</hi> for nothing can move, much less help without <hi>God;</hi> a vain thing to stir the ballance of the Clock or Watch, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Spring and great Wheel stir. All Creatures are but poor, little Wheels, that can do you no Good without the first Cause. <hi>God</hi> must say the word; if he hiss to the flies, they come amain; and therefore lose thy time no more in solliciting poor second cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or depending on them, but knock at the right door, and you will find <hi>God</hi> still within. Some trust in Chariots, and some in Horses, but we will remember the Name of the <hi>Lord our God.</hi> In vain is Salvation looked for from the hills; from <hi>God the Lord</hi> is the salvation of his people. Make thy Ground as good as thou canst, but then trust not in the goodness of thy Ground, but in the goodness of thy <hi>God</hi> for a plentifull crop; <hi>Non Solum sed Caelum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi>

Manure and prune thy Trees with all thy Art, but then depend on <hi>Gods</hi> blessing for store of fruit: for the Creature can but do what it's bidden, and therefore its folly to depend thereon.</p>
               <p>And consider the <hi>danger</hi> also; for when its depended on, it is in danger of a blast, and you are in danger of a cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e. <hi>God</hi> will not give his Glory to another, nor suffer his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to wear his Crown, and therefore he many times smites the Field, the Beast, the Horse, whereon you depend too much. If you make but a Trench for water, and have no dependance on God, he takes it ill, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 11. <hi>Ye make a ditch also,—for the water of the old Pool; but ye have not looked to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker thereof, neither had respect to him that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned it long agoe.</hi> Hereby also you invite a Curse upon your selves; for <hi>God</hi> hath said, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5. Cursed is the man that maketh flesh his arm, that trusteth in man, and whose trust departeth from the <hi>Lord.</hi> And if you run such an hazard by trusting in man, how will you escape for depending on any other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our creature, below <hi>God</hi> himself? Read and believe the whole truth of this, and nothing but the truth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144. 10, 12, 13. <hi>It is He</hi> that giveth salvation unto Kings,—that maketh our Sons as Plants,—our Daughters as Corner stones,—our Garners full, our Sheep fruitful, our Oxen strong. Let the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman therefore make <hi>God</hi> his friend, and

then he is at league with the very stones of the Field, and whatsoever he doth shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper. Be sure that he be sollicited every day by prayer, and crowned with praises; and then second Causes are thine own. Use means, but trust not in them. Let not your Faith <hi>stifle</hi> your Industry, nor your Industry <hi>blind</hi> your Faith.

He that should have blest <hi>God</hi> for his Brother, and examin'd himself, he takes it ill at <hi>God,</hi> and ill of his Brother, and is the death of him; as envy useth to pursue its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death, he kills him down right, because he was exalted in <hi>Gods</hi> esteem above him. And ever since, the spirit that is in the Husbandman is prone to lust unto envy. His Landlords temptation is to despise him, and his temptation is to envy his Landlord. He
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47672:50"/>
can hardly come to Town, but he envies the ease of the Tradesman: He can hardly see the fine house of the Gentleman his neighbour, nor the fine cloaths of his Wife or Children, without an envious eye; nay, the painful life of his faithful Minister he is apt to envy, as if he had a degree of ease and honour above himself; yea, except grace prevent and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, there lies at his heart a perpetual grudg, and secret spite at all Magistrates, Ministers, great and wealthy men, all which he thinks do him wrong, because he sweats, and they do not; he payes the money, and they receive it; he gets it, and they spend it, though most of it returns through his hands again. He knows no reason, why such being made of the same mold, and perhaps born of the same Stock with himself, should live in such brave houses, wear such costly apparel, and fare at such an high rate; when he hath his head full of cares, his bones full of pain, and hath hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meat to eat, or time to eat it; when his Landlords Horses lye in a finer House then he, and his meanest servant wears a cloth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him.</p>
               <p>This Temptation meeting with a proud temper, doth much disfigure our Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and makes him speak reproachfully and unadvisedly with his lips. This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a Judge, said they of <hi>Sodom</hi> to <hi>Lot</hi> the wealthy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 9. What are these idle Gentry good for?

               </p>
               <p>The rich, they are sick of their poor neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and the poor are as sick of their rich Superiours: and there is a levelling Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the hearts of common people, that can endure no Superiour; as there is an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one in Great Ones to abide no equal. Nay, the Husbandman is apt to think that he hath Reason on his side, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>a and <hi>God</hi> Almighty also, that <hi>God</hi> loves none that are richer than he; and because he finds that the Gospel hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the poor, he thinks to exclude the rich; and comforts himself after all with this, that in Heaven he shall sit above them, if at least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them come there. Thus he pleases, but mostly frets himself at the Grandeur of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; and instead of chearing himself, he tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments himself at the comforts of his betters.</p>
               <p>But doth he well this while? Is he indeed in the right? and hath Providence done him wrong, or doth <hi>God</hi> throw down riches and greatness winking, and bestow honours at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures? Nay, my Beloved, this is but his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47672:51"/>
Temptation. The holy Husbandman will not yield to these thoughts, he is of another temper. But though this Cockatrice must be crusht, and Antidotes sought against this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humour; yet I dare not plead for any of the excessive gallantry, or costly superfluity, either in fare, building, or apparel, that is in use with any; nor for an idle, unuseful life, for any man or woman in the world; (Our Father <hi>Adam</hi> himself, if he were alive, would not desire it) I may not speak one word for these; nay wo, wo to them, if poor men pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for want of necessaries, while they swim in their superfluities, and relieve them not: Sadly and certainly shall they rue it with the rich man in the Gospel, if they make their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants grown by the racking of their Rents, that they may sing in the multitude of their Frolicks. If their sitting on your Shoulders do not raise them nearer Heaven, but only squeeze down you to the earth, they will have a full cup of wrath made ready for them in due time. But yet in the mean while, if ye will be Gods <hi>Husbandry,</hi> if ye will be Gods Building, ye must not envy them, no not at all.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Preserve</hi> you then against this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Study the real evils or troubles, as well as the seeming happiness of your Superiours.</hi> You see their Glory, but alas you do not see their misery; you envy the bravery of their Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but you would pity them if you knew the Diseases and Distempers that are often under

it; you see their stately houses, but you see not the cares, the fears, the discontents that many times lodge within them; you grudge at their full Tables and delicate fare, but if you consider the great reckoning they have to pay, you would pity them at your heart. Their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>azzards, and troubles, and temptations at present, besides their danger to come, do far surpass their enjoyments, and do rather crave your compassion, then your emulation: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are in perpetual danger of falling from their height. If you saw a man advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the top of some high pinacle, and there shaking by every blast, would you not pitty such a man? Who would envy that mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement? Such is the condition of Great men; they are higher than you, but then their hazzard is greater, and their fall the sadder; Every wind shakes them, and their fears drink up a great deal of their joyes: And then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their troubles are proportionable to their greatness: You have small debts to pay, and they have great debts to pay, and find it as hard to discharge them, as you find yours; and for one Husbandman, there are two or three Gentlemen that dye in debt: You have crosses in your Children; why, they have greater: And the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, do sometimes ecclipse one another, and cannot be fixt in the same firmament: You have injuries offered you, and so you are drawn into suit; Alas! they are seldome out of suit: You are provoked by evil words
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47672:52"/>
now and then, they likewise have their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, that pierce them far deeper than yours do. And then for health, that epitome of mercy; you are indeed sometimes sick, alas, they are seldome well: they must eat and drink by rule, and do find far less sweetness in their meat, and sleep than you do; and must these be envyed? And then you must needs imagine their cares do exceed yours; and cares, you know, are the heaviest of your load, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they do as much exceed you, as in their estates; care to get, care to keep their own, care to borrow, and care to pay, care to get and keep their reputation, and houshold cares must needs be many: and all these cares and troubles are herein heavier than yours, in that they are more unexpected, and they are less prepar'd for them; and you know the more tender the skin, the deeper the iron enters thereinto.</p>
               <p>And 3. As their Troubles, so their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations are very great. A wise man would not have their Estates a year, for the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have in an hour. The greater the Man, the greater is his Temptation. O what temptations have they to Pride, to Flesh-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, to Covetousness, to Atheism! What fuel do their Estates lay up for these sins? How hard is it to have full barns, a vast Estate, and that entail'd, without a Soul at ease? You little think what their danger is, how readily a man forgets <hi>God,</hi> when he is full. I dare say, thou that enviest him, would st be worse than
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47672:53"/>
he, if thou had'st his Estate. What a strong temptation is it to oppress, when a man knows he can do what he list? The having of much, is a mighty incentive to hunger for more. So that every way thy Superiour, is superiour to thee in temptations, and therefore his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be envied.</p>
               <p>And then 4. If you think of their future hazzard, you have small need to envy them; for it is a thousand to one, they miss of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and go to Hell; and therefore as the <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi> that was Sentenc'd for stealing Grapes, and reproach'd by his fellows for eating them so busily, as he was going to Execution, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, Do you grudge me the Grapes, that I must pay so dear for? So you have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to grudge them the Estates, for which they must pay so dear. This is the Portion of their Cup, if they be without <hi>Christ;</hi> And if thy Superiours be good men, thou shouldst love and honour them, and never envy them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Study the Wisdome and Word of God.</hi> As he may do what he will with his own, and thy eye hath no reason to be evil, because His is good; so a little modesty would tell thee, that he hath wisdome to know where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow his gifts. Alas! for thy part, he sees that thy neighbours high Estate, and thy high spirit would undo thee: he knows what's fit for him, and he knows what's fit for thee: He knows a Competence, and Heaven at the end of it, is enough for thee, if thou be his Child; and it is too much, if thou be his Enemy. He
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47672:53"/>
knows the better temper, and other usefulness he may be of, which shall not go without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and while thou hast more then thou deservest, what needst thou care what <hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon others.</p>
               <p>And then if you will look into the Word of <hi>God,</hi> you will quickly see their End. <note n="†" place="margin">Ps. 73.18.</note> 
                  <hi>That they are set in slippery places,</hi> that they are <hi>fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the slaughter,</hi> and who envies the stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Oxe his large allowance? <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 49.14.</note> That <hi>the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right shall have dominion over them in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Ps. 73.19.</note> That they are <hi>brought into desolation as in a moment,</hi> and <hi>utterly consumed with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours;</hi> That <hi>their utmost happiness is but a dream;</hi> That where the Scripture counteth <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 62.</note> 
                  <hi>men of low degree vanity,</hi> it determineth that <hi>men of high degree, are a lye.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the name and words of the most High I admonish thee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.16. Be not thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased: For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.</p>
               <p>And thus you see how much against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, how much against Religion it is, to have a rising thought of envy against your Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; which Considerations may work with you, and Prayer joyned to them will work with <hi>God,</hi> to bring your spirits level with your Estates, and rather to pity then envy that Crown, that's so garnisht with <hi>Pearls</hi> without, and lin'd with <hi>Tears</hi> within.</p>

THe Fifth Temptation of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman <note place="margin">Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of, and Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> is, <hi>Negligence and Deadness in holy Duties.</hi> I say this is his Temptation; not that it is his usual sin, if he fear <hi>God:</hi> for you shall most commonly at his door hear as grave and serious and pathetical a Prayer, as at the Parsons of the Parish; but yet through the multitude of his business, and the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his spirits, he is often tempted to dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Service of <hi>God</hi> in his Family, and in secret, and somtimes to neglect and pass it over. Alas you can have of a man but his strength; and that ere the Sun be set, is most an end spent and gone; so that when he comes to Prayer, his heart is a sleep, and a little thing would hire him, if he durst, to skip over that good work; by which in very deed he gets and saves more, than by all his dayes work besides. As when <hi>Moses</hi> spake of sacrificing to <hi>God, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> still spake of work to put them off: So when <hi>God</hi> calls to worship, the World calls to work, or the Flesh to sleep. Or if the fear of <hi>God,</hi> or a constant custome do engage him in his Duty, he dreams through it, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that its over, though he have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but displeased <hi>God</hi> the rein. If the Day had been two hours longer, he would have found strength, to do more work; but he hath no might for God, or ability for heavenly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47672:54"/>
The Fish is scarce ever weary of swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because the water is her Element; but on the dry ground she is soon weary: So our poor Husbandman hath strength for two dayes in the Earth, which is his Element; but hardly vivacity and ability for half an hour in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious service of his <hi>God:</hi> He is like a Bee that hath lost her sting, dull and dronish: Alas he hath lost his spirits, and hath nothing, but wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry limbs, and a dead heart, to present to God.</p>
               <p>And Soul-work never goes on, unless we have a mind to work: as they, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.6. <hi>They built, &amp;c. for the people had a mind to work.</hi> O when a man hungers for Prayer-time, more then meal-time: when all businesses are dry, and all Companies taste of the Cask but <hi>Gods';</hi> when a man can see more glory and beauty in one verse of the Bible, than in all the Corn in his Field; when the Soul doth really hasten, through all other business, and cry, <hi>O When shall I come and appear before God!</hi> then the work of <hi>God</hi> and the Soul goes on; then Duties of worship are welcome to him, and well done by him.</p>
               <p>And thus it is with our serious Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that uses the world that he may enjoy God, and not the contrary, that rids his work that he may go to Prayer, and rids not Prayer out of the way, that he may go to work. But alas, all Husbandmen are not of this mold, happy they for ever, if they were. Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them think, when they have supped they have a VVrit of ease to go to bed, and let
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47672:55"/>
them pray that have nothing else to do. And though they are seldome so weary, but they will think upon their bodies, and take their suppers with them, ere they go to rest, yet they dare venture to forget their souls, and steal to bed without a blessing.</p>
               <p>And so in the morning, the VVorld calls on so hard, that prayer is neglected in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and at night the Flesh calls for ease, that Prayer is neglected at Evening: or if som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done that way by reason of custom or conviction, alas the wife she is sleeping in one corner, the child in another, the servant in a third; when they should all of them be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stling might and main with God for mercy for their souls.</p>
               <p>And then, when the Sabbath comes, the poor Husbandman lyes under great Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to make it a <hi>Play-day</hi> for his body, and yet no <hi>Work-day</hi> for his soul. He that can rise early every morning, takes his ease that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Bells do hardly raise him up: And then in the Assembly, the easier is his seat, the readier is he to sleep, while his weightiest affair is in hand: Or it the Church be far, or the weather frown, or his finger ake, a small matter shall keep him at home; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps (as it was the case of <hi>Thomas the Apostle</hi>) that very day, he might have seen <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to his eternal comfort.</p>
               <p>And here is the Husbandmans Temptation, Negligence and Deadness in holy Duties. But what <hi>Preservative</hi> can we prescribe against this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47672:55"/>
temptation? These two at present. 1. More Zeal. 2. Less Labour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>More Zeal.</hi> Zeal is Religion boyling hot. And a warm heart in a weary body will be active. Zeal revives the languishing spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, infuses new spirits, makes a man all spirit for the time. This in a false Religion will raise a man to his Orisons at Midnight, send him some hundreds of miles on Pilgrimage, make him sweep the Church with the Hair of his Head, lame his Knees with Prayers, and blind his Eyes with tears. In the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion this works more languidly, it's true, (men swim faster down then up the stream) but more regularly, and doth animate a gracions heart wonderfully in the wayes of <hi>God;</hi> makes the <hi>lame man to leap as an H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rt, and the tongue of the dumb to sing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The godly Husbandman remembers, that his chiefest business every day is with God, and the hardest of his work is on his knees; and so buckles to it, and is in good earnest, and sweats even at his eyes. The more zeal, the more forward to what is good, and the more unwearied in it. And it is good to be alwayes zealously affected in a good matter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. The service of God is the best matter in the world, and it is not enough to be well affected to it, but to be zealously effected in it. The wise Husbandman considers, that in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the load of his whole dayes work will be thrown off at night, except Prayer do bind it on; that he cannot be a gainer, if his soul
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47672:56"/>
lose its spiritual life and strength; he knows if he leave off his meals, he must go with thin sides; and if he omit his Prayers, he must go with a thin soul. Alas, what will you be the better to pay your Rent, and to run in arrear with <hi>God?</hi> to keep your time with your Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, and break time with God, your <hi>Landlords Landlord?</hi> What good can your meat, or clothes, or estate do you, if it be not blest by prayer? or how can <hi>God</hi> and you be friends, if you keep not correspondence? cannot he, yea will not he make thee amends by the years end, for an hour in a day spent with him? Alas, you may get more in half an hour by Prayer, Psalms, Reading, to wit, some grains of true grace, than by your hardest working all your lives, yea then all the world is worth; and why then will you stand so with <hi>God</hi> for <note place="margin">Somthing warm in a morning before you go out to work is wholsome. So a warm Prayer in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is very wholsome for the soul. Mr. <hi>Swinnock,</hi>
                  </note> a little time? He that gives you all, will you stand with him for an inch? If your servant should tell you, when he hath neglected a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of concernment, he could not help it, for he had business of his own, would it please you? so neither will it please <hi>God</hi> when you omit Prayer, &amp;c. that you had other business, and could not heed it. The very <hi>Turks,</hi> though they make their slaves work hard, yet afford them time for food and rest, will you deal worse with your soul, than with a Gally <hi>slave?</hi> Hath not <hi>God</hi> said, <hi>Psalm</hi> 127.2. <hi>It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows, except the Lord give his blessing:</hi> and how is that obtain'd but by prayer; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47672:56"/>
blessing, but by constant prayer? Alas, one mischance may half undoe thee; and were it not best then to keep in with that God, that hath all creatures and casualties in his hand? <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Byr. Lanc.</hi>
                  </note> You have heard of that religious <hi>Gentleman,</hi> concerning whom the Witch his Neighbour made this confession at her death, That she had waited seven whole years to do him a mischief, but his constant Prayers had still disappoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her; until one Morning, that hast of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had carryed him from home without Prayer in his Family; and before his return she had bewitched four or five of his children. Miracle of mercy, and nothing else! that <hi>God</hi> hath spared thee, whose neglects in that kind have been many. What if Satan had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to do so by thee? how many Prayers might it have cost thee for deliverance? And is it not more comfortable to spend those Prayers for preventing evil, than for removing it? Is not that Prayer better spent that <hi>God commands,</hi> than that which <hi>Sin procures?</hi> Nay think, when you are tempted to neglect the service of <hi>God</hi> in your Families or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, what an honour and advantage it is that you may thus approach <hi>God.</hi> If the King should but give you liberty to come twice or thrice a day into his presence, and there tell your whole case, and lay out all your wants, and promise a real answer to your requests, how hard or many soever: O how proud would you be of such a priviledge, and seldom would you miss your time, you would find

But yet he hath much adoe with his heart herein. <hi>Flesh and Blood</hi> looks thrice upon his money, ere the <hi>Spirit and Grace</hi> can once part with it.

               <p>But if he have no Faith, but an earthly sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish temper instead of it, the poor have cold entertainment at his door. He thinks it enough for him to be just, to pay every man his own; let others be charitable that have greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states. He must pay Taxes to the King, he must pay Rents to his Landlord, he must pay Lewnes to the Church, and then to the poor of his Parish, and by this time he is drained,

and can do no more. And it is (to say the truth) a lamentable thing, that so many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Beggars are suffered to be unimployed; and yet more, that the burden of them falls upon the poor Husbandman; for his Landlord lives in the City, and visits his Hall only twice a year, and the poor are little the better for that; yea somtimes their unconscionable Rents make the Beggars, and then the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman is forc'd to keep them.</p>

no Rent at all to pay, how freely and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could I serve God, and take care about my soul! but this world, this world takes me off, and whatsoever my soul doth, Rent must be paid, and care must be taken: As if he should say, If I were a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> I would be a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi> I would take care of my soul, if I had nothing else to do.</p>
               <p>It's true, care must be taken how to live in the world, but not distracting care, not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding care, not unseasonable care, not immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate care, not distrustful care.

or the soul unfitted for the comfortable discharge of your heavenly or earthly Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Nor lastly, <hi>distrustful</hi> care, when you trust too much in your own understanding, and too little in the Wisdom and Providence of God.</p>
               <p>And this Temptation is so much the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in that it carries so fair a pretence, and is really spent about honest and lawful things; for about lawful things we most often miss it, and endanger our souls where there seems least danger at all. More men (you know) dye by meat, than by Poyson. As that great <hi>Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> used to pray, that God would deliver him from his friends, for he should take care him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to avoyd his enemies: So we have great need to be careful about lawful things, for less care will save us harmless from things plainly evil. And so we shall proceed to lay down some effectual <hi>Preservatives</hi> against this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of distracting care: Namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Learn to cast your care upon God, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Casting all your care upon him, for he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for you.</hi> A most rare Duty, and a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Promise. <hi>Cast,</hi> not only put or lay it on, in part, or at leisure, but cast it wholly and speedily. Cast what? why, <hi>your care,</hi> your distracting care, so the word signifies; your necessary cares you must grapple with as well as you can; but when they squeeze, torment, divide, distract the heart, then cast them away; and not one or two of them, but <hi>All</hi> your care. In six troubles and in seaven go the same way, knock at the same door, throw them on
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47672:66"/>
the same shoulder: where's that? <hi>Vpon him;</hi> one able to bear and order them all, and not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but very willing, <hi>For he careth for you:</hi> It is his business to care for you; his business and design is to order all things for your eternal good. What needs the child torture himself about a business, when the Father, that is wise and loving, sends him word that he will take care thereof? Sayes God, Let present duty be your care, and future events shall be mine; If you will trust me, I will order it well for you.</p>
               <p>How can you pretend to trust him for the things of another life, that you never saw, if you cannot trust him for the things of this life, wherein you have seen his Providence over and over? Learn then to use a moderate care about your affairs; but when your cares oppress and disturb the quiet of your heart, bring faith to such promises, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.11. and rest thereby upon them, quietly expecting in the use of all good means a comfortable issue. If the success suit not with thy expectation, believe that God saw thy desire was not for thy advantage. If the issue fall out to thy mind, it is in mercy; thou didst thy duty, and trustedst in thy God, to which he hath annext a certain Promise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.3. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                     </gap> thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider the unprofitableness of distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting cares. It is certain, they never do you
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47672:66"/>
good. Your design in them is for your good, for your advantage, but they advantage you not: for <hi>Psal.</hi> 127.1. <hi>Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it, and it is in vain to eat the bread of sorrows.</hi> Is it not as good to lay those cares aside, as vex your selves with them in vain. If indeed they could bring your matters to pass, and that success would stil attend upon your carking thoughts, somwhat might be said for them. But alas, it is so far from that effect, that the ready way to blast any business, is to bestow immoderate care about it. The Lord taketh the wise in their own craftiness, and bringeth their devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to nought; that all men may know, that it is not of him that runneth, but of God that blesseth, that any thing comes well to pass: More Prayers, and less cares, will do your business.</p>
               <p>And therefore when they crowd in upon you, and overpress you, let out your hearts to God in prayer, lay your straits and business before him: commit thy way to the Lord, trust also in him, and see if he do not bring it to pass. Say, Lord, my heart is overwhelmed in me, <hi>out of the Depths I cry unto thee,</hi> I can do no good of it, but thou canst; this knot thou canst unty; my carking snarls it the fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I'le trouble my self no more but to do my duty; my contrivances are Castles in the Air, but thy Understanding is infinite. And at long run you will find this, that Real Piety, is the truest Pollicy. Alas the Husbandmans head is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47672:67"/>
not shap'd for worldly wisdom, he is plain and simple; and again, he is spent sufficiently by his labour, hath no need to break his head and disturb his sleep and mirth with these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, especially while they will do him no good; and therefore <hi>go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink that thou hast with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy work,</hi> Eccl. 9.7.</p>

And a just fear and respect he must have for his Landlord, or the Gentleman his Neighbour, because God hath placed them above him; and he hath learnt that by <hi>the Father</hi> he ought to honour, is meant all his Superiours; and himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the like from his children and servants; and therefore he is far from that clownish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of those, that will make no difference between the King and the Beggar: knowing that would bring confusion into the world, and break that order that <hi>God</hi> hath plac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. And therefore in all worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters no man more respective to his Superiours than the Husbandman; none more ready to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47672:67"/>
all those services and offices due from him to those above him: He's ready, and his children are ready, his Horses ready, and any thing he hath; and that not out of base fear, or other self-ends, but out of a principle of ingenuity and kindness, and a frame of heart to be doing good to every one. Here is his temper and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but now his Temptation lyes in this, That when his Landlord, or other great men about him, do discountenance the practise of piety, and that holy strictness, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the will of <hi>God,</hi> and necessary to salvation; he is apt either to take down his Colours, and either to waste his oyl, or hide his Lamp, lest he should bring anger or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon himself.</p>
               <p>He hath a mind to have constant prayer in his family, and reading the Scriptures, and singing Psalms, and would do so, if that course were held in the Hall that's near him; but he is loth to go before a Gentleman, no not to Heaven, and hath cause to fear a frown or worse for so doing. And then having but little Faith, he apprehends <hi>God far off,</hi> and his <hi>Landlord near,</hi> and will rather venture the loss of his House in Heaven, than his House upon Earth, and so neglects those Duties.</p>
               <p>And so likewise in the practice of sobriety, circumspection and watchfulness, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and fear of Superiours, do lay a strong siege to his convictions and resolutions, and make him (if strength of grace uphold him not) hazzard the Peace of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47672:68"/>
to keep the peace and quiet of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Estate. Fain he would go to Heaven, if he durst; and enjoy the smiles of <hi>God</hi> and great men also. He thinks without the favour of man he cannot live; and without the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>God</hi> he dare not dye; and so would conjoyn that which seldome meets, the love of <hi>God</hi> and the love of the World too. Thus is that Scripture fulfilled, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. <hi>The fear of man causeth a snare.</hi> He would fast with his Family, but he dare not. He would read good Books, the best Books, and hear the best Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, but he dare not; he would go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he dare not: he is in the snare; The Lord of Heaven help him out!</p>
               <p>Not that all of this Rank are taken in this Temptation; for there are many, that go to Gods house for their Religion, and not to their Landlords; that if their Prayers will not bring him with them to Heaven, his frowns shall not bring them to Hell with him; That resolve to be in Gods Books, though they never be in great mens. And these som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times suffer for their presumption, their Rents raised, or themselves dismist; but they have cast up their accounts, and do know that all that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer for it, and are content.</p>
               <p>Now to fence and <hi>Preserve</hi> the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from this slavish fear of man, consult, 1. The Providence, 2. The Promise of God.</p>

               <p>And more sad, that the Husbandman should plead for this his Ignorance; that any should imagine his sin should excuse him, and bring him off before God; That when God saith, <hi>My people perish for want of Knowledge,</hi> he <note place="margin">

and to be a Christian without knowledge of the Scripture, is like being a Philosopher without learning.</p>
               <p>Though thy Understanding be dull, yet when the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is the School-Master, it is possible to learn. If no man learn any thing that he is dull at first about, how few would have skill in any thing. The first line in the Horn-book is the hardest; the further you learn, the easier: Prayer and Diligence will make it easie. And the Husbandman's God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.26. He that teacheth you to know the properties of the Earth, will teach you also the passage to Heaven.

               <p>Notwithstanding all your business, you have one whole day every week. How rich in knowledge would you quickly be, if every

minute of that day were put to the best. Some Divines have collected the material points of Religion into fifty two heads, for each Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath one; now if the poorest Husbandman in the Land would fix each Lords day on one of these, (and any good Minister would set you in) and in the spare time thereof, read, or hear others read to him, or ask questions, and confer with his honest Neighbour about it, and as he hath occasion the week follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drive in the same nail, What a blessed crop of saving knowledge would he reap when the year is expired? This is to seek knowledge as silver; and it's worth more pains than this, in that there's no going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without it. If you lived in Countries where no Bibles must be read, where there be no Ministers to teach you, and to know Christ were criminal, there were some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for ignorance: but what plenty of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Bibles have we? what store of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Books, Catechisms, and principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? what choice of Ministers that long to teach you? And to run through all this light into eternal darkness, what excuse can you bring? how great will be that darkness! Up therefore and be doing; let your future di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, compensate your former negligence, lest you hear that fatal sentence, when it is too late to reverse, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.11. <hi>This is a man of no understanding, and therefore he that made him, will not save him, and he that formed him, will shew him no favour.</hi> Now God forbid
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47672:76"/>
that the poor harmless Husbandman should after his painfull life, be thus sentenced into a more painful state! that for want of <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> he should be poor here, and for want of <hi>inwards</hi> be poor for ever. Why, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, while there is time: The markets yet are open, good eye-salve to be had; The rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pearles to be had, for a little labour. God himself will be the Master, and who will not be proud to be his Schollar? O taste and see how good the Lord is, apply your selves to him, and he will teach you the fear of the Lord, so shall you be rid of this temptation.</p>

THe Tenth Temptation of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Wronging his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> is, <hi>Wrong unto his Neighbour;</hi> Though most other imployments exceed this in temptations hereunto, yet this Calling wants not its temptation. This wretched <hi>Self</hi> is of such powerfull influence, that it draws the plain Husbandman himself, to strain a point of Conscience sometimes, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the lusts thereof. Hence it comes to pass sometimes (I hope it is not oft) that you may observe deceit and dissimulation in his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, though not so much as a tradesman, yet too much for a Christian: unfaithfully commending what is bad, when he sells, and unconscionably condemning and dispraising what is good, when he buys. Even in the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47672:76"/>
words of <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.14. <hi>It is nought, it is nought, saith the buyer, but when he is gone, he boasteth.</hi> Pinching the poor either in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or in his price, when he sells his corn, and taking occasion from his <hi>straits,</hi> to deal <hi>straitly</hi> with him. Hence his unsound horse, and unproveable cattel are brought to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, with the greatest protestations of their soundness and goodness; Insomuch as it is grown a distinct Art, to buy or sell any thing in the market; and to buy a Cow a man had need of as many friends as she hath legs, lest he be defrauded. And then so many fair sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, nay, so many equivocations, nay, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny flat ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s, nay, so many oaths, nay, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perjuries, swearing this price shall be the lowest, and yet abating it at next word, that a man would wonder men should apparently venture their consciences and eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for so small a business, and yet be more astonisht, that this should be done by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that believe the Bible, and by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Husbandmen, that are the plainest heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all others.</p>
               <p>And then another way whereby he is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to wrong his Neighbour is, by <hi>Trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> upon him; either his cattel being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, and not lawfully ordered, or his fence neglected, (for we must descend, if we would amend the most inferiour things in our way) and these things are neglected either through idleness, or other business, (it is hoped out of no worse design) so long that his honest
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47672:77"/>
neighbour is prejudiced and provoked. And hence follows, (besides the wrong done, which is the worst evil) grudgings, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings, and often unkind and angry expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and sometimes long and chargeable suits. How great a fire a little spark kindles? Insomuch that oftentimes, the nearest neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are lest beloved, and sometimes so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in suits and rancour against each other, that they lose the comfort of that mutual love and offices, they might enjoy.</p>
               <p>And this is a most sad and doleful thing, to be written in tears, and spoken in sighs, that those people should so fail in <hi>Actions,</hi> whose Religion gives lawes to the <hi>Thoughts;</hi> that they should live below the Heathens, who expect to be equal to the Angels; that some little part of that world, the whole whereof is not worth the poorest soul in it, should so bewitch a man, to break all bonds, divine and humane, to compass it. Let us therefore enquire out some powerful <hi>Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative</hi> against this temptation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Observe the piercing eye of Almighty God alwayes upon thee. When thy heart gives thy mouth the lye in dissimulation, he observes thee all the while, and marvels at thy folly. Would'st thou speak so falsely, if he with whom thou dealest knew thy heart? Why wilt thou speak so, when God knows thy heart? Is he less formidable than a worm? wilt thou bear such awe of one that can only shame thee, and not bear much more of one
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47672:77"/>
that can both shame and damn thee? Thou wilt not affirme a thing if thou knowest a stander by can disprove thee; Why, <hi>God</hi> is a stander by, and when thou art lying equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and swearing, he can disprove thee every word, can stop thy mouth with a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt, strike thee dumb, yea, dead in the place, as he did <hi>Ananius</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and many others since, with their lye in their mouths. Hearken what he hath said, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Let no man go beyond, or defraud his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any matter, because that the Lord is the avenger of all such.</hi> If an ingenious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will win thee, He whom thou defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is <hi>thy brother,</hi> wilt thou eat up thine owne flesh? If a dreadfull argument will work on thee, <hi>The Lord is the avenger of all such.</hi> God will sooner or later reckon surely with thee for it, and therefore as thou tendrest thy safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happiness, go beyond no man in any matter. <hi>God</hi> will not see one man rise unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on anothers ruine with any patience, nor behold thy cunning to make a prey of his sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity without a sharp revenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> A man cannot live in the world without using his wits: Other men use it more than I: These shifts are common and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>onest in comparison of others: I do but make the best of my own: Let them look better about them, and then there's no danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no necessity laid on any man to sin. It's better to be poor than sin. He would make such a bargain as would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47672:78"/>
do him, that would tell one lye to gain all the world. Others practise is no rule, and will prove no excuse for thy wickedness. God hath given thee to understand, that his Word is the Rule, that must guide and judge thee; and that thou art to imitate not the worst, but the best men, and them onely in what is good. You are to know, that by beguiling others, you make the worst of your own, and hazzard all to increase a little, and venture hell to gain a peny. That <hi>God</hi> hath not given all men the like measure of skill and perspica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, but they are plain and simple, and think every one else is like them; but in that case God hath made thee thy Brothers Keeper, and put him into thy hands to deal mercifully and honestly with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be confident, that what is got by wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, will never do you good; the gain of deceit lasts but a while; or if it do, it's given thee in wrath; like a Sute with the plague in it, it's gay and fine, but death is in it; So is unjust gain, though it stay with thee till thou dye, yet the curse of God stays with it, and rests if not on thy state, body or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet on thy poor soul, which is worst of all; And who would be fond of a fair Sute with the plague in it? it were better to wear leather, poor leather or russet were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: so it were better for thee a thousand times, to live poor, and just, and dye blessed, than to live rich, and dye accursed. The crafty <hi>Fox</hi> in the Fable hugged himself, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47672:78"/>
he had cousen'd the <hi>Crow</hi> of her breakfast, but when he found himself poyson'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he wisht it out of his belly. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.6. <hi>The getting of treasures by a lying tongue, is a vanity tossed to and fro, of them that seek death.</hi> Your design perhaps is to make estates for your Children, but alas this is not the way; for if you could rise out of your graves one fifty years after your death, you would find the canker of your deceit and injuries had consumed it all. The eye of <hi>Scripture,</hi> the eye of <hi>Reason,</hi> the eye of <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> sees this every day, that—<hi>De male quaesitis vix gaudet tertius haeres,</hi> The third heir seldome enjoys ill-gotten goods: What madness is this for you to lose your souls in the <hi>gaining</hi> of the world, and your posterity to lose their souls in the <hi>spending</hi> of it? and so the same purse or house damnes both the Father and the Son; the Father by injurious getting it, and the Son by ungodly wasting it.

And if these things be true, O why will will ye defraud any more? You build castles, but it's in the air; your house wants founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your title to your estate is nought, and as sure as there is a God in Heaven, and a curse in this Bible, you will be losers by this gain; no peny that you have gotten by fraud shall ever do you or yours good. God hath said it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.25. <hi>With an upright man I will shew my self upright, and with the froward I will shew my self froward.</hi>
               </p>

                  </note> you in the point of <hi>Restitution.</hi> If injurious or deceitful gain, in the judgement of God; and experience of men, and in your own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation do no man good, but much hurt; and inevitably entail a curse upon the man and all his estate, whiles he keep it; Is it not Wisdome and Conscience to restore what you have thus gotten? Would you keep a sute that has the Pestilence in it? will you hold that which God bids you restore, and will damn you in hell, if you keep it? whereas it will do you no good: what, run a plain haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of losing your honest gain, by keeping some little which is dishonest? and venture
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47672:79"/>
hell fire, rather than part with some of that estate, when as if God say the word to night, thou must part with it all before morning? Is it not better to bring it back, and be saved, than have it fetch't, and you be lost?</p>
               <p>If ever God work savingly, I say savingly, upon your hearts, you will make as much hast to restore, as ever you did to get it; and shake it out of your skirt, as you would brush a spark off your clothes, as <hi>Zacheus, Luk.</hi> 19.8. No sooner was salvation come to his house, but he cryes out, <hi>Lord, if I have taken any thing</hi> (mark any thing of what kind soever, of what quantity soever) <hi>of any man,</hi> (whether good or bad, rich or poor) <hi>by false accusation I restore him,</hi> (not I'le do it at my leisure, but upon the nail I restore him) <hi>four-fold:</hi> I'le ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a loser than my Neigbour; he shall have four-fold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will perhaps object your ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and poverty, that you cannot make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, or at least this would make you poor enough, and therefore desire to be excused.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Total inability excuses restitution in the <hi>Kind,</hi> but yet there must be restitution in the <hi>Mind.</hi> A will you must have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and the deed (except remitted) if ever you be able. In the mean time, you are to be sorry, that you have wrong'd your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in your actions, and can onely-right him in your wishes. And sure there is some hand of God in it, that your estate (though increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by your trespassing upon, and wronging
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47672:80"/>
of others) should be brought to such an ebb, that you are unable to make just restitution. Surely <hi>God</hi> hath blown-upon you, with the fearfull blast of his curse already, and you may find by this, that no industry nor intail can assure ill-gotten goods. And as sure as this curse follows you <hi>externally,</hi> so surely (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nce and restitution) will it follow you <hi>eternally.</hi> And therefore you are wide point blank in your argument, you cannot restore, because it will make you poor; for if you do not restore, you will be poor. Your building now is on a quick-sand, pile up your wall as high as you can, the quick-sand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it will bring it down, and you and yours under it. And therefore its better to be poor with Gods blessing, than poor with his curse.</p>
               <p>And grant it do bring you low, to restore to every man his own; alas it doth but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you from that estate, which would do you hurt, and strip you of some garments, that would keep you too hot. However the event, Duty must be done, whether we grow rich or poor by it. Poverty and piety are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter company, than riches and sin. And if you can trust God, (and otherwise you can never come to Heaven) he can and will, if it be for your good, make you amends for your self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, and give you goods, and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science also. Take therefore thy ill-gotten goods in thy hand, (as that <hi>Phylosopher</hi> did his estate, when he threw it into the Sea) and resolve, 'tis better these things be lost
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47672:80"/>
for me, than with me; and let God doe his will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It may be you will say, I shall be shamed, my name will be posted up for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty; and it is a saying, that it is a shame to steal or wrong, but a worse shame to bring it home again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Sin is worse then shame. A man may stand under shame, but you cannot stand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of sin. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath determined long ago, <hi>That sin is not remitted, till the thing be restored, wherein you sinned.</hi> If your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encewere tender, or your eyes open, you would more tremble for guilt then shame. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver better with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> than when <hi>he was ashamed, yea even confounded</hi> (the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of shame) <hi>for the sins of his youth, Jer.</hi> 31. 19. And never worse with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> than <hi>when he was given up to sin, Hos.</hi> 4. 17. How long do you think it will be, ere you must be charged before God, Angels, and all your neighbours, with your injurious dealings? and then what unspeakable shame will cover your face, when it will appear that after all these warnings, you lived and dyed in these sins? Alas! It will be but a while, and all your heart and actions shall be laid out to the view of all; and were it not better you prevented this your self?</p>
               <p>But to come nearer; Pray what shame is it to do that which is good, or undoe that which is evil? It is a shame indeed to sin, but that is past, that thou art asham'd of too: but now
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47672:81"/>
thou art about a work of righteousness, equity and honesty, there is no shame in this: Nay all men, at least all wise men will think better of thee than before: They will now conclude, certainly yonder is a singular good man, that will part with his estate, and venture his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, rather than burden his Conscience, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under sin. All men will commend this, and much praise will redound to God. Pray what disgrace is it to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that he was willing to restore all he had gotten by wrong? God and Man record it to his honour.</p>
               <p>But further yet, you may so order your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, that (if occasion be) you never need to be known. Consider whom you have injured, and how much; and then choose your discreet Minister, or some other faithful friend, who may dispose the thing restored, or the value of it, to the right owner, and your name never needs to be in question. But rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, than fall short of the full value, in your restitution. <hi>I will restore,</hi> saith <hi>Zacheus, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,</hi> that is, rather more than less. And the Lord hath ordered in that case, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>They shall confess their sin which they have do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> and he shall recompence his trespass with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> hath trespassed.</hi> This is equitable for him, who perhaps hath been prejudiced by your injury, more than the naked worth of the thing; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if much time be past. And it is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you; when your sin costs you dear, its
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47672:81"/>
likely you will not easily meddle that way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I, but what if the party I have wrong'd be dead, and perhaps there is none left, to whom restitution may be made; or the persons at such a distance, that it is impossible to make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Restitution must be made in the proper place, if it be possible; or if the party be dead, to their Heirs or Executors, and pains must be taken to find them out. It is but a reasonable penance for your fault. But if no person can be found in whom the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving remains, then hear what God saith, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.8. <hi>But if the man have no Kinsman,</hi> (or person having right) <hi>to recompence the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompenced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, even to the Priest</hi>—Almighty God is Heir-General in all such cases; in whose name and stead his Priests and poor are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised to give you an acquittance; and your sin bewailed shall through the <hi>Ram of attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>same verse,</hi> be forgiven. But till this be done or fully purposed, your guilt remains, you are yet in your sins.</p>
               <p>And thus I have at length, given you a view of the Husbandmans <hi>Temptations,</hi> and their several Antidotes; not but that he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. As he is a Christian, he is liable to all the temptations of a poor Christian; so as he is Husband, Master, Subject: but I think these are more incident to his earthly Calling, wherein if he be faithful to his own soul in the

use of the <hi>Preservatives</hi> annexed, I trust, by the blessing of God, he shall overcome, and reign with Christ at last, where the <hi>wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary an at rest.</hi>

               <p>ANd now I proceed to the <hi>Sixth</hi> Point to be handled, which is the excellent <hi>Lessons</hi> that God teacheth the poor Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who perhaps cannot skill of one Letter in the Book; <hi>For his God doth instruct unto discretion, and doth teach him;</hi> as you had it out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.26. And that's a dull Schollar that such a Master cannot teach. There is hardly any thing that the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath to deal with, but he may learn som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God out of it, when <hi>God</hi> doth prompt him thereunto. Yea God hath translated the world into the Scripture, that we may tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate and think of the Scripture in the World. This (as was observed) is one end of Similes and Comparisons, so frequent in the Bible, not only that <hi>God</hi> may come down by them unto
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47672:82"/>
us, but that we may by them ascend unto him, As our <hi>Lord Christ</hi> (excellently) by occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Vine in his way, (as the <hi>Learned</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) raiseth up his and his hearers minds to learn this Lesson, <hi>That every branch that</hi>

                  <hi>beareth not fruit, shall be taken away; and the branch that doth bear fruit shall be purged to bring forth more fruit,</hi> Joh. 15.1, 2. A profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Lesson taught out of a Tree. Having therefore such a Copy, let us endeavour to shew, what Learning the Husbandman may and ought to get. And, I. Out of his <hi>Ground.</hi> And here</p>
               <p n="1">1. He looks on it, and thinks <hi>Whence he came.</hi> He reads his Pedigree in the Dust; and remembers his Paternal Coat is blazon'd, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Out of the Ground wast thou taken.</hi> And having much business with it, he is often minded what he is, <hi>For Dust thou art.</hi> And there is but a remove between the <hi>Dust</hi> that lies, and the <hi>Dust</hi> that's walking on it. And therefore the Husbandman ought to look down, and learn humility; and then to look up, and beg it of God. And hence it was (as some judge) that <hi>God</hi> gave to our Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> his name from the ground or earth (for so his name signifies) that whensoever he heard his name <hi>Adam</hi> call'd, he might think of his original and be humble.</p>
               <p>The Husbandman therefore hath many <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems</hi> of his frailty, and must lay it to heart. Here is my Ground, and alas what am I but earth sifted and purified, and molded up by

the hand of God? And what cause hath white and red clay to be proud! Come down O my vain heart, and know thy place; when clay ascends, it is against the Laws of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From his ground; the Husbandman learnes his <hi>mortality;</hi> and may be oft mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his change. <hi>For unto dust thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:</hi> There is the end of his Line. Poor man creeps out of the dust, keeps a coile in the world a while, and then r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>turnes unto dust again. Every day the Husbandman may learn this lesson. His imployment lyes as it were in his grave; when he is digging or plowing in the ground, he breakes out in these thoughts. Poor peice of creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dust, whither art thou going? Art thou ready to return to thy mother Earth again? Hast thou glorified God? Hast thou finisht the work which he gave thee to do? What sticks it at? Thy passing Bell may be rung to morrow, and <hi>then shall the dust return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit shall return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to G d who gave it, Eccles.</hi> 12.7. Prepare thy self therefore, to lye down in the Earth, which thou art now manuring: Get dying thoughts, for thou art but dying dust.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the quality of his ground, he must learn his lesson. When you walk over a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Field, the sight of it pleaseth you: And a fruitful heart and life would please God much more. This shower of rain hath made my field better? Did the last shower from Heaven make
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47672:83"/>
my heart better? <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.7. <hi>For the Earth that drinketh in the rain that cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbes meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God.</hi> Shall my ground be blessed, and not my heart? Is a fruitful field a pleasant sight? O how muc h more blessed sight is a serious growing and holy heart? Awake therefore O my soul, lest thy ground do shame thee, and lest the Earth rise up in Judgement against him that tills it.</p>
               <p>Again when the Husbandman is in his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ground, there he learns <hi>the danger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulness.</hi> For saith the <hi>Scripture, Heb.</hi> 6.8. <hi>that which beareth thorns and bryars is rejected, and nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned.</hi> Doe I turn that ground to Commons, that will bring neither Corn nor Grass after all <note place="margin">Ex terra ferlili pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducetur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I'le g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>home and mend my pace, &amp; bring forth fruitso meet for repentance, lest while I seem blessed on earth, I prove to be accursed from Heaven. And thus the barren ground reads a fruitful lecture to the observing Husbandman.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His fourth lesson is from the <hi>improving</hi> of his ground. He finds that the dirty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure is necessary to make his ground fertile, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.8. Not only the fig-tree, but the vineyard must be <hi>dig'd and dung'd,</hi> else it wil grow weedy, gather moss and be fruitless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:47672:84"/>
And here our Husbandman learns the <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and benefit of affliction.</hi> Here's a piece of ground; alas without much paine, I shall reap no profit. And here's an Heart, that will bring forth little, without much pains and cost. Afflictions are profitable, but not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant at all: They fall upon us by a necessity, <hi>(If need be) ye are in manifola temptations.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. Let a man live two or three yeares without affliction, and he is almost good for nothing; he cannot pray, nor meditate, nor deny himself, he gathers abundance of moss and rust; but let God smite him in his child, or estate, or health, now he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

God hath now as much honour again from him, as he had before. Hereupon many good Husbands think, that improving is better than purchasing: the Lord hath such a large improvement from one of his servants after affliction, that it brings in as much, as if he had converted a man out of the rough. And now thinks the Husbandman; my pains and cost is well bestowed; this crop rewards me: And so sayes God, This amendment pleaseth me; This rod was well bestowed. And thus doth <hi>God</hi> chide himself friends with his poor children, and heales them by his stripes: and this the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learnes from the improving of his Ground.</p>

5. The Husbandmans fifth lesson is, from fencing of his Ground. He observes that after all his cost and labour in his field, one gap or breach is able to ruine all his hopes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concludes the necessity of a fence, for the receiving of his deserved profit. Here my Corn is sown, but my labour's lost without care to preserve it; up Sirs, let us be doing, this field must be fenced, or all is lost. And hence the Husbandman learnes the duty of <hi>watchfulness,</hi> and concludes that without it an everlasting soul is lost. When God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath sown the precious seed of Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in the heart, and plac'd many orient Graces in the soul, there is no small need of a serious and constant watch, else Satan and his instruments, will quickly lay them wast. Let the field of your heart be never so richly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with knowledge, love, zeal; yet if one gap be left open for the <hi>Boar</hi> out of the Wood, or the <hi>Foxes</hi> of the field, to any one conscience-wasting corruption, open or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, all will be destroyed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.30. <hi>I went by the field of the man void of understanding, and loe—the stone wall thereof was broken down.</hi> Here was a field without a fence; but did the passenger gather nothing hence? Yes <hi>vers.</hi> 32. <hi>Then I saw, and considered it well,</hi> [I was thinking what I might learn from it] <hi>I looked upon it, and received instruction.</hi> My neighbours folly taught me wisdome, I was instructed by it; this outward object, taught me an inward lesson.

               <p>And then again, the Grass Preaches to the Husbandman, <hi>Relyance upon the providence of God.</hi> Thinkes he, here I have a great family, and many Children, and certain provision for them I have none, but <hi>Math.</hi> 6.30. <hi>If God thus cloath the Grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the Oven, shall be not much more cloath</hi> me and mine, if I have any faith?

               <p n="8">8. The Eighth Lesson the Husbandman learns in his Ground is, from the <hi>Stones</hi> of his Ground: And these, though they do som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring into his mind Jesus Christ, that <hi>living stone;</hi> and occasion otherwhiles thoughts of that <hi>White stone</hi> of Absolution he hath so long panted after, (as an industrious Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can get profit out of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He is ill troubled with these stones under his feet, but he is worse troubled with the stone in his heart; he thinks on his sins, and cannot weep for them; he looks at him whom he hath pierced, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mourn over him; he hears of the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the godly, and sees the wickedness of the ungodly, and cannot break his heart for them. He knows not what to do with this stone within: He puts in the Plough of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, he tears up his heart by convincing aggravations of his sin; he puts it under the dropping of holy Ordinances as oft as he can, remembering that—<hi>Gutta cavat, lapidem, non vi sed saepe cad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These he converses with every day, and draws acquaintance to them, because they are of kin. And the Lesson he learns from them is, his own <hi>mean and low condition,</hi> and a potent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against pride. If a worm should take on, lift up it self, and be proud, then any thing may be proud, <hi>Job</hi> 25.6. <hi>How much less man that is a worm, and the Son of man that is a worm.</hi> Here is a worm, this is a mean creature in comparison of me; but I am a meaner crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in comparison of <hi>God.</hi> How easily can I crush this worm with my foot? and more easily can the great God crush me into pieces.

O what reason have I to be humble, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these very wormes, if <hi>God</hi> did say the word, could easily vanquish and devour me: that were not afraid to set upon a King in his greatest Pomp, when the great God did clap them on the back, and set them on, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23. <hi>And immediately the Angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory, and he was eaten up with Wormes, and gave up the Ghost.</hi> The Angel gave the first blow, to give the worms hold of him; and then every one had a morsel of his flesh, and sucked up that blood wherein the glory of God did not swim; an host of Maggots overthrew him, and kil'd him dead. What a low opinion must he have of himself, that must say to the worm, <hi>Job</hi> 17.14. <hi>Thou art my mother, and my sister?</hi> Thou art a reasonable worm, and that's all.</p>

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:47672:89"/>
1. The Husbandman learns something from his <hi>Plowing</hi> for Corn. And this teaches him the use of <hi>Godly Sorrow,</hi> Jer. 4.3. <hi>Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</hi> What is fallow good for? put in the Plough, <hi>sayes God</hi> to some spiritual Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I shall have no Rent hence untill the plough go here; plow me a long furrow here: O Lord, cryes the soul, I can sorrow for my sin, I am broken; plow deeper, <hi>sayes God,</hi> fetch up these weeds by the roots; now he cryes, An undone sinner; The Law hath quite undone me; my heart is rent and torn within me: All the world for one smile of Christ. Now, <hi>sayes God,</hi> thou shalt have it. I meant thee no more hurt than the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman means his field. Plowing is hard work, but it brings sweet profit. So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction is hard work indeed, letting one blood in the heart, this goes near; but it's profitable, the peaceable fruits of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness pay for all: the plough makes one <hi>sweat,</hi> but the crop makes one <hi>sing;</hi> and without this plowing in tears, we should never reap in joy, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.12. <hi>Shall Horses run upon the Rock? will one plow there with Oxen?</hi> no man will do it; and yet, <hi>sayes God,</hi> there I must plow, or no where: I must squeeze wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of a slint, and make a rocky heart mourn, or never cure it. Thus our Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learns Humiliation at his plough, and studies a broken heart while he is breaking up his ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:47672:89"/>
And then his plough teaches him the need of a <hi>Watchfull Perseverance,</hi> Luk. 9.62. <hi>No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.</hi> He finds the careless eye makes many a balk, and it must be a staid and constant observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that makes an even furrow, wherein if he fail, he goes home with shame. And he knows the plough will do good no longer than it's followed, and there's no leaving it, if he mean to live. And this helps him to consider, of the constant need he hath to observe his ways, to cleave an hair, and draw an even furrow in all his courses: to beware of extreams in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-righteous, or over-wicked; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that one broad furrow will require ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make it smooth, or else require a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row one to drive it even. And therefore he concludes, there's no sleeping at Plough; no throwing up his worthy work of Religion for any difficulty in it, till his Harvest come in Heaven, where he shall rest from his labours, and <hi>his works shall follow him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second Lesson which the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman may learn from his Corn, is, from the <hi>Sowing</hi> of it. And hence he may learn,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How to hear:</hi> For so hath our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> taught him hence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. who there takes the Husbandman upon himself, and reckons his and his Ministers preaching, like the sowing of Seed. Where he finds four sorts of ground, and but one sort sound and good. It is three to one in a Congregation, that the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47672:90"/>
hearers miscarry in hearing. Here I have precious Seed, sayes the Husbandman, but if I should cast it in this high-way, or among yonder thorns, or else on the rocks, what crop could I expect? It would be cast away: and what is my Earthly Seed, to the Heavenly Seed of my <hi>Lord and God?</hi> who not only scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Seed, but offers Pearls, yea Blood, the precious blood of Christ, and it's cast away, if I bring an hard or worldly heart to the Word of God. O then what need have I to prepare before; and to watch in the hearing thereof, lest I receive <hi>that Grace of God in vain.</hi> How fruitless would that seed be, that is sown on the green-sod, before the ground be plowed? I would not venture one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Seed upon it. I'le therefore plow up my heart by Godly sorrow for my former negligences, that the Lord may now <hi>Sow in Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>that I may reap in mercy:</hi> for I know as I sow so shall I reap; when I sow Fitches, I look not to reap Wheat; no more must I expect to sow dead duties, and reap lively returns. I must not look to reap any thing but corruption, if I sow to the flesh: If I expect clean corn, I must sow clean seed; and if I look for life everlasting, I must sow to the Spirit. And herein also,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Husbandman is taught <hi>Bountiful Almes-giving,</hi> for as much as he finds by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, He that soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly, and he which soweth bountifully, shall reap bountifully. He observes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47672:90"/>
is treble to the laying out, and the thicker he sows, (observing rules of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,) the thicker it comes up, and pays him fully, both for his labour, and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance. And he that can trust his Seed in the bosome of the Earth, can trust his Charity in the hands of God; and therefore of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he hath, his poor Neighbours shall have part. Heaven will repay it all, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Third Lesson which the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learns from his Corn, is from the <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it; and hence he learns the Nature, both of the <hi>first and second Resurrection.</hi> First, he perceives hence the <hi>strange working of Grace</hi> in his soul, Mark 4.26. <hi>So is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground, and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how.</hi> There he throws his seed into the cold ground, and goes his way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold e're long it comes up, but he knows not how. Just thus, cryes he, was it with my heart; I feel some supernatural work in me, but I know not how 'twas wrought. Seed I remember was cast upon me, but how this sorrow, this faith, this love is wrought in me, I know not. What a blessed change is here? a field of thorns, into a field of corn? Sure Lord thy hand has been here; And 'tis thou must perfect the work of thy own hands. This green corn must have many a shower, before it be ripe; this must have the former and the latter rain: and so must I. And this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47672:91"/>
minds the Husbandman of frequenting all the means of Grace he can, and there he layes his soul under the droppings of heaven with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable delight, and goes away from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance more green and fresh than he was before.</p>
               <p>Hence again, he learns something of the <hi>last Resurrection,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.35. <hi>But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,—It is sown in Corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</hi> The Husbandman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, he sowed his Corn white and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, but it comes up fresh and green: it lay in the ground, till it seem'd lost and perish't, but that dying was to give it life; and that corn, which to his sence was dead and gone, e're long to his sense is revived, and in greater glory than before. And is it thus, saith the Husbandman? Why, then this withered bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of mine, is but sown in the grave, to spring up again without these imperfections. It is to be sown <hi>deeper,</hi> because it must spring up <hi>higher,</hi> than my corn: what though I dye, consume and perish to the eye of sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, yet <hi>though worms destroy this body, in my flesh shall I see God,</hi> and though I live and dye in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, yet I shall rise again in honour. He that raises up my corn, can raise up me. He can effect one Resurrection at last, that causes a Resurrection in my field every year. How many thousands of men and women, shall spring up then out of this one Church Yard?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47672:91"/>
You shall see no less, I believe, than fifty or threescore thousand come up, at the spring of the Resurrection in this one Church Yard. How dreadful then will the whole appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be at that great day?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fourth Lesson that the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may learn from his Corn, is from the <hi>Reaping</hi> and <hi>In-gathering</hi> of it. And this effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually minds him of the <hi>End of the world,</hi> Mat. 13.39. <hi>The Harvest is the end of the World, and the Reapers are the Angels.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the world hath grown a long while; it hath grown longer than the Old world by two thousand years; so that now the fields are white to the harvest, and I doubt if it grow longer, it will grow worse every day then other. Now when the Husbandman sees his field is ripe, then he puts in his sickle, sets in his reapers, and down it goes: The weeds that have escaped till then, go down, and are bundled toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hrr, and cast away. And so, when the holy and wise God sees his Elect ripe for glory, and the Reprobates for ruine; then he calls to his Angels, as <hi>Joel</hi> 3.13. <hi>Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe, come, get you down, for the Press is full, for their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness is great.</hi> What a brave sight will it be, to see the Angels reaping? And then those hypocrites, that have grown in Gods field with the corn, and had their part in the showers above, and fatness beneath with the corn it self, shall be gathered into bundles; a bundle of proud creatures, a bundle of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47672:92"/>
worldly creatures, a bundle of wanton wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and cast into hell fire: there shall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnashing of teeth. And then shall true Holiness be richly rewarded, which also the Husbandman hath occasion to think of in his harvest. What pains had he in sowing? how did he sweat at plow, but now he is richly paid. The Vallies are covered with corn, they shout for joy, they also sing, they make the Husbandman to sing. <hi>He went forth weeping, bearing precious Seed, Psal.</hi> 126. <hi>ult. But now he comes again rejoycing, bringing his sheaves with him.</hi> And he learns by this, that his fasting and prayers, and self-denial, though sharp and difficult, yet will quit the cost at the long run. He hath a natural faith to believe his pains for the Earth will pay his charge, and make him merry once in the year, and he hath a spiritual faith, to believe his pains for Heaven, will bring much greater, surer and sweeter gains. Drudging at the harrow, that's sharp; but sweeping down the wheat, that's sweet. Prayers and tears he finds to cost him dear: but grace and glory pay him home. <hi>The Sluggard,</hi> Prov. 20.4. <hi>will not plow by reason of cold, therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.</hi> The idle hand shall have an empty Barn; he shall beg and have nothing, when harvest comes. Here, the idle poor glean at harvest, and get something; but O what millions of Beggars will there be at that great harvest, crying, Give us of your Oyl? but they shall have nothing: the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47672:92"/>
Father shall not spare the Ungodly Child, one drop of Oyl; nor the religious wife, to the graceless husband. They who would now spare a drop of their hearts blood to save their Relations; then will not, cannot, must not spare them one drop of Oyl, to save their souls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.9.</p>
               <p>And from the <hi>In-gathering</hi> of his corn he learns this Lesson, That when his Soul is ripe and ready, God will leave him no longer in the field below, but will house him in heaven above, and will bring him into his grave in a full age, <hi>like as a shock of Corn cometh in in his season.</hi> And if he see a storm coming, he will make some haste to secure him before it falls; as the Husbandman hurries in his corn, when he sees danger of the rain. Thou long'st till thy corn be in the barn; And <hi>Christ</hi> longs till thou be in heaven. He is not compleat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they whom thou hast given me, be with me, where I am:</hi> haste home my Children unto me. And at last, welcome O Sons of God, you have been long in coming in, but out ye shall never go again.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Fifth Lesson the Husbandman learns from his Corn, is, From the <hi>Threshing</hi> of his Corn. And this teaches him the <hi>necessity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</hi> He sees that Corn in the Eare will do him no good, it must be beaten out by the Flaile; though this work be painful, yet it is needfull: Threshing must be had. Grace is in the husk, while prosperity lasts, appears lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47672:93"/>
works little, is little: but the flaile of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction beats it out, makes it sensible, and lively. How weak are we in faith, till <hi>God</hi> thresh us by some disaster or other? God's flaile comes and cryes, Come forth thou grain of Faith! and when the heart is tough, he is inforced to lay on the more and greater blows, <hi>Isa.</hi> 21.10. <hi>O my threshing, and the corn of my floore.</hi> At length, that Grace that lay hid in the husk, comes forth; and then O the faith, the humility, the patience, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that appears, even where little was dream't of before! How mellow and sweet doth a fit of sickness, the loss of a child, or a prison make the soul, to whom it is blessed? The sweetest Spices enjoy their own sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, till they be bruised; then they diffuse it, and all the room perceive their odour: and the most precious Saints are oftentimes hid, till they be bruised by the Cross of Christ. Believe every creature that afflicts thee, to be <hi>Gods flaile;</hi> and answer his designs therein. Fly not in his face like the chaffe, but fall down at his feet like the good corn, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10.5. <hi>O Assyrian, the Rod of mine anger, and the staffe in their hand is my indignation.</hi> And God knows when it's time to thresh thee, and how many strokes to give, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.33. <hi>The Daughter of</hi> Babylon <hi>is like a threshing floor: It is time to thresh her.</hi> Let him alone when &amp; how long to thresh his corn. An hard heart will not be cured with a little labour. How many work-men hath God tired out upon thy
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47672:93"/>
heart? Repent betimes, lest thou be thresht for ever.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Sixth Lesson the Husbandman learns from his Corn, is, From the <hi>Winnowing it;</hi> And therefore he learns the <hi>reason of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi> Luk. 22.31. <hi>Simon, Simon, Behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.</hi> What, an heap of grain seems to lie in the Barn? but when a strong wind comes, it parts it, and leaves the corn in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room. Just so the number of religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons looks great sometimes. Then God suffers Satan to raise a wind of persecution, and that doth so sift and fan them, that they prove but few, that are faithful to the death: the greater half was chaff, too light for the tryal, and they are blown away. O Sirs, God will have clean wheat for Heaven; not a tare that must come there.</p>
               <p>Yea, in the hearts of Gods own people there is a great heap, but it's grace and sin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. When they are tryed, the grace will be found but little, and the sin great. As in that case of <hi>Peter</hi> above. There appeared a fair show on the floor, but it was wheat and chaff together; and upon the winnowing of <hi>Peter,</hi> his faith and courage went into a little room, and there was much chaff in him. But the stronger is the wind, the cleaner is the corn; and so the <hi>sharper</hi> the tryal is, the <hi>purer</hi> it leaves them that are upright in heart. This temptation made <hi>Peter</hi> the healthier, and the better while he lived: and you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47672:94"/>
his future courage, made signal amends for his former cowardize. And usually one time or other, Jesus Christ comes with his fan in his hand, and doth throughly purge his floor, and then gathers his wheat into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and burns the chaff with fire unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And such Lessons as these the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman learns from his Corn.</p>

It's sad, that we have need to learn of them; It's well, we have the Art to learn of them. The greatest of men may learn from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e least of creatures; and the silly Ass may reprove a Próphet, when God sets in with it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The First Lesson the Husbandman may learn, is, from his <hi>Oxen.</hi> And there he learns,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Patient industry.</hi> He observes his Oxe, that's ignorant of the will of God, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Heaven; yet day by day works, till he be weary, keeps his place and furrow,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47672:94"/>
though it toyle him every step; carries his yoke without grieving at it, and suffers the sharp visits of the Goad without renitency or opposition; and expects nothing but food for his labour. And this instructs and quiets the Husbandman in his painful Calling. He knows he hath as much reason to work <hi>for God,</hi> as his Oxe hath to work <hi>for him;</hi> and that he expects a far greater reward, and therefore he is content to weary himself day by day; he keeps in his place and furrow, though his idle neighbour would tempt him out to vain company. His yoke is somewhat heavy, but he knows it will grow lighter by bearing it in his youth: and though he feel the goad of domestick afflictions, sometimes <hi>in his side,</hi> yet he frets not, but mends his pace: a night will come at length, when the weary are at rest.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He learns hence <hi>Justice to his painful Minister,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.9. <hi>It is written in the Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>f</hi> Moses, <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe, that treadeth out the Corn. Doth God take care for Oxen? or saith he it altogether for our sakes? for our sakes, no doubt, this is written, That he that ploweth, should plow in hope.</hi>—The Oxe gets thy corn, and thou givest him some of the straw at least. And thy careful Minister, whose charge is weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and whose pains are great, hath as good a right to thy <hi>Earthly</hi> things, as thou hast to his <hi>Spirituals.</hi> The Husbandman therefore that fodders his Oxe, will not starve his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47672:95"/>
and therefore what the Law allows, or his own heart hath purposed besides, he supplies him with all possible speed and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity.

               <p n="2">2. The Second Lesson the Husbandman may learn, is, from his <hi>Kine;</hi> from whom he learns <hi>daily fruitfulness.</hi> He sees they pay their tribute every day, yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> twice a day to him: And therefore will he every day pay his tribute unto God. The <hi>better</hi> pasture he brings them to, the <hi>more</hi> milk they bring him home; whereby he learns, that the greater stock or estate he hath, as he payes more rent to man, so he ought to pay more thanks and fruits unto God. He trembles, lest his soul should prove like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean <hi>Kine,</hi> Gen. 41.19. <hi>That devoured the fat, and continued lean.</hi> It is leanness that makes them ill favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there's no uncomliness like unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. A lean soul under fatting means, is an ill favoured sight. He considers, that if once his Kine grow fat and not fruitful, the next <hi>Range</hi> will be the <hi>Shambles:</hi> and thence he concludes, that outward fulness, with lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the soul, is the surest preface to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and therefore he earnestly depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the sin of barrenness, and strives in his place, to bring forth fruits meet for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. O how many may <hi>God</hi> bespeak, as he did those, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.1. <hi>Hear the word ye</hi>

The Third Lesson the Husbandman learns from his Flocks, is, From the <hi>Horse,</hi> and that is the <hi>misery and danger of ignorance,</hi> Psal. 32.9. <hi>Be ye not as the Horse or Mule, which have no understanding, whose mouth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

You see the innocency, mildness, and usefulness of your Lambs: Behold, the Lamb of God, he was far more. The Lamb hath no armour but patience in the midst of Wolves, and so was Christ brought as a Lamb to the slaughter: yet he was <hi>a Lamb without blemish,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. fair without, and sound within. What more useful and profitable? every part of the sheep is good for something; poor men cannot live without them. Jesus Christ is an useful commodity. They that know themselves, cannot live without Jesus Christ. And here the Husbandman hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47672:96"/>
to contemplate the death of his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. He submitted to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Without repining.</hi> The Lamb looks chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on the slaughterer.

And it is observable, that the word for Sheep, both in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> signifies <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>straying,</hi> the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that the Husbandman would learn from them. But this is but a small part of what <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>David</hi> learned, and the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47672:97"/>
might and would learn from his Sheep, but that the Shepheard hath taken them out of his hand, who having no other Book to learn in, surely, learns the more in this.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth lcsson the Husbandman doth learn is, from his very <hi>Swine;</hi> In whom he beholds the <hi>filthiness of a sinner,</hi> whom Christ himself calls no less <hi>Math.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Cast not Pearls before Swine.</hi> The Husbandman observes, that all the stndy and care the Swine takes, is for his belly, to satisfie his brutish appetite: He works not as the Ox, brings no fleece as the Sheep, nor milk as the kine; All he does is to fill his belly. And this teaches him to dislike that disposition of sensual sinners, whose only study is to eat, and drink, and feed their lusts. If it be a hateful quality in the Swine, it cannot be lovely in any man, but much more hateful: And therefore he resolves to eat that he may live, and that for God; and not to live, that he may eat. And more particularly, he learns from the Swine the danger of <hi>relapse</hi> into a course of sin, and the difficulty of leaving sin, till the nature be changed. The Proverb is known, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>The Sow that was washed is turned to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> How sadly and truely doth this set out the unregenerate sinner. He comes to the means of grace, and those show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do wash him; he comes among good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, (the Swine may get into the Parlour,) and that smooths him again. Restraining grace pins him up; but after all, his filthy
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47672:97"/>
Swinish nature remains, and the next pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle he comes to, he wallows in it again. O the endless labour that out God hath with us, before we be clean! And alas the worst filth is sweet, in comparison of sin, for that's the Devils excrements, and so most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; if our spiritual senses were exercised to discern good and evil. It were better to tumble in the sink, than in thy filthy sins. A Swine is a cleanly creature to a filthy sinner. Admire then the grace and goodness of God that hath chang'd thy nature: And of a Swine made thee a son. And beware thou come no more into the mire, lest instead of being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the blood of Christ, thou perish in thine own.</p>

                  </note> as if a man should never go among his Trees without some contemplation. And here in general, when he comes into his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, he remembers <hi>Paradise,</hi> where he in <hi>Adam</hi> did once enjoy God, and where by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forbidden fruit he lost him! And this comes in well to qualifie that delight, he takes among his Trees. It is said that our Father <hi>Adam</hi> did never look towards <hi>Eden,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:47672:98"/>
the <hi>Paradise</hi> whence he was cast, without a tear; to think of the happiness he had lost, and the evil he had committed. However, the Husbandman hath many an aking heart here, upon the sad remembrance of his sin and fall, and thereupon he examines, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the guilt of that sin be pardoned to him, and whether the heart and strength of it be broken in him. But the more particular Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he learns in his Orchard are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>variety and kinds of Trees</hi> and the fruits thereof. He observes the <hi>diversity,</hi> and <hi>choice of Christians, and of their graces</hi> shadow'd out in that <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Thy plants are an Orchard of Pomgranates, with pleasant fruits, Camphire with Spikenard, Spikenard and Saffron, Calamus and Cynamon, with all Trecs of Frankincense, Myrrh and Aloes., with all the cheif spices.</hi> Here's Christs Orchard; every Tree a Saint, and every Saint variety of sweet tasting and sweet smelling graces. Ah Lord, sayes the Husbandman, what plenty is here for me, but what scarcity have I for thee? What a brave sight is a fair Orchard with well-ordered Trees, and each filled with fruit? How much fairer a sight is a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of fruit-bearing Saints, that bear the fruits and Spices that God loves? What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light doth the Husbandman take in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard; and O what delight would your God take, to walk with you in your houses, and to walk among us here in this house, if every Seat here were filled with a row of fruitfull
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47672:98"/>
Trees! he would pluck our ripe fruits and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and take them to Heaven with him: he would prune and purge us, that we might bring forth more fruit. And what, must young Trees and others, that bear nothing, be cast into the fire? Nay the Husbandman waits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with patience, and suffers many a Tree that beares nothing grow in hopes; but if no industry or patience will cure them, then up they go, and to the fire. And so doth God bear with young ones in hopes, and looks for little service from little ones, and fences and waters many a Tree, that yet brings no fruit; but this is in hope, that their after-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence will pay for all. But if a man promise little, he comes as <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none, cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</hi> How near thou hast been to stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, none knows but God and Christ, who hath diverted the blow many a long day. But if no course will make them fruitful, then <hi>the ax is laid to the root of the Tree, and every Tree that bringeth not forth fruit, shall be hewn, down and cast into the fire.</hi> They which are not good for fruit, shall be good for fuell. By the leaning of the Tree, he knowes which way it will fall; and by the leaning of his own heart towards Heaven, he trusts it will fall thither.</p>
               <p>But especially the Husbandman in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard thinkes of <hi>Christ and his sweetness, Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>As the Apple Tree among the Trees of the</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:47672:99"/>
                  <hi>Wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my tast.</hi> All the Trees of the Wood must give place to the Apple: And all creatures must stand aloof from Christ. His shade and fruit are both sweet. O what a treasure, thinks the Husbandman, have I of my Saviour! and thereupon he tasts this Apple of <hi>Paradise;</hi> and as by an Apple, death came into the world, so by this Celestial Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he recovers life again. O the solace the poor Husbandman hath under Christ's sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in an Ordinance! O the sweetness he tastes from his spirit! And so he returns into his house full of Christ, and earnestly pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him upon others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second lesson the Husbandman learns in his Orchard, is from the <hi>Planting</hi> of his Trees, and hereby he understands the <hi>Nature af regeneration, Rom.</hi> 6.5. <hi>For if we have been planted together, in the likeness of his death.</hi> He sees the Crab-Tree stock must be cut off, and then into it, must the Scion be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed and inoculated, before it can be an Apple in his Orchard: Whereby the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman learns, that the old man in him, though it cannot be stockt up by the rootes in this life, yet it must be cut off by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, humiliation, and mortification; and the new man ingraffed into his heart by vivification, faith, and renovation: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he concludes, I must live in another, if I would live for ever, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I am cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:47672:99"/>
                  <hi>with Christ: Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ that lives in me.</hi> As if the Crab-Tree stock should cry out, I am cut off; yet I live, but not I, but the Scion that is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in me. Old <hi>Adam</hi> cryes, I am wounded and killed, nevertheless I live; yet not I now, but Jesus Christ, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> lives in me. And he sees, that till this work of ingraffing be over, no fruits are to be seen but Crabs. And thence he gathers, that till that change be wrought within, no man can bring forth fruit acceptable unto God: All his best works are but meer Crabs; or the fruit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better then the Tree; and therefore he is restless, till this work be done in him; He reads, he inquires, he prayes, he hears, he is never quiet, until he also be renewed in the spirit of his mind, and be made like that Tree, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17.8. <hi>planted by the waters, whose leaf shall be green, neither shall it cease from yielding fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Lesson the Husbandman learnes in his Orchard is, from the <hi>Pruning</hi> of the Trees; And there he learns the <hi>danger of prosperity,</hi> and the <hi>Mercy of crosses.</hi> He sees that when there are too many branches, there is too little fruit; and where the top is too big for the root, there's danger of being wind-fallen. And this he considers well, and receives instruction. He likewise hath found, that the pruning of the Tree hath usually made it better, and that which seemed to <hi>hurt</hi> it, hath <hi>helped</hi> afterward. And the Lord
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47672:100"/>
hereby teacheth him the danger of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and the blessing of the Cross. He learns that an high estate is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and less fruitful than a mean; That i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="2">2. The Second Lesson the Husbandman learns in his Garden, is, from the <hi>watering</hi> of his Garden. And thence he learns the <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Ordinances.</hi> He finds that his choicest flowers must have water, either by the hand

of man, or from the hand of God, or else they wither. When the bottles of heaven fail, the flowers on the earth hang their head. And this clears it to him, That inherent Grace without auxiliary grace, will be green but a while. That the Soul lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. And this he finds by his constant Experience, that the work-dayes are the spreading time for his Grace, and the Lords day his storing time; and therefore he thinks the week long, and the Sabbath short, and in his heart cryes out, O when shall I come and appear before God? Alas! he knows, that a Garden without a fountain, or showers, will have beauty or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy but a while: And even so, he feels his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And though he be weary with his hard labour, yet up he rises early, and labours hard on the Sabbath, in the heavenly trade of Religion, and comes home at night <hi>glad and merry in heart, for the goodness of the Lord.</hi> His Garden is watered, and his Graces are revived.</p>

3. The Third Lesson the Husbandman learns in his Garden, is, from the <hi>Weeds</hi> therein. He finds a little Garden hath many weeds; many kinds, and many of every kind; and they come up without planting, and spring much faster then herb or flower. He sees if care be not taken, they will over-top the flowers and herbs; and that it will co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> both observation, and industry to pluck them up; and when at length, the Garden is rid of them, and is clean and fair, yet they will peep up, and spring again, and renew his trouble over again; and this endless business he hath with it, onely the winter helps him, and pinches these weeds at the roots: but yet in the spring they revive again, and give him the same trouble he had the year before. And this teaches him the <hi>Difficulty of a clean heart,</hi> and the industrious life of a serious Christian. He finds his Garden <hi>within,</hi> as bad as his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>without.</hi> What variety of sinful moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections are rising there? Divers, that he knows not whence, nor how they come. How speedily have some Lusts got a head? His pride hath sprung faster, than his Humility, by the half. His passion is at a great height, in comparison of his Patience. He wonders at the strange growth of his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, he concludes that without a speedy and effectual course, his Garden will be a Wilderness: and therefore, he awakens watchfulness, and falls to serious mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, repentance, and reformation of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47672:103"/>
estate; he gets to his Knees, prayes, and weepes over his evil desires, pursues them into every corner, and at length hath a clean heart created in him, &amp; hopes now all is well: The old man is dead and gone; but ere long he descryes that he was but asleep; his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption returns and exercisesh im in the same trade, he was at before: Till some happy affliction comes, and that with Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, doth break its heart, and Death at length puts an end to this weary life. <hi>Faith is a Rose,</hi> that growes between two nettles, <hi>Presumption</hi> and <hi>Despair.</hi> And so <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> Every Flower hath two weeds, two extreams about it, which are like to grow with them, but must not grow over them. And this is the good Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans task. His Garden findes him work to weed as long as he lives.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Lesson that the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learnes in his Garden is, From his <hi>Bees.</hi> He sits down by his Bees, and sees their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. He observes, they are ever busie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fetching materials without, or working them within; they hate a droan: they seem to delight in their work, they grudg not to fulfil their place, they are most industrious in getting, most curious in keeping, and most provident in spending their wealth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision. And hence again he learns <hi>Diligence in his calling,</hi> and so away he goes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes his strength most willingly therein; and repines no more at his lot: He is loth to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47672:104"/>

Lessons from his House.</note> learns something of God is, <hi>his House.</hi> And though he studies to be cheerful at home, and be too weary to learn much; yet he steals some notes, and gathers instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons now and then in his habitation, though he have no Study but the Fire-side. From the loving obedience of his Wife, he learns the like carriage to Jesus Christ, his heavenly Head and Husband. By the disobedience of his Children, he is minded of his own unto God his heavenly Father, and laments them with grief. The frowardness and follies he sees in them, do bring him to remember his own at their age, which otherwise he had forgotten; but their easie reconciliation after falling out, convinces and perswades him to be a child in Malice, though he would be a man in Understanding: nay, he admires at the Providence of God, that ties their infant tongues till they have some understanding, else many a foolish word would they speak. And by seeing their full dependance upon him for meat and clothes, and his readiness to give them what they want, he learns the like dependance upon God his heavenly Father for all, and trusts that he will much more give spiritual things to him, that humbly craves them of him.</p>
               <p>

By the readiness of his Servants, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced into the like, to the commands of God; and often hath occasion to consider how much Gods service is beyond his. The heat of the Fire often preaches to him the intollerableness of that Fire that is never quenched. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so comfortable in the Chimney, which would be dangerous in his Thatch, teaches him the excellency of true zeal in its place, and the danger of zeal when it is out. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves few meats are good and wholesome without some heat from the fire; and thence gathers, that no duty or work is right good without some zeal therein. The fowlness of his Rooms do shew him what need his heart hath of cleansing; and each part of his furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth furnish him with some celestial les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, each one worth all the estate he hath. But more especially,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> of his House he learns, <hi>the misery of his estate on earth.</hi> Here is my house, sayes he, but alas the room is strait, the air cold, the structure rotten, dirty without, and empty within. Thus all that is in this World is lame and imperfect; no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit without pain, no pleasure without sting, no honour without peril: vanity, and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of spirit, I find to be written, yea, intail'd on all sublunary things; now who would be fond on such a life! who would choose such a portion? If this be the World, give me Christ. One Christ is worth many Worlds.

                  <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> were <hi>Husbandmen.</hi> Well, we see here the Husbandman hath need of patience, long patience to wait for the fruits of the Earth. Many a long day and night there is between Seedness and Harvest, and yet he is not in despair, he waites and hopes Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest will come at length. The Heavens they frown upon the Earth, the Corn mourns, the Grasse withers, but yet he waits with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon God. He knows the bottles of Heaven are in a good hand, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes on God, and does his duty. His ground is sometimes chok't for Rain, and sometimes again chok't with over-much Rain: But he frets not at, all, but quietly waits on Gods pleasure. He goes into his Barne, and sees his Corn almost gone, and then goes into the Field, and there its slow in ripening. He looks into his purse, and there's no money; and now his patience is tryed. Yet in this case he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the wisdom &amp; providence of God, &amp; arms his mind with patience till Harvest comes; and then sometimes excessive Rain keeps him and his Corn asunder, Week after Week; and when it comes, sometimes the poor yieldance of it utterly disappoints him, so that he hath need of patience to last another year; by that time his borrowed Corn is paid, and his Ground Seeded, his stock is almost gone. And therefore the Husbandman hath need of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, great, long patience, patience to wait.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He must have Patience <hi>to bear.</hi> He meets
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47672:108"/>
with a dear bargain, a hard Rent, heavy Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, tempests without doors, and storms some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times within. But this is his Cloak to bear off all weathers, this is his harness he dare not go without: If he fret, it will gall him worse; And he is then undone when the back of his patience is broken. His provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are many, his neighbours wrong him, but he licks himself whole by his patience, his servants are surly; his children oft dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please him, yea his wife sometimes lets fly her tongue against him: But he hath his Armour on, He knows they have <hi>little</hi> wit to provoke him, but he thinks he should have <hi>less,</hi> alwayes to observe it. According to that, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.21. <hi>He takes not heed to all words that are spoken, lest he hear his servant curse him.</hi> He finds a time to acquaint them with their duties, and miscarriages, and bears what cannot be helped, with Patience. Alas his whole life is a tryal and exercise of this grace. He works hard, and fares hard, and lodges hard, but patience is the pillow he lies on, the only Bootes he hath to ride with in the mire, yea the Horse he rides on: The linnen of his every day clothes: Its all the Table cloth and napkin he uses; in a word its the very food he lives by. And therefore as ever you hope for comfort in this calling, labour for this grace of patience, meditate of it, pray for it; when it fails, renew it; study the precept, plead the promise; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that grand pattern of Patience, our Lord
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47672:108"/>
Jesus Christ. And oft think that there is more real good in it, than there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in that which tryes it: That you are in a better condition, when you have patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a tryal, than if you were without the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And seeing you possess but little in the World, resolve to <hi>possess your own souls in Patience.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In his <hi>affairs, Isa.</hi> 28.25. <hi>Doth the Plowman Plow all day to sow? Doth he open and break the clods of his Ground? When he hath made plain the face thereof; doth he not cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the Fitches, and scatter the Cummin, and and cast in the principalWheat, and the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Barley &amp; Rye in their place?</hi> Here you see the Holy Ghost himself, guiding the Husbandman in his Tillage; he should be wise to manage his business in due season and order. And then, <hi>vers.</hi> 27. <hi>The Fitches must he beaten out with a staff. Bread Corn must be bruised,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> even this Discretion must be taught of God, so saith this Scripture, <hi>vers.</hi> 29. <hi>This also cometh from the Lord of Hosts, which is wonderful in Counsel, and Excellent in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> He doth well therefore to be inquisitive of his elder neighbours, but he must not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to seek this skill of God, who is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in counsel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:47672:109"/>
And then he finds that wise fore-casting is as necessary as working, that things may be done in their place, that he neither enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain confusion nor idleness; but that busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses may fall in one after another, and still there may be fit time for religious duties. And thus a good man orders his affairs with discretion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He must have discretion about his <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> that he may therein be neither a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> nor a <hi>Cypher;</hi> that he may educate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his children with that prudence and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection he ought. Discretion also to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect in prudence, not in passion, and to add sweet lessons (as God doth) to sharp lashes; to keep them at a sufficient distance, and yet not discourage them, to preserve his authority in hischeerfulness, to choose fit Callings for them or matches when they are ready, and to load them from him at least with good counsel. There is nothing harder, than for an indiscreet man to command due reverence in his house. And therefore the wise Husbandman considers, that if his Authority in his house be gone, he is buried alive; and the life of a slave will be better then his; that hath all the charge and none of the rule. And this can never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by imperiousness, or correction, but by discretion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He must have discretion for his <hi>estate;</hi> that he may neither live above it, nor below it. That in his clothing, house-keeping and spending,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47672:109"/>
he may neither be guilty of pride nor base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <note place="margin">Sr. Fr.

If he can pay his Rent and Taxes, feed and cloath his family, you shall not hear him complain. But if with all he can yearly lay by a little towards the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter education, or disposal of his children, then you shall hear him sing. Well, all the Discretion he hath is needful hereunto, <hi>Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to take such bargaines that may afford a livelihood, and yet herein he is afraid of weakning the estate of him that sells as well as his own, <hi>Partly</hi> in observing the Markets for the vending of his commodities and other wayes; unless he will outlive his livelihood and leave his Children beggars.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He hath need of discretion in <hi>Religion;</hi> to reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In a word, his Family and his Farm are his Kingdome; and he hath need of Christian politicks, as well as a Prince. And what need have ye then to study, and pray, and seek after wisdom? First, knock at Gods door, for he hath bid us come to him,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47672:110"/>
before we trouble any body else; and his word is past, that he will give, and give libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and never upbraid.

down, and the frame of it bent earthward, unless he study this Grace.

               <p>Look up often to the Heavens, and withal think who dwells there, what they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, what thou wilt be abont a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years hence, how a man should do to get thither, and how a man may know he shall dwell for ever there. No creature upon earth hath an upright countenance as man hath, on purpose that he might look up to that God that made him, and not to the earth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is made. Resolve with an Heavenly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity when thou art plowing or digging in the earth, and say, Oearth, I am not now thy equal, By Grace I am advanced to reach after higher things, then thou canst yield me any. Here I have pibbles, but yonder are pearles; here I have clods of dust, but yonder there are Crowns of Glory; here 'tis true are my Wife and children, to cherish and nourish whom I could be content to live; but that yonder is my Father, my Christ, my noble friend, my true joyes, my real treasure, my God, and that's enough: And therefore up O my leaden heart, and make thee wings,

Think, would I flag thus, and have my heart under my feet thus, if some excellent Minister were in my company; what questions would I be asking him, whatconverse would there pass between us? O how much more Heavenly should I be, that have a Heaven so nigh me, if not a Heaven in me?

               <p n="5">V. THe Fifth Grace that the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">His Love.</note> hath need of is, <hi>Love.</hi> Love to thy Neighbour as thy self. And this is a great word. It is not said, love him <hi>as he loves thee,</hi> for that may be <hi>more</hi> than thou knowest, or <hi>less</hi> than he ought: nor love him <hi>as others love him,</hi> for by this rule Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when on Earth, would have mist thy love; but as truly, as constantly, as effectually as your selves, though not so intensely. But thou must in thy <hi>Judgement</hi> think him as well worthy to enjoy what he hath, as thou art to enjoy thine. In thy <hi>Desires</hi> to wish him the same good things as to thy self, that when its well with him, there may be mirth in more houses than one: And in <hi>Deeds</hi> to do him that good, that thou desirest from him; to promote his profit next thy own, to inhance his credit, and to procure his content.</p>
               <p>It is not said, thou shalt not hate him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? as many will say, I will neither love nor

                  </gap> hurt: but thou shalt love him as thy self; a rule which the ignorant'st may understand, and the weakest remember.</p>
               <p>And this Love,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Will teach the Husbandman to <hi>give,</hi> where there is want: for the poor hath as much right to what you can spare, as you have to what is necessary and comfortable for you. Love will argue thus; If I must give my Enemy meat, when he is hungry, much more must I give to this poor Creature, that never did me hurt. Love will think, This will do him more good than it will do me hurt; and therefore he shall have it, yea, and my heart with it: mark, the true charity is not onely when I draw forth my hand to the hungry, but when <hi>I draw out my soul to the bungry</hi> Isa. 58.10. And then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Love will teach the Husbandman to <hi>Lend,</hi> and make him really more glad to do a courtesie, than receive one. The <hi>Good man Psal.</hi> 112.5. <hi>shews favour and lendeth;</hi> and you know who is called <hi>Good-man</hi> all about We are apt to think it better to receive twelve pence, than to give or lend six: but Christ saith, <hi>It's more blessed to give, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

freely: God forbid that should lye by me in my chest, that would save my neighbours life or state, provided that I hurt not my self to help another, but be wise as well as kind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Love will teach the Husbandman to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give</hi> both trespasses, and injuries, and unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and this he hath need of. As <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> cover'd his Bishops faults with his purple robe, so should the Husbandman his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours trespasses with the robe of Christ. They who are best at loving, are worst at remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring injuries; alas, it's hard to live a day, without injuring some body. The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man must believe it better to receive the greatest, than to offer the least injury. Love is not exceptions as we say, takes things in the best sense, is not apt to create unkindness, heeds not a cross look, or a hasty word, but gives each man grains of allowance, because he knows he needs them himself; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Sun is setting, he thinks it is time to be reconciled, and puts all wrath from him, lest the Devil should get place thereby.</p>
               <p>Yea, 4. Love must make the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to <hi>defend</hi> his Neighbour. In his <hi>Life;</hi> and not go by him, as the Priest and Levite did by the wounded man, as though it were nothing to him. In his <hi>Name;</hi> and therefore when he hears a reproach upon his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he must take himself bound to vindicate him, as far as he can, as knowing that Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

is like a building long in raising, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="5">5. The Husbandman must love his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <hi>Soul,</hi> and not let that go by him into hell without some means to stop him; and therefore is bound to pray for him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and perswade him to holiness. God hath taught you, and do you teach them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. <hi>And consider one another, to provoke to Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As that Excellent Lady <hi>Falkland</hi> us'd to say, If I let you go to hell, or you me, how am I your friend?</p>
               <p>And 6. Love will teach you to <hi>sympathiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> with your Neighbour; to cover and cure his infirmities: for God will never <hi>cover</hi> his sins, that loves to <hi>uncover</hi> others. And to carry it lovingly and peaceably, not strangely or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piciously to him, as knowing that all the world is akin to you in <hi>Adam,</hi> and all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are akin in Christ.</p>
               <p>By all which you see, that true love consists not in complemental civility, not in sinful compliances, nor in a bare inoffensiveness, but in a gracious disposition of wishing good and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47672:114"/>
doing good to others. And this I earnestly press the Husbandman to get, That this may be written on his Grave, Here lies one that was <hi>Beloved of God, and a Lover of all men;</hi> which is the best Motto and blessedness, I can wish him.</p>
               <p>Let the Husbandman often think of Gods undeserved love to him: Let him study the good qualities of others, and his own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness: Let him remember kindnesses long, and forget injuries quickly: And especially let him pray for this Grace: Thou God of Love, plant the Grace of Love in this heart of mine! Leave not <hi>God</hi> till he hear thee, leave not thy <hi>Heart</hi> till it be kindly affected, leave not thy <hi>Neighbour,</hi> till he be reconciled and truly beloved.</p>

                  </gap> God hath led him into a Calling, that it is the best calling for him in the world, till the same God lead him out of it. It was therefore wise answer of Bishop <hi>Grosthead</hi> of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to a Kinsman of his, an Husbandman that came to him, expecting some preferment from him, being so dignified and able to advance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If King <hi>Vzziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.10. had kept himself to the care of his Kingdom, and the love of Husbandry, he might have liv'd with comfort, and died with honour; but he must incroach on the calling of the Priest, and paid dear for it. Let his example be thy caution. Let the Priests follow their Calling, and do thou follow thine.</p>
               <p>And 2. Contentment with <hi>thy Portion</hi> in thy calling. It often falls out, that Poverty in comparison, is the portion of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; as it is, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.12. <hi>The Captain of the Guard left of the Poor of the Land to be Vine-dressers, and Husbandmen.</hi> It is the poor of the Land, especially in <hi>France,</hi> and other Countries, that are the Husbandmen. Poverty is the Husbandmans disease; one Noble man can buy and sell five hundred of them; And it is much adoe to be poor and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient under it. You must study therefore a chearful contentedness with your portion, as being carv'd unto you by the wise and holy God, who better knew what was meet for you, than your selves.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47672:116"/>
do without Faith? The winter is long, and he longs for the spring and seedness: but the weather threatens he shall have no seedness at all. The Summer's long, and he longs for harvest; but the weather then threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, he shall have no harvest: Here's the frowns of Providence. But now the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman turns to the Promise, and it smiles, Gen. 8.22. <hi>While the Earth remaineth, seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</hi> And this his faith tells him is certain and true, and therefore he doth his work, and leaves God to his; and while others are in a fright, hang down the head and repine, he believes in God, and is chearful at the heart.</p>
               <p>Again, the Husbandman goes into his barn, and there's no corn; inquires of his Wife, and there's no store within, and little bread; looks into his purse, and there's no money: Then he recoils into his heart, and there's faith in God, who hath said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>The young Lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord, shall not want any good thing.</hi> And this through Grace he believes, and is satisfied: <hi>He trusts in the living God, who is the preserver of all men, especially of such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> His daily bread he begs, and his daily bread he believes he shall have. I know God will not suffer me to want, at least <hi>any good thing.</hi> If poverty be good for me, I shall have it: and if plenty be good for me, I shall have
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47672:117"/>
that: if better cloaths, and fare, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>And then the Husbandman hath need of Faith for his Children; for many times he leaves them to the wide world, hath made shift to educate them, and that's all. And when he dies, the Lease is expired, and they must be gone. But he believes that God will take care of poor mens Children. If he have faith, and so be in covenant, he concludes that his children are in covenant also; and therefore is confident that God will provide for them. That God who hears young Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, will hear young Children. Though <hi>Ishmael</hi> was no better then he should be, yet <hi>God heard the voice of the Lad,</hi> Gen. 21.17. for the old love that was between himself and <hi>Abraham.</hi> And he often thinks with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort on that, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.25. <hi>I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his Seed begging bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he hath need of Faith to hold up his heart, under his many wearisome cares and troubles. Faith will find honey in the Lion, and comfort in the Bible, when there's none on earth: and therefore when the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man comes home tired with his hard work, he takes the Bible, and there finds that every condition, all things shall work together for
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47672:117"/>
good to them that love God. That when flesh and heart faileth, yet God is the strength of his heart and his portion for ever. He finds that tribulation works patience, and patience experience. That affliction is better than sin. That it is better to be worn out with labour, than to be given up to lust: He believes the day, how dark soever, will end well. O the Husbandman cannot live a day without faith. He cannot live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</p>
               <p>And lastly, he hath need of Faith for his poor soul in the world to come. If ever any man, sure he may say, Psal. 27.13. <hi>I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the Land of the Living.</hi> This is his refuge, when nothing else will serve; when his body and spirits are spent, when his cares and crosses prevail against him, Heaven will put an end to this. Now I am <hi>plowing</hi> in the Earth, but shortly I shall be <hi>reaping</hi> in Heaven; This <hi>sweating</hi> life will be over, and my <hi>singing</hi> life will begin: yet a while, and I shall be sent for post to Heaven. There is but one life between me and a great Estate; my troubles will have an end, but my joy will never have an end; and my short afflictions which are but for a moment, are all this while working for me, an exceeding great and eternal weight of glory. And this I believe. I have not onely some sleight and groundless hopes of it, but I have an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47672:118"/>
for it. I find my Name in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and so know it is in the book of Life: And therefore my heart is glad, my glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth, my flesh also that hath little rest here, doth rest in hope; my possessions are little, but my reversions great. He that shall be rich for ever, may be content to be poor a while.</p>
               <p>And thus you have heard what special Graces the Husbandman should have, and which I earnestly in Gods behalf perswade you to strive for with all your might; leave no means unused, no strength unspent, for the attaining of these Graces. It is possible to get them, its profitable to have them, its peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to be without them: without these you live but little above your beasts, you do but drudge. O therefore go to the God of grace for them, and never leave him, till you have them.</p>

But that's the fault of the men, not of the Calling; the Calling shall be had in honour, when they shall dye in shame. What Calling more Excellent than the Ministry, and yet alas how is that Calling abused? but wo to them by whom offences come: let that holy Calling stand innocent and honourable notwithstanding. Our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Calling of Husbandry is defaced by too many; but for all that, remains Excellent: Yet these Abuses we must detect, that you may see the extreames, and never fall into them.</p>

               <p>O let this instance teach the Husbandman, never to abuse his Calling thus by drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Gluttony, I mean immoderate eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking; when men eat or drink more than doth good, not onely when it is too much for their heads or stomacks, but when it is too much for their time, or too much for their estate; which God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Drunkenness at the last day. Though there be degrees of it, and some worse than other, and it is worse in some men than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and beseems an <hi>Husbandman</hi> as ill, as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47672:119"/>
most others in the world. And yet he is prone to think, there is no Recreation but an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house; no way to quench his Cares, but by strong drink; no exercise on a Festival, but quaffing and smoaking.</p>
               <p>But this is a fearful Abuse in thy Calling. Thy hard labour will never excuse thy hard drinking; thy field groans that bears the grain, which thou thus abusest. Why, this is a beastly, and deadly sin. Other sins, 'tis true in their nature are many of them worse than this, but few beyond it, considering the inseparable effects of it; namely, the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the man, or rather the beast liable to all sins. A sin that by degrees will steal all the money out of thy purse, all the comforts out of thy house, all thy credit, and all thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and leave thee nothing but stinging sorrow.</p>
               <p>O rectifie therefore this Abuse. Hast thou no Recreation but thy Ruine? no pleasure but in Sin? no way to refresh thy body, but by wounding thy soul? hast thou so many houses neer thee, where thou may'st be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and welcome for thy company; and will none serve thee but the Alehouse, where thou art welcome onely for thy money? Think as thou entrest in those doors, Doth God call me hither? Can I give account of this? Is God to be met with here? would I be found thus by Death? Shall I gratifie my flesh to provoke my God? Shall I sadden my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to chear my Appetite? I'le away, I'le
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47672:120"/>
                  <hi>stay here no longer.</hi> Depart from me ye Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, for I will keep the Commandments of my God.</p>
               <p>But this Excess of the Husbandman is not ordinary, but chiefly at the great Festivals and yearly Wakes; And then he is in exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fault. For though it be convenient for friends sometimes to meet together, and be chearful, yet the principal end of such Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations must not be forgotten, which was to praise God, and not pamper the flesh: To spend time in religious exercises, and feasting only to attend upon that: But by no means to dishonour God by excess, or keep such feasts, as Jesus Christ would not keep you company in; or like <hi>Nabal</hi> to be prodigal once a year, and penurious ever after. The wise Husbandman will not do so. Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Chearfulness are constant dishes on his Table. He that will be devout to God, or charitable to others, must not be indulgent to himself.</p>

It is said, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.10. <hi>A righteous man regardeth the</hi>

                  <hi>life of his beast, but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</hi> He regards his very beast out of pity; not only out of policy, but pity. Now to weary out, and break the spirits of the harmless and laborious beasts, out of an immoderate desire to do much work, or get much gain, this is an abuse in Husbandry, and a spot upon Christians. If God should give thy Horse or Oxe a tongue to speak, as he did to <hi>Baalams</hi> Ass, how unanswerably might they ask thee, <hi>What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? Numb.</hi> 22.28. Why art thou so unmerciful to one, that cannot speak for himself? You must remember, they are your fellow-servants, and you but Stewards, and not Lords over them. You are the Lords reasonable Servants, and they are his unreasonable Servants; You are both made of the same Mold, and it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the goodness of God, that hath made you better, and if you want Grace, you are worse than they.</p>
               <p>Use therefore that Mercy and Moderation, that beseems a man of Bowels, a man of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Consider, if God have not sometimes taken away some of thy Cattel, for thy cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the rest; and sometimes blasted thy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, which with so much impatience thou hast pursued. A man would think Bedlam were broke loose, to see the mad frantick pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion you sometimes are in with your Cattel, when they give you no cause, but by being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

them, because they are beasts. O the heat, the rage, the oaths, the curses, the nonsense, the stripes, nay, sometimes the maims you bestow upon them, for little or no cause at all: where's the mercy now, where's the patience, where's the meekness that becomes your reason, your profession? The worst of them are more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you than you are to God: your Oxe knows you better, than some of you know God; for he'l follow you when you carry his meat before him, but you will not follow after God, though all your fresh springs are in him; your Cattel will quietly submit to the Yoke, while you wrangle and wrestle against any Yoke that's put upon you.</p>
               <p>Bewail therefore and amend this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>oolish Crueltie, and shew mercy <hi>below</hi> thee, as thou expectest mercy from <hi>above.</hi> For it is often found, that mild and moderate endeavours, conduce more to thrift, than the impatient hurrying, and cruel wringing of worldly men: Gods blessing, which alone makes rich, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying that former, but seldom this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way; who sooner or later revengeth the cause of his meanest Creatures, upon those that cruelly oppress them.</p>

Canst thou forbear before man, any word that might hurt thee, as words of treason, &amp;c. and darest thou venture to swear before thy God, which is no less than treason against him? The more easily you escape any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment from man, the more sharply will this sin be avenged by God; who hath forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this Commandment in particular with this resolution, <hi>He will not hold them guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, that take his Name in vain.</hi>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47672:128"/>
and aime as high as the greatest Gyant. O therefore stir up your selves, and direct your designs on high. If thou can'st any way mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Wisdome, Greatness, Holiness and Goodness of thy Maker, happy art thou, and happy is thy Calling. This is an End for an Angel. They trumpet forth his Glory, and so dost thou; they sanctifie his Name in Heaven, and thou in thy lower sphear dost sanctifie his Name on Earth. And though thou shootest with a weaker bow, yet aimest at as high a mark.</p>
               <p>But alas! say you, How can I glorifie my Maker, that am but one remove from a piece of earth, yea of sinful earth. <hi>I answer,</hi> Not only the <hi>Heavens declare the Glory of God, Psal.</hi> 19.1. but even <hi>Beasts, and all Cattel, creeping things, and flying fowle, Psal.</hi> 148.10. and would you know how? See <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>The fire and hail, snow and vapour, stormy wind fulfilling his word.</hi> How manifestly does the snow, hail and tempest, preach the power, justice and wisdom of God; I say, they do plainly preach them, and that by doing his Will, hanging in the sky, and falling on the earth as he pleaseth. As well taught Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Servants do honour and magnifie their superiours by their ready obedience: Even so at least, may the poor Husbandman glorifie his Father in Heaven, by an obedient depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself in his place, and doing the will of God in his vocation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:47672:129"/>
And therefore this he should aime at in his Calling; why, here I am, here I work, and sweat, chiefly to please my God, who hath set my lines, and carved me out my imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and hence even Servants <hi>must do service, with good will as to the Lord, and not to men;</hi> Eph. 6.7. as if God himself did every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ing set the Husbandman his task, and at night survey his work: with what care and delight should such a man follow his business, that hath such a Master as God himself? Lord, sayes the Husbandman, I am but a mean creature, but yet I will honour thee, as well as a mean man may do; I'le work to please thee, and by consequence no harder nor easier than will please thee; I'le yoke and unyoke when thou wouldst have me, as exactly as I can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern by that prudence I have, and those rules of Religion to be observed to thee, and pitty to the Creatures. When I come home I have but a mean feast, but yet <hi>Whether I eat or drink, or whatsoever I do,</hi> it shall some way be terminated in that end of ends, the Glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. When I go to bed, I will not forget that <hi>whether I wake or sleep I should live to thee,</hi> for thee, with thee, 1 <hi>Thef.</hi> 5.10. Though my work be mean, yet my aimes are excellent; and brass guilded with God, will make it glister. A poor man with rich ends, is of good account in Heaven.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that the holiest action of an Hypocrite, if you ravel it to the bottom, ends at self; and the meanest action of a Saint,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47672:129"/>
ends at God: for example, why doth the Hypocrite pray: that he may pass well with others, or satisfie the cryes of his Conscience. And why aimes he at these? That he may have repute without, or quiet within. And why doth he desire these? Why because they do gratifie carnal self. On the other side, why doth the Husbandman work? to provide for his family. And why that? That he may educate and dispose his Children. And why so? That they may honour and serve their heavenly Father, when their Earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are dead and gone. Well then, let this End surmount all others, and be diligent and faithful in your Calling, to please that God who hath set you therein, and to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him, what in you lies, by setting forth his Wisdome, Power and Goodness, that when he changes your Countenances, and sends you away, you may sing that sweet song, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. <hi>Father, I have glorified thee on earth, I have finished the work which thou hast given me to do; And now Father glorifie me with thy self.</hi>

               <p n="2">II. THe second design of the Christian <note place="margin">The Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Soul.</note> Husbandman, is, <hi>The Salvation of his Soul.</hi> This he studies upon night and day. He knows that estate is ill got that beggars the Soul; That Rent sorrily paid, that makes him run in arrears with God: And therefore
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47672:130"/>
saving stakes in the world is his by-business, but saving his soul is his main business: <hi>For what will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and to lose his own soul?</hi> Mat. 16.26. what is he better, if he discharge all his debts, and die in Gods debt, and be cast into the prison of hell for ever? What welcome can he have to God, that hath done every thing but what was chiefly given him in charge? That is good counsel then for the Husbandman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19, 20. <hi>Lay not up for your selves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where Thiefs break through and steal, but lay up for your selves treasure in Heaven.</hi> Nothing you can get in this world, that can be laid up safe; but if your soul be saved, that will be safe for ever.</p>
               <p>You must remember, that you were not made to work and eat, but to save your souls in the first place. God hath no where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, that if you seek the world, and the vanities thereof, the things of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom shall be added to you; but he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, that if you <hi>Seek the Kingdome of God, and the righteousness thereof, all other things shall be added to you,</hi> Mat. 6.33. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therefore the Religious Husbandman will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the main chance. I must part with my house and my ground, and my children, but my soul I must live with for ever, and that I will secure. I know many things are <hi>useful,</hi> but one thing is <hi>needful:</hi> And no care enters
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47672:130"/>
deeper than the welfare of this; no cross lies heavier, than the hindrance of this. As in a common fire, a man will strive to save his building; but if he cannot, he would not lose his goods; yet if these go in the flame, he'l venture far to save his Cash, his Writings and his Jewels. So our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman is careful of his other concerns, but his Soul, his Jewel, in the thickest of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, he will endeavour to feed, and cure, and save, whatsoever it cost him.</p>
               <p>The soul like some great Personage is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what exceptious; if she be not regarded in the first place, she will not be served with broken meat. When that is made a by-business, which should be the main business; when men are serious in trifles, and trivial in seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, that's wisdom from beneath, stark folly before God. The Husbandman is loth to end his life with that doleful song, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6. <hi>My Mothers Children made me keeper of the Vineyards, but my own Vineyard I have not kept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet alas for grief! how many such foolish Creatures are there, that like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren sent upon some weighty errand, fall in love with this and the other gay flower or weed in their way, and play with them, while their business is neglected; how do such Children deserve to be welcom'd home? So do they. Almighty God hath sent you into this world upon a great errand, namely to conquer the Devil, exalt the Lord Jesus, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47672:131"/>
climb to Heaven. Ah Sirs, do not fall in love with the fading flowers of lawful comforts, do not play with the stinking weeds of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful lusts, and forget your errand. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, there's no conversion after Death, no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the grave, no forgiveness in hell; lo, this is the accepted time, this is the day of salvation, you must plow and sow for Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. No seedness here, no harvest there.</p>

               <p n="3">III. THe Third Design of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should be, <hi>The Publick Good,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good.</note> He hath learned but a little way in the book of Christianity, that sets his private benefit above the publick good. He that will <hi>Sleep in Jesus, must serve his Generation,</hi> Acts 13.36. And the Religious Husbandman will serve his God, and then will serve his Generation, and then will serve himself; not himself first; no, how may I further the common Good? He plows and sows, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because <hi>he</hi> lives by it, but because the <hi>Common Wealth</hi> cannot live without it. That was right Husbandry in <hi>Joseph, Gen.</hi> 41. He did not hoard corn, and let others starve; but he hoarded it, lest others should starve: It is said, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. <hi>He that withholdeth corn, people shall curse him, but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it;</hi> and the wise Husbandman more values the blessing of God upon an empty barn, than a full barn
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47672:131"/>
and a curse therein. He is more pleased with the publick wealth, though he lie under pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate wants, than if himself had wealth, and there were publick want abroad. Though he be a <hi>private</hi> man, yet he should have a <hi>Publick</hi> spirit.</p>
               <p>It is strange, what Instances have been of this Excellent Spirit among Heathens. <hi>One</hi> advising his Countrey men for the publick Good, though he knew that Advice would speedily cost him his life. <hi>Another</hi> purposely disguising himself in the battel, that he might be there to save his Countrey. <hi>Another</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing <note place="margin">Necesse est ut eam, non ut vivam. <hi>Pomp.</hi>
                  </note> to Sea in a dreadful storm to relieve his needy City with Corn, with this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, it is not necessary that I live, but it is necessary that <hi>Rome</hi> be relieved. Shall limp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature go thus far, that had no Bible but the Creatures, nor Heaven but the <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Fields? Surely grace in the Husbandman will not leave him behind. For he hath far stronger inducements to be publick spirited, to wit, The Love of Jesus Christ, which love being shed abroad in his heart by the holy Ghost, should make him drown his private in the Publick Good.</p>
               <p>Away then with that poorness, that base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of spirit out of this Excellent Calling: As <hi>David,</hi> though he had then onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd Shepheard, yet when he heard of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah's</hi> affront to the publick, he had the heart of a King to vindicate that disgrace; and took his life in his hands, and came off with
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47672:132"/>
honour: So should the Religious Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man look above himself, above his own silly interest, and design the publick good in his labours: And as the least pin is of use in the greatest building, so the meanest Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be of use in the Mightiest State and the Swords that defend us would be of little avail, without the Plough-shares to maintain them. It were a mercenary Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that only would fight for his pay, no, he must fight for his Country: So that's a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Husbandman that onely works for riches, he must labour for his Countrey, else he is not worthy to live in it: And therefore wheresoever his private benefit crosses the publick, as in hoarding up Corn in a time of dearth, or any such like, therein he must deny himself; and account that sordid, yea cursed gain, that is obtained with the general loss.</p>

He holds up <hi>Abraham</hi> for his Copy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. with whom he resolves to charge all his, with the fear of God in the first place, and can never look upon them with compleat comfort, till they be born again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:47672:132"/>
He hath it also in design to bestow read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at least upon them; and if he grow able, is ambitious to furnish them with such edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as they are capable of. And their <hi>apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to it, with his <hi>ability</hi> for it, he looks upon as the call of God, and never parts with his money more readily than for their education. He feels the sad experience of an unpolish't breeding, and therefore gives them all the humane and divine accomplishments that he can; and this is the top of all his Ambition in this world, that his poor children, that are ignorant and rude and sensual by nature, may be lick't into some form, and squar'd for some use in the world. And for this end he is willing to work the harder, that he may afford to maintain his Children at School, and fit them for some honest or holy Calling. O if <hi>I</hi> can see my children have a title to Christ before they have an estate in the world, <hi>I</hi> shall be well; that they be Gods children as well as mine; that though they have but a <hi>small portion,</hi> yet they may have <hi>many prayers</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>And then he desires, if he can reach it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out immoderate labours or indirect means, to make some comfortable provision for them, that they may bless the Lord for him, when he is dead and gone. But herein he is not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, as knowing what immoderate care gathers, oftentimes immoderate expences scatters, and the Parents sin seldome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Childrens happiness; much less dares
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47672:133"/>
he get one penny unjustly, lest that penny consume all the pence he hath. Regulate then your designs in this respect by these rules; <hi>I</hi> will out of Conscience to God be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in my Calling, and <hi>I</hi> will endeavour among other charitable ends, to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for posterity, if it may be done without sin against God, wrong to my neighbour, or uncomfortable distraction to my self.</p>
               <p>And truly, Beloved, it is next degree to madness, too earnestly to proceed in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, seeing nothing is more evident and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, than Riches gotten by the owners to their hurt, and the hurt of posterity; and that generally, when Children after honest educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are left to work out a livelihood by their own industry, they prove most provident, thriving, holy and happy.

August</note> that sent to buy the bed and pillow, such an one used to lie in, that died much in debt a little before, as thinking there was some strange vertue therein, to make a man sleep so soundly, that was so much in debt. The Husbandman hath no such bed: for forty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings breaks his sleep more, than four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands doth his Land-lords. His care and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign therefore is to pay every man his own, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7, 8. <hi>Render to every man his due,</hi> &amp;c. And this Scripture commands him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to pay what's due to the Church, as if he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47672:134"/>
paid it to God himself; his due tribute to the State, well knowing that Princes burthens must be taken up upon our knees; his due Rent to his Land-lord, and that without repining at his abundance; and his due deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> to his friend, that the world may be clearly quit of him.</p>
               <p>And all this he doth by reason of the Law of God, rather than the Law of Man; and out of conscience rather than compulsion; remembring that word abovesaid, <hi>Owe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Hereupon he looks on his cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with this thought; here is a Cow, but she is none of mine, nay, my very meat is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mine own, till my debts are paid. I will arise and study the first opportunity to quit scores. I shall be in debt to God do what I can: but I will turn every stone, to give to all men their due. And this is the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's fifth Design.</p>

THe Sixth Design of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">To have Ability to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> in his Calling, is, <hi>That he may have ability to do good, and to Communicate.</hi> He loves not Riches for themselves, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, if God see it good for him, <hi>rather to give than receive, as being a more blessed thing, in the judgement of God</hi> himself, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.35.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47672:134"/>
He believes, if his Goods do no good, they are no goods: And therefore the design of his daily labour is, that he may <hi>do good unto all, especially unto the Houshold of Faith;</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that rule, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. <hi>Let him that stole, steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands tho thing that is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi> Mark, one true end of work, not work to get and keep, nor work to spend &amp; riot, but work to give to him that needeth. As water, if it stand, it putrifies; if it run, it purifies: So riches if they be stor'd, and not used to the Glory of God, and good of others, they rust and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and cry against the owners thereof: but when they are disposed to good uses, they make a good foundation for a man against the time to come.</p>
               <p>It was the sin of the Rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.19. and his damnation, that he fared delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously every day, but he suffered poor <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to perish for hunger at his door. If ever our Husbandman desired to be rich, it was not to wear fine clothes, eat delicate meat, enjoy a writ of ease, but that he might be able to give and lend, that <hi>he might do good and communicate, knowing that with such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices God is well pleased.</hi> And in very deed, the condition of a Prince (as was hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is better than the beggars, only for this, that they have larger opportunity to do the Lord service, and to do good to others. The poor mans meat and drink, and sleep, are as

If his greatness make him more potent to sin against God; if his parts render him more ingenious, to put a trick upon Religion; if his riches only ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to serve his lusts more effectually, better a thousand times for him, that he had been in his Scullions place.</p>
               <p>For this end our Husbandman aimes at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

O Sirs, do these thoughts breed in your hearts? Are ye <hi>devising</hi> to do good, as well as <hi>desiring</hi> to be great? Alas! none of your expences and layings out will pass in your accounts with God at the last

                  <hi>Audit,</hi> but what have some way tended to the glory of your Master, or the good of your fellow-servants, as well as your selves. O if God would intrust me with plenty, and with an heart to use it to his Glory, then I were happy; but of the two, let me rather have a narrow Estate and wide Soul, than a wide Estate and a narrow heart. And this is the sixth Design of the Husbandman, so much plenty as may inable him to do good, and to Communicate.</p>
               <p>And so you have the Ninth General Head in this Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> the Husbandmans ends and designs, which if you find written in your own hearts, bless the Lord upon your knees. If you fall short, let me tell you, that speedy Repentance, and rectifying of your hearts, is your wisdome and duty, that God may bless and not blast you in all your undertakings. If your aimes be only worldly profit, ease or preferment of you or yours, <hi>What do ye more than others?</hi> Do not the very <hi>Pagans</hi> the same? And if you care and work only to pay your Rent; alas the <hi>Turks</hi> do so: But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you excell, <hi>If you look not at things that are seen, but at things that are not seen.</hi> If you aime at God, unto God you shall come at last.</p>

                  <hi>Learn Prudence and Diligence in your Calling.</hi> Prudence, this your God will teach you, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 26. That you may do each thing in its season, for things are ugly out of their time. Remember that it's the note of a good man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 112. 5. to <hi>order his affairs with discretion.</hi> And that if any man lack wisdom, <note place="margin">See <hi>Cato</hi>'s Rules. Plant in thy youth: Build not till thou be throughly stored; be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to purchase; spare no pains in Husbanding what thou hast; The most sure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue is that which hath cost least. The good Husband must be a Seller, not a Buyer. Do each work in its season. Procure the good Will of thy neighbours, keep no unquiet or injurious Servants, &amp;c.</note> it is but ask and have. And then Diligence, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>That ye study</hi> [<hi>Gr.</hi> as ambitious men for Honour] <hi>to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you.</hi> It was good Mr. <hi>Dod's</hi> saying, He ever liked that Christian that would <hi>pray</hi> hard and <hi>work</hi> hard.</p>
               <p>Thy endeavours in thy Calling should be as diligent, as if thou would'st win all the world, and then as diligent in Prayer, as if thou would'st win Heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 29. <hi>Seest thou a man diligent in his business, he shall stand before Kings, he shall not stand before mean men:</hi> that is, diligence is the high-way to preferment. How many have we seen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47672:137"/>
out of the rank of ordinary men, meerly by Gods blessing on their diligent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth of one <hi>Cresinus,</hi> that <note place="margin">The indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>works</hi> Miracles, by turning stones [<hi>lime stones</hi> and <hi>marle</hi>] into bread. Mr. <hi>Fuller. H. S.</hi>
                  </note> from a little ground did, by his industry, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so much Riches, that he was accused of Witch-craft, by <hi>Albinus</hi> an <hi>Aedile:</hi> his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours could not imagine that so small a shred of ground, should heap such treasures on him: But he at the day of his appearance, produces his implements of Husbandry, and ranks them in order before the Senate, and withall his Daughter, a strong Woman, and then cryes out, <hi>Veneficia mea Quirites, haec sunt:</hi> O ye Senators, these are all the Charms I have; and so was dismist with praise.</p>
               <p>But yet this Diligence may pass its bounds and due limits. A man may work hard and have no thanks of God for his labour. The Godly Husbandman is busie, not out of love to <hi>Riches,</hi> but out of hatred to <hi>Idleness.</hi> An idle man can neither find in Heaven, no nor in Hell, a pattern. The Angels above are ever imployed, and the Devils below are ever imploying themselves. All the creatures move in their places, and hath Man any reason to have a writ of ease? There were in Old <hi>Rome</hi> persons deputed to be <hi>Censores morum,</hi> and in <hi>Athens</hi> the <hi>Areopagi,</hi> who took particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Diligence of persons in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and rewarded or punished them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>And indeed, idle persons are but like wens in the body; that are nourish't, but it's only
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47672:137"/>
to disfigure. It is said, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The hand of the Diligent maketh rich,</hi> and yet <hi>vers.</hi> 22. it's said, <hi>The blessing of the Lord it maketh rich.</hi> Indeed both must concur; but observe that where it's said, The blessing of the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth rich, it follows, <hi>And he addeth no sorrow with it.</hi> Riches without Gods favour shall be like gravel in your teeth, but when he sends them in mercy, they are perfectly comforts.</p>
               <p>Let these things, stir up the sluggish Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman in his Calling. For the most part we find, that God hath most graciously appeared to his people, even in the honest discharge of their Callings. The Apostles chosen from their Nets, and <hi>David</hi> from his sheep. And to come to Husbandry it self; where was <hi>Amos</hi> when the Lord sent him to his people? Why <hi>among the Herdmen of Tekoa, Amos</hi> 1.1. And where was <hi>Elisha</hi> when the Lord called him to his own work? why, <hi>plowing with twelve Yoke of Oxen before him, and himself with the twelfth,</hi> 1 Kings 19.9.</p>
               <p>O therefore use thy best Art and Industry. <hi>Adam's</hi> sin hath hardened the ground, and now thy sweat must soften it: but this is thy comfort, it is sanctified sweat, and every drop of it spent in a right manner, and to a right end, shall be rewarded with a thousand years in Glory: And thy Diligence on Earth, will make thee long to be in Heaven.</p>

               <p n="2">II. THe Second Rule for the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> in his Calling, is, <hi>Submit unto Providence.</hi> Be convinced that there is a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Providence, that directs and orders all and every event in the world, and be satisfied therein, as that which is best for you, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.3. <hi>Our God is in the Heavens, he hath done whatsoever he pleased.</hi> Read more in the Book of Gods <hi>Providence,</hi> and less in the books of mens <hi>Prognostications.</hi> And this I do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely instance in, because the common use of these books is most foolish and fallible; for how can One of them tell the whole Nation of rain such and such a day, when there is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually rain in one Country, and fair weather in another the same day? Besides, the Lord doth very often alter the Scene of these things, either upon the prayers of his people, or the sins of his enemies. Hence that Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, <hi>Isa.</hi> 47.13. <hi>Let now the Astrologers, the Star-gazers, the monthly Prognosticators stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.</hi> And this was spoken to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the best in those Arts in all the world. And yet there is a good use to be made of them for signs and seasons, and days, and years; but as to any certain foretelling of weathers or other events that depend on casual or voluntary causes, they are matters
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47672:138"/>
beyond their line. And if you can know your present Duty, no matter for fore-knowing fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Events.</p>
               <p>And then submit to the same hand of God in all things. It's mans <hi>Prudence</hi> to submit to Gods <hi>Providence.</hi> Labour to sec God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing: is thy promising Crop blasted? it's Gods wisdome that hath done it. Doth the Rain cross thee? why, the rain that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thee, hath furthered some greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. There is mention, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.16. <hi>of a Wheele in the middle of a wheele.</hi> It is thought to set forth the invisible Providence of God, that acts and over-rules all second causes for good ends. And you must still remember that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things shall work together for good, to them that love God;</hi> and therefore say, and that withall thy heart, <hi>Father, thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven.</hi> Alas Sirs, will your repining make the matter better? Is Sin a proper cure for Affliction? No, no. The ordering of Gods affairs belong to God, and of your affairs to you: let it rain when God will, let snow and ice come, when God will, and then heat and drought when he will, for that belongs to him. And do you plow and sow when you can, and reap when you can; for this is the will of God, that you be dependent creatures, and live on him, seeing you cannot live upon your selves.</p>
               <p>Let not a grudging thought therefore arise in your hearts, against the Providence of God: I say, not a <hi>grudging thought,</hi> for even that doth
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47672:139"/>
plainly tax his Wisdome and Government. Who can send a drop of rain without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of God? <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. <hi>last. Are there any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Vanities of the Gentiles that can cause Rain?</hi> (as if God should say, where are they, let them come forth and answer now, if any such there be) <hi>or can the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens give showers?</hi> (alas not a drop!) <hi>art not thou he, O Lord our God? therefore we will wait upon thee, for thou hast made all these things.</hi> Repine not therefore in the least at any of these Events. It is the Lord, let him do what seems good to him. Do thy part, and he'l be sure to do his.</p>
               <p>Nay, in those injuries that are put upon thee, the over-ruling and well ordering hand of Providence doth guide and dispose the same to the best, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Let him curse</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Shimei</hi> that reviled him bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without a cause) <hi>because the Lord hath said to him, Curse</hi> David, <hi>who then shall say, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hast thou done so?</hi> O study Providence, believe Providence, submit to Providence. God is Righteous in mens Unrighteousness, and he never permits <hi>any evil</hi> to befall thee, except he can bring out of it some <hi>greater good.</hi>

in the things of this World; O labour to be rich in the possession of that God that made it. Your harvest is doubtful, your comforts are uncertain, O make sure of God, and then you have something sure. A few hard years will bring the Husbandman to bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; had not he need then to be sure of Christ? He whose treasure is above, can never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
               <p>It was the saying of an Holy Man, to one whose crosses and troubles were so great, that he cried out, O I am quite undone; why says he, is not God in Heaven? Who can sink, that hath <hi>Caesar</hi> with him in the ship, or be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable that hath the possession of happiness it self? <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Although the Fig-tree shall not blossome, neither shall fruit be found in the Vines, the labour of the Olive shall fail, and the Fields shall yield no meat; the Flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no Herd in the stall: yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, and will joy in the God of my Salvation:</hi> O blessed frame. O divine Spirit, like that of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that is content and satisfied in and with himself, though there were nothing else in the world.</p>
               <p>And thus the holy and mortified Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sits down with God, and sings chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The Lord is my portion, saith my soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will hope in him.</hi> If <hi>I</hi> had nothing in the world, if there were no world at all, yet my soul is compleatly happy in my God. <hi>I</hi> have enough, and enough, and enough.

a true Saint is <hi>under</hi> his condition by Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but <hi>above</hi> it by Faith, and can make a living not out of bread only, but out of <hi>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God:</hi> And therefore he fears God in prosperity, and loves him in Adversity: he trembles the more for his mercy, and loves him never the less for his frowns: And when the Barn is empty, then he can live by Faith. <hi>My God,</hi> is riches enough for any man: <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard, I shall not want.</hi> One Jewel is worth an hundred load of lumber. Others can boast of their fair houses, large demesnes, Noble Alliances, and numerous Friends, and <hi>I</hi> can glory in the Lord, that exercises to me loving kindness, and righteousness, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights therein.</p>

                  </note> must not abuse that, which was given you to help you more comfortably to Heaven, to further you most effectually to Hell. You abuse it, when you suffer that use of it, to which your Maker made it. When you suffer the world to monopolize your hearts from God, then the right use of the world is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; when it thrusts out religious duties or straitens them so as makes them inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the health and welfare of the soul when the world governs you, which was made to serve you: In a word, it's abused when it is not crucified; when it's used to serve your corruptions, as your pride, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness or lust, then it's abused: when you dig an estate out of the bowels of the earth to dress your backs with pride, or to maintaine unjust sutes, or to be drunken, or gluttonous this is to abuse the world: and thus the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47672:141"/>
is made to groan, and the poor creatures do even sigh under their abuse, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly made subject to our vanities, and long to be delivered from the bondage of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Keep the world therefore in its place, and put it not in the place of God. Remember that the heart is Gods-acre, a place prepared for the Lord, and never meets with its match but in him, who fits all its dimensions, fills all its desires, cures all its diseases, and answers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

it is the Divinity of Heathens.

They have great estates, fair houses, and gallant clothes, but a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to one they have either some gnawing cares, or saddening guilt, that defeats their comfort, and even in laughter their heart is sad; and indeed it is a rare thing to see a rich man light at heart: their Gold lies like lead at their hearts; when you (having peace with God and a chearful spirit) have not onely a feast every week, but even <hi>every day,</hi> yea, a <hi>continual feast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wash off daily your sins in the blood of Christ by faith, and fail not solemnly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, at least, every night before you go to bed; work your business off your hands, and let no cares discompose the quiet of your mind, nor feed like Vultures upon your heart. Let to morrow care for it self, and do you the work of the day; so will your load be light, and your spirits at liberty to rejoyce in God, and be chearful all the day long. When
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47672:144"/>
distrustful thoughts, and piercing cares come on you like a flood, run like famous <hi>Luther</hi> to one Psalm or other, and sing them away: This will be food and physick for you; this will solace your families after their hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, when they see mirth in your face, and musick in your voice. This will dispose you exceedingly to holy duties, and divert many temptations of the Devil.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, a measure is to be observed; we easily offend in joy, and frothy mirth is to be avoided, especially when others natural infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or sinful deformities make us merry: but yet there is left room enough, for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest innocent chearfulness, which doth the Husbandman <hi>good, like a Medicine,</hi> and for which he can bless God as heartily as for his meat. Cast away therefore that morose, dull and uncomfortable frame, which consumes your own spirits, and is a burden to others. Remember it was <hi>Nabal</hi>'s character, that he was such a man of <hi>Belial,</hi> that no body could speak to him. A sullen frame is neither plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God nor man. God loves a chearfull labourer, as well as <hi>a chearful giver, Deut.</hi> 12.7. <hi>You shall eat—and rejoyce in all that you put your hand unto, you and your housholds.</hi> And he that hath said, <hi>Repent and be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> hath said also, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.16, 18. <hi>Rejoyce evermore, and in every thing give thanks.</hi> What is there that should dispirit or disquiet you? You are friends with God, your sins are forgiven, eternals joy awaits you, your
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47672:145"/>
temptations are but common to men; your labours are but such as your Father <hi>Adam</hi> had before you; your weariness is sanctified, and shall have everlasting rest; Your enemies are in your Fathers hands, the griefs you feele are short, and short of many others; and the things you fear, may never come upon you; you are travelling to the City that's paved with Pearls, and your portion there shall be with the best. And why then are you cast down? why are you disquieted? <hi>Trust still in God: for you shall yet praise him, who is the health of your countenance, and your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Leave your sadness to them, whose Hell is before them, and who have their portion in in this life; and endeavour by squeezing the promises, contemplating Heaven, earnest prayer, and practical endeavour, to get and keep a Christian chearful spirit. And <hi>because the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and in all the works of thy hands, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou shalt surely rejoyce,</hi> Deut. 16.15.

THe Ninth Rule for the Husbandman in <note place="margin">Pay your Great Land-lord his Rent.</note> his Calling, is, <hi>Pay your Great Land-lord his Rent.</hi> The Lord of Heaven and Earth is Lord of the <hi>Soil,</hi> and Lord of the <hi>Soul</hi> also, and a Chief belongs to him. This is that great <hi>Housholder, Mat.</hi> 21.33. <hi>that planted a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and hedged it about, and let it out to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, and went into a far Country.</hi> And he hath charged a Rent over and beside your earthly Land-lords upon your estate, and it concerns you to enquire what it is, what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears there are, and what course to take for the constant discharge thereof; least the Lord turn you out of doors: Your petty Land-lord can but turn you into the wide <hi>World,</hi> but your Chief Land-lord can turn you out into <hi>Hell.</hi> The former indeed may <hi>imprison</hi> you, but the latter can <hi>damn</hi> you: Alas! how little have you thought of this? one Year returns after another; your Earthlie Land-lord calls for Rent, and you make hard shift to pay him: but your Heavenly Land-lord calls, and calls again, and no Rent is paid to him: What will ye do in the end thereof?</p>
               <p>Pray consider, though you hold your Land of man, yet you hold your Life of God: though you have your house of some Great man, yet you have the body and soul that inhabits it, of the Great God; you have your health of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47672:149"/>
God, your strength of God; You hold the Gospel by a tenure <hi>in Capite</hi> of God, through Jesus Christ: now what Rent do you pay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? flinch not, nor start away, but say, what Rent have you ever paid unto God? Must every one have their due but God? canst thou please him only with fair words, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him with naked promises? Can you pay unto men their Pounds, and cannot you pay unto God his Pepper-corn? what? deny your Maker his pepper-corn? why, what is this pepper-corn? <hi>I answer;</hi> It's contained in one verse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. last. <hi>He that offereth praise, glorifieth me, and he that ordereth his conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright, to him will I shew the Salvation of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Rent then consists in Holy Worship, and Holy Walking. When you sit down to meal and rise; my Rent, <hi>says God.</hi> Be sure he have cordial praises, that you adore him in your hearts; See your tongue be the faithful Messenger of your very heart: so when you lie down and rise up, when you go out and come in again; in all thy wayes acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy steps: but this is not all your Rent, you live by him, you must live for him, if you ever mean to live with him. Go to then, speak, and act for God to the utmost of your Capacitie. The little you can do for God, do it with all your might; If God will take his rent in thoughts, in words, and in deeds, that cost you nothing, O grudge it not, delay it not. Cry out, <hi>Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:47672:150"/>
I am a poor man, but here is my Rent at my day. <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, Thou hast been faithful in a little, I will make thee Ruler over much.</hi> Whereas if Gods Rent be neglected, he will either strain upon thee here, by some severe cross or other, or take out all his Arrears in Hell, <hi>Where the worm dieth not, and where the fire is not quenched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Keep up therefore your daily sacrifices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, both alone and with your family, and there alwayes offer an upright, humble and holy heart: praises and prayers from thence will be prevalent with the Lord: I say, both <hi>alone,</hi> and <hi>with your family,</hi> and especially <hi>on the Sabbath.</hi> About each of which, it will be necessary to enlarge a little.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some Rent you have to pay alone; for <note place="margin">1. In your Closets.</note> this, the Scripture is as clear as can be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. <hi>When thou prayest, enter into thy closet; and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</hi> And to this agrees the practise of Jesus Christ, and of the Saints in Scripture; witness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.35. And Reason it self perswades, seeing that each of you have secret sins, secret wants, and secret affairs with God, which require private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse between God and your Souls.</p>
               <p>I do not resolve, that this Duty is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable twice a day, but I assert, that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of it, when opportunitie may be gotten, argues a prophane spirit; and the consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47672:150"/>
practise thereof is a great argument of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie: And in short, he that loves not, uses not secret prayer, yea and meditation, and self-examination, shall never be rewarded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly. Foot-steps also of the use thereof, in the Morning are, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.3. And in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Houshold Rent also daily must be <note place="margin">2. In your Families.</note> paid; I mean a sacrifice in and with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; for it is not enough you pray for them, but you must pray with them: So <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>I and my house will serve the Lord.</hi> For the clearing in some measure, and setling this family worship, too much neglected in the Husbandmans house, let these Propositions be laid down:</p>
               <p n="1">1. God is not only to be worshipped on <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> discourse about Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> the Lords day, but <hi>every day.</hi> This is not only typified, but proved, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.38. <hi>Two Lambs of the first year, day by day continually.</hi> Wherein, though the offering was ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, yet the time was moral, there being as much reason for the Christians offering every day, as for the Jews. And as works of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity have room in Gods day, so Prayers and Duties of necessitie may command room in our dayes, especially seeing we have daily wants, sins, and mercies, and cannot tell what a day may bring forth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is not only to be worshipped alone in a family, but <hi>joyntly and together.</hi> For every Christian family should be a little <hi>Church;</hi> like that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. Now it's not enough,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47672:151"/>
that the members of the Church worship God alone, but it ought to be done together, The same reason holds in a family; namely, for mutual Edification, that the stronger may help the weaker, and that all may worship without fail. It is also much for the Honour ofGod, that many joyn in his service. And the very tenour of that pattern of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.11. runs plural, <hi>Our Father,</hi> which art in Heaven. And proves beside, that daily prayer ought to be used by divers together, Give <hi>us this day</hi> our daily bread.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The fittest time for family worship, is, <hi>Morning and Evening.</hi> This time of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general, the light of Nature it self di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates. The morning and evening being such signal periods of time, as do in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intimate to man religious duty then to be done. <hi>Prayer</hi> being the <hi>Key</hi> to unlock the <hi>Blessings</hi> of the <hi>Day,</hi> and to lock up the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> of the <hi>Night;</hi> for alas we walk upon bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Gun-powder in the <hi>Day,</hi> our snares are so <hi>many;</hi> and we lie in the shaddow of death at <hi>Night,</hi> our dangers are so great.</p>
               <p>Also at those times, we have most oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for such work, and therefore when the Lord orders Parents to teach their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6. he times it thus, <hi>When you lie down,</hi> and <hi>when you rise up.</hi> And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture also makes it manifest, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.39. Also Numb. 28.4. <hi>The one Lamb shalt thou offer in the Morning, and the other Lamb at Evening.</hi> And thus the <hi>Tribes, Acts</hi> 26.7.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47672:151"/>
                  <hi>are said to serve God instantly night and day,</hi> that is, evening and morning. By which, things soberly considered, together with the practise of Gods people, as a Commentary thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you may evidently see, That to worship God in your families morning and evening is the will of God; it is your duty, nay it is your priviledge.</p>
               <p>And now to return to the Husbandman: This being his Duty, no excuse can clear him, no plea can excuse him from paying this chief rent to the most High. His inability and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in prayer cannot help him; for one sin can be no excuse for another. Besides, there are <hi>Helpes</hi> for the weak, till strength come. And above all, the Holy Ghost is a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Help, to all that ask him; and a sence of sin &amp; danger will soon untie your tongues, and make you, if not eloquent, yet effectual in your prayers.</p>
               <p>Want of time, or abundance of business, can be no excuse; for a man must have time to eat, and sleep, and pray, whatever busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness stay. If any thing fall out, that will not let you stay to eat, in that case perhaps you may omit your prayer; provided you pray as well as feed the heartier next time, and are truly sorry for your disappointment. And you must believe, or else you have not a faith to save you, that God can and will make you amends for all the time is spent about your souls; see <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.25. and tremble for your neglects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:47672:152"/>
The backwardness of your relations and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies will be no excuse. For <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and every Child of <hi>Abraham</hi> must, <hi>command their Children and their houshold, and they shall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 18.19. lest God observing you can command, and keep them to their work, but cannot command them to Prayer, see through your hypocrisie, and pour out that dreadful curse upon you, [from which the Lord bless the poor Husbandmans house!] <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen, and upon the families that call not on thy name.</hi> Set immediately therefore on your duty, with sorrow for your former neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and a setled resolution for the time to come, and be assured that God will meet and bless you as he hath promised, and what you take in hand shall prosper. Our work on earth is done best, when our work in heaven is done first. The Philosopher could say, he <note place="margin">Aristippus ap.

Dismiss your business a little sooner, the day before, and discharge the very thoughts thereof till the Sabbath be past.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47672:152"/>
and so compass the Altars of God.</p>
               <p>And bless the Lord, good Husbandman, with all thy soul, That God hath given thee so merciful a release from the labours of thy body, and withal blest thee with a harvest day for thy soul. And in thankfulness to God, in love to Jesus Christ, and in care of thy poor soul, rise up betime, and work hard for eternal life. Let no business of the world be done that day, which might have been done before, or may be done after without plain prejudice. Command thy family from vaine stragling, or foolish sports, and let them spend that day in Gods house, and in thy own. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them of the state of their souls, of their proficiency that day, and seriously catechize the younger sort in the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Be resolute against worldly discourse with your Neighbours, and with a Christian dexterity carry the stream thereof the other way. Lose not a minute of that precious time, make it as long a day as any of the rest, and when it is done, long for another Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>And now you have the Rules, see you be ruled by them. It may be your ease to sleight them, but it will be your safety to observe them.

What an hell is this to be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all day, and yet sinning all day? Shine therefore in the Graces of your Calling. Brown bread, and the Grace of God are good fare, Raggs and Christ's Righteousness are good Clothing; a straw bed, and a good Conscience are good Lodging.</p>
               <p>Let the <hi>Abuses</hi> in your Calling warn you to beware them. <hi>Adam</hi> had your Calling in it's prime, but he abused it, and lost it: and if abuses crept into the <hi>Garden,</hi> they will walk into the <hi>Field</hi> much more.

Watch then before, least you wail after; if you will not watch on earth, you will wail in hell.</p>
               <p>Let the foresaid <hi>Ends</hi> of your Calling act you. At the beginning of every year, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very week, of every day, level your ends afresh, as you have been directed: So will you please God the more, and profit your selves never the less: then every Charre you do, will be a work for God; and though you fail in your subordinate ends, yet you'l never fail in your supreame end. You have a mean Calling, you had need of Noble aimes; a Coelestial end ennobles a Terrene employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Let the <hi>Rules</hi> rule you, and let these truths live and die with you. Let me say to you as that great <hi>Law-giver</hi> did, Deut. 32.46, 47. <hi>Set your hearts unto all the words which I testifie among you this day, which ye shall command your Children to observe to do; for it is not a vaine thing for you, because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your dayes in the Land.</hi> When <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> had compiled some excellent Lawes for his Common-Wealth, he binds all his Citizens in an Oath, that they should exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe them untill his return; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he willingly went into perpetual Exile, that they by vertue of their Oath might for ever be obliged to their observation. Will you my Candid Hearers, and you the

Readers also of these things enter into a Covenant, and firm resolution, faithfully to perform these practical Directions laid before you; so should I the more chearfully submit to an Exile for terme of life, so that we might meet in that better Paradise, whence we shall be driven out no more, and <hi>where the weary</hi> Husbandmen <hi>are at Rest.</hi>
