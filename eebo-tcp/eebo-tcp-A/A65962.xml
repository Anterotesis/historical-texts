            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Before I plead, I humbly crave leave to expreſſe my ſelf in a few words to this Court, and afterwards to make humble Propoſals of what I deſire in order to this Trial. In the firſt place, being I am this day called to a great and weighty work, in the entrance to it I do earneſtly beg the prayers of all them that have an intereſt in God, that he would carry me through this whole Triall with ſuch gravity, godlineſſe, and meekneſſe of wiſdome, as becomes a Profeſſor and Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; and that he would keep me in this houre of temptation, rather from ſin then from ſuffering. Sir, I am this day made a ſpectacle to God, Angels, and men, ſingled out from among my brethren to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47192:4"/>
be the object of ſome mens indignation and inſultation. By my appearing in this place, I am made a grief to many that are godly, and a laughing ſtock to the wicked.—

               <p>We have been calling upon God to direct us and you, and all good people, that juſtice may be done; and you would glorifie God rather then man, if you would confeſſe, knowing what was done in that great ſin of <hi>Achan</hi>; there was great pains taken, and the whole Nation was fain to be examined, and their houſes divided, and at laſt when it came to <hi>Achan,</hi> you know what <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and tell the truth, and glorifie God; this is that, that if you reſpect God before man, you may now clear your ſelf, and ſet forth his glory upon earth; and your next work is to plead guilty or not guilty.

               <speaker>L. Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>To a Miniſter, you ſay well; but I tell you, we do more to a chriſtian then to a miniſter; and we are all chriſtians, and your miniſtry is but an Office; and therefore what <hi>Mr. Lilburne</hi> had, it was the favour of the court then; but time is ſpent, and pray do not you follow that now.</p>

Sir, I am as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was, born a man of ſtrife and contention: not actively, I ſtrive and contend with none: but paſſively, many ſtrive and contend with me; yet I truſt God will make me, as he did <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> an iron pillar and brazen wall againſt thoſe that do oppoſe me, that I ſhall not be diſmayed at ther faces, leſt I be confounded before them. Strong ſuggeſtions againſt me are generally received, and great oppoſition ſtrongly maintained, and in this condition no man dares ſtand by me; but God ſtands by me and ſtrengthens me. —

My Lord, this is a Court of Juſtice that proceeds accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the eſtabliſhed Laws, and Laws that have been read to him. Mr. <hi>Love</hi> is a Miniſter, and had he applied himſelf to God as he might have done, he need not have been brought hither; if he had not gone that way he did.

It is not my nature, but the duty of my place; and the duty of his place, as a priſoner, is to plead, and to put himſelf upon triall; that being done, there will be occaſion enough for him to plead his own innocency.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47192:5"/>
conſtituted, of the 26 <hi>March,</hi> 1650. that forbids receiving or ſending Letters or Meſſages to or from <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> do inable you to receive a charge againſt me concerning Letters to or from <hi>Scotland, Scotland</hi> not being mentioned in that Act by which you are conſtituted; therefore ſeeing this is matter of law, I deſire I might have counſel to adviſe with about it.</p>

Therefore <hi>I</hi> deſire counſel in this, Whether <hi>I</hi> that am accuſed of writing and ſending into <hi>Scotland,</hi> am therefore accuſed of writing and ſending to thoſe who are in arms againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi>; or whether they were in arms for the preſervation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or in oppoſition to the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>When Chriſt was accuſed in a civil buſineſſe, to be a mover of ſedition (as now <hi>I</hi> am) they asked him whether he was King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and he anſwered them not a word. But this is that <hi>I</hi> doubt, whether there be not matters of law ariſing from the charge read againſt me, and that in reſpect of the time of the Act of the 26 <hi>March,</hi> 1650. which gives power to you to determine ſeverall crimes, and to proceed to the trial of the offendor. And Sir, it is alſo to me doubtfull, whether this be not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of law, <hi>viz.</hi> whether this trial ought not to be by a Jury of twelve of the neighbourhood, or whether in any different way from it; and <hi>I</hi> doubt it upon this ground, your Lordſhip having given me this hint; for <hi>I</hi> was preſent at the trial of <hi>Mr. Lilburne,</hi> and the formality of the law tied him to plead to this, that he muſt be tried by God and his Country. He refuſed it, and your Lordſhip urged it upon him, that he might ſafely plead it by God, becauſe God was in all Judicatories; and by his Country, becauſe, ſaid you, by Country is meant the Jury of a mans equals. And this is a trial according to the law of the Land. Now if you have declared that in <hi>Guild-Hall, I</hi> beſeech your Lordſhip inform me, whether a different way from this of a Jury of the neighbourhood be according to law in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Hall.</p>

               <p>You ſhall be informed. That was a trial by the law, as it then ſtood; theſe now are all upon Acts of Parliament and Laws of the Land, that are of as high a nature as they: thoſe are ancient Laws, and theſe are Statutes lately made, and of an extraordinary nature, and were made to meet with ſuch perſons as you, that have done ſuch things as you have done. And now for your Neighbourhood, <hi>I</hi> hope you have twenty or forty Neighbours that are within the equity of that Law.</p>

               <p>Sir, you did declare this after the change and abolition of a King and Houſe of Lords, that a Triall by a Jury of twelve of the neighbourhood was according to Law; and you urged Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> with this, that he might plead, and do no harm unto himſelf. And not onely ſo, but the Houſe alſo declared, That ſince the change of Government, they would never alter that way of triall; and upon the ninth of <hi>February,</hi> 1648. they did declare, That though they thought fit to aboliſh the Kingly Office, and the Houſe of Lords, yet they reſolved they would ſtill retain and preſerve the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Laws of the Nation, for and concerning the preſervation of the liberties, lives, and eſtates of the people. Now Sir, they declaring they would never alter this way of triall, and you declaring this way of triall by Juries, to be according to the fundamentall Laws of the Land, I beſeech you give me the reaſon why it is denied to me.</p>

               <p>My Lord, it is very unuſuall for a priſoner to debate with the court. Here he is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled. Let him know he is a priſoner, upon the triall of his life, before that court that hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by the Parliament, they who did never binde their own hands: I muſt ſay, my Lord, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not binde their own hands. And it is this triall that they have thought fit to give him. And for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting againſt thirty five, then you will hardly be a court left. My Lord, I think if he look upon the court, he will finde no enemies here, knowing them to be of his neighbourhood, and moſt of them of <hi>London</hi>; and I think, he known to them, and they to him, the moſt of them. But my Lord, theſe diſputes are not allowed to others; and the Gentleman will (I hope) have ſo much modeſty at laſt, that he will think he hath ſaid a little too much to the court; and I think, it is not good to provoke too far. And my Lord, he hath ſaid much, and you have given him faire anſwers, and thoſe that are cleare and undeniable. But if he ſpeak of the juriſdiction of the court, and that he will not plead, let him ſpeak in plain Engliſh, and he ſhall hear me in plain Engliſh.</p>

               <p>Although I am not ſatisfied as to the foundation and originall of this court, yet I refuſe not a triall, hoping that tenderneſſe of conſcience will appear in you, and clearneſſe in me, and weakneſſe of proof againſt me. Upon this, I do not refuſe a triall, but I will plead, if I may have that which the Law allows me. And according to my weak meaſure and unskilfulneſſe in the Law, upon the charge read againſt me, I do apprehend there may be ſome things objected againſt the legality of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and many things to take it off, both for matter of time, and form, and other things, by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer. Therefore I intreat I may have counſell to be with me, both in my chamber, and here in the court, and then I will plead.</p>

               <p>I could do nothing in order to my triall, becauſe I have ſent for counſell, and they would not come neer me, becauſe they were not aſſigned by this court; and my ſtudies being another way, and being unskilfull in the Law, therefore I could do nothing in preparation to my triall: Therefore I pray do not deſtroy me in a hurry: The more faire the triall is, the more juſt you will be, and I the more guilty if it be proved againſt me.</p>

               <p>If you had deſired a copy of your charge, you might have had it.

You are not now for the preſent where <hi>Lilburn</hi> was, nor before ſuch a court; he was before a Commiſſion of Oyer and Terminer, who are to proceed according to thoſe Laws, and upon that the Commiſſion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, and that is by that which the known and fundamentall laws of <hi>England</hi> direct unto: but this is not in all particulars the like; the Jury there hath a large latitude, who proceed by way of grand Jury and petty Jury, which are both included in this court: ſo that in all things the proceedings upon that are not as upon this: but thus far the proceedings are alike; you have your charge, and you are to plead to it, for that is the firſt thing to be done; there is nothing can anſwer your charge, but whether you be guilty or not guilty: if you plead not guilty, then the evidence will be called, and if then any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of law ariſeth upon the evidence, it is the uſuall courſe to aſſigne you counſell, and to be counſell for you, and to tell you it is law to have counſell; but for you to demand counſell, and firſt to have counſel aſſigned you, it is againſt that form and legality that the law of <hi>England</hi> appoints; for till you put your ſelf upon trial, we cannot allow you counſel to the trial; ſo that you muſt plead, and it is our duty to tell you ſo: and it is the duty of this court, to be as careful when you have put your ſelf upon trial, that all the benefit of the law may be afforded you; therefore you need not fear it, for if any of theſe things ariſe you now fear upon the evidence, then will be your time and our time to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this you now do, touching matter of law; but in the mean time, in truth that which we are to tell you, and which we are bound in juſtice and conſcience to let you know, is this, that you are out of your way; and therefore do not deſtroy your ſelf: for if you refuſe to plead, there is nothing then but a plain downright judgement.</p>

               <p>The main thing you ſtand upon, <hi>Mr. Love,</hi> is this, that there is no mention made in any Act, that this court can take cognizance of ſending to, or receiving from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but therein you are miſtaken; for the buſineſſe of holding correſpondency with <hi>Scotland,</hi> is in expreſſe words appointed to be under the juriſdiction of this court, therefore I think you are utterly miſtaken in that. Then Sir, for counſel, if there comes any thing in the world that is legal, and is a fit thing counſel ſhould be heard in, I think I may promiſe it, we will not make our ſelves ſo far guilty of your bloud, as to deny you that juſtice that belongs to any man; for it is your juſt right to have it, and we cannot deny it, when a point of law ariſeth. And you do not urge matter of law; onely you queſtion the juriſdiction of the court, and we muſt overrule you in that, for we are not to diſpute the power of the court; for if the Parliament give us juriſdiction, and by a ſpeciall Act appoints, that the buſineſſe of holding correſpondency with <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be within the cognizance of this court, we muſt obey, and not diſpute.</p>

               <p>But there is no time mentioned: for there are two Acts, wherein if the priſoner be not indicted within a yeer, then the fact ſhall not be proſecuted. Therefore I muſt demur to the charge, as not legal in matter of form. There are two Acts declaring what offences ſhall be treaſon, wherein it is ſaid in thoſe two Acts, That if the party be not indicted within a yeer, he ſhall not be indicted at all. Now the Indictment that is againſt me, looks back to things that are pretended to have been done by me in 1648. and 1649. And ſo according to thoſe two Acts, I am not to be queſtioned for them, it being above a yeer before I was indicted.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Love.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I am now to look to the charge of treaſon read againſt me, and not to the evidence; and in the charge I am indicted for thoſe things, for which I apprehend I ought not to be indicted. For according to thoſe two Acts, I ought not to have been indicted for things pretended to have been done by me ſo long ago: and this I apprehend to be matter of law. And for the witneſſes, let them ſpeek to what time they will, yet this I am ſure, they cannot prove that I was indicted within a yeer for thoſe things that are charged upon me to be done in 1648. and 1649. for that were to prove an impoſſibility: ſo that it appears to me, I am indicted for thoſe things for which I ought not to be indicted.</p>

               <p>It may be ſo; and if ſo, thoſe things will fall off of themſelves; there may be ſome things true, and ſome things not true; and the counſel may faile in proof of ſome of them, and you may clear your ſelf; yet this cannot be before the pleading. When you come to plead, if the matter be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt you, and within the time limited, it will fall off of it ſelf without any words at all; and all this time is loſt to all this Auditory, and no counſel can give you advice in this.</p>

               <p>I ſtill ſay, I do not refuſe to plead, but if you would afford me counſel, I ſhould thinke my life in a great deal leſſe danger. For I do not know, whether I may not, by the adviſe of counſel, confeſſe ſome part of the indictment; whether I may not demur in law upon ſome part, or a great part of the indictment, which <hi>I</hi> have done already; As that <hi>I</hi> am charged for treaſon for thoſe things that are not within your cognizance or power, as <hi>I</hi> apprehend, and things done before your Acts; and for ſuch things, that if <hi>I</hi> had done them, <hi>I</hi> muſt have been indicted for them within a yeer, or elſe not at all; and theſe <hi>I</hi> deem legal exceptions.</p>

Let me hear then, I beſeech you, what is the meaning of thoſe words, That the priſoner at the bar may have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to overthrow the Indictment. I cannot overthrow the Indictment when I plead; for then witneſſe comes in againſt me.</p>

               <p>He may overthrow the Indictment by the witneſſe; and I believe he is convinced, that the court hath juriſdiction in as full and expreſſe terms as law and authority can give them. And for the next, I may ſay, your Lordſhip and the court did never allow a counſel to pick holes and finde faults. But if he object that to you that is juſt and probable, and that which is dubious and doubtful, and fit to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in law, Aſſigne him counſel. You have heard all his particular exceptions, and given your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them all. But I hope, he doth not here expect to have lectures of law read him, and to make him underſtand them. But as to thoſe particular exceptions that he hath made to you, I think ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is given, and that every man is ſatisfied, and that there is no colour of doubt there; for matter of fact, and the times that he inſiſts upon. For the Act directing what offences are treaſon, and not to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned unleſſe they be proſecuted within a yeer, <hi>I</hi> muſt tell him, the impeachment is laid from 1648 to 1651. Yet my Lord, I ſhall make it appear, that the Indictment doth look backward to ſome offences, and forward to others; it is laid firſt in general. He committed ſuch and ſuch treaſons and offences in ſuch and ſuch years. And I ſhall come with the evidence, and apply them to ſuch times that are within your power, and in which the law makes them offences: And this is to be debated then, and not to be once ſpoken of now. My Lord, I ſhall begin from 1648. and run on with him, that he hath continued in a treaſonable diſpoſition, and in treaſonable plottings, to the time he was laid up, and ſince; and will juſtifie all; and therefore it behoves him to inſiſt upon it. And I will make it appear, that he was one of the firſt that ever did appear againſt this Common-wealth in plotting; and he did continue ſo until the time of his reſtraint, and after that time.</p>

               <p>I did not think to have ſpoken, nor have I uſually ſpoken in this court, yet I will ſpeak a word out of tenderneſſe to your ſelf. You have very often inſiſted upon it, that you ſhould have counſel aſſigned before you plead, that is it you plead for: truly the courſe of law is this, That if the priſoner charged at the bar, before he plead ſhall demand counſel, he muſt of neceſſity put in ſome ſpecial plea before the time he can demand counſel. The court doth not inforce you to plead guilty or not guilty to all the matter of fact, but they ſay, of neceſſity you muſt plead. If you put in a ſpecial plea, and tell them that it is a ſpecial plea, and deſire counſel upon it, they will conſider it: but till you can declare what that ſpecial plea is, for there is a general plea, and a ſpecial plea; the general plea is, <hi>not guilty,</hi> the ſpecial plea is in ſome particulars. Now for you to alleadge neither the ſpecial plea nor the general plea, it is impoſſible that counſel can be aſſigned you. And whereas you ſay you are concluded if you plead, and cannot object againſt the indictment afterwards; no Sir, I tell you in the name of a Chriſtian, and one that knows a little of the law, that all the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions you have againſt the indictment, the formality of it, and thoſe things you ſpeak of, as that of your fact not being committed in ſuch a time that the Act holds out, that the high court hath no relation to try you for <hi>Scotland</hi>; all theſe will be ſaved to you, if they ariſe upon matter of fact from the evidence. True, if you make an objection againſt the juriſdiction of the court, that hath no relation either to the ſpecial plea or general plea, it cannot be. It is impoſſible an objection ſhould be received againſt the eſſence of the court, there is none can poſſibly over-rule that for you, but themſelves; it is ſuch a thing, that no counſel can be aſſigned you, as to that, becauſe it ſtrikes at the very being of the court. Now therefore I beſeech you in the name of a chriſtian, that you will not do your ſelf that prejudice, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth every man to preſerve himſelf by all juſt wayes and means; and I do believe that in this buſineſſe you have apprehended it for your preſervation, and that you are loth to do any thing that tends to your deſtruction; but you may ſatisfie your conſcience, in that you have done what you can. And when you have pleaded, and uſed all the arguments you can, and have heard the judgement of the court in it, you may ſatisfie your conſcience, that in the words of honeſt men (unleſſe it be the juriſdiction of the court, though you have tacitely ſpoken there) you ſhall have that right and priviledge which the law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows you.

Now if the queſtion you offer be a mixt doubt, for your objection is mixt; for you ſay, the Court hath no power to try the facts, whereof you are indicted; now is it poſſible the Court can judge of that, or know there is matter of law ariſeth out of it, till the fact appear out of the mouths of the witneſſes? it may be the fact will not be proved, then there wil be no matter of law ariſing; if the fact be proved that it was done at ſuch a time, before the act was made, when that appears to them, the Court then will ſtrike it off, you ſhall not need counſell, then we ſhall not regard it: if upon the fact any other doubt ariſeth in relation to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (for it muſt be from two witneſſes, your doubting being mixed with matter of fact) we ſhal then be able to judge of it.</p>

               <p>You have accepted of ſpeciall pleas, you did it in the caſe of Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi>; and if I through my ignorance in law, cannot urge the ſtrength of law, and a ſpeciall plea, as otherwiſe I might do, I beſeech you let me not be prejudiced by it.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> inſiſted upon ſpeciall matter he had to plead, and that was, the Articles of <hi>Exeter</hi>: but he did firſt plead to the charge, Not guilty: yet we gave him that benefit; and he had that which did laſt a great debate of this Court, and ſo did <hi>Hambleton</hi>; and divers others, we will do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with you then with them.</p>

               <p>If you now deny me my ſpeciall plea, I cannot help it, which is this, that the writing or ſending letters (if it could be proved againſt me) into <hi>Scotland,</hi> doth not come within your act, and that it is only for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> that are mentioned therein.</p>

               <p>If there be a ſpeciall plea wherein there is no difficulty, then we give no counſell; but a ſpeciall plea muſt have ſomething that is dubious in the judgement of the Court; but for this, that in the letter of the law every School boy underſtands; the Judge will not allow you counſell in a triviall matter; we have gone over and over with you againe, and this is like other diſcourſes with you; but certainly never was the like ſeen, that a Court was ſo trifled with.</p>

               <p>My Lord, we do ſay in the behalf of the Common-wealth, he is guilty of the crimes and treaſons laid to his charge. And, my Lord, you now perceive, that when you have been long trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, you ſee he comes very hardly to it; an innocent man would not have made ſo much ado; and knowing his innocency, would not have had ſo much capitulation and trifling with a court of Juſtice. My Lord, for theſe crimes, you are pleaſed to obſerve they are of ſeveral natures, and of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And now, my Lord, for the ſtate of the evidence, it is commended to the charge of another Gentleman, that is maſter Solicitor General of the Common-wealth, to open to you the ſtate of the fact, by which he ſtands here impeached and accuſed, the nature of it, and how it ſhould have been carried on, the ſeries of time, the perſons with whom he complied, how plotted and contrived to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine this Common-wealth, even to the foundations of it. My Lord, when that is opened, <hi>I</hi> will then produce the evidence to make it good againſt him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Solicitor Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>Mr. Love</hi> urgeth much for himſelf, but he doth not tell you what. For my part, <hi>I</hi> never ſaw his face till now; but his own carriage, if that do not do him wrong, none will. He ſaies, he is ſingled out from all the reſt of his brethren. I ſuppoſe he means thoſe that are his fellow conſpirators; the reaſon of that is, becauſe he was the firſt, he had a hand in the firſt action and laſt action; ſo that from the beginning to the end he was the principal man, both by counſel, friends, purſe, and incouragement; and that is the reaſon he might juſtly be ſingled out to be firſt in the puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was firſt in the fact. He ſaies, God in <hi>Achans</hi> caſe wrought the diſcovery. My Lord, I thinke the court will think, that God was the great Diſcoverer of this great treaſon; for through the whole ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of it, it was preſt and carried on with as much caution and ſecrecy as the wit of man could contrive, and nothing but the goodneſſe of the God of lights, the Father of lights, could have brought this to light, who diſcovers the ſecrets of all hearts, and hidden things of darkneſſe; He hath diſcovered this. My Lord, the nature of the treaſon, it is not one or ten treaſons, but it is a myſtery of treaſons, woven together during the ſpace of two years, under the notion of Religion. Many of them that were the conſpiratours, giving out, that they were a party diſtinct and ſeparate, and ſo they did behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like a party ſeparate from the reſt of the Common-wealth. Firſt, this party did aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſoveraign power, and did exerciſe it divers ways; they did take upon them to ſend Agents abroad to treat with forraign Princes and States, enemies to this Common-wealth, and to give commiſſion to that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47192:10"/>
purpoſe, and to give inſtructions to that purpoſe, they did demean themſelves in this point, as if this party had been a free State. My Lord, the very firſt of their riſe was that in <hi>February,</hi> 1684. When the <hi>Scots</hi> had declared for the King, then they ſend immediately to their brethren here, theſe conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to let them know that they intended to make addreſſes to the new King very ſpeedily, and that there was propoſitions drawing to that purpoſe; and did deſire a firm compliance with them, promiſing them faithfully (and how they kept it we ſhall hear) as their brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that their intereſt ſhould be provided for as their own. And the Covenant that was the ground of all. When they had thus promiſed, they believed their brethren, and thereupon went about the work, and eſtabliſhed a councel at <hi>Dowgate,</hi> and there they met, and plotted and contrived how in the firſt place to make an agreement between the King and the <hi>Scots,</hi> to the intent that when they were agreed, they might come with united forces to invade this Common-wealth. They were plotting and contriving this about Midſomer, 1649. They were taken notice of abroad to be conſiderable men; and the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> as they called him, thought fit to ſend an Agent to them, to treat with them, which was one <hi>Maſon,</hi> my Lord <hi>Piercies</hi> man; his errand here, was to reconcile both parties, the Royal and Presbyterian party, and to make them both ſubſervient to do his work. My Lord, he treated with the Counteſſe of <hi>Carliſle, William Drake,</hi> and divers others, citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and this was with the privity of the Miniſters. My Lord, he had commiſſion from the King to aſſure theſe conſpirators, that if they could procure the <hi>Scots</hi> to ſend more moderate propoſitions then they had formerly ſent (for the treaty was broken off before; the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were then immoderate) that they ſhould be ſatisfied. Thereupon they were ſo confident of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo bold; (and in this Maſter <hi>Love</hi> had a principal hand) that without any more ado, he frames a Letter to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to adviſe them, and to perſwade them by all means to ſend more moderate propoſitions. The <hi>Scots</hi> return them this anſwer, That they ſaw no cauſe to ſend more moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; but they deſiring a good ſucceſſe of the Treaty, they ſhould ſend before hand to the King, to prepare and move him to comply with the propoſitions when they came. Thereupon they were as ready, whereas they ſent with the one hand to the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſo with the other hand to the King. They framed a Letter to the King, and I will expreſſe it in their own language; this was the ſubſtance of their Letter: Firſt they let the Prince know, that there was a conſiderable party in <hi>England</hi> ſenſible of their ſufferings there (they made themſelves ſo conſiderable;) and by and by, you ſhall ſee what became of that. Firſt, the Kind did underſtand them to be ſo conſiderable. Secondly, they were bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and loyalty, to the utmoſt to help him to his juſt rights, if he were once ingaged with them by taking the Covenant, &amp;c. and proſecuting the ends of it. Thirdly, that there was no way to do this, but by cloſing with his ſubjects of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Fourthly, that being done, all the Presbyterians were bound to aſſiſt him. And this, which they did, muſt be ſent away before commiſſioners come, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the King to give them good entertainments. With this Letter there was a Letter ſent to the late Queen, to deſire her by all means to work the King to a compliance with the <hi>Scots.</hi> And there was a Letter ſent to my Lord <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Jermin</hi> to that purpoſe, taking notice that the Queen, my Lord <hi>Piercy,</hi> and <hi>Jermin,</hi> were their very good friends, and ready for this conjunction; whereof they took ſpecial notice, and did approve of it as a thing very acceptable, and which ſhould be remembred in due time. My Lord, this Letter was ſent, and afterwards <hi>Maſon</hi> he brings the Anſwer from the King, and Queen, and <hi>Piercy,</hi> all agreeing to work this, that the <hi>Scots</hi> if they came with propoſitions, ſhould be complied withal. But <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Jermin</hi> writ further, and did adviſe them, to the intent the King might not fall back again, that they would ſend a meet perſon to be preſent about the King when the commiſsioners came, that ſo he might ſee faire play: And thereupon <hi>Titus</hi> was ſent away, to be an agent there for them at this Treaty; and this Treaty was at <hi>Jerſey</hi>; but this Treaty took not effect as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. Whereupon they reſolved upon another treaty at <hi>Bredah</hi>; but at the treaty at <hi>Bredah</hi> the King adviſed in his Letter (which I ſhall reade) in the later end of the Letter, that they would ſend com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners then to treat with him. My Lord, the Letter was written by the King back again to the Miniſters. Firſt, the King in the Letter took notice of the Miniſters non-compliance with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent power, and of their loyalty and good affection to him; and that if God reſtored him, he would requite them. Secondly, he promiſed all ſatisfaction to the <hi>Scots.</hi> Thirdly, made large promiſes of high favours particularly to the Miniſters. Fourthly, wiſht them to ſend commiſsioners, ſufficiently inſtructed, to treat at <hi>Bredah.</hi> Now my Lord, in the Diary that came along with this (for there was a Diary of all <hi>Titus</hi> his Negotiations) in that Diary it did appear, that the King was very much ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the correſpondents application to him, and that that ſhould be a main argument to him to ſatisfie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47192:10"/>
the <hi>Scots.</hi> So my Lord, if they had not thus moderated, and perſwaded the King that they were a very conſiderable party, he would never, in all probability, have cloſed with the <hi>Scots,</hi> but have thought them very inconſiderable. But when he was informed, that if he cloſed with the <hi>Scots,</hi> he ſhould have a conſiderable party in <hi>England,</hi> that made him think the <hi>Scots</hi> were worth the cloſing with. My Lord, <hi>Titus</hi> in his Negotiation at <hi>Jerſey</hi> did aſſure the King, that the Miniſters were averſe to the preſent Government, both in pulpit and in print, and that they were well-affected to ſerve him and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the Nation was ready to eſpouſe his quarrel if he did joyne with the <hi>Scots.</hi> This he did aſſure him in the behalf of the Miniſters. And to ſhew how they did own this, they did like this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſo well, that they ſent him another Letter; and they did likewiſe ſend him a Letter of thanks for his good ſervice he had done, in poſſeſſing the King how conſiderable they were. My Lord, after this buſineſſe of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> when <hi>Titus</hi> had done his good ſervice there, he was coming home to make his relation; but hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing by the way, that the Councel of State had intercepted ſome Letters, he durſt not come farther then <hi>Calice</hi>; and from thence he ſends a Letter, to let them know all this; and withal, that he had ſomething to communicate to theſe conſpirators, that was not fit to be communicated by Letter, and therefore deſired that ſome meet perſon might be ſent to <hi>Calice.</hi> Thereupon, this Letter being read in Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> ſtudy (ſo ſecretly was it carried) there it was agreed, that Major <hi>Alford</hi> ſhould be the man that ſhould go to <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſhould receive all this account from him. Whereupon <hi>Alford</hi> he went away to <hi>Titus</hi> preſently, and there he did ſpeak to him, and <hi>Titus</hi> did acquaint him with all theſe proceedings; and withall they did adviſe, that a Commiſſion ſhould be ſent in the later part of the Letter. So that now they had no more to do, but ſince their hopes failed them at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> to have an eye to the Treaty at <hi>Bredah,</hi> where they deſired to ſend Commiſſioners. My Lord, this letter to be preſented at <hi>Bredah,</hi> was managed at Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe. Col. <hi>Maſſey,</hi> Col. <hi>Graves, Titus,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe were the parties There were Letters ſent to them to act accordingly; and <hi>Titus</hi> ſent letters to the King and Queen, and <hi>Piercy.</hi> And again my Lord, for the Commiſſion; it was as tranſcendent a boldneſſe, as ever was done by private men; and the Commiſſion was corrected by Mr. <hi>Love</hi>; for it was rough drawn by <hi>William Drake,</hi> which was the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent here. But Mr. <hi>Love</hi> in his ſtudy, and Doctor <hi>Drake,</hi> did help to correct it. The ſubſtance of the Commiſsion was this: <hi>We the Presbyterian party in</hi> England, <hi>do authorize you,</hi> Francis <hi>Lord</hi> Willoughby <hi>of</hi> Pariham, Edward M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſey, James Bunce, Richard Graves, <hi>and</hi> Sylas Titus, <hi>to treat on our behalf, and the reſt of our Brethren the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians of</hi> England, <hi>with the King, and to aſſiſt our brethren the</hi> Scots <hi>Commiſſioners, in their treaty with the King, and to do according to the Inſtructions annexed.</hi> My Lord, here be the heads of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: That the Commiſsioners ſhould uſe all arguments they could, to move the King to give the <hi>Scots</hi> ſatisfaction, and to take the Covenant; and particularly to inform him of the condition of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and how things ſtood in <hi>England</hi> at that time; all which then cried out for an agreement with the <hi>Scots</hi>; giving them full power of all things, and what ſhould be concluded by them the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, ſhould be confirmed by the confederates. I think, my Lord, here was a very large commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; whatſoever they thought fit, they were willing to comply with and make good. My Lord, at Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, at the ſame time it was moved (according to a letter from my Lord <hi>Piercy</hi> to <hi>William Drake</hi>) that a good ſum of money might be ſent to the King, as a great means to diſpoſe the King to an agreement with the <hi>Scots</hi>; but they did not think fit to be cozened of their money, but if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction did follow, then to raiſe money conſiderably. And they went on ſo far, as to debate how to raiſe this great ſum of money for this pious work, as you ſhall hear by and by, under what notion when propounded. Thoſe men agreed, that the beſt way was, that the Miniſters ſhould have ſeveral correſpondents; and that they ſhould propound the lending of 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 pounds, for a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable uſe; but you muſt not ask what this charitable uſe is for. And this charitable uſe, what would it have been? if God had not bleſt the battle at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> we ſhould have ſeen it. My Lord, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the battel at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> when they had a letter from <hi>Maſſey,</hi> or <hi>Bailey,</hi> or, ſomebody, they then began to underſtand their brethren better then before; for he did informe them, that notwithſtanding what was pretended, yet for all that, there was no <hi>Engliſh</hi> imployed, nor was the King crowned. This did diſturb the minds of the conſpirators very much; inſomuch that they did expoſtulate with a large let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written by Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and Dr. <hi>Drake,</hi> written in a table-book in ſack, and ſent there; they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with them, becauſe the Presbyterian party, which was the over-ruling party, were growne ſo confident of carrying all before them, that they did neither crown the King, nor minde the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They did blame them for this, ſeeing this going upon a ſingle intereſt, and upon one party alone,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47192:11"/>
which they did call godly, would not do well. And my Lord, it proved ſo indeed, they carried it on upon this, till the battel at <hi>Dunbar</hi> came, and then they began to be of another minde. After that battel, there was a letter from the commiſſioners of Eſtates, preſsing for Arms and Ammunition; and letters from <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> for money to be ſent. My Lord, theſe good natured men, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they had been ſo handſomly dealt withal when their brethren were in power, yet for all that, ſo fierce and eager were they to carry on this great deſigne, which God knows what it would have come to, they notwithſtanding, upon Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> propoſition (for he was the man who did propound it) agreed to ſend 500 pounds preſently to <hi>Maſſey.</hi> My Lord, this money was raiſed, and ſubſcriptions taken by Mr. <hi>Love</hi> himſelf at his own table: And this is proved by one who brought his ten pounds, he brought it to Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> and would truſt no body elſe with it; and this was ſent away preſently by captain <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey.</hi> My Lord, there was a large letter ſent alſo with the money, wherein was good counſel; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the money, he did write to adviſe his brethren, that it would be notable ſervice to indeavour after union. The letter was ſent, and that large letter inviting to union had been delivered to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and that would help to quaſh the diſſenting party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had made the King a priſoner. But now the State and Church were all agreed, and this was the fruit of Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> letter. And if they had not been ſo united, they could have done no harm; this letter came ſo ſeaſonably that they conceived it very conſiderable. They preſsing to union very much, by this means did quaſh the diſſenting brethren, and by that means they came to be as now they are. My Lord, about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, there came a letter from <hi>Maſſey,</hi> which gave an account of crowning their King, and of great preparations to take the field; and that the correſpondents here ſhould beware of unſeaſonable riſing, and that they were moſt affraid that theſe perſons would riſe too ſoon, and ſo ſpoile all. My Lord, in anſwer to this letter, they write back again to <hi>Maſſey,</hi> to adviſe him on the other ſide, to take heed that he came not into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> but well provided, and not to depend much upon the aſſiſtance here in <hi>England</hi>; they were affraid he was too weak, as he was affraid they were too forward. My Lord, after <hi>Cook</hi> was apprehended, then the correſpondents met no more at publick meetings, and yet they received letters from <hi>Drake, Maſſey, Bunce,</hi> and the reſt (whereof Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was ſtill made acquainted as a principal man) that told them of the hopeful condition of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, that they intended to engage in <hi>England</hi>; adviſing the party here, not to be too forward. This was the ſecond advice; and ſee the reaſon of it; for if Mr. <hi>Love</hi> ſate at the helm, as he did, all the meetings being at his houſe, after <hi>Drake</hi> went away he ſtill ſtating the queſtion, drew theſe letters and corrected them. And if he were ſuch a main ſtickler, truly there was very great reaſon for his advice. My Lord, about the middle of <hi>March</hi> laſt, Col. <hi>Bamfields</hi> man brings an anſwer to the meſſage in the table-book written in ſack, containing foure or five ſheets of paper: Upon this packet there was nothing written but the letter <hi>L.</hi> to deliver to one of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and ſeeing nothing but the letter <hi>L.</hi> written, he carried it to <hi>Mr. Love,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Love</hi> did own it as ſent to him; and that was the large Narrative of the ſtate of affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the fight at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> how things ſtood there. My Lord, with this Narrative was ſent alſo a letter from <hi>Mr. Bailey,</hi> by order from the general Aſſembly: they did order <hi>Mr. Bailey</hi> (which was the <hi>Scotch</hi> correſpondent there) to write a large letter; and there was another letter from my Lords of <hi>Argile, Lowden,</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> &amp;c. it is worth your obſerving what this letter was that came from theſe men: Firſt, thanks for the good affections of <hi>Mr. Love</hi> and the reſt of the conſpirators. Secondly, incouragement to perſevere, and to credit <hi>Bamfields</hi> negotiation for money. Thirdly, promiſed to repay all, whatever they ſhould lend: But when, and by whom this payment ſhould be made, the letter will tell you; and that is, when God ſhall bleſſe their endeavours in procuring a free Parliament in <hi>England.</hi> So the Parliament in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> muſt pay all the <hi>Scots</hi> debts, that theſe conſpirators ſhall lend. Truly <hi>I</hi> thinke it will be a very free Parliament indeed, when it comes ſo free out of the peoples purſes. My Lord, <hi>Mr. Love</hi> and others gave <hi>Bamfields</hi> man that brought this Narrative out of their own purſes ten pounds, and ſent a bill of exchange of 30. pounds to <hi>Bamfield</hi>; by one witneſſe it will be expreſly proved, that ten pounds of this money came out of <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> purſe. My Lord, <hi>William Drakes</hi> laſt letter did informe, that <hi>Maſſey</hi> would break into <hi>England</hi> as ſoon as there was graſſe for his horſes; and therefore he ſent to have a good bank of money provided in readineſſe, and that they ſhould think of timing a party, and that they ſhould neither riſe too ſoon nor too late, but juſt when <hi>Maſſey</hi> came in; this <hi>Mr. Love</hi> told <hi>Major Adams.</hi> My Lord, now we come ſo near to the time, as that one of theſe conſpirators is apprehended by the Councel of State. When he had been in reſtraint three daies, he ſent to <hi>Mr. Love,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Love</hi> came to him; but he had been at a kinde of a Faſt, for they did keep Faſts once a fortnight at leaſt, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47192:11"/>
Prayers, for the good ſucceſs of this deſign, That God would bleſs this wonderful Treaſon; which was for the making, by the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, an utter ſubverſion of this Commonwealth; and the free, and noble, and magnanimous people of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be made vaſſals and contributaries to the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation; This was the deſign, and for this deſign, the Miniſters faſted and prayed: But it is plain, God did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor ſuch things. And, my Lord, Maſter <hi>Love</hi> took upon him, to ſpeak to the perſon under reſtraint, <hi>Take heed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what you do, leaſt you wrong your ſelf or others</hi>; and ſaid, <hi>It is true,</hi> Titus <hi>his man hath broken up Papers, but we are all well enough; but give notice to the reſt of the Confederates, That they may not be ſurpriſed; but be you not troubled, becauſe we have prayed for you this day:</hi> And they implored the God of Truth, that nothing of all this ſhould come to light, but that we ſhould be in the dark ſtill in generals. My Lord, This is the true ſtate of the evidence, as near as I can preſent it, with a frail memory: And, my Lord, I have opened nothing but generals, your Lordſhip and the Court, will judge of it; and Maſter <hi>Love</hi> will have the leſs to do to anſwer: But it appears by this, That there hath been ſuch a practice, ſuch a ſeries of Treaſon, Treaſon upon Treaſon, that one Act of Parliament is not enough to contain it; but all thoſe Acts of Parliament read, every one of them make him a Traytor. And, my Lord, I am ſorry I have taken up ſo much of your time, eſpecially, when you have ſpent ſo much time before: If your Lordſhip therefore will be pleaſed to have the patience to hear the Witneſſes, we ſhall prove more then I have yet opened.</p>

               <p>My Lord, This was an early Treaſon, that began betimes to cruſh the Commonwealth in its infancy: And, my Lord, Maſter <hi>Love</hi> being ſingled out for juſtice, you will anone obſerve, there was ſingular cauſe for it; and if he had had his deſert, it had been long before now: But States can play ſometimes with Treaſons, and not take a time tell they ſee fit. My Lord, This Treaſon, as I have opened it to you, began in the year 1648. The King of <hi>Scots</hi> ſo called; but take notice, That the ſame Nation and Perſons that proclaimed him King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> proclaimed him King of <hi>England</hi> alſo at the ſame time, in the ſame Nation; and thoſe perſons that proclaimed this perſon King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the ſame proclaimed him King of <hi>England.</hi> My Lord, You have heard ſome of the Conſpirators named, <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Drake,</hi> active men both of them; Theſe men have been ſo ingenuous, That they have fled for their Treaſons; notwithſtanding this Gentleman, a Miniſter of the Goſpel, he doth not do ſo; they have confeſt their offences, and are fled for them; they dare not appear, they have ſo much guilt within them, that prompts them to keep away; but this Gentleman hath not ſo much My Lord, <hi>Drake</hi> was ſo active, and it was carried on with ſo much ſecreſie, and ſo much (as they thought) of Caution, That Maſter <hi>Drake</hi> writing, as that Gentleman next Mr. <hi>Love</hi> doth, in ſhort hand, he burnt his Papers, and burnt all where any thing was to be ſeen, ſo that no originals are to be ſeen. My Lord, in this caſe it hath been opened to you, what tranſactions Mr. <hi>Love</hi> had with <hi>Scotland</hi>; and you have been pleaſed to obſerve, it was a tender point, that Mr. <hi>Love</hi> did enter diſcourſe with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was very much troubled at it, and he may ſee juſt cauſe to be troubled at it: And will you give me leave, there hath been Blood and Treaſure ſpent, as was told you by Mr. Solicitor. I am afraid, I might too juſtly ſay, by that Gentleman, and thoſe he did ſeduce, That they have been too much the cauſe of this Blood, even that Gentleman that ſtands at the Bar, that ſhould be a man of peace, and not of blood. My Lord, I may juſtly ſay, That that Gentleman hath been too much the cauſe of theſe late Engagements between theſe two Nations, and making himſelf a party; and it is a ſad thing, when parties appear againſt a State. My Lord, I am too much afraid, what ever God pleaſes to work upon him, That it ſhould touch his Conſcience, that he ſhould be inſtrumental in ſuch a work. But I verily believe, had there not bin actings from hence, there had not bin ſo much forwardneſs in the Kings party to the <hi>Scots.</hi> My Lord, I will minde that Gentleman of what is ſaid of the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> I am ſorry for it, that it ſhould be ſaid of our Miniſters, whoſe Faith is Faction, Whoſe Religion is Rebellion; it is ſaid ſo of the Romiſh Miniſters, I hope it will not be ſaid ſo of the Engliſh, That their Faith is Faction, and that they pray for ſtrife, and faſt for ſtrife. My Lord, For theſe men, <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> they are gone, as I ſaid, and they did confeſs themſelves ſo much guilty, as that they have fled for it; and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> doth know (I am ſorry to ſee him in that geſture) that he was converſant with them all, and doth know (I believe) that we can prove it; and when he hears the men named, he will ſay ſo too. Truly, my Lord, I have nothing to ſay againſt the perſon of the man, but againſt his vices and faults; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his Function, and nothing to thoſe whom he pretends ſo boldly to repreſent, that is, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian party. We do all know, there are many honeſt, precious and godly men, that have received no diſcountenance from the State; nor this Gentleman, that ſhould give him any countenance or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47192:12"/>
to oppoſe the State: But it is ſomewhat a bold thing, for a particular man to be the head of a party, and they to engage as repreſenting a conſiderable party, to engage to ſend Commiſſioners to agree upon Inſtructions; this is very bold. But, my Lord, God be thanked, many of thoſe that were ſeduced at firſt, were wiſe, and did come in before the laſt; and did not ſtrut it out, my Lord, with States and Juſtice, as that man hath done before now, and at preſent, even out-facing Juſtice, and boldly, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay, wiping his lips; he hath done no offence. My Lord, they were ſo bold with <hi>Scotland,</hi> that there was a known Agent there maintained and kept, between <hi>Scotland</hi> and them; and I will tell him the Gentlemans name, his name was Mr. <hi>Sterks</hi>; and, my Lord, when he went away, the Act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring thoſe of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation to be gone, that Gentleman did ſupply him with money himſelf; and others gave him eight or ten pounds in his purſe to carry him away. My Lord, I believe he knows this, and I am ſorry, That that Gentleman that hath gone along with us in much of this War, that he ſhould at laſt, ſo much betray his own diſcretion, as rather to truſt a reconciled Enemy, then to be true to his own Friends. I ſay, He truſts a reconciled Enemy, and a weak Enemy, and that he will think, and will know, that they might betray him; as juſtly may be done, when men ſo caſt themſelves upon the Party of the King, and Queen, and <hi>Peircy,</hi> and <hi>Jermine</hi>; it is no great policy nor diſcretion to have ſo many of Councel: they ſay, three keeps councel; but this Gentleman hath now 20, 30, 40, in <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and Agitations between them, and frequent Intercourſes.

I do declare alſo in the preſence of the ſame God, I never received any Letters written to me, either from the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or Queen his Mother, or from the Church or State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in general, or from any particular perſon of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, ſince the Wars began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations, to this day.

               <p>I was examined ſeveral times, and had a wide latitude there; and then I was to ſpeak to every truth, as I thought and heard; but now I have taken an oath to ſpeak the truth between the State and this Gentleman: And I beſeech you, that I may be held cloſe to thoſe things, and I will give you the fulleſt and faireſt account I can. What I ſaid before, was in order to the diſcovery of the thing; much of which, I had by hear-ſay from others, and in that I may miſtake, in perſons, places, and times: What I have done my ſelf, and what I know this Gentleman hath done, that may be put to me fully.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47192:13"/>
may erre in that particular, poſſibly <hi>M. Drake</hi> did not tell me ſo; for as I apprehend, I ſaid, I did think it did put a neceſſity upon the King to agree with the <hi>Scots</hi>; and then having ſeen ſome papers, and conferr'd with that relation others have made, I collected the truth of them, as far as I did know; but now I am upon my oath, let me therefore come to the matter; I ſpake then many things as I heard, which I cannot affirm upon my oath.</p>

               <p>My Lord, J was one morning wiſh'd to go with <hi>William Drake</hi> to the Swan at <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> heating there was a Gentleman lately come from the Prince, where J ſhould hear all the news from beyond the Seas; when J came there, it was one Captain <hi>Titus,</hi> one whom J had never ſeen before, and he gave a relation of the good diſpoſition of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and how inclinable he was to take the covenant, and to caſt off the cavaliering party, and thoſe about him, if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e were an opportunity to make it known, that there was a conſiderable party in <hi>England</hi> that would ſtick cloſe to the ends of the covenant. Upon that Sir, my ſelfe, and ſome others that were there, did think we were bound in duty, and in relation to the Covenant, to preſſe the ends of the Covenant, for the Prince to take it, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47192:16"/>
to proſecute the ends of it. And for that Captain <hi>Titus</hi> ſaid, if we would appoint another meeting, he would draw up ſomething by way of atteſtation or petition to the Prince to that purpoſe. My Lord, we did meet at the Bear in <hi>Breadſtreet,</hi> and there he did draw forth ſomething that he had framed to that purpoſe, and he read it; and afterwards (not at that time) it was agreed upon to be ſent over to the Prince. The ſubſtance of it, was to preſſe the Prince to apply himſelf to take the covenant, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the ends of it; and to caſt off all his cavaliering party about him, which had brought ſo much miſchief to his father, and would do the like to him. This Captain <hi>Titus</hi> drew up, and this I believe was ſent over, for <hi>Titus</hi> undertook to ſend it over. <hi>I</hi> did ask how the Prince ſhould be made to believe, that this coming from an inconſiderable party, as we were, ſhould come under the notion of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian party of <hi>England,</hi> for it went under that notion? He ſaid, he ſhould undertake that by the means of my Lord <hi>Piercy.</hi> And the petition that was agreed upon, he did ſend over, I believe, for I did not carry it to the poſt-houſe, but he did undertake to do it. Afterwards he went over himſelf, and when he was over, he had information that there was notice of his being here, and of the buſineſſe he was upon; and therefore he writ over to <hi>William Drake</hi> (as <hi>M. Drake</hi> told me) that he did deſire ſome of us that knew of the buſineſſe, ſhould be ſent over to him, to receive that account from him which he had in the buſineſſe. So <hi>M. Drake</hi> did perſwade me to go over to <hi>Calice</hi>; and having ſome buſineſſe of my own, I did go over to <hi>Calice.</hi> I went from my houſe on the friday night, and I was back again on the tueſday following: And he did give me an account of that tranſaction. The ſubſtance of it was this: It was about his own troubles he had undergone there by the cavalie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing party, in managing that buſineſſe. He had likewiſe been impriſoned, and they told him they would try him as a ſpy; and that they urged hard againſt him; and that he was in that condition till my Lord <hi>Liberton,</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, came over; and by his means he had acceſſe to, and favour with the Prince. And that was the ſubſtance of all. He ſaid the King was averſe to the covenant, not of himſelf, but by reaſon of thoſe counſels that were about him. And this was the ſubſtance of that account he gave me of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action there at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> in reference to the buſineſſe he went upon. And this he gave me in writing, which I brought over to deliver to <hi>M. Drake,</hi> for it was directed to him, which I did deliver. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Maſter <hi>Drake</hi> carried them to Maſter <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, where they were read. And that is all as to that buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Then afterwards there was a commiſſion, they called it a commiſſion, it was agreed upon among us, to be ſent over to my Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham</hi> and <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and I think <hi>Graves</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> that they ſhould agitate and act for us at <hi>Bredah,</hi> and to adviſe with the <hi>Scotch</hi> commiſſioners that were there, in the behalf of the Presbyterian party here in <hi>England</hi>; and that is all in relation to that. Afterward <hi>M. Drake</hi> read to me the copy of a letter in characters, which he had written himſelf in his own back-ſhop, which he told me ſhould be ſent to the Queen, which was to perſwade her to perſwade the King, as he came that way, to cloſe with the <hi>Scots,</hi> for that was the likelieſt way to make good his own intereſt; but that was at <hi>M. Drakes</hi> houſe, onely between him and I. Afterwards <hi>M. Drake</hi> told me he had diſburſed money about receiving of letters, and receiving of news, and did wiſh me that I would let him have ten pounds, and ſaid he would ſpeak to ſome others of his acquaintance to do the like, and if he could get up a conſiderable ſum, I ſhould have part back again, for he ſaid the charge was too great for him to undertake; and I do think he had ten pounds of me for that. After <hi>Dunbar</hi> fight, there was I and ſome others at <hi>M. Loves,</hi> in his great lower room, where was a letter read that was ſaid to be from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Maſſey,</hi> that gave an account of the buſineſſe of <hi>Dunbar</hi>; and alſo did write for Arms, I know not how many thouſands; and to that purpoſe, that they might be provided by the way of <hi>Holland.</hi> But upon that, all that were there did ſay—I heard no man ſpeak of providing arms or any ſuch thing. He writ in his letter, that for his own neceſſities, and Captain <hi>Titus</hi> that was there, that a motion might be made for providing ſome money to ſend over for their ſupply; and it was then ſaid, we were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, and ſo few, that the ſum ſpoken of could not be done; and therefore it was moved, that every one ſhould do by himſelf and friends what he could. This was the ſubſtance of that.</p>

               <p>I believe, My Lord, he hath dealt ingenuouſly with you. This in the generall. I pray you ask him, what he knows concerning any letters that ſhould have been ſent at the beginning of the change of this government to <hi>Scotland</hi> from any part of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, he ſaies <hi>Titus</hi> at that time did give relation of the Prince and his party. Can you remember what that relation was? and do you know whether this was not afterward communicated, and to whom?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Maj. Alf.</speaker>
               <p>I have given you the ſubſtance of it; but for communicating of it, I knew it from none but onely from thoſe there.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Maj. Alf.</speaker>
               <p>He did ſo; and at the next meeting at <hi>Breadſtreet,</hi> there were the ſame men again; and I think at the ſame time there was Col. <hi>Barton.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Maj. Alf.</speaker>
               <p>It was asked <hi>Titus,</hi> how the King ſhould be poſſeſſed that this came from the Presbyterian party in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe it was agreed upon that there ſhould be no names uſed to it? he ſaid there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded none, but onely the ingagement of the miniſters in it.</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>I cannot ſay at that time, but afterwards.

               <p>It was to be done among our ſelves, to raiſe ſome money; there was five hundred pounds ſpoken of, but it was impoſſible for us to do that, for us that were inconſiderable men, being men of mean eſtates, and fortunes, and ſo it was brought down to a leſſe ſum.</p>

               <p>My Lord I can ſay, that about <hi>March,</hi> 1648. I met with Major <hi>Alford,</hi> and he told me that <hi>Titus</hi> was in town, and asked me if I knew him, and I told him, I; and asked him where he was, he ſaid he was newly come from beyond Sea, from the Fry, there being Alderman <hi>Bunce</hi>; I asked him where he was, he ſaid little to me; but he ſaid he was to meet him the next day at the Swan at dowgate, that there was to be ſome Citizens in order to thoſe Gentlemen beyond the Seas, to ſpeak with him there. I did meet, and the Citizens there were Col. <hi>Barton,</hi> Col. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> Captaine <hi>Maſſey,</hi> L. Col. <hi>Bains,</hi> and I think <hi>Hollis</hi> his man, I am not certain of it; but Captain <hi>Far</hi> was there: the buſineſſe at that time, was only commendations from their friends there; and to tell them that he was commended to their acquaintance. And afterwards, he grew into very high praiſes of the Prince, and that he had the knowledge of it from a Scotch Lord, <hi>I</hi> know not his name. After this he told them the Prince was running very unhandſome courſes, and they had very great hopes, that his own inclinations did not lead him to it, but it was the Malignant party about him, that had a prevalency over him there, as over his Father here; but he did rather incline to join with the Jriſh Rebbels, and did beleeve he would incline that way, unleſſe he could get ſomething from hence, to divert him from i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; whereupon he did hope they would all ſet themſelves that way, and that he would get letters from perſons of honour (whom I know not) that ſhould perſwade him into a good belief of the Scots, and to take the Covenant; after this there was a meeting again, I think fourteen days after, at the white Hart in Breadſtreet, and there I met too; in the time that I was there, I did underſtand there had been a meeting or two before in order to the buſineſſe, &amp; Captain <hi>Titus</hi> did declare he had now again letters from perſons of honour, to ſend to my Lord <hi>Piercy,</hi> and did hope they would ſet ſomething a foot amongſt themſelves of the like conſequence: for <hi>Maſſey, Bunce,</hi> and <hi>Graves</hi> could ſee no way under the heavens but for the King to take the Covenant, and joyn with the Scots, and to engage the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting party here. And to that purpoſe, he draws forth a paper that did purport that they were bound in honor, and juſtice, and conſcience, and I think Loyalty, to maintain him in his juſt rights, if he would go and joyn with the Covenanting party in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and that he had no other way under God, but that; which if he did, they took themſelves bound in Conſcience to help him to his juſt rights. Upon this L. Col. <hi>Bains</hi> makes objection to it, and ſaid, it was a Malignant buſineſſe; and did fear there was no good deſigne in the thing, and thereupon they did break up. <hi>I</hi> cannot tell whether it was ſent or no, for they were affraid he would betray the buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>After that I was told by Major <hi>Alford,</hi> that <hi>Bains</hi> told them, he was very ſorry he ſhould meddle in that buſineſſe, and that they would never proſper, that had any thing to do with him, for that the ſins of him and his Father were ſo great; whereupon they were very wary and affraid he would diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the buſineſſe. And he, <hi>I</hi> think, knew no further. After this, <hi>I</hi> did underſtand this letter was ſent to the Prince, and I was told ſo by <hi>M. Alford,</hi> that it was ſent in the name of the ſecluded members, and Miniſters, and Citizens, and ſouldery, and Noblemen; I remember it fetch'd a great compaſſe: wherupon when the Prince ſaw this letter, and had it from my Lord <hi>Piercy,</hi> he ſtormed at it, &amp; ſaid, Who are theſe Noblemen, and the reſt? What can they do for me? can they raiſe me ten thouſand men? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there was nothing done, but <hi>Titus</hi> retired himſelf to his mothers houſe, &amp; there lived about three quarters of a year, and came to town after, &amp; did ſolicite his own buſineſs. A little after this, I heard (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the buſineſſe of the <hi>Scots</hi>) that there was another letter ſent that did begin the thing again, and now the Prince had conſidered of the thing, and ſent over the letter, and I heard, that it was to the Miniſters of <hi>London.</hi> I did not ſee the letter, but <hi>Alford</hi> and <hi>Drake</hi> told me it was ſo. After this <hi>Titus</hi> was ſent away, and that with a ſum of mony, as I heard; who lent the mony, J cannot tell, and what ſum J know not: but preſently after this, J coming to town out of the Weſt, in <hi>March</hi> 1649. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of March, the day of my coming to <hi>London,</hi> after J had been here one or two days at moſt, J

met with <hi>Hollis</hi> his man in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> I do not know his name, he met me, and I asked him what news? he told me, he wondred that <hi>I</hi> was a ſtranger: and <hi>I</hi> asked him, what news? ſaith he, if you come to M. <hi>Love's</hi> houſe, you ſhall hear newes; what is your buſineſſe there, ſaid I? he ſaid, it was to pray together, and to hear the newes: I went about nine of the clock, and prayer was over, and the news a great part was over: but after I did come there, that I did hear, was this; <hi>William Drake</hi> pulled a paper out of his pocket, that I underſtood he had put into his pocket, or withdrawn, becauſe of a ſtranger, and afterwards he took it out again. The ſubſtance of the paper was to this pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſome body asked him, what power have we to give ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? it was anſwered again by <hi>Wiliam Drake,</hi> that we have the Kings command for it, and wee have likewiſe the authority of ſome prudent Parliament man, whom wee look upon (ſaith he) beyond the power of them that now ſit: whereupon M. <hi>Love</hi> replies, Come, come, let it go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after that I knew nothing.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Concerning any thing that came from <hi>Scotland,</hi> I never knew any thing, nor did I ever hear any thing; for <hi>Dowgate,</hi> J was at two meetings at <hi>Dowgate</hi>; At the firſt meeting, there was a perſon that J did not know, which at the ſecond meeting, J was told was Captain <hi>Titus,</hi> and he at that meeting (where there was nine, or ten, or more, or thereabouts,) he did propoſe ſome thing to be done in order to the reſtoring or preſerving the Presbyterian Jntereſt by way of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King, as he called him, and did adviſe it to be by way of petition, and that he conceived to be the onely way to preſerve the Presbyterian Jntereſt in <hi>England</hi>; and that way would be the way to aſſure him, he had a conſiderable party in <hi>England</hi>; and he did uſe many arguments, as a duty ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us by our Covenant, to apply our ſelves to him, and he offered to draw up a draught of a petition againſt the next meeting to that purpoſe: and he ſaid, it was neceſſary ſome thing ſhould be done by ſome Parliament men, and ſome Miniſters, and ſome Citizens, that were leading men, men that thereby he might be aſſured that he had a party, and that conſiderable. At the next meeting, which was ſuddenly after, he did produce a paper, which, as J remember, was in ſhort hand; a petition, which was to the purpoſe J have hinted. There were ſeverall debates, whether it ſhould be ſigned, or not ſigned, and my ſelfe, and two more before diſliked it; and before he read the paper, he began to commend the good nature of the King, what good affections he had, and likewiſe did ſay, there was a neceſſity ſomething ſhould be done to the Queen, and <hi>Jermine,</hi> and <hi>Piercy</hi>; who he ſaid, were our friends, that they ſhould ſtir him up to comply with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners; and upon this there was my ſelfe, and two more there preſent, (I hope it ſate upon them, as upon my ſelfe) diſliked the buſineſſe, and from that time for my own part, I never heard any thing; the heads of the Petition <hi>I</hi> cannot ſuddenly remember. This paper carries the ſum and ſubſtance of the buſineſſe.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Adams.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Adams.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay he did, it may be, he might, but I dare not ſay upon my oath, that he knew of it.</p>

                  <hi>M.

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> cannot tell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it was in his ſtudy, or in the lower room, I am apt to believe it was in the lower room.</p>

               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Was Mr. <hi>Love</hi> there?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Whether did it not declare the poverty of his condition? And was it not after <hi>Dunbar</hi> fight?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, it was.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Was this letter from <hi>Maſſey,</hi> read at Maſter <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, was this for money?</p>

               <p>It was.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Was it agreed for money to bee raiſed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>If you take the word <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,</hi> as I formerly propounded, it was ſo.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>How was the money to be raiſed, and in what manner?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>It was by thoſe that were privy to the contribution.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Was not Mr. <hi>Love</hi> there, and did not he write down the ſums that were to be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>This <hi>I</hi> muſt needs ſay, that Maſter <hi>Love</hi> had papers in his hand, and hee did write ſomething, but I did not ſee what he did write, and every man did write that was there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did not you conceive ſo, that Mr. <hi>Love</hi> ſummed up every mans ſum? did he put the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their names before them, when he writ the ſums?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Was not there a letter penn'd by Maſter <hi>Love,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Drake</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>To that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I muſt ſay there was a letter, but I cannot deliver it upon my oath that it was penn'd by Maſter <hi>Love,</hi> or Doctor <hi>Drake,</hi> but it was taken to be ſo, and I thought it was ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>To whom was that letter directed?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell to whom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>To whom was it declared to be directed? to whom was it declared to be written?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>To the Generall Aſſembly and Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>It was ſo.</p>

               <p>Was <hi>Mr. Love</hi> preſent, and did approve of it?</p>

               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was preſent at ſome time of this meeting: the reaſon why <hi>I</hi> thought it to be of Maſter <hi>Loves,</hi> or Doctor <hi>Drakes</hi> drawing, was nothing but meerly the language of it, it being in order to promote the ends of the Covenant, and all the whole language was couched to that purpoſe, and taking notice of the want of reſpect to <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and of their being beaten.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, This is very high; for he tels you this letter was approved of, and directed to be ſent, and this was after <hi>Dunbar</hi> fight, after we were ingaged in bloud.</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>Here Adams read out of his Examination, as followeth:</stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>There was alſo a large letter in the nature of a Declaration penn'd by Maſter <hi>Love,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Drake,</hi> and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by moſt of the Presbyterian party, Miniſters, and other, and directed to the Generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſubſcribed by none, which contained the ſubſtance of what was declared by <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Maſſey,</hi> but durſt not promiſe any great ſums of money till they appeared more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and grew nearer action; the buſineſſe required higher ſpirits then was for the preſent, and the buſineſſe required a conſiderable ſumme: but to leave no means un-attempted when the buſineſſe was ſeaſable.
<stage>So far he reads.</stage>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Major <hi>Adams</hi> is now upon his oath to tell you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, As well as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it did put forth much after this ſort, but <hi>I</hi> cannot ſwear it in theſe words, but that is the ſubſtance of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Was not this agreed and declared at <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> houſe, that ſuch a letter ſhould be written to the Honourable Committee, and to the Kirk.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, that after the ſame manner as all other things are agreed at ſuch meetings as this is, but I have no ground, and do not know why I ſhould ſay Maſter <hi>Love</hi> and Doctor <hi>Drake</hi> penn'd it.</p>

               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Ask him for the ſubſtance of the letter, whether it were not as he hath told you, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not ſay, they could not promiſe a conſiderable ſum of money.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly, either in that letter, or ſome other, there was ſome ſuch expreſſions.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. <hi>Preſ.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>VVell, it was about that time, and in that letter, or in ſome other letter, and at M. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Ask him if there was not an Agent come from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a way laid at <hi>Kendall</hi> for a correſpondency between theſe Gentlemen here, and ſome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and whether one <hi>Groves</hi> was not ſent thither?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>That was ſomething obſcure; that there was ſuch a thing, I do verily believe, becauſe it went amongſt us for a truth, but how to make it out for a truth upon my oath, I cannot tell.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. <hi>Preſ.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Did <hi>Mr. Love</hi> know of it?</p>

               <p>

               <speaker>Att Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Ask him what he knows concerning Colonel <hi>Bamfield's</hi> man coming hither?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Concerning that I know nothing, but I confeſſe <hi>I</hi> had ſome <hi>Item,</hi> that at that time there was ſomething found; and this is all I can ſay to that, I cannot gueſſe the time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Was it after the fight at <hi>Dunbar</hi>?</p>

               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, that it was.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Were the meetings at <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> houſe?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay all, but all that I know of, were.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Ask whether upon the large letter, <hi>Maſſey</hi> did not write that things were well ſetled in <hi>Scotland?</hi>

               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>Many of theſe things were underſtood ſo, and taken for granted amongſt us, but I can ſay no otherwiſe, I thought it to be ſo; but I know not.</p>

               <p>Were you not preſent, or at <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> houſe, when theſe letters were read, that they were in a hopefull condition?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay ſo.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>What can you ſay?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>As before. That it went for a truth amongſt us, and that is as much as I can ſay to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Was there not a large letter inviting your friends to union?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the other letter to be this you propound to me now.</p>

               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Now we ſpeak of a letter from Alderman <hi>Bunce,</hi> and others?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſpeak particularly to that; for I did not ſee them, but they were told me by one or other of thoſe that were of the correſpondency, and this is all I can ſay.</p>

               <p>What is the truth? Doe you conceive it is ſo?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we ſhall not trouble him with that, my Lord. Ask him one queſtion more, What did <hi>Mr. Love</hi> tell you, that if the Presbyterians got the upper hand again?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adams·</speaker>
               <p>Thoſe words, I think, did but amount to this, that if the Presbyterians were in armes again, by the bleſſing of God, the Cavaliering party might be prevented from getting the day.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I pray ask him, whether any of theſe pretended or ſuppoſed letters, were ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by me, any one of them, or that I writ one of them, or mended one of them.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that ever I ſaw him do any ſuch thing, nor did <hi>I</hi> ever ſee him write any.</p>

               <p>That I have ſaid.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Love.</speaker>
               <p>Ask him whether I gave my conſent to the ſending away of this he calls a commiſſion, and inſtructions, about the time of the Treaty at <hi>Bredah.</hi>

            <p>That there were many oaths abroad, and he could not tell what to ſay to them, and he deſired to be excuſed. The L. <hi>Preſ.</hi> told him that he could not be excuſed. <hi>M.

The Court ſtill preſiſted in it, that he muſt take his oath, and witneſſe what he knew; he anſwered, hee would ſpeak the truth of what he knew, as well as if he was under an oath: The Court told him, that that could not be, for if he did not ſwear, what he ſhould ſay, could not be received as any thing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of evidence. M. <hi>Jaquel</hi> ſtill perſiſted in his refuſall; when the Court ſaw he could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prevailed with, they fined him five hundred pounds for refuſing to ſwear; and Mr. <hi>Jaquel</hi> after he was withdrawn out of the Court, was called in again, and preſt to take his oath, and was told that the Court had fined him five hundred pounds for refuſing to ſwear, and again asked him whether he would ſwear. M. <hi>Jaquel</hi> then, when the oath was read to him, did not ſwear in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the other witneſſes did, but only put his hand to his buttons, and when Mr. <hi>Love</hi> asked him whether he was under an oath, he anſwered that he was as good as under an oath: but the Court not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied with that anſwer, preſt him further, and then hee did ſay, he was ſworn, and was under an oath.</p>

               <speaker>Iaquel.</speaker>
               <p>I did ſo, but I think <hi>Drake</hi> deſired it. I met him in <hi>Newgate</hi> market, and, ſaith he, I am going to ſee <hi>Titus,</hi> goe along with me; I ſaid, I never ſaw him, nor did I know him: ſayes he, You ſhall not ſtay at all: whereupon we went and found him in a Cheeſe-mongers houſe in <hi>New-gate</hi> market.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Jaquel.</speaker>
               <p>He ſaid, he was newly come out of <hi>Holland,</hi> and he had been with the King, and he was a man of excellent parts for his years, and that he was inclinable to what was good, but that he had ſuch deſperate evill Counſell about him; and that hee did much pity him, and that his Clergie eſpecially was wicked; and he propounded nothing to us, nor did I ever ſee his face afterwards, and this is about two years and a halfe ago; and for any other mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings at the Swan Taverne, or for any Agents, I never met him, or ſaw him.</p>

               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Doe you not remember at any meeting, that there was money propounded for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Titus,</hi> or for <hi>Alfords</hi> being ſent over to <hi>Calice</hi>? Speak what you know of that, and by whom it was told you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iaquel.</speaker>
               <p>Major <hi>Alford</hi> himſelfe told me he was to meet his ſon, and he went over upon that ſcore; but after he was gone, <hi>William Drake</hi> told me he was gone to ſee or meet Captaine <hi>Titus,</hi> I am not certaine of the words; and when he did come againe, which was the next time I heard of him, then <hi>William Drake</hi> comes to me, and deſired mee to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, for I think he went up and down to every man.</p>

               <p>There were ſome papers read, which <hi>Alford,</hi> as I take it, read, or <hi>William Drake,</hi> I am not certaine which; but read it was, of a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Titus</hi> came out of <hi>Ierſy,</hi> and had ſeen the King there, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, and that the King had a great inclination to agree with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, and that he was a man of excellent inclinations and parts, and had a great deſire to agree, but his Counſell, and wicked crew about him would not let him; and he ſaid, as I remember, that the King was a kind of a Priſoner with them there, and ſaid, his Counſell did hinder him, or elſe, if he were from them, hee would agree with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners.</p>

               <p>My Lord, let now Maſter <hi>Jaquel</hi> tell you what was the cauſe, why they did refuſe to do any thing in the Letter about Five thouſand pounds; what was the cauſe upon the debate between you at Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe? why you did refuſe to do any thing about the Five thouſand pounds?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jaquel.</speaker>
               <p>The debate was ſoon over; for we abſolutely refuſed it, we would not meddle in it, not liking the buſineſs; it was a trouble, <hi>I</hi> am confident, to them that heard it read.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I was there a little while after the death of the late King; I was going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cannon-ſtreet,</hi> and met with <hi>William Drake,</hi> he deſired me to go with him to the <hi>Swan</hi> at <hi>Dow-gate,</hi> I told him I had a little buſineſſe in <hi>Cannon-ſtreet,</hi> and I would be there by and by: I ſtaid about halfe an hour about my buſineſſe, and went then to the <hi>Swan</hi> at <hi>Dow-gate,</hi> and there was, to my beſt remembrance (for poſitively I cannot ſay) <hi>William Drake,</hi> and one a ſtranger, Major <hi>Huntington,</hi> and Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Bains,</hi> and there was one Captain <hi>Titus,</hi> as was ſaid, and Major <hi>Alford,</hi> and I do not remember who elſe were there. My Lord, at that time truly I was under a defect in my hearing, and ſince that <hi>I</hi> have loſt an ear, through a huge heat, and cold taken. But, my Lord, I not coming but to the middle of their diſcourſe they had, and not perfectly hearing, could not well judge of their diſcourſe, but afterwards I asked <hi>William Drake,</hi> what the intent of the meeting was? he told mee, that their intentions were to make ſome addreſſes or applications (ſome ſuch word it was) unto the Prince, and to take him off from his malignant or evill Counſell about him, and to put him upon ſuch as would be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter and better Counſellers; and this is the ſubſtance of what <hi>I</hi> then underſtood from <hi>Will. Drake.</hi> My Lord, J think, two or three dayes afterwards, I know not which, there was a meeting againe at the <hi>White Hart</hi> in <hi>Baſing-lane,</hi> and at the corner of <hi>Bread-ſtreet</hi>; there were, <hi>I</hi> think, moſt of them that <hi>I</hi> have named at the firſt meeting; I am ſure <hi>William Drake</hi> was there, and Captain <hi>Titus,</hi> and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel <hi>Bains,</hi> and Major <hi>Huntington, I</hi> cannot tell whether <hi>Mr. Alford</hi> was there or no, but theſe I am ſure were there; I did not come to the beginning of that meeting neither, the Paper had been read before I came in, to my beſt remembrance; but I asked <hi>William Drake</hi> what was the meaning of that meeting? he told me, it was to the ſame effect that they ſpake of before; and they had thoughts to ſend ſome body over to the Prince, to perſwade him from that condition; a while after J met with Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Bains,</hi> and truly, J did ask him more fully of the circumſtances of that meeting: he told me ſomething that they intended to make uſe of my Lord <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Jermin,</hi> and thoſe about the Prince, which hee diſliked. Truly, my Lord, it troubled me extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to think that they ſhould make uſe of ſuch ill inſtruments to perſwade the King, and J ſaid, J thought it was not well: And the next time J ſaid to <hi>William Drake,</hi> you have not done well, for it is not a chriſtian way we take to make uſe of ſuch men as theſe to perſwade with the King; for do you think that my Lord <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Jermin,</hi> and thoſe men will ever perſwade the King to leave themſelves, and their own Counſels? ſo he put me off, and from that time he was a little more ſhy of me. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he did ſecretly and cunningly get from me Ten pounds, and came under a pretence to ſupply a friend in neceſſity, and J ſaid to him, you have money of your own; ſaies he, J have not ſo much as J muſt needs ſupply him with, and he could not do it of himſelfe for fear it ſhould be miſſ'd. My Lord, J asked him what friend it was; nay, ſaith he, you can not know that, nor you cannot have it till he is in a condition. To tell you truly, he had been a good cuſtomer to me both for himſelf and friends, and J was loath to deny him it, ſuppoſing J ſhould have it again. J afterwards did not, to my beſt knowledg, meddle or make at any meeting, J was never at any of thoſe meetings after the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe at <hi>Baſing lane,</hi> becauſe J diſliked them; but afterwards J did ſuppoſe that this Ten pounds was for Captain <hi>Titus</hi>; for J did put it to him, and ſaid, J am afraid you did furniſh <hi>Titus</hi> with that Ten pounds: What then, ſaid he? Then J ſhall require it again of you: ſo he put me off, and run out of the Land. My Lord, for any other meetings, tranſactions or knowledge of any other thing from the time of the meeting in <hi>Baſing-lane,</hi> J know none. For the Priſoner at the bar, truly J do not remember, and J am confident J was never at his houſe in my life, nor changed one word with him.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Love.</speaker>
               <p>Ask him, whether <hi>I</hi> did not declare in the Company, when there was ſuch ſpeech of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionating, that it was an high act of preſumption for private perſons to commiſſionate any, and a notorious falſhood, to ſay it was an act of the Presbyterians, and whether did not <hi>I</hi> declare my ſelf againſt ſending the Commiſſion?</p>

               <p>J do not own any thing about concurring with any Commiſsion, but only diſ-avowing of it.

               <p>My Lord, I ſhall not trouble your Lordſhip, and the Court, to bring in at preſent any wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to teſtifie any thing that might invalidate that teſtimony that ſome have brought in againſt me; I love not to protract time, but I ſhould betray my own innocencie, ſhould <hi>I</hi> by my ſilence lie under all that charge and obloquie which is caſt upon me: and therefore, I deem it my dutie wherein I can, and as far as <hi>I</hi> am able, to expreſſe my ſelfe before your Lordſhip, and the Court; And therefore I humbly crave leave of your Lordſhip, and this Court, that I may make my defence for my life before you.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>I</hi> am denied counſel to plead for me in this Court, which is ſo juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a means for the preſervation of my life, yet my comfort is that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My Lord, You have granted me that favour, which the <hi>Romans</hi> did to <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might anſwer for himſelfe, concerning the crimes laid againſt him.</p>
               <p>In making my defence, I ſhall humbly crave leave to proceed in this method, To ſpeak ſomething firſt concerning the charge. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, concerning the witneſſes and their teſtimony. 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, ſome thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my ſelfe; and then Laſtly, ſome things humbly to propoſe to your Lordſhip, and the Court. Concerning my charge. Mr. <hi>Atturney General</hi> hath exhibited a charge againſt me conſiſting of two
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47192:30"/>
parts. Of high treaſon, and of other high crimes and offences. As touching the firſt, comparing the acts which the State hath made, with the actions which my ſelfe have done, I know not any perſonall act of mine, (proved againſt me) that renders me guilty, as to treaſon, by any publick act of your Lordſhips; And therefore I pleaded the generall iſſue, Not guilty, as to that.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond, my Counſell, having a general licenſe to come to me, and ſince having been with me; they have acquainted me that preſence with, or ſilence at what my accuſers have done, this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders me culpable by your acts. And therefore as to that, I ſhall humbly commit my ſelfe to your juſtice and mercy.</p>
               <p>Concerning Sir, the Charge laid againſt me, I can ſafely and truly ſay, <hi>I</hi> am charged with many things, which I ought not; being pretended to be done before the Act was publiſhed, which conſtitutes this Court; <hi>I</hi> am charged likewiſe therein with many things that I knew not, and with other things that I did not; and therefore dare not in conſcience lie under the obloquie of the whole charge. <hi>I</hi> do therefore in generall declare and proteſt againſt what is mentioned in the charge, touching the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of inſurrections, ſeditions, and rebellions; I may ſay in that regard as <hi>Jeremy</hi> did, I deſire not that wofull day, God he knows.</p>
               <p>To the other particulars, to wit, the confederation with <hi>Jermine, Piercy,</hi> and others in forraign parts, to raiſe forces, I anſwer, I diſlike the very mention of their names, or any concurrence with them in any practiſe of ſuch a nature; who are perſons, whoſe principles are ſo contrarient to religion and liberty.</p>
               <p>As touching the other particulars; to wit, a correſpondence with the Son of the late King, the Queen, <hi>Jermine,</hi> and <hi>Piercy,</hi> and others mentioned in the charge; I doe declare before you, that I never received letter from, nor ſent letter to any of them, nor had I any correſpondence with them.</p>
               <p>There are other things in the charge, to which all the depoſitions of the witneſſes doe not in the leaſt come up: And ſhould I by my ſilence, render my ſelfe obnoxious to the whole, you might judg me to be guilty of that which indeed I am not guilty of.</p>
               <p>I obſerve in reading the charge, that there are many things in it, which the witneſſes doe not in the leaſt ſpeak unto. For firſt, None of them ſwear, that ever I writ letter to the King, or to the Queen, his mother, or to <hi>Jermine, Piercy,</hi> or any other perſon named in the charge, or to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation, ſince the troubles began.</p>
               <p>Againe, None of the witneſſes ſwear, that ever I either deſired, or perſwaded, or directed any perſon to write any letter to any perſons, whoſe names are mentioned in the charge; or to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in, or of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation; Nor do any of them ſwear, that ever any letter was written in my houſe: but that onely letters ſuppoſed to be come from, or ſent to the <hi>Scots,</hi> were read there, which I do not deny. Again, None of them ſwear, that ever I did ſo much as read a letter in my houſe, or other where, that was pretended to come from the <hi>Scots,</hi> or pretended to bee ſent into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Further, None ſwear that ever <hi>I</hi> gave my expreſſe and particular aſſent to the ſending away of any letter. And none ſwear, that ever I collected one peny of money, either for the King, or the <hi>Scots,</hi> or any perſon in <hi>Scotland.</hi> That which is affirmed by one teſtimony, to wit, by <hi>Alford,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for money, I ſhall anſwer when <hi>I</hi> come to it. Again, None of the witneſſes prove, that ever <hi>I</hi> invited any perſon, or forraigne forces, to invade the Nations of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which yet is laid expreſly to my charge, in the charge read againſt me: None likewiſe prove, that ever J plotted, contrived, or endeavoured to raiſe forces, tumults, or inſurrections within this Nation, againſt the preſent Government. None ſwear, that J was a correſpondent; Jndeed <hi>Adams</hi> in his teſtimony had theſe words, (which both the Notarie and my ſelfe took,) that he took me to be a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: but when J had your Lordſhips, and the Courts leave to put this queſtion to him; Whether upon oath he would affirm J was one? His anſwer was, that he could not poſitively ſay J was ſo, but he ſaid, he did conceive J was a correſpondent, but did not ſay J was ſo. So that Sir, as to theſe particlars, there are none of the eight witneſſes, (neither the ſeaven, that have been ſworn, nor yet Maſter <hi>Jaquel,</hi> whom J doe not take to be under an oath,) that doe charge any of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars upon me.</p>
               <p>J have a word alſo to ſpeak concerning the witneſſes, who are my accuſers, and J might ſay, there is an incompetency in them, as to their number. There are many particulars ſworn againſt me, to which but one witneſſe hath ſworn to one fact; and this J ſhall humbly offer to your Lordſhips
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47192:30"/>
and the Courts conſideration. J might alledge alſo an incompetencie, as to their quality, they are not onely perſons accuſed of treaſon, and ſo are not to be believed, but they have made an open confeſſion of that which is treaſon by your Act, and ſo are not <hi>legales teſtes.</hi> They have done that by an open confeſſion, which as J am informed, is equivalent to a conviction; they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, ſending of letters, receiving of letters, and lending of money. But they have proved none of theſe things againſt me. Now they having both given it under their hands, and alſo publickly declared that they have done theſe things, I cannot judge them competent witneſſes againſt me; but this I muſt leave to the Courts conſideration.</p>
               <p>Sir, Concerning the incompetency of their number, To that wherein two witneſſes doe concurre, I am concluded. And wherein they have teſtified any thing true, I would not deny it for all the world, and wherein they agree in their teſtimony in a truth, therein I will be candid, and ingenuous to acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Though the Charge be long, and my time but ſhort, and the depoſitions many ſheets of paper, (and truely I could hardly read them over, till late laſt night) yet through the good hand of God upon me, I ſhall labour to make as plaine and clear a defence as God ſhall enable me.</p>
               <p>Sir, In reading over the charge, I obſerve, that thoſe things which ſeem moſt criminall againſt me, are ſworn to, but by ſingle teſtimony, and I will mention with your Lordſhips leave a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Touching the letters, ſaid to be from <hi>Titus,</hi> the effect of it being as was ſaid, to deſire ſome to come over to <hi>Calice,</hi> that he might give them information touching affaires at <hi>Jersey,</hi> none but <hi>Far</hi> ſwears that, this letter was read in my houſe. The other witneſſes, ſome ſay, it was read in one place, and ſome in another; <hi>Alford,</hi> I remember, he ſayes, he heard it from <hi>William Drake,</hi> and <hi>Adams</hi> ſayes, it was read in <hi>William Drakes</hi> houſe, but none but <hi>Far</hi> ſwears it was read in my houſe. There is likewiſe none but <hi>Far</hi> ſwears, that Major <hi>Alford</hi> was deſired in my houſe to go to <hi>Calice</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> neither <hi>Jaquel,</hi> nor <hi>Potter,</hi> nor <hi>Alford,</hi> nor <hi>Adams,</hi> nor any of the reſt lay this to my charge; it is onely <hi>Far,</hi> that layes this to my charge, and he doth it moſt untruly, which I will make out unto you by an undeniable demonſtration.</p>
               <p>He ſays, that at a meeting at my houſe, the company did deſire Major <hi>Alford</hi> to go to <hi>Calice.</hi> Now if your Lordſhip obſerves <hi>Alfords</hi> teſtimony, he tels you upon oath, that he was never in my houſe, till after he came from <hi>Calice,</hi> nor ever ſpake with me in my life, till after he came from <hi>Calice,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be deſired in my houſe to go to <hi>Calice.</hi> So that Sir, <hi>I</hi> will not lay it upon the badneſſe of <hi>Far's</hi> conſcience, but upon the badneſſe of his memory. I do not think he is ſuch an Atheiſt, to ſwear fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly deliberately, but being ask'd ſo many queſtions as he was, for he was ask'd fourſcore and eighteen queſtions by Mr. <hi>Atturney,</hi> and ſome of the Court, he might eaſily ſay, he knew not what.</p>
               <p>And <hi>I</hi> ſaw the man was confounded, and it was hinted to him what to ſay, by the help of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and examinations taken from him in private, and ſhewed to him in publick; ſo that Sir, <hi>I</hi> ſaw the man under a temptation. I was loth to mention this then, though I knew his teſtimony herein to be be falſe, becauſe I would not anticipate my laſt anſwer.</p>
               <p>A 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> particular charged upon me by one witneſſe onely is a copie of a letter, (not the Originall, none ſwears that) that <hi>Alford</hi> received from <hi>Titus,</hi> and he told him, it was a copie of a letter from the King. Now <hi>Far</hi> he ſwears that the ſubſtance of the letter was to deſire Commiſsioners to bee ſent over to <hi>Bredah,</hi> at the Treaty there; now <hi>Alford,</hi> who pretended to receive this letter from <hi>Titus,</hi> being ask'd the queſtion, he ſwears that there was no ſuch thing in the letter, that he knew of. Now truely, if any did know the contents of that copie of a letter, it muſt be <hi>Alford,</hi> who brought it over; I beſeech your Lordſhip therefore to conſider it, and though the charge againſt me be very high, and my condition very low, and the oppoſition againſt me very great, yet I hope I am in the hands of mercifull and juſt men, and that wherein you ſee but ſingle teſtimonies, that therein you would be very tender in proceeding to a ſentence againſt me upon thoſe teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>Again, in the next place, <hi>I</hi> obſerve a ſingle teſtimony only in another buſineſſe, and that is Major <hi>Alford</hi>; none but he of all the witneſſes, did ſwear that it was agreed upon among us, that is, at my houſe, That a commiſsion, and inſtructions ſhould be ſent over to the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham, Maſſey, Titus,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Bunce</hi>; none, I ſay, but <hi>Alford</hi> ſwore this; <hi>Adams</hi> indeed, ſwore that there was a motion that this ſhould be, and <hi>Huntington</hi> ſwore this, that Mr. <hi>Love</hi> ſhould ſay, Come, come, let it go, (to which I ſhall anſwer when <hi>I</hi> come to it.) But <hi>Far</hi> ſaid expreſly, three times in Court, being
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47192:31"/>
upon oath alſo, That all the Company were againſt ſending away the Commiſsion: And <hi>Alford</hi> he onely ſwears, that the Commiſsion was agreed upon.</p>
               <p>I hope your Lordſhip, and the Court, will judge which of theſe to believe, and for <hi>Alfords</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that it was agreed upon among us, <hi>I</hi> am ſure, if he had any conſcience, he could not ſay that <hi>I</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to it. I will not deny (now witneſſes have proved it) but that I was preſent. But I did expreſſe my ſelfe againſt the Commiſsion and inſtructions, as being an act of high preſumption, for private perſons to ſend commiſsions and inſtructions; and as being an act of notorious falſhood, that it ſhould run in the name of the Presbyterian partie; when none did know any thing of it, that I know of, but onely thoſe that were then in the room; and <hi>I</hi> beſeech your Lordſhip, and the Court, to conſider that this is not onely a ſingle teſtimony, but that it is ſaid to be done in the year 1649. a great while ago, my Lord: And ſo the buſineſſe of <hi>Titus,</hi> if it had been true, was done ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that; ſo that Sir, it being done before the Act of the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1650. which conſtitutes this Court, herein <hi>I</hi> hope it will not be deemed criminall, if I had agreed to, and approved of the Commiſsion, which I never did. Another particular, to which <hi>I</hi> obſerve, there is but a ſingle teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which is <hi>Alford</hi> alſo; he ſwore, that at a meeting at my houſe, I moved for contribution of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Titus</hi>: None ſwore this, but onely he, <hi>Adams</hi> ſwore, I took pen and ink in my hand, but he knowes not what I writ: others ſwore that I was ſometimes preſent at the meeting, but none but <hi>Alford</hi> ſwore that I moved at a meeting for contribution of money. Now Sir, as to that it is but a ſingle teſtimony; and if it were true, I do not deem it comes under the Act, becauſe the Act (of which <hi>I</hi> was ignorant, till the day I heard it here in Court) of the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1650, That Act doth adjudge this to be treaſon, to wit, <hi>The ſending, or cauſing to be ſent money, horſes, or armes, into Scotland.</hi> Now Sir, if it had been true, which this witneſſe depoſeth, That I at a meeting did move<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for money, yet he proves not againſt me, that ever I received or ſent away a penny; and if <hi>I</hi> had moved it, that had neither been a ſending away of money into <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor a cauſing of money to be ſent away; and ſo brings me not as to treaſon under your act.</p>
               <p>Another thing, unto which onely a particular witneſſe ſwore; to wit, <hi>Far,</hi> is, that I moved him particularly to contribute money; he chargeth not this at a meeting, as <hi>Alford</hi> doth; for he ſayes, he came in late, but ſaith that it was a perſonall motion to him alone; and he doth not ſay, that I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him for money, for <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> but that I onely ask'd him this queſtion, Captain <hi>Far,</hi> what will you do? And if your Lordſhip conſider it, and that your Notaries have taken right, you ſhall find that to be his anſwer, which I ſhall anſwer when I come to it; and thereupon he confeſſes, he brought five pounds to my houſe, but he doth not tell you that I received it, and God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I never ſaw it, nor received it, nor did I give any directions about it; but as <hi>Far</hi> was going out of the Court, he named Captain <hi>Maſſey,</hi> the perſon which hee thought received the money; for which hee was rebuked by ſome that were by him, that ſo the greater <hi>odium</hi> might lie upon me; as if becauſe the money being brought to my houſe, I muſt needs therefore receive it; his name, as I am informed, that rebuk'd him for declaring, who received it, is Captain <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>; ſo that they would inſinuate into your breaſts, who are my judges (who I hope will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious) That it was I that received the money, when the witneſſe meant honeſtly, that another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it; but if I had received it, or moved for it, yet he is but a ſingle teſtimony to that particular. Again, in reading the depoſitions, I take notice that there is onely a ſingle teſtimony to thoſe words; (upon the reading; reading I cannot ſay, for I never read it; upon the hearing ſome papers read, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a commiſsion) that <hi>Huntington</hi> ſwore, that I ſhould ſay, <hi>Come, come, let it go.</hi> Thoſe were his words; but the other who were there preſent, two or three of them being ask'd whether they heard me ſpeak ſuch words, they all of them denied that they heard any ſuch words. Now truely, this <hi>Huntington</hi> is a man whoſe face I never ſaw before that day, nor ſince, till I ſaw him here in the Court; and if <hi>I</hi> had known that a buſineſſe of any dangerous nature had been come to my houſe, which <hi>I</hi> did not; (for <hi>I</hi> knew no more of it, then any here preſent, before <hi>Drake</hi> took the papers out of his pocket, which <hi>Huntington</hi> confeſſes were written in characters, and read by <hi>Drake,</hi>) I ſhould have been accounted a very indiſcreet man, to ſpeak any ſuch words in the preſence of a man whoſe face <hi>I</hi> never ſaw before. And for thoſe words, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Come, come, let it go. I</hi> hope your Lordſhip, and the Court, will be ſatisfied, that <hi>I</hi> never ſpake any ſuch words; as to the commiſsion and inſtructions, for then <hi>I</hi> ſhould have contradicted my ſelf in one breath. For at the ſame time, <hi>I</hi> had ſpoke againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:47192:31"/>Again, I obſerve in the depoſitions, None but <hi>Adams</hi> affirms that there was a Letter, which ſayes he; <hi>was declared to be directed to the Generall Aſſembly of Scotland.</hi> He doth not ſwear it was directed to the General Aſſembly, but that it was declared to be ſo, and ſo ſwears by hear ſay: None but he (I ſay) affirmes upon oath, that at my houſe there was a Letter read which was declared to be directed to the General Aſſembly. And he ſays further, He thought this Letter was pend by Maſter <hi>Love,</hi> or D. <hi>Drake.</hi> But I beſeech your Lordſhip and the Court to conſider by what reaſon he did conceive this, and <hi>I</hi> hope your Lordſhip will diſtinguiſh between a poſitive aſſertion, and a conjectural ſuppoſition. For being ask'd why he conceived ſo? I conceive ſo, ſays he, becauſe of the language of it; as if he that never ſaw any Letter of mine, to know that poor and low ſtile I write in, ſhould conceive that either I, or that other Gentlemen named, ſhould pen that Letter, meerly becauſe of the language of it; it being (he ſaid) in order to promote the ends of the Covenant. I hope the Court will judge of the inſufficiency of this evidence; and were it never ſo clear, yet as to that particular, it is but one teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Again, None but <hi>Adams</hi> ſware concerning a large Letter, that for my part I never knew of, till the day he affirmed it here in Court. A large letter, he ſayes, in the Nature of a declaration, pend as he thought, by Maſter <hi>Love,</hi> or Doctor <hi>Drake,</hi> wherein it ſhould be ſaid, that they could not ſend mony, till the Scots did appear more conſiderable, and grew nearer to Action. Yet he confeſſes he had no ground to ſay, Maſter <hi>Love</hi> pend it. And indeed, he had not. But Sir, as for this letter, though I durſt not for a world deny any thing which I know to be true; Yet God is my record<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to any knowledg, I never ſo much as heard any mention of it. And as for theſe words he ſpeaks of to be in the Letter, I know nothing at all of them. Nor did <hi>I</hi> ever hear them, as I know of, till <hi>I</hi> heard him affirm them here in Court.</p>
               <p>But if it had been ſo, yet he is but a ſingle teſtimony, and <hi>I</hi> beſeech your Lordſhip to conſider that he ſays it was to this effect, or this was the ſubſtance of it. Now <hi>I</hi> hope, ſo many Grave Judges and Lawyers that ſit upon my life, and ſo many conſcientious men, will be tender of a mans bloud, when a man ſhall come in with evidence, and ſhall ſhew neither my hand, nor the letter, nor the Originall, neither copy, nor tranſcript, nor any thing but the vain rovings of a mans memory in things ſpoken or done ſo long ago: And that a man ſhall come in againſt a mans life, and ſhall only ſay, that this was the ſumm or ſubſtance of it, or it was to this effect: And <hi>I</hi> being a Divine, <hi>I</hi> ſhal not ſpeak as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Law, that this is inſufficient teſtimony, but as a Scholer, and one that ſtudies the Scriptures, <hi>I</hi> ſhall obſerve one memorable inſtance that pleads my juſtification in this particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they are the words of Chriſt; Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Deſtroy ye this Temple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it up</hi>: Now the Scripture in <hi>Mark,</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>I beſeech your Lordſhip to conſider, that in this teſtimony of the falſe witneſſes againſt Chriſt, there is only the variation of a word, and the addition of a letter; there is the addition of a letter, <hi>I,</hi> and the alteration of the word ye for will, (there's all) for Chriſt did not ſay <hi>I</hi> will deſtroy, but, deſtroy ye, and yet the Scripture takes notice of it, that this addition of a letter, and alteration of a word, brought his accuſers under a falſe teſtimony; though they ſpake according to their intention, for they did verily beleeve he ſpake of the Temple, for they ſaid, Forty years was it in building. So that <hi>I</hi> beſeech you be tender in matters of blood; <hi>I</hi> know you who are skilfull in the law do know that the proof of treaſon muſt be as cleer as the Sun, <hi>Probationes opportent eſſe luce clariores.</hi> Now when a man ſhal come againſt a mans life, and cannot ſhew any letter that ever he wrote, or that ever he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; but ſhall only ſwear it was to this effect or to this purpoſe, or <hi>I</hi> beleeve this was the ſubſtance of it, <hi>I</hi> hope you are ſo wiſe and conſciencious, that you will paſſe no judgement upon this conjecturall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Another particular, to which only one witneſſe teſtifies; and that is <hi>Adams,</hi> he ſwears that <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay, that if the Presbyterians were in Armes, by the bleſsing of God, malignants might bee prevented from getting the Day. Truly, I do not know what crime is in theſe words, but as they may be wreſted. But Sir, I do remember that this <hi>Adams</hi> hath often come to my houſe; he ſaid, ſeven or eight times; he might have ſaid, ſeven and twenty times: for he hath come ſome times once or twice a week to my houſe, to tempt me (as I now perceive) and hath offered me mony: and would ask mee whether I knew any thing for a publick uſe that might require money. And though I never ſuſpected him, yet ſo free am I from maintaining correſpondencie, or from having intelligence, or contributing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47192:32"/>
of money to maintain a war, That I never received one peny of him in my life, though I have been moved to it by him: But I remember, of late eſpecially, about a quarter of a yeer before I was in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hee would come once or twice a week to my houſe, and he pretended that he was wrought upon by me, and that I had turned him from his malignant principles; for he was very violent for <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> which I was, and to this day am againſt; and I did labour to poſſeſſe him what a miſchievous deſign that was: And ſo he pretended to be turned to my principles, and upon this got ſome room in my affections; but theſe words were not above a fortnight before I was committed to priſon: and I remember, the occaſion of them was this; I was bewailing the great alienation and difference that there was between the Presbyterian and Independent partie (though I do not love names of diſtinction) and indeed, thus I ſaid, That if the godly party, that are now diſunited and disjoyned, both of the diſſenting and the Presbyterian way, were in arms, there were no hopes that ever the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants ſhould get the day. And God is my record, I ſpake nothing to him but to this purpoſe. And thus through the good hand of God upon me, I have ſpoken to what I obſerve in reading the Depoſitions, wherein I finde but ſingle teſtimonies againſt me.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now crave leave (which is the main of my work) to run over the Depoſitions as briefly as I can; for I ſhall not trouble you with large Speeches: but being the Depoſitions were large, and the Witneſſes many, your Lordſhip and the Court (I hope) will bear with me with the more patience, if I ſpeak more largely in it.

                  </gap> was ask'd about me, to which he ſpake but conjecturally; <hi>As he thought,</hi> and <hi>as he beleeved,</hi> and <hi>as he conceived.</hi> And when papers by M <hi>Att. Gen,</hi> of his Examination were tendred to him, he anſwered, that <hi>then he had a latitude to ſpeake more then he durſt affirm upon Oath.</hi> And upon this I ſhall humbly crave leave that I may make this motion to you, That you would not, in paſſing judgment upon me, hearken to any private examinations, which are extrajudicial to be brought in Court againſt me; for moſt of the Witneſſes had their private Examinations ſhewed them in Court, and were read to them, and they did not ſpeak in their relations of what they knew, but what they conceived; and when they could not tell what to ſay, then their Examinations were produced to direct them; and I hope your Lordſhip and the Court will take notice of this. And herein I cannot but acknowledg the juſtice of this Court in this particular, That you would not receive private examinations till they came face to face, that <hi>I</hi> might anſwer to the crimes laid againſt me.</p>
               <p>But as to his Teſtimony, I ſhall not run over things that touch me not, <hi>I</hi> muſt not flatter my ſelf to paſſe over things that concern me. For <hi>I</hi> know it will be look'd upon with more prying eyes then mine are. There are onely two things in his teſtimony that concerns me. He ſpeaks not of any meetings at my houſe that he knows of; he ſpeaks not of any money that ever J lent him or gave him, though there was a narrow and exact examination of him in thoſe particulars. But two things concern me in his Depoſition: The one is, that he received a letter with a great L upon it, from one Colonel <hi>Bamfield,</hi> which was a Narrative of the Affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which letter, with two more incloſed from my Lord of <hi>Argile, Lowden</hi> and <hi>Louthain,</hi> He ſaid, he brought them to <hi>Mr. Loves</hi>; and herein J might take notice, that he forgot himſelf a little, for he might have ſaid, that he brought them firſt to <hi>Mr. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quels</hi>; for <hi>Jaquel</hi> did affirm in Court, that <hi>Potter</hi> brought the letters to him, and ſpake to him to come to me. The ſubſtance of the letters from the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> and the reſt, he ſayes, were to move for ten thouſand pound; and (as J remember, <hi>Jaquel</hi> ſayes, for five thouſand pound: But <hi>Potter</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits me in this matter; for he doth not ſwear the letter was to me, nor could he ſwear it juſtly; nay, he ſwears, he did not think it was to me. And as for this <hi>Bamfield,</hi> he is a man whoſe face J never ſaw to this day. And he ſwears, (and indeed, he had been injurious if he had not told you thus) that when he came into <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> houſe, he ſaid, <hi>Mr.</hi> Love, I <hi>have news to ſhew you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>This paſſage of C.</hi> Potters, <hi>[Mr. Love, I have news to ſhew you] was through ſome miſtake left out of his Depoſitions.</hi>
                  </note> And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe things be aggravated againſt me by the inſinuations of men, and by rigid inferences and collections, this will be the worſt charged upon me, That there were ſeverall meetings at my houſe, and ſeverall letters read there; which J do not deny: But Sir, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, that he ſaid, [<hi>Mr.</hi> Love, <hi>I have news to ſhow you</hi>;] and that he opened ſome of the letters, and that ſome were not opened when he brought them: But neither he nor <hi>Jaquel</hi> ſwears, That J opened them. And he tells you, that he carried the letters away with him. And he ſwears further, that both my ſelf, and all that were there preſent did manifeſt an utter diſlike and deteſtation of thoſe letters. But herein
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47192:32"/>
J know what will be laid to my charge. Jt will be ſaid, why did not Mr <hi>Love</hi> reveale them? Truly to this J do ingenuouſly ſay, That J did conceive, by reading of the Act that conſtitutes this Court, That theſe onely were bound to reveale, that did receive them; and not that J was bound to reveal that which another man received. But herein J am better informed by my councel, and they tell me, That pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with, or ſilence at what others do, makes it a criminall fact in me, if the matter of the Letter be criminal and treaſonable by your Acts; and therefore in this, that J did not diſcover them, J ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg your favour.</p>
               <p>The next thing in <hi>Potters</hi> Teſtimony that toucheth me, is, He ſwears that he heard of a Propoſition for raiſing of 400 l. for <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Maſſey</hi>: But he varies from the others; <hi>Alford</hi> ſaid, 2 or 300 l. and <hi>Far</hi> ſaid, 250 or 300 l. and <hi>Potter</hi> ſaith, 400 l. But he ſaith he was not preſent when the propoſition was made, and therefore he cannot ſpeak as to that. But yet ſaith he, <hi>J brought ten pounds to Mr</hi> Love's <hi>houſe, and there left it</hi> (five or ſix perſons more being in the room.) Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi> was pleas'd to ask him whether he did not give me a twitch by the hand or cloak when he brought it? <hi>Potter,</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, denyes that he did ſo, and I do not remember that ever he did it, nor do I remember that ever he laid penny of money down in my houſe. And I tell it you in the preſence of God, I never ſaw it, nor received it to this very day. But Sir, if he had given me a twitch, which is intended as an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation againſt me, I hope a Judicatory will not proceed upon ſo ſilent a thing as that is. Though <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>There is a teaching with the fingers,</hi> yet that is ſo ſilent a thing, that a court of Judicatory cannot take notice of it, unleſſe it be manifeſt and apparent by ſome act.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.13</note> And therefore ſeeing he doth not affirm that I ſaw the money laid down, or that I received the money, or directed or ordered him to come to my houſe with any money, I hope you will not lay that to my charge. And thus I have done as to that particular.</p>
               <p>There is onely one thing more in order to the letters he was examined about. He was ask'd what anſwer was returned to thoſe letters that he received from <hi>Bamfield,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and the reſt, that he ſhewed <hi>Mr. Love.</hi> To that he gave this account, That a letter was left at his ſhop, which he thought (he ſaid) came from Mr. <hi>Love</hi> or Doctor <hi>Drake.</hi> Now Sir, for my part, I declare in the preſence of God, That I never in all my life, either wrote or ſent, or left Letter at his ſhop: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, I am not to plead an other mans cauſe, yet I believe, that godly Miniſter he mentions, will clear himſelf alſo; but I muſt onely ſpeak to my own defence. For my part, I never in my life, ſent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his ſhop, written to thoſe perſons: And he onely ſwears, That he thought the Letter left in his ſhop, came from me or Doctor <hi>Drake:</hi> But how could he know from whom it came, or what was the matter of it? And if it had come from either of us, which he did not affirm, yet he doth not ſay he opened the Letter, and ſo could not tell the Contents of it, that it was an Anſwer to the ſuppoſed Letters he ſhewed me. I have onely one thing to obſerve in his whole Teſtimony, and that is, That he confeſſes until he had a ſight of other mens Examinations in private; to wit, Of <hi>Alfords</hi> and <hi>Adams,</hi> the things did not come to his remembrance, or words to that effect, he hath in his depoſitions; and that there were ſome things, to which he could not ſpeak exactly, till he firſt ſaw ſome Informations; and that Maſter <hi>Attorney General</hi> did ſhew him ſome Informations, and that did bring things to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; and that before Captain <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> did prompt him and remember him, he had forgot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that Sir, J beſeech you conſider, whether this be a clear and good Teſtimony in Law, That when a man hath forgot a thing done ſo long ago, he ſhall through the Examinations of others, have his memory rub'd up, and then ſhall come here in a publike Court, to teſtifie this againſt a mans life.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is Major <hi>Alford,</hi> He gives you a large Relation about ſending <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and of a 100 l. given him for his journey, and of Letters to the Queen, and <hi>Jermine,</hi> and <hi>Percy.</hi> My Lord, J am as ignorant of all theſe things, as the childe unborn, and did never know that <hi>Titus</hi> was gone or ſent to <hi>Jerſey,</hi> by any perſon, till a long time after J heard he was there, and till J heard of his name in the <hi>Diurnals,</hi> That he was an Agent for ſome Presbyterians; till then, God is my Record, J knew nothing of that; and J need not ſpeak to this, but becauſe this was part of my Charge, and brought in to the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many may imagine, as if J were guilty upon the whole matter; but that which concerns me, is this. He affirms that the Commiſſion and Inſtructions were agreed upon, at my Houſe, to ſend to ſome perſons; To wit, My Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham, Maſſey, Titus,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Bunce,</hi> to Treat at <hi>Bredah</hi>; and this to be in the behalf of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:47192:33"/>Now Sir, I ſhall humbly crave leave to offer, wherein this Teſtimony is not onely diſagreeing with the Teſtimony of others of the Witneſſes, but even to his own Teſtimony alſo: For here he ſays, it was agreed upon at Maſter <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, and in three leaves after, he ſays, It is true, there was a Commiſſion and Inſtructions read at Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe; but whether they were agreed upon there or no, ſaith he, I know not: I do not ſay, he hath a bad conſcience, but ſure I am, he hath a bad memory. He diſagrees with the witneſſes alſo; for <hi>Far</hi> did expreſly affirm upon Oath, That all the company was againſt ſending them away; and therefore, for <hi>Alford</hi> to ſay it was agreed upon among us, in that I am ſure he doth not ſpeak truly. Another thing which <hi>Alford</hi> layes to my charge, is about a Letter, which after <hi>Dunbar</hi> fight ſhould come from <hi>Maſſey,</hi> wherein he ſhould write for Money, and for Arms, by the way of <hi>Holland</hi>; and he ſwears, this Letter was read in my houſe, and ſays, That upon the reading of it, I did move for the contribution of Money to be raiſed for the ſupply of <hi>Titus.</hi> Now before I anſwer to that, though I am not in a condition to retort, yet I ſhall humbly crave leave without offence to Mr. <hi>Attorney General,</hi> to intreat the Court to take notice of this one thing: Maſter <hi>Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General,</hi> when the witneſs had ſpake theſe words, did pray your Lordſhip and the Court to obſerve, That <hi>Maſſey</hi> wrote for Arms, and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> moved for Money; as if he would inſinuate to the Court, that he writing for Arms, and I moving for Money, that my moving for Money was to buy Arms: Now <hi>Alford</hi> upon oath did declare, That every man there was againſt Arms, and he onely ſaid, That the motion for Money, was to ſupply the Perſonal neceſſities of <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who were in want: So that I intreat you to conſider it, that that Inſinuation of Mr. <hi>Attorney General,</hi> might not be aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated againſt mee, and that a bad inference might not be drawn from it, as if hee writing for Arms, and I moving for Money, That that Money ſhould be to buy Arms; which is contrary to Major <hi>Alfords</hi> Oath. Againe, another inſinuation of M <hi>Atturney General</hi> is this, He prayed your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and the Court, to conſider, That I moved for three hundred pounds. Now this is contrary to <hi>Alfords</hi> oath; for <hi>Alford</hi> hath theſe words, Mr. <hi>Love did move for the contribution of money, but there was no ſumm ſpoken of.</hi> Now when he ſhall affirm, that there was onely a motion for money, but no ſum ſpoken of; Shall this be laid to my charge, as if I moved for 300 l.? Therefore I intreat you, that thoſe Inſinuations and Aggravations of Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> may not be laid upon me; and that ye would take no notice of any private Examinations, nor yet of any Aggravations of thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of State; but upon the plain depoſition of the Witneſſes, and according to their teſtimony and your conſciences, I muſt ſtand or fall. <hi>Alford</hi> ſaid further, That after he came from <hi>Titus,</hi> he gave an account of a Narrative, and of a Copy of a Letter from the King of <hi>Scots</hi>; what he might bring, I know not; and if he did, I never deſired him, either to go to <hi>Calice,</hi> or to come to my houſe: For I never ſpake with him (as I remember) till after he came from <hi>Calice,</hi> nor till the time, he ſays, the Letter and Narrative was read in my houſe: Now Sir, he onely ſays it was a Copy of a Letter (not the original). <hi>That</hi> Titus (ſaith he) <hi>did ſhow me a Copy of a Letter, at leaſtwiſe, which he ſaid was from the King to the Presbyterian Party.</hi> So that this which is the Foundation of the reſt of the teſtimony, is onely this, That the Copy of the Letter was read at my houſe, and that it was a Copy of the Kings Letter: This he affirms onely, upon hear-ſay, for he ſays, <hi>Titus</hi> told him ſo; But who can ſwear, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Titus</hi> had the original Letter, or that this was a true copy; nay, might it not be a fictitious thing, either of <hi>Titus</hi> or of this man, as may well be ſuſpected: So that they that receive Letters, if that be Treaſon, and thoſe that write Letters, and ſend money, if they be Traytors; yet they have proved none of theſe againſt me, and yet I onely am Araigned, and they in hope of Favor.</p>
               <p>Again, I deſire the Court to take notice, though Captain <hi>Far</hi> ſays there was this Clauſe in the copy of the Letter from the King, <hi>To ſend Commiſſioners to Bredah</hi>; (and yet he overthrew his oath afterwards: For ſays he, It is ſo long ago, that <hi>I</hi> cannot remember it; but I ſhall ſpeak to that when I come to it:) Yet <hi>Alford</hi> that brought this Letter, affirms, That he did not know it was to deſire Commiſſioners to be ſent; and if it had been ſo, I ſhould never have done it, and never did it: At that time I was in my Study, J do not deny it, but when <hi>Drake</hi> read the Commiſſion, J did declare my diſlike of it, and deteſtation againſt it; and ſo did (as <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> affirmed) either moſt or all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: And if any ſuch thing were ſent, God is my Record, J did neither know of the writing of it, (other then in Characters) nor of the contriving of it, nor yet of the ſending it away, till J heard <hi>Alford</hi> confeſs in the Court, that he carried this Commiſſion to <hi>Graveſend</hi> to one <hi>Maſon,</hi> a man whoſe name J never heard of, before J was in trouble: and if J had written and conſented to it, yet it was in the year, One thouſand ſix hundred forty and nine, as Major <hi>Huntington</hi> ſwore; and therefore
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47192:33"/>
was before the time that your Act could take hold of me, if J had concurred to it, which J never did. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he inſiſteth upon it, that I moved for a contribution. Now herein, I beſeech your Lordſhip, that I may offer theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This is but the ſingle Teſtimony of one man, and by the Law of God, and of the Land, a man muſt not die, but under the teſtimony of two or three witneſſes, in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. and 15. <hi>One witneſs ſhall not riſe up againſt a man for any iniquity, or for any ſin in any ſin that he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: At the mouth of two witneſſes, or at the mouth of three witneſſes, ſhall the matter be eſtabliſhed.</hi> And leaſt this might be thought to be a Judicial Law, pertaining onely to the Jewiſh State; it is therefore quoted four times in the New Teſtament; by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. by <hi>Paul,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. and in two other places; as noting it to be a Law of Moral equity, That no mans life ſhould be taken away, but by expreſs and clear Teſtimony of two ſufficient witneſſes. Now in this that may ſeem moſt to pinch upon me, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould move for Money, there is but one witneſs; and it is, as I am informed, contrary to the Laws of the Land, and the Statute of the firſt of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, which provideth, That no man ſhall be Indited, Araigned, and Convicted for Treaſon, but by two lawful and ſufficient witneſſes; and therefore I beſeech your Lordſhip, and the Court, That you would be tender in thoſe things, wherein you finde but one witneſs ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>The other thing which I ſhall ſay to this point, about moving for Money, is, That I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Act doth forbid relieving perſons in Arms: but now no perſon can be relieved by a bare moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is not the motion, but the having the Money moved for, before the perſon in Arms can be ſaid to be relieved; and if it were true, yet it is not proved, That thoſe perſons were then in Arms: The other Act of the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I conceive, gives me relief if <hi>I</hi> had moved for Money; For it judges thoſe onely to be guilty of Treaſon, That ſhall either ſend or cauſe to be ſent, Money, Horſe, Arms, and Ammunition into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now Sir, if I had in a meeting moved for Money, yet he tells you not for how much I moved for, for ought he knows it might be but for ſix pence, for he cannot ſwear to it; and I hope, when the ſum is not ſpoken off, you will be very tender. Yet this comes not under your Act, either to be a ſending of Money into <hi>Scotland,</hi> or a cauſing of it to be ſent, which is not in the leaſt faſtned upon me: When I askt him (though he ſwore I moved for Money) whether I contributed any Money my ſelf, to that he anſwered, He could not ſay I did; nor could any of the eight witneſſes that came in againſt me. And thus I have done as to his Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>The third Witneſs is Major <hi>Huntington,</hi> and he affirms, That in the year One thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty and nine, one askt him to go to my houſe, and told him there was ſome there at Prayer, and that he might there hear ſome news; and that he ſpake upon hear-ſay: but then he ſpake upon oath, <hi>And when I came there, Prayer was done.</hi> Now for a man to be ſo poſitive in the firſt entrance of his Teſtimony, as to ſay Prayer was done, when he could not know that there was any Prayer there at all, (for when he came, it ſeems there was no Prayer, and how then could he know there was any Prayer there at that time?) This at the very firſt entrance of his evidence, I ſuppoſe might be a juſt ground to ſuſpect his whole Teſtimony; but as for the man, I knew him not, I never ſaw him, as I ſaid, before that time, nor ſince, till <hi>I</hi> ſaw him here in Court. This man affirms, That <hi>William Drake</hi> read in Characters, that which he called a Commiſſion, and ſaid, That he had command from the King, to ſend this Commiſſion away, which God is my Record, I never heard, nor ever knew of it; and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> that brought over the Letter, in which <hi>Far</hi> ſwore thoſe words were, he himſelf denies it. But that which concerns me in <hi>Huntingtons</hi> Teſtimony, is this, He affirms, that when the Commiſſion was read by <hi>Drake,</hi> I ſhould ſay, <hi>Come, come, let it goe.</hi> Now Sir, I askt him this Queſtion, Let it go, what doth that refer to? ſays <hi>Huntington,</hi> Let the Papers go. Now truly, I am not ſo bad a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian, as to ſpeak of Papers, let it go, and not to ſay, let them go. And if I had ſpoke of Papers, as he ſays I did, I muſt either be guilty of non-ſenſe, or elſe he of falſhood, I believe he of both. But as for thoſe words, <hi>Come, come, let it goe</hi>; he doth not affirm, that I ſaid, Come, let it go away, but let it go, and that may be a word of diſlike: And if I did ſay ſo, yet it was not of the Commiſſion, God is my Record, for he came not till nine of the clock at night, as himſelf ſays; and before he came, I had declared my ſelf againſt ſending away the Commiſſion and Inſtructions, as being an act of two high a nature for private men, and of notorious falſhood, to ſay it was in the name of the Presbyterian Party, when it was not: And the other men that were here in Court upon oath, and that were then preſent, as <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Alford,</hi> did confeſs upon Examination, That they heard no ſuch words from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47192:34"/>The next teſtimony is Maſter <hi>Adams,</hi> and he relates a ſtory of a correſpondency between <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Drake,</hi> and one <hi>Maſon,</hi> and being ask'd, Was Maſter <hi>Love</hi> privy to this correſpondency? he did ſo far clear me, that he could not ſay it, nor was I privy to it. Being ask'd again, Was Maſter <hi>Love</hi> privy to theſe letters of ſending moderate propoſitions to the King? that he likewiſe cleares me in, he cannot ſay it. And <hi>I</hi> can ſay, that <hi>I</hi> am ſo far from moderation in their ſenſe, that moderation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>n their ſenſe <hi>I</hi> deem downright Malignity, which I was, and ſtill am utterly againſt. He was aſked likewiſe, did <hi>Maſter</hi> Love <hi>know of collecting a hundred pound for Titus?</hi> To that he anſwered, that he durſt not upon oath ſay that <hi>M. Love</hi> was privy to this collection, and he doth not ſay that it was agreed in my houſe, to ſend away the commiſſion, but ſays, it was moved in my houſe: for ſayes he, <hi>I cannot ſay it was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for there was no vote paſt.</hi> Theſe were his words, and he contradicts <hi>Alford</hi> and <hi>Farr</hi> in three places of his teſtimony. He overthrows <hi>Alfords</hi> depoſition. He affirms, that the copy of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the King, was to ſhew what great affection he bare to the miniſtry of England, and promiſed great favour when he was in a condition to do it, and deſired them to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the way they were in: and he ſaith, he dare not ſwear that this letter was read in my houſe, but he thinks it was. Now as to this letter likewiſe, J deſire the ſame favour from you, That when the letter doth not appear, neither the Originall, nor the individuall copy, that you would be tender of paſſing any judgment upon me, upon the vaine rovings of a mans memory; and of a mans memory too, that is ingaged to proſecute my life, to ſave his own, as moſt of the witneſſes that came in againſt me are. He ſaith, there was a motion made in my houſe, That a commiſsion and inſtructions ſhould be drawn up to ſend to my <hi>Lord Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham,</hi> and the reſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> but ſayes he, by whom I cannot ſay; and ſays he, there was no debate, as I remember, to mend the inſtructions; though the Atturny Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall did lay it upon me, as if I had corrected and amended them, when J did neither read them, no nor ſo much as touch them in my life. The ſubſtance of the commiſsion he tells you was to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham, Maſſey, Graves</hi> and others, to aſsiſt their Brethren of the Scotiſh Nation in their Treaty: Now to this there is a manifeſt contradiction in another mans teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For C. <hi>Farr</hi> ſwears, that the commiſsion he ſpeaks of was not to treat, but only as private perſons to adviſe that the King might agree with the Scots, upon the intereſt of Religion and the Terms of the Covenant, That he might not be drawn away by the high flown Cavaliers, and Malignants, ſo that <hi>Far</hi> overthrows this teſtimony of <hi>Adams: Adams</hi> ſays it was to treate, and <hi>Farr</hi> ſays, it was not to treate but to adviſe: but be it the one, or be it the other, J deteſt both, J had no hand in, and gave no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto it, but manifeſted my diſſent to the whole. He being likewiſe askt (for J am ſtill upon <hi>Adams</hi> his teſtimony) whether at a meeting it vvas not propounded at my houſe to vvrite to the Queen, and to <hi>Jermin,</hi> and <hi>Percy,</hi> to mediate vvith the King to agree with the Scots. To this he anſvvered no, and truly he might very vvel anſwer ſo, for J am ſure J did never in all my life hear of a motion ſo much as of a letter to be writ to any of theſe three perſons, to the Queen, <hi>Percy</hi> or <hi>Jermin</hi>; and ſhould have loathed and abhorred the very thought of it; and ſhould think that cauſe the worſe, wherein theſe perſons were ingaged; being ask'd whether there was not a letter from <hi>Percy,</hi> that writ for mony to be ſent to the King, and whether the anſwer given was, that they ſhould ſtay till the King and Scots were agreed, and then to ſend mony: <hi>Adams</hi> in this did me this right, He confeſt, he ſaw ſuch a letter writ, but (ſays he) I <hi>only ſaw it in the hands of one Maſon,</hi> a man who for my part, <hi>I</hi> never knew, nor heard of till I was in trouble: and being ask'd whether this letter from <hi>Piercy,</hi> was read in Maſter <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, he ſaid, certainly no. Being again ask'd whether about <hi>Auguſt</hi> there was not a letter written from <hi>Maſſey,</hi> wherein he ſaid he had back friends in Scotland, and complained that he was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted there, and whether that letter was communicated at Maſter <hi>Loves</hi> houſe; In this alſo he did me right, for he anſwered, <hi>No certainly, that Letter was not, to the beſt of my remembrance, read there</hi>; I <hi>heard of ſuch a letter, but ſaw it not.</hi> Then being asked whether one <hi>Sterks</hi> was not a <hi>Scotch</hi> Agent, and whether he did not uſe to come to my houſe? to which he gives this anſwer: <hi>We took him to be a Scotch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and he met ſometimes at Maſter Loves houſe</hi>: Now Sir, as to that, he ſuppoſeth that he was an Agent, but doth not ſwear that he was ſo, much leſſe that I knew him to be ſo. Nay, I can ſwear upon the beſt information <hi>I</hi> have had both from his own mouth, and the mouths of others, that he was no Agent, for he lived in England fourteen years, and had not been in Scotland in fourteen years.</p>
               <p>And I heard himſelfe ſay ſo, when he went away upon the Act; and I asked him, Are you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Church or State of Scotland? and he told me no, he was not: it is in your breaſts whether you wil believe me or no: and likewiſe M. <hi>Blare</hi> when he was here in London, did affirm to me,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47192:34"/>
that he was a poor honeſt man, and that he was no way imployed as an inſtrument of State. I know nothing of the mans Agency, be he Agent or not, I never ſent letter or meſſage by him, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any from him in all my life; but I ſee it is laid heavy upon me in my charge, that <hi>I</hi> contributed mony to him: but no man in his depoſitions did prove that I ever gave him a penny. <hi>Adams</hi> being ask'd, <hi>whether Maſter Love did not write down the ſums of mony that was to be contributed to Maſſey</hi>; In this he doth me right alſo, for he ſaith, <hi>Maſter Love had paper in his hand, but</hi> I <hi>did not ſee what he wrote,</hi> and therefore to that I need not anſwer; being further ask'd, Did not Maſter <hi>Love</hi> put the firſt letter of their names before the ſums which others wrote, he anſwered, he could not ſay ſo. Being ask'd further, Was there not a letter pend by Maſter <hi>Love</hi> and Doctor <hi>Drake,</hi> this anſwer hee gives, <hi>There was a letter, but</hi> (ſays he) I <hi>cannot deliver it upon my oath that it was pennd by them, but I thought it was ſo.</hi> He could not tell to whom this letter was directed, but ſaid, <hi>it was declared to be directed to the Generall Aſſembly of Scotland:</hi> Now as I obſerved in the beginning, this is only the ſingle teſtimony of one man, and indeed it was the firſt Queſtion (as I remember) that was ask'd me, that was of moment, when I was examined by the Committee, Whether <hi>I</hi> did not penn this letter? I did declare to them in the preſence of God, that I neither pend that nor any other to any perſon of the Scotiſh nation ſince the wars began, and this I declare in the preſence of the ſame God, ſtill to be a truth. Being ask'd further, Was Maſter <hi>Love</hi> preſent at ſometime of this meeting? he anſwered, I was, and the reaſon why he thought that we might pen it, was becauſe of the language of it. <hi>M. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Gen</hi> upon this (<hi>I</hi> remember) uſes this expreſsion, <hi>My Lord, this is very high, after we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in blood, that a letter ſhould be ſent.</hi> But to this I ſay, there is only a ſingle teſtimony, that ſuch a letter was writ, and whether it was ſent or no, he doth not prove, nor doth he prove that I writ it; and I declare to you, that I never writ it: as touching this letter, which <hi>M. Att. Gen.</hi> is pleaſed to inſiſt upon ſo much, <hi>Adams,</hi> being ask'd whether it was agreed upon that this letter ſhould be ſent? he gave this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>It was after the ſame manner that other things were agreed upon: but there was no vote paſt,</hi> and therfore he cannot prove my particular and expreſſe aſſent to the ſending of the letter, or any other letter whatſoever; and here to take off the Jealouſie of a correſpondency; which in the cloſe, through the Grace of God I ſhall clear to you; but to take it off now a little before I come to it: if there had been a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency maintained, would it have been imaginable, that from the time of the fight at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> which I think is ten months ſince, to this time, That there ſhould be no letter that any man can ſay, nor that I did certainly know of, that either was written or conveyed, or debated upon to be written, from that time to this very day, to any of the Scotiſh nation; and yet all this tends to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate matters againſt me, and all the burden is laid upon my weak ſhoulders. Other men that have heavy loades, have laid them upon my back to lighten them from off themſelves. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this letter, he ſaith, this was the ſubſtance of it, or it was to this effect, or purpoſe; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>I</hi> inſiſt upon it to beſeech your Lordſhip and the Court, to take heed what you do. It concerns you more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n me, it concerns my life only; But it concerns your honors, and lives, and ſouls and all, That upon an uncertain evidence you do not ſpill a mans blood. The man never read the letter, only he heard it read; and then he brings in to that and other letters, This is the ſumm of it, or it was to this effect. And though this man hath done me injury in ſome particulars, yet in others he hath done me right. For being ask'd, Did <hi>Maſter Love</hi> write letters, or receive any, or mend thoſe inſtructions, he only ſwears, he ſaw the letters, but cannot ſay I did read them; Being ask'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did give my conſent to the ſending away of that letter after <hi>Dunbar</hi> fight, which is ſo much inſiſted upon, and ſo greatly aggravated, he did thus farr right me; He ſaid, I <hi>will not ſwear he did give his conſent</hi>; being ask'd whether <hi>I</hi> was a correſpondent, he ſaid, he took me to be a correſpondent, and upon theſe words I had leave to ask him this Queſtion: Whether he knew J was a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? To this he ſaid, that Letters were heard by me, but ſaid he, <hi>J cannot ſwear that he was a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, J did conceive Maſter</hi> Love <hi>to be a correſpondent, but J did not ſay ſo, and J dare not ſwear that he was a correſpondent.</hi> So that herein likewiſe there is nothing but his humbly conceivings and his ſuppoſitions, according to which J hope you will not paſſe any cenſure upon me; and thus J have done with <hi>Adams</hi> teſtimony.</p>
               <p>The fifth teſtimony is that of <hi>Jaquel,</hi> which I do here again in Court except againſt, as no Legall witneſſe, for he did declare he could not in conſcience take an oath againſt me. He did well nigh half an hour declare he could not ſwear, but that he would make a Narrative or relation of what was true I did intreat your Lordſhips leave to put it to him whether he was under an oath or no, and he ſaid twice
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47192:35"/>
at leaſt, J am as good as under an oath: if any perſon good or bad come under an oath, J muſt ſtand or fall by his teſtimony, and according to Gods Ordinance, an Oath is to decide all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies: But the man declared, He was not under an Oath; and went out of the Court, and was fined five hundred pound; and when afterwards he was called into the Court again, he did onely put his hand upon his Buttons on his Breſt: So that this was not any taking of an Oath; but fearing his Fine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he did it, though with much ſeeming regret of Conſcience; and I am informed this day, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that he was under an Oath: And if ſo, Then I have nothing to ſay to his Teſtimony, and ſo ſhall not ſpeak to it, but onely as to a bare Relation, and naked Information. There is nothing that doth concern me in his Teſtimony, but onely a concurrence with <hi>Potter; Potter</hi> and he coming to my houſe, with ſome Letters (as he ſaith) One from <hi>Bamfield,</hi> another from <hi>Argyle, Louden,</hi> and <hi>Louthian,</hi> and <hi>Belcarris</hi>; and another from one Maſter <hi>Batly,</hi> if I remember right. Now Sir, as to theſe Letters, I do not deny, but that they brought them to my houſe; nay, I do acknowledge thoſe two men did bring thoſe Letters to my houſe, at leaſtwiſe, which they ſaid were ſuch; but whether they were the Originals, or Copies, I know not; for I never read nor kept the Letters, but they carried away the Letters with them; and Captain <hi>Potter</hi> ſaid, Maſter <hi>Love,</hi> I have news to ſhew you, at that very time when Mr. <hi>Jaquel</hi> and he came to ſhow them at my houſe. This Witneſs, I cannot call him ſo, but this Informer ſaith, That being askt what was done upon the hearing of thoſe Letters, he ſaid, <hi>Potter</hi> read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but that there was no Agreement upon it, but an utter diſlike in all that heard them, about the Contents of them: And he hath theſe words further, It was, ſays he, a trouble, I am confident, to them that heard and read the matter of thoſe Letters; but being askt, Did Maſter <hi>Love</hi> agree to the giving of Forty pound to <hi>Bamfield,</hi> and his man? To that Queſtion he anſwers thus; he ſaid, There was no Agreement, but it was thought convenient by all. Upon this, I craved leave of your Lordſhip to ask him this Queſtion, How he knew my thoughts, that I thought it convenient; to which, he gave this anſwer, <hi>I cannot ſay any thing, that Maſter</hi> Love <hi>did ſay, it was convenient.</hi> So that therein, though he might preſume upon a mans thoughts to know them, yet he muſt onely judge my thoughts by my words, as the tongue and heart agrees; for he is not a god: but he doth not ſay, That I ſaid it was convenient; nor did either of them prove that ever I gave a peny, either to <hi>Bamfield</hi> or his man.</p>
               <p>The laſt Witneſs that came in againſt me, is Captain <hi>Far</hi>; and indeed, I do not know what to make of his Teſtimony, I will not call it a prompting, that will be thought too bad a word; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was ſuch a Teſtimony, that I never heard produced in any Court in my life. For Maſter <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General,</hi> and ſome others here, did ask him Ninety eight Queſtions; ſo that the man ſpake nothing deliberately, but ſpake by reading out of his private Examinations, which is extrajudicial to be brought in Court where the witneſſes are to ſpeak <hi>Vivâ voce.</hi> There was, I ſay, ſo many Queſtions (beſides thoſe I had leave to ask him) propounded to him, during the time he was upon his Oath; And the man was of a dull ſpirit, and ſlow of ſpeech, and <hi>I</hi> did perceive him to be ſo poſſeſt with fear, that he knew not what he ſaid; for he hath manifeſt contradictions in his Teſtimony, which I believe all the Court will ſee, and therein concur with me, when they come to hear them. The firſt word I heard him ſay in Court, was this, To deſire the benefit of his Papers; it ſeems he did ſuſpect the badneſs of his memory, that he muſt have his Papers to help him (and Papers written by another) before he would be depoſed in Court againſt me for my life.</p>
               <p>Being askt, whether upon the ending of the Treaty at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> there was not a Letter came from <hi>Titus,</hi> to deſire ſome body to come unto <hi>Callis?</hi> and whether that Letter was read at any houſe? and whether at my houſe <hi>Alford</hi> was deſired to go? He affirms, he was (which none elſe did) and which is a moſt notorious falſhood. I have no rancor in my heart againſt him, the Lord knows I have prayed for all thoſe that perſecute me; and my heart cleaves to them in love and pity: I do not tax the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his conſcience, I think he dares not be ſo vile, but I do tax his memory in things done ſo long ago: And afterwards he ſays, He could not remember ought (though he did pretend to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) becauſe they were done ſo long ago: yet before he did affirm them Now to demonſtrate this that he ſays in this Clauſe to be falſe, That <hi>Alford</hi> was deſired in my houſe to go, <hi>Alford</hi> himſelf ſays he was never at my houſe, till he came from <hi>Callis,</hi> which is certainly true; and therefore <hi>Alford</hi> could not at my houſe be deſired to go to <hi>Callis</hi>; when there was an account given of <hi>Alfords</hi> return from <hi>Callis,</hi> then I know he was there, though I never ſpake with him before that time, as I remember; nor was he ever within my doors till after his return: But ſays <hi>Far,</hi> I cannot ſay Maſter <hi>Love</hi> was preſent, while <hi>Alfords</hi> return was there read, for ſometimes he was abſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:47192:35"/>Then further being ask'd what was the ſubſtance of that copie of the Letter from the King that <hi>Alford</hi> brought from <hi>Titus</hi>? he anſwered, that the ſum of it was this, That the King of Scots did declare he would give ſatisfaction to the Scots; and in order thereunto he deſired Commiſſioners to be ſent over to <hi>Breda</hi>; Theſe are the words of his teſtimony. Now Sir, this is but the ſingle teſtimony of one man, and it is contrary to the teſtimony of that very man that brought over this letter: and if any man knew the ſubſtance of the copy of the letter pretended to be from the King, it muſt be <hi>Alford</hi> that brought it over. Certainly, none could know it better then he, and therfore for this man to be ſo ſtrangely beſides himſelf, and to forget himſelf, ſo as to ſay, This is the ſumm of the letter, when he that brought it ſaith the contrary, and did not know that this was the ſum of it: this may ſeem ſtrange, and J hope you wil judg of the weakneſs of this teſtimony. Being ask'd whether he did not conceive this to be the copie of the Kings letter? he did me right in that, for he ſaid, he could not tell whether it was the copy; but that <hi>Alford</hi> told him, he brought over a copy of the Kings letter. And Mr. <hi>At. Gen.</hi> was pleaſed to aggravate this of Cap. <hi>Far</hi> againſt me: Sayes he, the King ſent over for Commiſſioners to treat, and accordingly at Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe it was agreed upon that Commiſſioners ſhould be ſent, and there were perſons named. To this J ſay, that, God is my record, <hi>I</hi> never in all my life heard (as J remember) of any letter from the King to that end, that Commiſſioners ſhould be ſent over. And <hi>Far</hi> doth me right herein; for in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that queſtion, <hi>Was your Commiſſioners agreed upon</hi>? he three times anſwers negatively. J do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he remembers himſelf ſo well in all his teſtimony, as in that particular. Being as'kd whether the Commiſſion was agreed upon, he ſaid it was not agreed upon by the company; and herein he did me more right then any man, for he gave my reaſon; for (ſays he) <hi>the reaſon given was, becauſe private perſons could not give a commiſſion.</hi> And though he hath done me more wrong then any man, yet herein he hath done me more right then any man. Being further ask'd, <hi>Was it not debated to ſend a Commiſſion over? Drake,</hi> he ſaid, read a paper in the nature of a Commiſſion; <hi>but it was not agreed upon by the company, becauſe private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could do no ſuch thing.</hi> And a third time he ſayes, <hi>The Commiſſion and Inſtructions were read in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe</hi>; (that he affirms, and that J do not deny) <hi>but not agreed upon.</hi> And further he ſaid, he did <hi>conceive, to the beſt of his remembrance, it was in the name of the Presbyterian party of England; but</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I cannot poſitively ſay it was ſo, for I did but only hear it read.</hi> Then your Lordſhip askd him this queſtion, <hi>Did you ſay, that the Commiſſion was not agreed upon, but that the Inſtructions were?</hi> To this Cap. <hi>Far</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Will. Drake</hi> undertook to draw up the Commiſſion and Jnſtructions; but yet, ſays he, <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, that they were either drawn up or ſent.</hi> Again, he ſays further (and herein hee doth me more right then <hi>Adams</hi> or <hi>Alford</hi> doth) <hi>Adams,</hi> he ſayes it was not agreed upon; yet he ſaith thus, There was a Commiſſion read for to treat, and ſo ſayes <hi>Alford</hi>; But this man ſayes directly, that this ſuppoſed commiſſion was not to treat in the behalf of the Presbiterian party. And it had been a folly for private men to aſſume ſuch a vain title to themſelves: ſo that he ſays directly, upon your Lordſhips queſtion to him, that it was not to treat, but to adviſe the Scotch commiſſioners, and the Miniſters eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to agree with the King upon the intereſt of Religion and terms of the covenant: but being ask'd, Was it not in the behalf of the Presbyterian party. He anſwered no, Being further askt: <hi>Was there not an agreement at M. Loves houſe for a letter to be ſent to the Queen?</hi> Herein alſo this man doth me right: he ſaid <hi>no my Lord</hi>; &amp; yet he contradicts himſelf likewiſe, for being askt in the next queſtion, what was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that letter to the Queen? he anſwered the ſubſtance of the letter to the Queen was, that ſhe ſhould perſwade the King to give ſatisfaction to the Scots in their juſt demands: now either he muſt hear of this letter ſomwhere elſe, or elſe frame a fixion to himſelf, that this was the matter of the letter, when there was no ſuch letter in <hi>rerum natura</hi>; The next thing he charges me with is, that I ſhould ſay it was agreed that mony ſhould bee raiſed for <hi>Maſſy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; he names the ſum, he thinks 250 or 300l. And that I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhould particularly move him with this queſtion, <hi>C.</hi> Far, <hi>What wil you do</hi>? Now I beſeech your Lordſhip &amp; the Court to conſider, that he doth not ſwear that I ſaid, <hi>we were agreed</hi>; but <hi>it was agreed</hi>; &amp; that might be the act of other men, &amp; not mine: and in an other place, he ſaid <hi>they agreed</hi>; but he doth not ſay, That J ſaid, <hi>Wee agreed</hi>; to include my ſelfe; but to that, that J ſhould move him and ſay, <hi>C.</hi>F. <hi>What wil you do?</hi> Truly this is but a generall queſtion, and he himſelf did me thus far right; When I had leave from the Court to propound this Queſtion to him, <hi>Captain</hi> Far, <hi>Did I move you, or ſay to you, What mony will you give for</hi> Maſſey <hi>or</hi> Titus? He anſwered, he did conceive it was for that uſe; So that he proves not againſt me, that I moved for money for <hi>Maſſey</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi>; but onely that I ſhould ſay, <hi>Captain Far, What will you do?</hi> and if you obſerve the words of the teſtimonie, they are theſe exactly. He tels you that he brought five pounds; for there is all that ever <hi>I</hi> am charged with: I am not charged

with lending a penny, but onely that fifteen pounds was brought to my houſe; ten pounds by <hi>Potter,</hi> and five pounds by this man: And he affirms that he left this five pounds at my houſe; and herein I perceive a contradiction in the man, and therefore it is hard to determine when he ſpeaks true, or when he ſpeaks falſe: Theſe are his very words; <hi>Mr. Love</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ask'd me what I would do? And I did lay down five pounds upon Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>Table when ſeverall perſons were in the room.</hi> And being asked, Did Mr <hi>Love</hi> receive this money? he ſaid he could not tell; but was loth to tell, who he thought received it; but in his laſt word ſave one that he ſpake in Court (which made much for my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) he ſaid, he thought I did not receive it; and God is my record, I did not: but he ſaid, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man did, and named Captain <hi>Maſſey.</hi> But the contradiction I obſerve is this; He tels you, he laid down five pounds when ſeverall perſons were in the room: and in the next queſtion but one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ask'd, Was <hi>Mr. Love</hi> in the room? Yes, My Lord, ſayes he; but I cannot ſay any body elſe was there. So that therein the man evidently contradicts himſelf: and it appears he was under a very great fear, and even confounded by the many queſtions propounded to him. I ask'd him further, <hi>Did I bid you lay it down?</hi> Sayes he, <hi>I cannot ſay that you bid me lay down the money.</hi> Being ask'd, Was this way of laying down of money to prevent diſcovery? He ſaid, he did it under that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But being ask'd by me, <hi>Did I bid you lay it down under that notion?</hi> He anſwered, he would not ſay I did. So that I neither directly nor indirectly did bid him bring money to my houſe, or lay it down when it was brought there; but other perſons were in the room, and he conceives what perſon took it away: therefore I beſeech you make a candid and fair interpretation of what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have ſaid or done.</p>
               <p>Being ask'd about the copie of the Kings letter, that <hi>Alford</hi> ſayes he brought over from <hi>Titus,</hi> whether I was in the room whileſt it was read? he ſaid, <hi>I cannot ſay that he was there when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was read:</hi> but he was there during ſome part of the communication; but ſayes he, <hi>I cannot ſay he was there at the reading of the Letter, Nor can I ſay he was preſent whileſt the Narrative was read.</hi> He obſerved I was often called away, and was abſent; and ſayes hee, <hi>I cannot ſay there was any ſuch thing done by Mr.</hi> Love. And I ask'd him this queſtion, <hi>Did I ſend, or agree to ſend Major</hi> Alford <hi>to Calice?</hi> Hee anſwers, he thinks <hi>I</hi> did not; and herein he falſifieth his former Teſtimony; for he ſaid Major <hi>Alford</hi> was deſired in my houſe to go to <hi>Calice</hi>: And yet <hi>Alford</hi> ſwore he never was in my houſe till after he came from thence. But herein he doth me right too (though with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to himſelf.) He ſaid, it was agreed at my houſe that <hi>Alford</hi> ſhould go; and yet now he ſayes he thinks I did not agree to the ſending of <hi>Alford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being asked further, Whether did <hi>I</hi> give conſent to the ſending away the Commiſſion? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>I cannot ſay Mr.</hi> Love <hi>was there when it was ſent away.</hi> And truly I may ſay, who brought it away, or who drew it up, and what was done in it, I cannot tell; there might be a thouſand Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in it for ought <hi>I</hi> know; for <hi>I</hi> did neither own the reading of it, nor the ſending of it; but did utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proteſt againſt both. Being again ask'd, whether J agreed to the ſending of it away? he anſwered, <hi>It was agreed upon by all, That we could not ſend the Commiſſion away.</hi> When J ask'd him, Did J ſay to you, <hi>Captain Far,</hi> Will you contribute five pounds for <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus?</hi> he gave this anſwer; (ſays he) <hi>You ask'd me what I would do? ſo that I conceived it was for</hi> Maſſey <hi>and</hi> Titus: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e affirms, he laid this five pounds down in my houſe; but did not ſay that J received it; and in the preſence of God J ſpeak it, J never ſaw it nor, received it in all my life.</p>
               <p>And thus with much acknowledgment, and bleſſing God, and thanking your Lordſhip and the Court, you have given mee leave to take a brief ſurvey through the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, though they have been very large, and the Charge againſt me very high.</p>
               <p>Now having ſpoken to the Depoſitions (before I ſhall crave leave to ſpeak ſomething concerning my ſelf, and make humble Propoſals to this Court) I ſhall add but one word, and it is this: I was loath, before I ſaw Witneſſes face to face, to confeſſe any thing: I deem'd it againſt nature for any to confeſſe againſt himſelf, unleſſe he could be ſure his confeſſion ſhould not prejudice him; and I might have been guilty of my own bloud, if I had confeſſed: for then, did the matter confeſs'd amount to Treaſon by your Law, my life would be at your mercy, and you might hang mee upon mine own confeſſion: and upon that ground I went reſolved to the Committee, and through the grace of God I reſolved not there confeſſe a word nor tittle, till I heard what proof was brought in againſt me. And now I do ingenuouſly acknowledg. That there were ſeverall Meetings at my houſe, That theſe perſons met there, and that this Commiſſion was read there: but I did utterly diſlike it, and diſſent from it.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47192:36"/>
And that I was preſent at the reading of Letters, either at the beginning, or end, or ſome part of them, I do acknowledg: And this I ſay, that I was ignorant of the danger that now <hi>I</hi> ſee <hi>I</hi> am in. The Act of the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1650, doth make it Treaſon to hold any correſpondencie, or to ſend Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though but in a way of commerce, into <hi>Scotland</hi>; let the matter of them be what it will be: Now herein my Councel acquaints me with my danger, that I being ſometimes preſent when Letters were read in my houſe, am guilty of a concealment: and as to that <hi>I</hi> do humbly lay my ſelf at your feet and mercie. But as to Treaſon, I do not know any perſonall act of mine proved againſt me, that brings me under any Act of yours. And thus having briefly ſpoken concerning the Charge in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and concerning my accuſers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and having briefly ſurveyed their Teſtimony, I ſhall humbly crave leave to ſpeak ſomething concerning my ſelf, and I ſhall be very brief in it.</p>
               <p>Concerning my ſelf, it is needfull <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſpeak a word: I would not ſtand under miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to ſeem to be what I am not. I am preſented unto ſome, as if I were a Malignant, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from my firſt principles, a mover of ſedition; and what not but what I am? Wherefore I am conſtrained to ſpeak a word in my own vindication; and I ſhall make the Apoſtles apologie, <hi>I am become a fool in glorying: but ye have compelled me. I</hi> count it never lawfull for a mans own mouth to praiſe him, till another mans mouth accuſes him; and then he may without vanity be his own vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator. What I ſhall ſay of my ſelf, the Lord knows it is not voluntarily, out of an affected oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but by compulſion, for a neceſſary and cleer manifeſtation of my Principles and Practices now ſuſpected. As touching Malignity, I hate both Name and Thing: and, as Cardinal <hi>Farneſus</hi> ſaid of himſelf profanely, That if he knew any part of him infected with Lutheraniſm, he would cut it off, and caſt it into the fire: That I can ſay truly, That if I knew any part of mee infected with Malignity, <hi>I</hi> would cut it off with the pruning hook of mortification, and by an ingenuous retractation before you all this day. God is my witneſſe, I never drove a Malignant Deſigne, I never carried on a Malignant intereſt, I deteſt both; <hi>I</hi> ſtill retain my old Covenanting principles, from which through the grace of God <hi>I</hi> will never depart for any terrour or perſwaſion whatſoever. When I look upon all the Vows, and Covenants, and Declarations, and Proteſtations of both Houſes of Parliament, <hi>I</hi> do finde a ſutableneſſe between my judgment and them, and am not conſcious to my ſelfe of any thing that I have done in oppoſition or contradiction thereunto: And therefore J may ſay as <hi>Jeremy</hi> did when he was accuſed in the like caſe, of making defection to a contrary party, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 37.13, 14. <hi>Irijah ſaid to Jeremiah, Thou falleſt away to the Caldeans: Then ſaid Jeremiah, It is falſe, I fall not away to the Caldeans.</hi> So, if it be charged upon mee, that J am fallen from my firſt Principles, or that J am fallen to Malignity; J ſay to any that ſhall ſo accuſe me, Jt is falſe, J fall not away to Malignitie, J do retain as great a keenneſs, and ſhall whileſt J live, and as ſtrong an oppoſition againſt a Malignant intereſt, whether in Scotland, or in England, or in any part of the world, againſt the Nation where J live, and have to this day, as ever J did in former times. J am no Jncendiary or evill Jnſtrument, to divide the Nations one from another. God knows, the grief of my heart hath been for the diviſions, and the deſire of my ſoul hath been for the union of both the Nations: and if J had as many lives as J have hairs on my head, or as much bloud in my veins as there is water in the ſea, J could count it all well ſpent to quench the burning that our ſins have kindled between the two Nations. J have all along engaged my eſtate and life in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Quarrel againſt the Forces raiſed by the King: My appearing in their cauſe was not from any aim at profit, but out of a perſwaſion of conſcience, and ſenſe of duty. J may ſpeak it as <hi>Paul</hi> doth it of himſelf, <hi>I was in labours more then they all.</hi> J ſpeak it without vanity, J was, according to my obſcure ſtation and mean condition, in doing and giving in the Parliaments Quarrell, more then many. Many gave out of their abundance, but J out of my want: and as Chriſt ſpake to the widow who gave two mites, that <hi>ſhe gave more then they all; for ſhe gave all that ſhe had, even all her living:</hi> So did J; though J gave my mite, yet J gave my all: And J did not only deem it my duty to preach for the lawfulneſſe of a Defenſive war, but, unleſſe my Books and wearing apparel, J contributed all that J had in the world; and that was no ſmall ſumm, conſidering the meanneſſe of my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And J have at this day a great ſumm due to mee from the State, which is ſtill kept from me, and now my life endeavoured to be taken from mee. And yet for all this, J repent not of what J have done; though J could from my ſoul wiſh, That the ends of that juſt VVar had been better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: then ſhould we have been happy and united among our ſelves, and honoured among the Nations round about us, J am ſo far (J ſay) from repenting of what J have done, both by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47192:37"/>
and contributing, and ſuffering in the Parliaments Quarrell. That were it to do again upon the ſame unqueſtionable Authority for the ſame declared ends, and againſt the ſame Malignant perſons, I ſhould manifeſt as much readineſſe of mind to engage according to my meaſure, as ever I did.</p>
               <p>And thus I have declared my ſelfe touching my Principles, in theſe particulars; I ſhall now crave leave to expreſſe my ſelfe a little touching my ſufferings; and then to make but a few humble Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and ſo caſt my life into Gods hands and yours. Touching my ſufferings; I may ſay, that my whole life hath been a time of affliction, either of body or mind, God ſees my heart to be a tuffe and knotty piece, that it needs ſo many blows to break it; I may ſay with the Pſalmiſt, I <hi>have been afflicted from my youth up,</hi> and from my youth up I have met with oppoſition. From the Prelates, being perſecuted by them, meerly for conſcience ſake; it is near twenty years ſince I was cited to the Biſhops Courts; I have been often troubled for hearing of Sermons, and diſcharging other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Religion, which were an offence in thoſe dayes: When I was a Scholer in <hi>Oxon</hi> and Maſter of Arts (I do not ſpeak it out of vaine oſtentation, but meerly to repreſent unto you, that what <hi>I</hi> was, I am, and what J am,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> J was) J was the firſt Scholer that J know of, or ever heard of in <hi>Oxon,</hi> who did publickly refuſe in the Congregation Houſe to ſubſcribe unto thoſe impoſitions, or Cannons impoſed by the Arch-Biſhop touching the Prelates and Common Prayer. And for which, though they would not deny me my degree, yet I was expelled the Congregation Houſe, never to fit as a Member among them. When J came firſt to <hi>London,</hi> which is about twelve years ſince, J was oppoſed by the B. of <hi>London</hi>; and though J was called as a Lecturer to <hi>Ann Alderſgate,</hi> yet it was near three years before J could faſten upon any Lecture. After this, about the year 1640, or 1641, J was impriſoned in <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> meerly for expreſſing my ſelf againſt the errors of the Service-Book, and was removed from priſon there, by a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> to this place; And in this Court of Kings Bench, J was acquitted. After this, about the beginning of the Wars between the late King and the Parliament. J was the firſt Miniſter that J know of in <hi>England,</hi> who was accuſed for preaching of Treaſon and Rebellion, meerly for maintaining in a Sermon in <hi>Kent</hi> at <hi>Tenterden,</hi> the lawfulneſſe of a defenſive war, at the firſt breaking out and irruption of our Troubles; but was then publikely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted in a Court there, and recovered coſts and damages of my Accuſer. After this J had a little breathing time, whilſt the two Houſes of Parliament were in power; only J was once complained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by the Kings Commiſſioners at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi> for preaching a Sermon there; J did not know that J ſhould preach there till the Pſalm was ſung, and did only preach a Sermon which J had preached the day before at <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle; J was, J ſay, complained of by the Kings Commiſsioners to the Houſe, for that Sermon; but within three weeks J was acquitted and diſcharged, by order of the Houſe of Commons. That Sermon is much ſpoken of becauſe it is ſo little ſeen, it is ſo obſcure a piece, and many imagine, as if the keeneſſe of my affection was blunted from what it was in that Sermon: But J declare unto you, that J come up to this day to every tittle of that Sermon: J hear it is lately printed, and if it be printed according to the firſt copy, J will own every line of it, as that to which my heart and judgement concurs to this very day. After all this, ſince the late change of Government, J have been three times in trouble; J was once committed to cuſtody by, and twice cited before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Plundred Miniſters, but there was no ſufficient proof againſt me, and ſo J was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
               <p>But now laſt of all, this great and laſt tryal and trouble is come upon me: J have been kept ſeverall weeks in cloſe Priſon, and now J am arraigned for my life; herein is my great comfort, even that which was the Apoſtles, <hi>God that hath delivered me, he doth deliver me, in whom I truſt that he will yet deliver me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Job</hi> 5.19.</note> And that that ſhall be made good to me; <hi>He ſhall deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea in ſeven there ſhall no evill touch thee.</hi> As <hi>Cato,</hi> he was accuſed thirty two times by the unkind State whom he faithfully ſerved, and yet after thirty two times accuſation, his innocency and uprightneſſe brought him off. Why ſhould not I be confident in my God, who have had a life time of experience of his care and love towards me. It is not the danger of my life troubles me; I am a ſickly man, and I know a diſeaſe will ear long kill me, whatever you do with me; but this grieves me more; That I ſhould ſuffer from their hands for whom I have done and ſuffered ſo much in my obſcure ſtation, and according to my weak meaſure; had it been an Enemy had dealt thus by me, and made ſuch an eager proſecution of me, and ſuch high aggravations of that which in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of my heart I have done, it had not been ſo much, and as I told the Committee when I was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47192:37"/>
examined by them (who charged me with Jeſuiſme and non-ingenuity, becauſe I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe againſt my ſelfe and others) that though I honoured them as private Gentlemen, and ſhould acquaint them with what my ſelf had done, when it ſhould not be a ſnare to me; but when they ſhall apprehend me by a warrant for Treaſon, and examine me in order to a triall for my life, In no Judicature in the world, will I confeſſe a word, till I firſt hear what will come in againſt me. Now as I told them then, I never wrote letter, nor received letter; nor ſent, or lent mony to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Scotiſh Nation. Now that I ſhould meet with this hard meaſure; to have the moſt ridgid and ſevere interpretation put upon all my actions, to be look'd upon with ſo jealous (I might ſay with a worſer) eye, that have in my meaſure ventured my all, in the ſame quarrell that you were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, and lifted up my hands in the ſame Covenant, that have took ſweet counſell together, and walk'd in fellowſhip one with another; That from theſe I ſhould have ſuch hard meaſure, This, this troubles me greatly; had I been ſo dealt withall at the Juncto at Oxon, I ſhould not have been ſo troubled at it; but to be dealt ſo with at Weſtminſter, this is that at which I ſtand amazed: yet bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, I am not affraid; My Conſcience doth not tell me of any perſonal Act of mine proved againſt me that brings me under any of your laws as to Treaſon. And thus having expreſt my ſelf, concerning my charge, and the witneſſes, and my ſelf. I ſhall now in the cloſe of all ſay (what ever tortured collections, or inferences, are drawn from my practiſes, and however Lawyers may aggravate thoſe things that in part have been proved againſt me; yet I do declare in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, that what ever I have done, in the ſimplicity and integrity of my heart, I have done it; and did deem it to be conſonant and agreeable, both to my conſcience, and to the Proteſtations, and Covenant I have taken: and I have done nothing out of animoſity or from a ſpirit of revenge; and thus J have done concerning my ſelf. J have only a few humble propoſalls to make to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Court, and then J ſhall leave all to Gods determination and yours. To you that are my Judges, J humbly crave this of you, and J do it upon your Lordſhips words, the firſt day of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance here. When you were pleaſed to deny me Counſell, you ſaid you would be Counſell for me; and J beſeech you be ſo, for you are Judges both of matter of law, and matter of fact. J may make uſe of that paſſage, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31.8. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays there, <hi>that rulers muſt open their mouthes for the dumb, in the cauſe of all ſuch as are appointed for deſtruction.</hi> Truly, My Lord, J am as a dumb man before you; dumb in matters of Law, J cannot plead one word for my ſelf: J beſeech you be as <hi>Solomons</hi> Rulers were, and open your mouths for him that is appointed to deſtruction; you who are my Judges, be my Advocates, my life lies in your hands. And then J beſeech you let me make this humble motion to you, That you would not count any thing that J have done to be out of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, or ſtoutneſſe of Spirit; Truly, nothing but Conſcience could carry me through all my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; I could not leave ſuch dear relations that God hath given me, and ſuch a loving people, and comfortable livelihood, as any Miniſter hath within the walls of London: Nothing but conviction of conſcience, can carry me another way: And till Conſcience be fully ſatisfied, J cannot ſtir one ſtep.</p>
               <p>The next thing J beg is to beſeech your Lordſhip and the Court, to put a candid and fair interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon all that J have done, or that by witneſs you have heard; that it was no Malignant deſign, though I do not own the management of any deſign: J never writ letter, nor ſent letter to any of the Scotiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet thus far J own the thing, that it was agreeable to my judgement and Conſcience: For J thought the intereſt of God, and Religion, and the good of the Nation would be more advanced, if the King went into Scotland upon Covenant terms, then if he ſhould fall into the hands af the Jriſh rebells; or offer this Nation to the Turk, or Spanyard, or any other to come in and make a prey of it. J did Judg it would be a foundation laid of great troubles and blood, if he were not received by that nation. And though I did not, and do not in the leaſt own either the Commiſſion or Inſtructions, or the way of management of that buſineſſe, yet I confeſſe the agreement between the King and <hi>Scots</hi> I deſired, and deemed it my duty upon this ground, one clauſe of the Covenant being, to ſeek the union and good of both Nations; and thoſe who endeavour the contrary are declared by the Covenant to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendaries, Malignants, and Evill Inſtruments, who not only divide the Kingdoms one from another, but divide the King from his people. Now they declaring him to be their King, according to my apprehenſion I thought it agreeable to my Covenant, to pray and deſire, as a private man, and no more, for an agreement between the King and them, upon thoſe terms conſiſtent with the ſafety of Religion, and the terms of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And thus I have opened my heart to you. The favourable interpretation I humbly beg of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47192:38"/>
you is this, That things might not be taken in the worſt ſenſe: <hi>Non eſt reus, niſi mens ſit rea</hi>: He is not guilty, unleſſe the mind be guilty, I heard your Lord-ſhip ſay ſo at <hi>Guild</hi>-Hall, as I remember.</p>
               <p>The Lord knows in the uprightneſſe of my heart, I have done, what I have done. It is a Maxime in the Law (I have read it in Divinity books) <hi>Ampliandi ſunt favores, et in paenis benignior interpretatio facienda</hi>; Favours are to be amplifyed and enlarged by Magiſtrates; but in puniſhments, the moſt benigne and favourable interpretations muſt be made. Now of my Actions the harſheſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are made; I have a Charge laid againſt me, which I deem (and as my Councell tels me) to be rather a flouriſh in Law, then reality of matter..</p>
               <p>I ſtood amazed when I heard the charge againſt me, I thought it had rather been againſt ſome other man then againſt me. As if I ſhould ſend to the Queen, <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Jermin:</hi> herein I did rather venture my life upon a Tryall, then to lie under all that Obloquie, which that charge did lay upon me. Therefore I again beſeech you put a fair and candid interpretation upon what is proved againſt me.</p>
               <p>I remember a phraſe, <hi>Summum jus eſt ſumma injuria,</hi> to be over juſt, is to be injurious. <hi>Be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver righteous,</hi> may refer to Courts of Judicatory. Herein I acknowledge, that my not revealing what my accuſers have done, this layeth me under the fault of a concealment, for which <hi>I</hi> lay my ſelfe at your feet.</p>
               <p>The next humble requeſt I have to make, is this, To intreat your Lordſhip and the Court, that you would not hearken to any politick ſuggeſtions, that may be laid before you: I know under what diſadvantage I lye, that am the firſt Miniſter in <hi>England</hi> tryed for Treaſon, in a buſineſſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and what a prejudice this is to me, to make an example upon.</p>
               <p>The firſt Suggeſtion that I humble intreat you would not hearken to, is; That it will not be for the honour and intereſt of the State, if I be not condemned; Truly it is for the honour of the State for you to do Juſtice, If you have found, that I ever writ letter, or ſent, or received letter, or lent money; if in theſe regards you have found me within your Acts, ſpare me not: But if I have been onely preſent at the reading of letters, and have been ſilent at what others have done; therein <hi>I</hi> lay my ſelfe at your mercy, to ſhew me favour. It was a ſuggeſtion to <hi>Pilate, If thou ſpareſt that man, thou art no friend to Caeſar</hi>; and ſo if you do not condemn me, you are no friends to thoſe who commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate you; but be friends to your ſelves and families, and take heed that you bring not guiltleſſe blood upon you.</p>
               <p>And here (and ſo I ſhall have done) in the cloſe of all, I do acknowledge, that in many particulars, as touching not revealing (I ſay not as to perſonall actings, nor do any prove it againſt me) I do fall within your acts, as to the cenſure of a concealment; and herein I humbly beg your mercy. And however J may be judged to be a man of a turbulent and unquiet ſpirit,; yet thoſe that know me in my relations, will not ſay ſo of me; and my people, over whom God hath called me (J think) will ſay, J am a man who deſireth to live quietly in the Land: But however my ſpirit and principles are queſtioned, yet J reſolve by the grace of God to lead for the future a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, in all godlineſſe and honeſty.</p>
               <p>J have but one word more to cloſe all J have to ſay for my ſelf (for J have made no plea in Law; in thoſe matters J am as a dumb man, and cannot open my mouth) and 'tis this, The Charge and Depoſitions lie before you, and J will but lay this before you alſo, that if ſo be my fact ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve death, which J beleeve it doth not, and J hope you cannot finde me under your own Acts as to Treaſon; yet if you do cenſure me rather upon a politicall intereſt, then from the merit of the fact, the Scripture accounts not that Juſtice, but Murder. <hi>Jehu</hi> put to death <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſons, and that by the command of God; but he did it upon a politicall intereſt, to eſtabliſh himſelf in his new gotten Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and when God reckons for this, he ſayes, <hi>I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu.</hi> To do any thing upon a politicall intereſt, though the fact may deſerve death, the Scripture counts this Murder, not Juſtice.</p>

               <p>MY Lord, you have heard him ſay much, and it had been much better for him if he had ſaid leſs. My Lord, when men go out of the way of their own calling, they very often erre; and truly I may attribute much of M. <hi>Loves</hi> confidence to his ignorance, My Lord, to his ignorance of the Law; and when men meddle beyond their own bounds, they doe tranſgreſs. M. <hi>Love</hi> hath made you a continued Speech; My Lord, I do finde the old Proverb commonly true, <hi>In multitude of words there wanteth not evill:</hi> And ſhould I ſay nothing againſt M. <hi>Love,</hi> my Lord, he hath ſaid enough againſt himſelf, in that that he hath now repeated even to his own condemnation in that which he acknowledgeth, my Lord, (I cannot ſay ingenuouſly, though himſelf hath ſaid ſo) to be rather a miſpriſion of Treaſon and a concealment. My Lord, acts of concealment are not ſo long continued, they have not ſo long continuance: And my Lord, you very well know (for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Gentleman at preſent, and ſome elſe that hear me) that he that heares a Treaſon, (for I do go now a little in his own way) he that hears a Treaſon, muſt not look back before he go to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and reveal it, and if he be at the Plough, he muſt leave his Plough; if this Gentleman were in his Pulpit he muſt leave his preaching, he that knowes a Treaſon, muſt go preſently and reveal it; there muſt be no repetition of Treaſon, My Lord, M. <hi>Love</hi>: my Lord, will be miſtaken in that. But truly, my Lord, I was very ſorry, conſidering the condition M. <hi>Love</hi> now ſtands in, to hear thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from him that he hath made to you in relation to the paſt and preſent Authority; my Lord, I am not willing to repeat them, M. <hi>Love</hi> muſt hear of it another time; truly, my Lord, here is little of ingenuity (all men will believe) in this Gentleman, that hath now laid it for a principle to himſelf, and all that ſhall hear him (and I think it not to be ſo Chriſtian, ſo ingenious) not to confeſs any thing any time; but that is ingenuity that what is proved, that he wil confeſs, and that is a high piece of ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, that thoſe things that are proved he wil ingenuouſly acknowledge; I, my Lord, I do not take that to be ingenuity neither in my Law, nor <hi>I</hi> believe in his Divinity wil it be. My Lord, there hath been a great deal of care and pains taken by M. <hi>Love</hi> to take in pieces the evidence, I ſhall not undertake now to joyn them together, but in convenient time I ſhall, I doubt not, for the ſatisfaction of the Court, and their judgements, who I muſt ſay, have been threatned by the Gentleman; and my Lord, I hope for the conviction of himſelf. My Lord, he knowes there are ſhrewd pieces againſt him that he hath acknowledged; but he would take them off one by one, but when they are put together, they will not be ſingle evidence, nor ſingle teſtimony, nor ſingle facts, but a continued reiteration and repetition of Treaſon, a continued and Series of time. My Lord you are pleaſed to obſerve that himſelf doth appear from 1648. to 1651. ſo that in 1648. 1649. 1650. and 1651. in all theſe years my Lord, there hath been this conſtant repetition and tranſacting of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I learn from him, and 'tis very true,—It is not good dallying with holy things, nor is it with States and Common-wealths, it is very bad dallying with them, thoſe that flutter there will burn their wings at laſt; and it is not Quirks of wit, nor ſtrains of ſenſe or non-ſenſe, will, my Lord, clear theſe things, it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My Lord, he hath deſired you will not hearken to private examinations, my Lord, I have ſaid ſo too, and there hath more been offered to you; but that which hath been publike and <hi>viva voce,</hi> all have been ſo. But ſurely, my Lord, I could wiſh this Gentleman, and all others of his profeſſion, would meddle in their own Sphere, and not to walk out of that to come and teach Court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what they ſhould do, to teach the Magiſtrate what is his duty. My Lord, I do hardly think it belongs to them ever in the Pulpit to do thoſe things: But to tell us we muſt not examine before-hand, and ask queſtions in private; My Lord, we cannot then be prepared for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons and Treaſons: And my Lord, J ſay, this confidence is much from his ignorance; for theſe things
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47192:39"/>
are very familiar, and muſt be continued to be done; ſo that theſe things are not well broached by him, and I do think he will ſay at laſt he underſtands not himſelf; and thoſe (I hope) that hear, my Lord, will ſay, I do not uſe it; for, my Lord, I muſt ſay, it muſt be otherwiſe in all well-governed Common-wealths. My Lord, he hath not denied, but acknowledged Meetings at his houſe more than once, twice or thrice: And truly, I did expect from this Gentleman that he would not have continued thoſe fearfull imprecations of calling God to witneſs, that he did never write Letter, nor ſend Letter, nor lend money. I had thought he would not have gone upon theſe equivocations; Did he never move other men to write? Did he never move others to lend money? It is not to ſay, this, and this I have not done; but I had thought he would have cleared himſelf totally of any guilt that way, either in relation to receiving, or hearing Letters read, or lending, or receiving money, or moving for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. My Lord, to put it upon a particular Caſe, this will not blinde the eyes of Juſtice, but you will be able to ſee it: He is pleaſed to ſay, my Lord, he will not lay it to the badneſs of the Witneſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but to the badneſs of their memories; my Lord, I hope in concluſion their memories will appear to be right, and ſome bodies conſcience elſe to be bad. And, my Lord, for to hear this ſaid by this Gentleman that is a Miniſter of the Goſpell, that it is a crime for theſe men to acknowledge their offences, this is ſtrange; I had thought the firſt ſtep to repentance had been confeſſion, and that it had been no offence for any man living that hath committed a fault, or that thought he had committed a fault, to acknowledge it. In my Law and Divinity <hi>I</hi> thought it ſo, and I have not learned otherwiſe; and ſhall this Gentleman take exceptions, becauſe theſe Gentlemen who have thought they have done amiſs, have acknowledged their errors, and have craved mercy? My Lord, I muſt ſay thus, if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve mercy, it is thoſe that doe acknowledge their offences, and crave mercy, and are ſorry for them; &amp; not thoſe that are obſtinate, &amp; bid defiance to juſtice, prove what you can, I wil confeſs nothing, that is not ſo conſciencious nor Chriſtian a way: And for the Witneſſes, I do wonder that Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> of any man, ſhould find fault with them; I cannot ſay they have taken ſweet counſell together, but I ſhrewdly ſuſpect they have taken very bad counſel together; theſe Gentlemen are of his own choice, and of his own companions, and thoſe that were converſant with him; and if you pleaſe to obſerve, at every word <hi>Will Drake,</hi> me-thinks that is a word of familiarity; but my Lord, for theſe, they were his companions, and whether I might ſay more, his houſhold friends or gueſts, but ſure they were in his houſe very often, and were private with him, and in his Chamber and Study, and to cover all theſe actions, and theſe treaſonable practiſes, and Letters, and Deſigns, here they muſt come to hear news, and this muſt cover it all; they come for nothing but news, and our contributions muſt be for charitable uſes, but you muſt not ask why or wherefore we lend money, but it is for charitable uſes; neither God nor man will be blinded in theſe things, and if theſe fig-leaves be ſown together, it will neither cover na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs nor treaſon. My Lord, M. <hi>Love</hi> hath ſaid, (and in that given judgement againſt himſelf) that either to treat or adviſe with the King of Scots in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he deteſts them both: My Lord, if he be guilty of both, then I hope, he doth deteſt and renounce himſelf, and then I think, he hath laid your judgement ſomewhat; his own having paſt firſt, yours will eaſily follow. My Lord, he confeſſes, that for this act of the 2. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1650. he was ignorant of it, and of the danger of it. My Lord, he very well knowes that ignorance is no excuſe, the Act is a publike Act, and hath been long printed, now ten moneths ſince, himſelf ſaith: And yet me-thinks I cannot reconcile that, (that he that goes to make others differ) that he knew not of this Act, and yet <hi>Sterks</hi> the Scotch Agent was baniſh'd upon this Act, and there was a contribution for him for his going away; the ſame Act that doth the one doth the other. My Lord, he hath been pleaſed to cite a ſaying of Cardinall <hi>Farneſus, That if he knew any part of him infected with Lutheranism, he would cut it off, and throw it into the fire</hi>; and ſo can he ſpeak truly of himſelf, he would do if he knew any thing of Malignancy by himſelf. My Lord, the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between him, and us is, what is Malignancy, I doubt we differ in that, I doubt his ſenſe of Malignancy; I am ſure by ſome words I ſhrewdly gheſs at, that I count that malignitie, and I hope all this Court, and all that hear me count that malignity, that I doubt his judgement leads him not to it, ſo I doubt we differ upon that.</p>
               <p>My Lord, he hath ſaid he was never an Incendiary, or evill inſtrument: <hi>I</hi> wiſh there were not cauſe for you to think otherwiſe: But ſurely the Gentleman hath made large imprecations, and hath ſpoken much for himſelf; but (I believe) he knowes there is ſo much juſtice here, that he expects not to bee believed in what he ſayes. If it were enough to accuſe, who ſhould be innocent? And if it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deny, who ſhould be guilty? he doth not expect to be believed for his word <hi>certainly</hi>; for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47192:39"/>
now he knowes he ſtands in another capacity, and as things are alledged and proved on both ſides, ſo he is to be believed and no otherwiſe. My Lord, he hath been pleaſed to reflect upon my ſelf in many particulars, yea and the Court knowes in what a capacity <hi>I</hi> ſtand here, as a ſervant to the State to doe my duty faithfully, and J muſt doe it, and yet I muſt ſay, it doth not become me to prompt Witneſſes; that word, my Lord, was not well ſpoken. He is pleaſed to ſay in the commendation of himſelf, that he hath a place in <hi>London</hi> where he hath a very good Congregation, and a very good competency of maintenance, and J heartily wiſh he had thought ſo really, and had kept himſelf ſingly to that; J do not think he will ſay that in the duty of his place, as a Miniſter of the Word, to preach, to inſtruct, to exhort, rebuke, reprove his people, or any under his charge, that ever the State did interpoſe or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with him, neither the Parliament nor the Common-wealth; then for Gods love, my Lord, why ſhould this man interpoſe or meddle with the State? Had you not enough to doe in your own cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Had you not charge enough lying upon you, but muſt you be going abroad, and put your ſickle into another mans harveſt? I will ſay, the State did never trouble the Gentleman in his duty, he did go on with as much peace and quietneſs as himſelf could deſire, we interrupted not him, let him reflect upon himſelf, whether others have dealt ſo kindely with him; when had he that liberty that now he hath had? You may be pleaſed to obſerve, himſelf ſaies twelve years ago he could not in three years in <hi>London</hi> get an admiſſion to be a Lecturer, and when he ſpoke in the Congregation-houſe at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he was expulſed there; he hath had no ſuch meaſure here: doth kindneſs provoke him to theſe things? thoſe that ſin againſt kindneſs are the higheſt Tranſgreſſors. What provocation hath this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had in his Miniſtery, that he could not follow that, and have let the Parliament and State alone? Doth he not receive breath here to live, and his livelihood to ſuſtain himſelf and his relations? Why ſhould you interpoſe to diſquiet your ſelf and the Common-wealth when they did not provoke you? And let all judge whether this ſhould not convince you; and let me ſay thus much, that you have dealt fooliſhly, and have gone beyond your bounds, and have not kept within your limits in what you have done in theſe things that you have acknowledged.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſpeak this, that thoſe may hear now that may not hear the other; for that which M. <hi>Love</hi> hath ſaid, we muſt have ſome time to recollect, and to ſpeak in the vindication of the proceedings of the State againſt this Gentleman, which though <hi>I</hi> think it needs not much, in reſpect of the Court that hath heard him ſay ſo much and confeſs ſo much as he hath done, yet for the lenitie of the State, that hath moved them to take care of their own preſervation: And I would not do it but that he hath ſtood upon all terms of defiance with juſtice and majeſty, and you have heard from a fellow Miniſter what he did the laſt day, and the principles he urgeth this day, which let me repeat again, there will be no living in ſociety, if theſe things be let alone. My Lord, it is much inſinuated by him, that his blood will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you and the Court, J would he had thought upon blood before theſe things had been ſo tranſacted by himſelf, I am afraid (between God and his own conſcience be it, and thoſe that have had correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with him) that much of this blood that hath been ſpilt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath been much by their means; you hear him ſay, that what was deſired by them (and in order to what it was) was, that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> might joyn with the Scottiſh Nation, and not go to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that was his conſcience: I do not know, his conſcience led him to meddle with thoſe things, to meddle with State-affairs. But my Lord, if it be ſo, and this hath been brought on by them, that one hath incouraged the King to joyn with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the other hath incouraged the <hi>Scots</hi> to joyn with the King by hopes of parties here, which he himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth now, was undertook in the name of a Presbyterian party, though I think and do believe it, for very many honeſt Presbyterians, that they would ſpit in his face if he ſhould ſay it of them; but I ſay theſe doings hath occaſioned the ſhedding of much blood, and a great deal of variance between the two Nations, and the Lord knowes when it will end. But my Lord, as he concluded for himſelf, you will be pleaſed, my Lord, to give me leave (though not in that way of conjuration as he hath done) to ſay for the State, I ſhall not prevent your judgements; but it is better that one man, than a State ſhould periſh. And if this man be guilty of the Treaſons proved againſt him, <hi>I</hi> believe himſelf will judge, he had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter periſh and ſuffer death, than the State ſhould periſh. All theſe actings of his have been underminings of the State clean through, carried on very cloſely and covertly in diſguiſes, and not diſcovered; but he that dances in a net will be catch't trapping at laſt. My Lord, before you give your judgment, you wil conſider that juſtice to the Common-wealth—</p>
               <p>So my Lord, I have added what my bad memory (J hope not bad conſcience) hath repeated to me, as might give ſome anſwer to what he hath ſaid: but ſince he hath been pleaſed to take ſuch pains to run
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47192:40"/>
through all and every one of the evidence ſo exactly, and hath had three dayes given him for it: my Lord, I ſhall ask but one for my ſelf, and for thoſe that are the Councell of the Common-wealth. My Lord, this is all <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay at preſent to you, and ſhall ſay no more till next meeting.</p>

               <p>But again in this point, for the Presbyterian Government, if it be rectified, doubtleſs it tends to the peace of this Nation, and all places, but not with a Scotch limitation, I deny that; nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by a Scotch Covenant.</p>
               <p>The next thing is this, becauſe you often fall upon diſtinctions of the Law, and that you are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Law; the more to blame you, that profeſs the learning of the Law of God; for there is no Law in <hi>England,</hi> but is as really and truly the Law of God as any Scripture-phraſe that is by conſequence from the very Texts of Scripture; for there are very many conſequences reaſoned out of the Texts of Scripture; ſo is the Law of <hi>England</hi> the very conſequence of the very Decalogue it ſelf, and whatſoever is not conſonant to Scripture in the Law of <hi>England,</hi> is not the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the very books and learning of the Law; whatſoever is not conſonant to the Law of God in Scripture, or to right reaſon which is maintained by Scripture; whatſoever is in <hi>England,</hi> be it Acts of Parliament, Cuſtomes, or any Judiciall Acts of the Court, it is not the Law of <hi>England,</hi> but the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the party which did pronounce it, and you or any man elſe at Bar may ſo plead it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to profeſs you are knowing in the Laws of God, and yet to be ignorant of the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> when yet the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> be ſo purely the Lawes of God, as no Law in the world more practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call at this day, for you to be ignorant of them, it is not to your commendation, nor to any of your profeſsion.</p>
               <p>Then Sir, for your going on in theſe wayes. The Court with patience hath heard you (I think) two hours, or thereabouts, and you have done nothing but anticipated the Court; What? do you think they have not underſtandings, and judgements, and conſciences? They would have done it, they would have examined theſe Witneſſes preciſely, and would have compared them; but you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up all this time by way of anticipation; and in a Rhethoricall way to do it! let me tell you, that Orators among the Heathen have been the greateſt Incendiaries, and thoſe Orators in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that do not ſet their judgements upon right ends, they are the moſt unworthy men in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for there is no hereſies, murders, traiterous and treaſonable practiſes and attemptings, and all the higheſt wickedneſſes that ever were committed in Chriſtendome whatſoever, or in this Nation in particular, but they have had ſome of that profeſſion that have called themſelves Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Jeſuits of Jeſus, and the Prieſts of thoſe; and all theſe things and high actings have ſtill had ſome tincture of your Coat in them: Therefore it is not your Office can excuſe you; your Office is ſacred, as other Chriſtian Offices are, and you are no more Divines by your Office; but you are to remember, and you muſt know, that Chriſtian juſtice that you teach in the Pulpit, to act it in the Court is of a higher nature than preaching is: and therefore in this, that you ſhould advance your profeſſion beyond the Judicatories of this Land, know, that Judgement and Juſtice is the higheſt Religion in the world both in Chriſtendome and out of it: And this Sir, wee would have you know, that Lawyers Doctrine tends to this, and <hi>I</hi> hope hereafter you will be more obedient and better vers'd to know theſe grounds of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> by which now you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here.

               <p>MY Lord, The Priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> ſtands impeach'd before your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of High Treaſon, which impeachment hath been read before your Lordſhip and the Court. My Lord, by that he ſtands charged with High Treaſon, with ſeverall offences of High treaſon; That he in the years 1648, 1649, 1650, and 1651, with <hi>William Drake, Henery Jermin, Henry Piercy, John Gibbons, Edward Maſſey, Sylas Titus, and others his Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, did Traiterouſly, Wickedly, and Maliciouſly Confederate, Plot, and Endeavour to ſtir up a New and Bloody War in this Nation, and to ſubvert the Government now eſtabliſhed, without a King and Houſe of Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>That in the ſame years, ſince the death of the late King, he did with other his accomplices, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote</hi> Charls Stewart <hi>to be King of England, contrary to an Act of Parliament, before that time made, in this Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>That in the ſame years, he and his accomplices did Traiterouſly and Maliciouſly aid and aſſiſt the Nation of</hi> Scotland, <hi>to the end that they might invade this Common-wealth; and hath adhered to the forces raiſed by the enemies of this Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>That in the ſame time, between the month of</hi> March, <hi>and the firſt of</hi> June, <hi>this preſent month, he hath Troiterouſly and Maliciouſly held and maintained correſpondency, and intelligence by Letters, Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, Inſtructions and otherwiſe, with the enemies of this Common-wealth; and to the prejudice of this Nation; And in particular with</hi> Charls Stewart, <hi>and the late Queen his Mother, and with</hi> Jermin, <hi>and</hi> Piercy, <hi>and other perſons of Councel abiding with</hi> Charls Steward.</p>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>That he hath likewiſe held correſpondency and Intelligence with the Scottiſh Nation, prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to this Common-wealth, and to the end they might invade and bring a Bloody Warr upon this Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>Theſe Treaſons and Traiterous and Wicked Practices of the Priſoner at the Bar, were and are to the apparent hazard of the publick Peace of this Common-Wealth, and Free-State, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and People of</hi> England; <hi>and in contempt and violation of the Lawes of the Land, and contrary to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Acts of Parliament, in ſuch Caſes made and provided.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, There hath been ſeverall Witneſſes, and Proofs of theſe particular Charges againſt the Priſoner. And, my Lord, I do conceive that there hath been ſuch proof made, that in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips judgment, he will appear to be guilty of all theſe particular actings; But, my Lord, I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the proof, only make a Summary Relation of the beginning and continuance of this Plot and deſigne.</p>
               <p>My Lord, This Plot did begin very ſuddenly after it pleaſed God to take away the chief enemy of this Nation. The King died in <hi>January</hi> 1648, and this Plot began in <hi>February,</hi> the very next month following: And in the ſame month, my Lord, the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation did proclaim <hi>Charls Stewart</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and they did not ſtop there, but proclaimed him likewiſe King of <hi>England</hi>; and then, my Lord, this Plot began here; for in the month of <hi>February,</hi> the next month after the King dyed, the meeting was at the <hi>Swan</hi> at <hi>Dow-gate,</hi> where were ſeverall of the Correſpondents at that time; as <hi>Drake, Huntington, Titus,</hi> and others, and the end of that meeting was to contrive a way that they might agree the King and the Scotiſh Nation; that was the end of their meeting at that time.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Within a few dayes after that, they met again all theſe ſeverall perſons, at the <hi>White-Hart</hi> in <hi>Bread-ſtreet,</hi> and to the ſame purpoſe; and at length it was reſolved to make their addreſſes to the Queen, and to <hi>Piercy,</hi> and <hi>Jermin</hi> (firſt it was the King himſelf) for a complyance between the King and the <hi>Scots</hi>; letters were ſent accordingly, and ſeverall meetings, and ſeverall returns of meſſages were had of them: My Lord, at length it was reſolved, that they ſhould ſend Meſſengers to

the King at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and agreed upon one <hi>Titus</hi>; and they raiſed money and gave it to <hi>Titus</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the journey. My Lord, <hi>Titus</hi> accordingly went in the month of May, One thouſand ſix hundred forty nine, and returned in <hi>Auguſt</hi> following. After he had done his negotiation there, he returned to <hi>Calice</hi>; but being afraid that this wicked plot was diſcovered, by reaſon of letters that were intercepted, he durſt not come into <hi>England</hi>; but ſent letters to deſire ſome correſpondents might be ſent to <hi>Calice.</hi> My Lord, all this time I do not finde that the proof diſcovers the priſoner at the Bar to be any actor, or preſent at any meeting hitherto: But when theſe letters came from <hi>Titus,</hi> then the letters were brought to Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe; which is the firſt time I finde him by proof to be preſent. The letters were read in his houſe, and in his Studie, as ſome of the witneſſes ſay, that there were preſent: and it was then agreed, my Lord, that <hi>Alford</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Calice</hi> to <hi>Titus.</hi> My Lord, accordingly he went, and there <hi>Titus</hi> did communicate unto him the Affairs that paſs'd at <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey:</hi> Within four or five dayes after, <hi>Alford</hi> returns again, and where ſhould the meeting be but at Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe again? where Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and divers of the accomplices were in his houſe, a letter from the King was read; the Dyary, the Narrative from <hi>Titus</hi> likewiſe was read there; and there was the conſultation wat ſhould be done, and what further courſe they ſhould take to joyn the King and the Scots together. My Lord, afterward they did agree that there ſhould be ſome ſent to treat with the King at <hi>Breda</hi>; The Inſtructions were drawn in Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, (I think one witneſſe ſayes ſo) and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> preſent; money was raiſed, and <hi>Mr. Love</hi> himſelf did ſpeak to one of the witneſſes to raiſe money, which was <hi>Far: Far</hi> accordingly did bring in five pounds, and laid it down upon <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> Table, <hi>Mr. Love</hi> being preſent then in the room.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall not trouble you with the relation of more particulars; But my Lord, I conceive, that Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> doth upon theſe proofs ſtand guiltie of endeavouring to promote the King to be King of <hi>England</hi>: For, my Lord, what ſhould be the end of uniting the King and the Scots together, after that the Scots had proclaimed <hi>Charls Stewart</hi> King of England, but that they might come in a warlike man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to invade this Nation, and to ſet up his Authority as King among us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, I conceive (I ſhall ſubmit to your Lordſhips judgment) that he is guilty of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence from a profeſs'd Enemy. The intelligence is (my Lord) that divers letters were ſent, and theſe letters were read in his preſence, as himſelf doth confeſſe he was at the reading of divers letters, and yet did not conſent to them; and thereupon makes it as it were but miſpriſion of Treaſon. My Lord, I conceive that this is apparently Treaſon: For if letters were ſent to one perſon, and did occaſionally come into another mans hand, and he conceale them, being not ſent to him, There per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure it is but miſpriſion of Treaſon. But when there are ſent to theſe particular perſons let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the King and Scots, and divers perſons in hoſtility againſt the Commonwealth of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and received by the Confederates in <hi>Maſter Loves</hi> houſe, and there were read and debated, though they did not agree to ſome particulars, yet they are Actors: They are — in the very intelligence it ſelfe; and did likewiſe return ſeverall letters.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Lord,</hi> this Intelligence was with the Scotiſh Nation, which truly, my Lord, I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hardly an Engliſh man, that had the blood of an Engliſh man running in his veins, would joyn in confederacie with that Nation, of all the Nations of the world, againſt this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: a Nation that hath been known (and I am ſure, the priſoner at the Bar is well read in the Hiſtories and Stories of this Nation) to have been a conſtant Enemie to this Nation in all ages through the memory of all Hiſtories; and, my lord, of late, not three yeers ſince, came and invaded this Nation with a Puiſſant Army, which it pleaſed God to deliver us from: and this the Priſoner could not be ignorant of, that we had lately a fight with them at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> that hoſtility could not be unknowne unto the priſoner at the Bar neither: and yet for all that, to confederate with a Nation, that were ſuch conſtant enemies to us. My lord, I could not conceive it had been in the heart of an Engliſh man, much leſſe in a Miniſter and Preacher of the Goſpel among us.</p>
               <p>My lord, There are ſome particular charges upon him more then upon any of the reſt; After <hi>Drake</hi> fled away, being doubtfull that his ſecret Traiterous Plot would be diſcovered, <hi>Mr. Love</hi> ſupplied his room: all the meetings, and confederacies, and letters, and Agitations in this buſineſſe were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> houſe, himſelfe being preſent. And, my Lord, mony as I ſaid before, by <hi>Mr. Love</hi> himſelf deſired to be raiſed, for the furthering of this deſign, and ſeverall ſumms of mony were raiſed.

               <speaker>Sir Th. Wither.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> Defence which he made for himſelf, as he did it for his life, ſo he took a great deal of pains in it, and was very accurate in the Defence he made, eſpecially in the Witneſſes. My Lord, I ſhall not take upon me (for it is not my charge at this time) to reply unto, the whole Defence that <hi>Mr. Love</hi> made.</p>
               <p>My Lord, That I ſhall ſay, ſhall be in two particulars, for <hi>Mr. Love</hi> divided that which he ſaid into four parts; the firſt concerning the Charge; the ſecond concerning the Witneſſes and Teſtimony; and 3. concerning himſelf; and 4. concerning ſome propoſalls to the Court.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall onely meddle with that which is concerning the Witneſſes; and 2. to ſome part of that he ſaid concerning himſelf; <hi>I</hi> ſhall only reply as to theſe two, and the reſt I ſhall leave to Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turny Generall, that better knows what is for the advantage of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall begin concerning the Witneſſes to clear them (for now we are in our reply for the Common-wealth.) <hi>Mr. Love,</hi> who did profeſſe a very great deal of ignorance in the Laws of the land yet he did inſinuate ſomething that implied ſome knowledge of them, in that, my Lord, he took ſome exceptions to the Witneſſes; my Lord, I take it that theſe exceptions were:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the witneſſes were not <hi>Probi teſtes &amp; legales,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 2. That they were <hi>Participes criminis,</hi> and that indeed is included in the other.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Firſt I ſhall ſpeak to this, that the witneſſes produced againſt him, are <hi>Legales Teſtes</hi>: they are competent witneſſes, and ſufficient witneſſes, without exception againſt them. I ſhall firſt ſpeak to that they are <hi>Teſtis legales,</hi> for Mr. <hi>Love</hi> did object, that they themſelves confeſſ'd themſelves to be guilty of the ſame crimes, and ſo their confeſſion is upon the matter, a conviction, and ſo they are convicted of the crimes in which they are witneſſes againſt him; and ſo are not competent witneſſes.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall clear this; under favour, I take it they are very clear and good witneſſes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Exceptions. And, my Lord, this I take to be a very plain caſe, the caſe which is in our Common Law; the caſe is —which proves it fully. For if a man be accuſed of High-Treaſon, indicted of High Treaſon, and will confeſſe the Indictment, and become an Approver, yet he may be a witneſſe againſt all thoſe parties guilty of the ſame Treaſons with himſelfe, he is <hi>particeps crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> with them, and they with him; and yet this man thus becoming an Approver, will at Common Law be a witneſſe, and a legal and good witneſſe againſt them.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall a little open that, becauſe it clears the caſe. My Lord, an Approver can only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it is true; that is when a man is indicted of High Treaſon and other his Accomplices with him; and he upon the Indictment ſayes it is true, and then deſires he may have ſome thing aſſigned to him, and then hee accuſes ſuch and ſuch perſons of the ſame crimes; in this caſe this man after he hath confeſt the Indictment, and takes his corporall oath to reveall all Treaſons he knowes in the Indictment, (for he can accuſe no further) after this done he ſhall be a witneſſe, he is a witneſſe againſt thoſe with whom he is <hi>Particeps criminis.</hi> Nay, my Lord, it is of merit and Juſtice that he ſhall have this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he ſhall be pardoned his life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now that I prove to you, becauſe that ſhews the reaſon; that even the man, after Indictment and Confeſſion, yet being an Approver, ſhall be an Accuſer of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, thoſe that were <hi>Participes criminis</hi> with him, and a good witneſs; and the reaſon of that goes to this caſe in hand. For although theſe men had a hand in the ſame plot and deſign with him, and have confeſt, and did confeſs it upon evidence, that they were there preſent, and did many things; yet I take it they are clear, competent, and good witneſſe; and that is no Objection againſt them, that they are <hi>Participes criminis.</hi> My Lord, if the law were otherwiſe, it were impoſſible to prove many offences; for many offences cannot be proved, but by ſome men that had a hand in them. Jn an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſe an action of Treſpaſs and falſe impriſonment, if three men are guilty of it, it is an uſuall thing in Courts of Juſtice to admit one of them a witneſſe; true, they are not parties in the action, and ſo may be witneſſes; for theſe things may be ſo ſecretly done otherwiſe, that their Treaſons could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be revealed to recover againſt the priſoner.</p>
               <p>There is a caſe, I think in all our knowledge, it is the caſe of the Earle of <hi>Caſtle-haven,</hi> he was accuſed of a very grievous Fact, the witneſſes which came againſt him, were one or two Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that were <hi>Participes criminis</hi> in the very ſame fact, and theſe men by the Opinion of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47192:42"/>
Judges were competent witneſſes. My Lord, he was arraigned, indicted, and convicted, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death: nay, it is very true, that one of theſe perſons was afterwards hanged for the ſame offence: ſo that I think, under favour, as to that, I take it, that they are cleer and good witneſſes, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that objection.</p>
               <p>The next objection is, that they were not <hi>probi teſtes:</hi> Truly for that, my Lord, I muſt appeal to your judgment in it, whether theſe men be not <hi>probi teſtes, &amp; houeſtes</hi> too; for in caſe of an approver, as I mentioned before, that man that accuſes his brethren upon the ſame Treaſon, it is ſaid, that of merit and juſtice, the King ought to grant him his pardon: For they that diſcover the Traitors againſt the Commonwealth, theſe certainly are <hi>probi teſtes,</hi> and good Common-wealths men: and ſo I take it, that this is no objection againſt them in that, but as before they were <hi>legales teſtes,</hi> ſo they are <hi>probi teſtes.</hi> My Lord, I mention theſe things, to ſhew that the witneſſes for the Commonwealth are good and competent in this caſe.</p>
               <p>The next objection touching theſe witneſſes, is, that though they be admitted for good witneſſe; yet there is not to any one fact two witneſſes: There is not any one of the moſt criminall parts of the Charge proved by two witneſſes: And ſo as before they were incompetent in regard of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and participancy of their crimes, ſo now he would make them incompetent for want of number.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall firſt agree to the ground of this objection; for truly, my Lord, I take it, that it is by the common and ancient law of <hi>England,</hi> that in caſes of Treaſon there muſt be two witneſſes; and it is by a law more ancient then that, that is, by the law of God. But my Lord, it is true, the law of this Land is explained by ſeverall Statutes; the Statute of the firſt yeer of <hi>Edward the Sixth,</hi> and the fifth yeer, and the ſecond yeer of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>; My Lord, I take it, upon all theſe Statutes, the one Statute ſayes, To accuſe another, there muſt be two witneſſes; I take it, the accuſer and witneſs are all one; that is, the ſame that in one Statute is called a Witneſſe, in another is called an Accuſer. But there muſt be two, that is the objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But then give mee leave to conſider this Caſe, and to conſider how thoſe two witneſſes ſhall be. My Lord, I ſay under favour, that in a Caſe that conſiſts of a complicated fact; that is, the reiteration of many actions, my Lord, I conceive none of theſe lawes are to be intended, that for every of the particular facts there ſhould be two witneſſes: that cannot be the intention of any of theſe lawes, that in every particular fact, that is to ſay, whether <hi>Mr. Love</hi> was preſent at the reading of the letters, if you have one witneſſe to that, another for the writing of them, another to the ſending of them; though theſe three witneſſes ſpeak to ſeverall parts of the buſineſſe, yet they are a concurrent teſtimony, for all agree to the fact. I well remember, my Lord, a Caſe in the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> againſt <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> I think there was an information againſt him for Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and extorting of Fees: The matter came in the concluſion, that one man proved a bribe, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man proved a bribe; one proved a bribe of forty pounds, and another a bribe of forty pounds: but there were ſeverall witneſſes to ſeverall bribes. The queſtion now was, whether he took bribes or no? And theſe tending to the ſame generall Charge, it was the opinion of all the Judges, that he did extort and take bribes. The one witneſſe ſpake to one bribe, and another to another; and in that Caſe, as two witneſſes, made good a charge againſt an offender, yet in that caſe it was taken, that where witneſſes, though they ſpeak not in every particular, yet all tending to the ſame generall Charge of Bribery, theſe were taken for plurall witneſſes, and that was a good conviction. That was the opinion of the Judges then. I mention this Caſe onely for an inſtance to expreſſe my ſelf in this: For <hi>Mr. Love</hi> cannot expect, that to every particular thing laid to his charge two witneſſes ſhould be produc'd. But my Lord, when one witneſſe proves, this thing he hath done, this letter hath he written; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that another thing he hath done, which all tend to the Treaſon; now theſe are more witneſſes, and two or three witneſſes of the ſame thing, though not to the ſame individuall thing it is —. So that upon the matter they are concurrent witneſſes in this complicated fact, though not concurrent in this or that circumſtance; for that is impoſſible almoſt in any action to be done.</p>
               <p>But then <hi>Mr. Love</hi> did further inlarge this objection; which was out of a ſaying he had, That in caſe of Treaſon, <hi>Probationes opportent eſſe luce clariores:</hi> The proof muſt be as cleer as the Sun. Truly, my Lord, it is very hard, that works of darkneſſe ſhould need ſo much light for diſcovery, and that ſo cleer a proof ſhould be neceſſary when the things are done in darkneſs and ſecrecie. My Lord, I think, under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, though in this particular we have our witneſs, as I do take it, to ſpeak very plainly and cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for it is their owne faults if they doe not, for they were preſent at the meetings, at the Conſultations and Debates. But yet I do obſerve, That in this caſe things were carryed on in a very
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47192:42"/>
secret manner; for I do obſerve firſt, at theſe meetings all of them were done under a diſguiſe, every thing acted in this buſineſſe. I obſerve it upon evidence, firſt, That the very meetings themſelves, They go under the Title of Prayer and Faſting; for ſo <hi>Huntington</hi> told you, he was ſpoke to go to prayer at Mr. <hi>Love</hi>'s houſe. The Contributions made for raiſing of money, for ſending of Meſſages and diſpatches, was under the diſguiſe of charitable uſes; ſo that here was darkneſſe all along. And then for the Letters, there was no names ſubſcribed to them, all were done without names, only the letter <hi>L.</hi> was upon one. And the place truly, I muſt ſay, that was obſcure too; for what man would have thought, that the place of meeting ſhould have been Mr. <hi>Love</hi>'s houſe, a man that hath been ſo much for, and ſhewed ſo great an affection to the Parliament, as he ſaid himſelf in ſubſtance? a man would ſooner have thought to have found this Treaſon in any Cellar in <hi>London,</hi> then in Mr. <hi>Love</hi>'s houſe. For the Instructions, for the directions and Diſpatches, ſome were ſent in Table-books, written in Sack in a Table-book. But, my Lord, I am afraid in the concluſion, the Letters will be written in blood. But, my Lord, this I do obſerve, that through theſe difficulties, though we paſt through our Evidence, yet your Lordſhip heard how plain the proof was in moſt particulars.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall ſay no more as to theſe Witneſſes, becauſe the other part of anſwering the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes belongs to the Atturney Generall; for Maſter <hi>Love</hi> went over all the particular Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>My Lord; I ſhall only ſay one thing, and that is this, concerning Mr. <hi>Love</hi> himſelf; and it is only concerning this point. My Lord, <hi>Mr. Love</hi> himſelfe did ſay, He would be ingenuous ſo far as he took himſelfe to be guilty. But, my Lord, I know your Lordſhip and the Court obſerves, that that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity did follow the proof that was for the Common-wealth. My Lord, he confeſſes he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at them, he was ſilent after all theſe Meetings and Debates, I mean the meetings after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at his own houſe; for I ſpeak not of them that were at <hi>Dow-gate,</hi> for there is no proof that he was there. My Lord, this he confeſſes, and this he ſayes is miſpriſion of Treaſon. Truly, my Lord, I muſt be bold to differ from him in that particular; I take it that that he confeſſes is High Treaſon. I ſhall ſpeak a little to Miſpriſion of Treaſon, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Miſpriſion of Treaſon is when a man hath notice of a thing that is Treaſon, and hee conceals it; now, my Lord, under favour, the concealment muſt not be long, it muſt not ſleep long with him. My Lord, I remember an Axiome an Author hath in our Law, and that is <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi>; he hath a diſcourſe of miſpriſion of Treaſon, he hath it in Latine—ſayes hee, <hi>He that knows a Treaſon, he muſt not ſtay in one place a day and a night, but he muſt go on, he muſt go toward the Magiſtrate. Nay</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>though he have moſt urgent buſineſſe yet he muſt ſet it aſide and go on, and muſt not ſtay in any place till he hath revealed it.</hi> Nay he ſayes further, <hi>He ought not to look back till he hath given information to the Magiſtrate</hi>; The man that doth not after this manner forth-with reveal it, this only is miſpriſion of Treaſon. But conſidering this caſe of Mr. <hi>Loves,</hi> now confeſſing the fact, he takes it to be miſpriſion of Treaſon, but I take it to be Treaſon it ſelfe. My Lord, I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what <hi>Mr. Love</hi> did; he was at theſe meetings; theſe meetings were continued for divers dayes, and months. My Lord, was there any diſcovery made by <hi>Mr. Love</hi>? was there any revelation of his to any Magiſtrate? Did he tell it to any man? Nay, Did he confeſſe it upon his Examination, when examined? Nay, Did he not deny it when he came to the Bar before your Lord-ſhip? Can this bee ſaid to be miſpriſion of Treaſon, that a man ſhould hold ſo long in Treaſon and not reveal it? My Lord, As every Treaſon includes a miſpriſion of Treaſon in it; ſo I conclude, that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion of Treaſon may grow up to treaſon it ſelfe. Now when a man ſhall ſo long ſleep upon it, and be violent in it, and not reveal it, I take this miſpriſion of Treaſon growes up into Treaſon it ſelf.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall ſay no more of that, but I ſhall conclude, becauſe the other part lies upon Mr. Atturney Generall, who is better able to do it; onely one thing <hi>I</hi> ſhall take notice of to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and I am troubled at it; and that is, That as he ſaith, that he that hath been ſo much for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, with whom he hath gone along, and took ſweet counſell together, and hath been Active for, and Paſſive with through all the paſſages of the late Warres, that he ſhould ſuffer from them, this he ſaies, ſtuck very much upon him. But, my Lord, for him that hath been ſo much for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſo familiar with their proceedings, that hath been ſo active for them, and hath ſuffered ſo much for them; my lord, for him to kick the heel againſt the Parliament, for him after all this, now even in the Infancy of this Commonwealth, that this child ſhould be deſtroyed, and by one with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47192:43"/>
whom we have took ſweet counſell together. And by one I may ſay this, that though he had no hand in making this Common-wealth, yet I dare ſay he had in the preparations to it; for himſelf all along hath gone with the Parliament; ſo that my Lord, I take this to be an objection againſt him. But, my Lord, I ſhall ſay no more in it, but refer the other part to M. <hi>Atturney-Generall.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, I am ſorry M. <hi>Love</hi> hath given the occaſion of this meeting, and of my ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at preſent, <hi>I</hi> could much rather have wiſhed to have been ſilent; but now I am drawn hither, I am forced to it. M. <hi>Love,</hi> my Lord, in the beginning of his Triall did deſire God ſo to aſſiſt him, that he might go through it with gravity, meekneſs and wiſdom, as became a Miniſter of the Goſpell: <hi>I</hi> wiſh that God had heard his prayers, that he had ſo gone through it; what he hath done, the Court hath obſerved.</p>
               <p>My Lord, in that part I have to do, I do heartily deſire <hi>I</hi> might doe it with faithfulneſs to you, and the duty of the place <hi>I</hi> ought to diſcharge, and to the Court.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the work that this day lies upon me is, to reply ſomewhat to what was ſaid by M. <hi>Love</hi> in his own Defence, and to make a faithful repetition to the Court, and to doe the Witneſſes and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner right; to repeat that, and that onely that hath been ſaid: And in that, that J may do no wrong to miſlead the Court, and offer nothing to the prejudice of the Witneſſes, nor to the priſoner. And truly, my Lord, I ſhall not (in his own words) have any tortured Collections, nor any inferences, nor ſtrains of wit; he hath ſhowed his Oratory in his defence. My Lord, <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſhow the ſimplicity of Law in the Reply.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the Charge hath been repeated to you, and for that inſiſted upon by M. <hi>Love</hi> for the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and teſtimony you have had anſwer; I ſhall not trouble you, there hath been pains taken in it, my Lord, I think all men were ſatisfied that it was clear enough; yet to make it more clear. <hi>M. Love,</hi> my Lord, inſiſted upon one thing more, and that is upon point of Time, and the point of the Juriſdiction of the Court, which (by your favour) I ſhall firſt begin with.</p>
               <p>He ſtands charged he ſayes, for crimes done in 1648. 1649. 1650. and 1651. and thoſe crimes he ſayes, were before this Court was, or had a being, and ſo had not power to take cognizance of them.</p>
               <p>That my Lord, J ſhall endeavour to clear to you, and I think in much cleerneſs, cleerer than the light, as he will have his evidence. He ſtands charged (I ſay) poſitively, my Lord, with no crime before a Law was emitted, that did give an inhibition and was publiſh'd and known. He ſtands charged with no crime before the Law was publiſh'd, that did declare what the crime was, and gave notice to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</p>
               <p>My Lord, that that was firſt, was the Law that was made the thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> 1648. that doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, (and upon that Law I ſhall fetch the foundation and riſe of this Treaſon) that whoever ſhall proclaim, declare, publiſh, or any way promote <hi>Ch. Stewart,</hi> or any other perſon to be King, or chief Magiſtrate of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> without conſent in Parliament, ſhall be adjudged a Traytor, and ſhall ſuffer pains of death as a Traytor: Here was this Law publiſh'd, and notice given what every man ſhould truſt to, and I may ſay my Lord, Obedience expected: Againſt this Law hath M. <hi>Love</hi> tranſgreſsed, and under favour, in a very high meaſure; ſo that, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> charge him upon this Law, and ſince this Law was made, and to this Law there is no limitation of time for men to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned for it: and for this Law, it is in expreſs terms given in Commiſſion to this Court to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of it; ſo that I think, this is a little clear to him.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the next is a Law publiſhed in <hi>July,</hi> 1649<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is entituled, <hi>An Act declaring what offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall be Treaſon</hi>; that I think he is not ignorant of, though he pretended to be ignorant of another. My Lord, that Law likewiſe, though it was before this Court was erected, yet this Court hath by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of the Commiſſion power to take cognizance of it; and this Court in theſe things is not like other Judicatories, that when offences are committed, the State takes care to appoint Courts and Judges to judge thoſe offences; let it be no offence to M. <hi>Love</hi> if this Court were erected eſpecially to try him, but the Law was not made eſpecially to puniſh him; for the Law was made before, and the offence committed before, and ſo I think, in all <hi>England</hi> the offences are committed before the Judges go their Circuits and have their Commiſsions.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the next is the Law that conſtitutes this Court, and ſayes in what particulars this Court
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47192:43"/>
hath power to take notice of offences, beſides thoſe mentioned before, and the laſt concerning the Scots; that was but lately which Mr. <hi>Love</hi> ſayes he was ignorant of; but he was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant to doe ſomewhat againſt it. My Lord, theſe are for the lawes that <hi>Mr. Love</hi> is impeach't upon.</p>
               <p>The next thing that I have to doe is, (and in that I humbly beg your favour, That as I am now to doe Juſtice (if I may ſo ſay) to the Court, and to bee faithfull to my Truſt and the Duty impoſed upon mee) to repeat the evidence right unto you; and in that, as the Gentleman the Priſoner at the Barre, hath had that favour from you to have a Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by him to take all that was ſaid of all parties; ſo, my lord, by your favour, wee have had ſome here to help our memories; with whom I have conferred, and by the help of their Notes and our memories, my lord, wee thinke wee have faithfully tranſcribed that which was ſaid by the Witneſſes. And, my lord, I humbly crave favour, as not now being a private examination, to be read, but a publike teſtimony in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Love</hi> himſelf, and the Court; I hope it is not private now, but I may uſe notes to do him right, and may read thoſe things that they teſtified upon their oath here.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, my lord, I ſhall according to my beſt judgement do him no wrong: For the firſt, I ſhall acknowledge it was but a heare-ſay, and that from <hi>Drake,</hi> of letters ſent from <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Presbyterian party in <hi>England,</hi> to let them know what had been done of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming the King there, and that care ſhould bee taken for their Intereſt. This I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge was but a heare-ſay; but that which followed not long after that time, my lord, was poſitive, and there (my lord) I ſhall begin the riſe of this; and thus as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by my fellowes that are Counſell here, though there was not acting, nor preſence, nor knowing, yet (my lord) under a ſecond, it will appeare hee was conſenting and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and ſo guilty of the firſt fact: My lord, there was a meeting at <hi>Dowgate,</hi> I ſuppoſe you remember it full well, it hath been ſeverall times repeated to you by ſeverall perſons, and <hi>Titus</hi> the party now beyond the Seas, and <hi>Drake,</hi> and other Traytors fled, were prime ſticklers for this, and moved others to come in and to bee there preſent, and heare what was the deſigne. As J did crave your Lordſhips favour, ſo I ſhall, that I may not (as hee ſayes) truſt to fickle nor roveing memory, that I may bee faithfull to read to you that I have taken, and what was ſaid by them; <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>Mr. Love</hi> hath by him one that can controle me if I doe not right.</p>
               <p>I begin with this meeting at <hi>Dowgate,</hi> and continued at the White-Hart in <hi>Breadſtreet, Alford</hi> gave you this evidence, <hi>That one morning hee was wiſhed by</hi> Drake <hi>to goe to the Swan at Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; when hee came there, there was one</hi> Titus <hi>who gave relation of the good diſpoſition of the Prince, and how inclineable hee was to take the Covenant, and to caſt off the Cavaliering party, and thoſe about him, if there were opportunity found, how to make him know there was a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble partie in</hi> England <hi>that would ſticke cloſe to the ends of the Covenant; and upon that wee that were there did thinke wee were bound in duty, in relation to the Covenant, to preſs the Prince to take it, and to proſecute the ends of it. And for that</hi> Titus <hi>ſaid, if wee would appoint another meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee would draw up ſomething in way of Application of the Presbyterian party to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee afterwards met at the Beare in Breadſtreet, and there hee drew fourth ſomething hee had framed to that purpoſe, and read it, and it was agreed upon to bee ſent over to the Prince, the ſubſtance of it was to preſſe the Prince to apply himſelfe to take the Covenant, and to proſecute the ends of it, and to caſt off all the Cavaliers and that party about him, which had brought ſo much miſchiefe to his Father, and would doe likewiſe to him: And this (I believe) was ſent over, for</hi> Titus <hi>undertooke to ſend it over. Wee aſked him how the Prince could bee made to believe that this coming from ſo inconſiderable a party as wee were, ſhould come under the notion of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian party of</hi> England; <hi>hee ſaid hee would undertake it by meanes of my Lord</hi> Piercie. And my lord, <hi>I</hi> think you doe remember there was one <hi>Maſon</hi> ſervant of <hi>Piercy,</hi> that was ſent over hither, ſo teſtified by ſome, to reconcile the Royall and Presbyterian party. This <hi>Maſon</hi> (my lord) was <hi>Piercies</hi> Servant, ſo teſtified here by divers, My lord, here is now the foundation,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47192:44"/>
                  <hi>Drake</hi> is he that moves <hi>Alford</hi>; and <hi>Titus</hi> I may ſuppoſe the mover of <hi>Drake,</hi> and both of them fled at Traytors.</p>
               <p>My Lord, If they were Traitours, and this is Treaſon; then whoever had a hand in carrying on this Deſign, himſelfe is a Traitor, and his Action is Treaſon. My Lord, this is the Teſtimony of <hi>Alford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, There is another witneſſe, and that is, lieut. Colonel <hi>Bains,</hi> who I think was preſent only at this meeting, and had enough of it, and did leave it; and yet was preſent at this, and gave in evidence of what was there propoſed. I think he was preſent at no other meeting, he was ſatisfied this was too much; his Teſtimony, as I take it, was this, for I ſhall read it, that I may do no wrong to no party: <hi>Bains</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was alſo propoſed by</hi> Titus, <hi>that ſomething ſhould be done in order, to reſtoring the Presbyterian Intereſt, by Application to the Prince, and to aſſure him that he had a conſiderable party in</hi> England, <hi>which look'd upon it as a duty, and lying upon all of them by the Covenant. And that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſome what ſhould be done by ſome Parliament men, Miniſters and Citizens, that were leading active men, that he might have an aſſurance, that ſomewhat would be done for him: and ſomewhat to the Queen,</hi> Jermin <hi>and</hi> Piercy, <hi>whom,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>were their friends.</hi> This, my Lord, was that which <hi>Titus</hi> ſaid at this meeting; and teſtifyed by <hi>Bains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, There is another, Colonell <hi>Barton,</hi> who was produced as an Evidence. My Lord, I think that he ſpoke not much more then to this, and gave off here. My Lord, his Teſtimony was this; for I do conceive, under favour, we have taken the very preciſe words ſpoken by them: And, my Lord, ſo as ſpoken and taken, ſo written, and ſo, my Lord, read to you: <hi>Barton,</hi> my Lord, ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Drake <hi>would have him to be a Meſſenger,</hi> and to that purpoſe there were ſeverall meetings at the <hi>Swan</hi> and <hi>White-Hart.</hi> This was what <hi>Barton</hi> teſtified.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Then there was Major <hi>Huntington,</hi> which was at this meeting, and one more at <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> houſe, which he full well remembers. My Lord, <hi>Huntington</hi> ſayes this, That about <hi>March</hi> 1648. (in <hi>January</hi> was the Law publiſhed) <hi>Alford</hi> told him, that <hi>Titus</hi> was in town, and that he was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come from beyond the Seas from their friends, <hi>Maſſy, Bunce, Graves</hi> and others, and that <hi>Titus</hi> was to meet the next day at <hi>Dow-gate,</hi> where he fell into high praiſes of the Prince, and told them that though he was taking unhandſome courſes, yet they had great hopes his inclinations were otherwiſe. <hi>Titus</hi> ſaid further, he feared his inclining to the Iriſh, unleſſe ſomething ſhould be gotten from his friends here to divert him; that you remember was <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> charity too, as you will hear anon. <hi>Titus</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to get letters from perſons of honour, to perſwade him to a good opinion of the <hi>Scots,</hi> to take the Covenant, and to joyn with them.</p>
               <p>Afterward they met at the <hi>White Hart</hi> in <hi>Bread-ſtreet,</hi> where <hi>Titus</hi> declared that he ſhould gain theſe letters, and hoped to ſet ſomething a foot to the ſame effect; and there ſaid, they were confident they could ſee no way under Heaven for him elſe, but by taking the Covenant, and engaging the Scots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>England</hi>; to which purpoſe he drew forth a Paper, purporting that they were bound in honeſty, conſcience and loyalty, to maintain and help him to his juſt Rights, if he would go along and joyn with the Covenanting party in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, This is that now that hath paſt in proof by evidence concerning this firſt meeting at the <hi>Swan</hi> at <hi>Dowgate,</hi> which I do humbly conceive was the riſe and foundation of what followes afterward. And this, my Lord, if true, I ſuppoſe no man will ſay, but that was Treaſon that was tranſacted there. I do not ſay, my Lord, that <hi>Mr. Love</hi> was preſent at it, nor as yet, can I ſay, knowing of it, but what followes after, my lord, will bring him in danger.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Here, you have heard, was this meeting, and what was propounded to be done here, and how active <hi>Titus</hi> was, and that he was to go (you have heard by the Teſtimony) to <hi>Piercy</hi>; and it is not doubted by any but he did go thither; it is not doubted by any but he was ſent and did go thither. To that purpoſe I ſhall now read you two witneſſes more, which I have cauſed to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed too, in the words as ſpoken by them, as I do conceive, that is <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Far</hi>; That there was money agreed upon, to ſend <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Piercy</hi>; that there was money collected, and that they themſelves did contribute. <hi>Adams</hi> he expreſſeth it thus: <hi>That upon a meeting, the place and time I remember not; where I think were preſent</hi> Drake, Titus, Alford, <hi>and my ſelfe, and I cannot tell how many more; It was agreed that</hi> Titus <hi>ſhould go to</hi> Piercy, <hi>the end of his going was to promote an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between the King and the Scots, according to the Covenant</hi> (and, my Lord, you ſhall hear in due time what that Covenant is, that M. <hi>Love</hi> hath ſaid in his late Defence,) <hi>In order to his going, we did
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47192:44"/>
agree to furniſh him with money for the preſent, and made ſome kinde of promiſe to keep him while he was out; about an hundred pound was furniſh'd; for my part, I paid twenty pounds of it.</hi> This is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Farr</hi>: He ſayes, <hi>He did underſtand by</hi> Drake, <hi>that</hi> Titus, <hi>who was here requeſted as one, to be preſent at the Treaty at</hi> Jerſey, <hi>which</hi> Titus <hi>did undertake to go thither</hi>; he undertook to go himſelf: <hi>that after he was gone,</hi> Drake <hi>deſired</hi> Farr <hi>to let him have ten pound, ſaying,</hi> Titus <hi>was in want, and upon this I lent him ten pounds; the Letter was read at M.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe when he came from</hi> Calice. So my Lord, here is now under favour, his proof before you of this meeting at <hi>Dowgate,</hi> at the <hi>Swan</hi> there, finiſh'd in <hi>Bredſtreet,</hi> carried over unto <hi>Jerſey, Titus</hi> the Meſſenger furniſh'd with money by a party from hence in this Arrant, as we told you. My Lord, all this while <hi>I</hi> do not hear of M. <hi>Love</hi>: if he were, My Lord, he was like the Mole under ground: but however, my Lord, Mr. <hi>Love</hi> hath carried himſelf (as ſome have ſaid) like a Rat among joynt-ſtools, a man can ſee him, but cannot hit him; But, my Lord, I doubt he will appear to be too buſie in what followes, and that he had a hand in it at firſt.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the next to go on with is this, in time; that when <hi>Titus</hi> finiſh'd his work at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> he was then to give an account to his Maſters that imployed him, and upon his return he was to doe it faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as he thought. But being informed, that the State had vigilant eyes, and they diſcovered him what he had been doing there, and he having notice from ſome of his ſtedfaſt friends here of it, he thought it was not ſafe for him to come in perſon, ſo that his guilty conſcience kept him off: But then he did deſire that he might give an account by the hand of ſome others, by their memories, and for that purpoſe wrote a letter, to whom I cannot tell, I think to <hi>Drake</hi>; The letter was written, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour, my Lord, this letter from <hi>Titus</hi> was read in M. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, to have one ſent to him; and there it was propounded for ſome to be ſent, <hi>Adams</hi> was propounded, for him to go; <hi>Farr</hi> propounded for him to go; but not them, but <hi>Alford</hi> was agreed to go, and did accept of it: but not that he was there, my Lord. My Lord, for this I ſhall crave the ſame favour from you, to read <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Farr,</hi> as to that particular. This is Major <hi>Adams, It was moved in M.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, M.</hi> Love <hi>being there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that I ſhould go to</hi> Calice <hi>to meet</hi> Titus; <hi>but</hi> Alford <hi>going thither, did at his return give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtate of things at M.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe.</hi> My Lord, that I read him for, is for that part, that it was moved in <hi>M. Loves</hi> chamber, <hi>M. Love</hi> being then preſent: <hi>that I ſhould go to</hi> Calice <hi>to meet</hi> Titus; it was moved that <hi>Adams</hi> ſhould go; my Lord, this I read to ſhow <hi>M Love</hi> was privie to this before the Meſſenger was ſent. My Lord, the next is Capt. <hi>Ralph Farr. I was in M.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe in his Study, wherein</hi> (in M. <hi>Loves</hi> Study) <hi>a letter was read from</hi> Titus, <hi>deſiring one might be ſent to him to</hi> Calice; <hi>and thereupon it was moved that I ſhould go, but afterwards it was agreed that</hi> Alford <hi>ſhould go, who went accordingly.</hi> That is now as to that particular, that before any man was ſent unto <hi>Calice,</hi> it was made known in M. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, and ſome propounded for to go, and at laſt another did goe; this, my Lord, I offer to you, as that which will not be controverted by M. <hi>Love,</hi> for I have read you two Witneſſes to it. The next, my Lord is, in which (I think) we doe not differ, but that when <hi>Alford</hi> had been at <hi>Calice,</hi> and had taken the account that <hi>Titus</hi> gave him, the copy of the letter which he ſaid was from the King to the Presbyterian party here, the Narrative of all the Tranſactions and Proceedings at <hi>Jerſey</hi>; that upon his return, I think we do not differ, nor is it denied; I am ſure M. <hi>Love</hi> acknowledged it in his laſt Defence, becauſe proved by four, therefore confeſſed; my Lord, that this Narrative, the copy of this letter was read in his houſe, and for that I have the teſtimony of <hi>Adams, Alford, Jaquel,</hi> and <hi>Farr,</hi> which if it be your pleaſure, I ſhall humbly read unto you.</p>
               <p>The firſt is Major <hi>John Alford, Having received at</hi> Calice <hi>a Narrative in writing of</hi> Titus <hi>his tranſactions in</hi> Jerſey, <hi>I brought the ſame to</hi> Drake, <hi>to whom it was directed</hi>: Now it appears to whom the direction was; <hi>and he brought it to M.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, where it was read; afterwards there was a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo called</hi>; but my Lord, if you pleaſe, that is for this in the firſt place, That this Narrative brought from <hi>Titus</hi> by <hi>Alford,</hi> was read at M. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Adams, But</hi> Alford <hi>going to</hi> Calice, <hi>did at his return give an account of the ſtate of things at M.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, which account was the Narrative from</hi> Titus, <hi>and the copy of the letter ſaid to be the Kings letter. The Contents whereof I remember was as followeth, The King expreſſed a great deal of affection to the Miniſtry in generall in</hi> England, <hi>and promiſed them great favours when he was in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſired them to continue ſtedfaſt in the way they were in; which letter was read and publiſh'd in M.</hi> Loves <hi>Study, and M.</hi> Love <hi>was there ſometimes of the reading, at the ſame time a motion was made of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47192:45"/>
giving thanks to</hi> Titus <hi>for his well managing affairs there, and at the ſame time the Commiſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were.</hi> So that here is another teſtimony, that this was done at <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> houſe; the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, ſayes this Gentleman, and the copy of the Kings letter.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the next I ſhall read unto you is <hi>Mr. John Jaquel. After</hi> Alfords <hi>coming home, I was at Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, where was</hi> Potter, Drake <hi>and</hi> Alford; <hi>and Mr.</hi> Love <hi>was there ſome times, though di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers times ſome body came to ſpeak with him, and called him, and he went to ſpeak with them: A Narrative from</hi> Titus <hi>was there read by</hi> Alford <hi>or</hi> Drake, <hi>wherein was declared the Kings inclination to make peace with the Scots, but his wicked Councel hindred him. I think it was a Narrative of what had paſs'd between the King and</hi> Titus <hi>at</hi> Jerſey. This is that that <hi>Jaquel</hi> ſayes.</p>
               <p>The next, my lord, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Far; Alford</hi> being returned, he gave account of his imployment at <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> houſe; <hi>A copie of a letter was there read, from the King to the Presbyterian party in England; the ſubſtance was to ſend Commiſſioners to the Treaty at</hi> Breda. <hi>The Narrative brought from</hi> Titus <hi>was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated at Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe: where were preſent ten or twelve perſons.</hi> So, my lord, you have heard theſe four witneſſes, what they have ſaid concerning this: Now you ſhall give me leave to make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this to the former; I ſhall crave you favour to go thorow this. There follows more at <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> houſe; this is not ended yet. My lord, after this, there was ſomewhat propounded to be done upon this Narrative and a letter from the King; ſomewhat was propounded at this meeting: My lord, then there was (as I know the Court remembers) ſpeech of a Commiſſion that was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what controverted. There was ſpeech of a Commiſſion, and a Commiſſion read, <hi>Mr. Love</hi> ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acknowledgeth, and it was proved, and he declared his diſſenting from it, and that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, becauſe as private perſons they had no power to do any ſuch thing. But, my lord, that there was a Commiſſion read there, brought by <hi>Drake</hi> (I do not ſay that this proves that <hi>Mr. Love</hi> corrected it:) That there were Inſtructions and letters read for to be ſent over, I think, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed: but, my lord, for that, if you pleaſe, I ſhall read you the witneſſe. The firſt is <hi>Alford: Afterwards there was a Commiſſion, ſo called, agreed among us, ſent over to the lord</hi> Willoughby of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Maſſey, Graves <hi>and</hi> Titus, <hi>at</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eda, <hi>to adviſe with the Scots Commiſſioners there, in behalf of the Presbyterian party in England. This Commiſſion was read in Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>Studie: and at the ſame time In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for the Commiſſioners to walk by were agreed on to be ſent: which Commiſſion and Inſtructions were the ſubſtance of the Petition formerly ſent, to preſſe the King to take the Covenant, and to proſecute the ends of it.</hi> This Petition was (I conceive) what was formerly agreed upon at Dow-gate: which Commiſſion and Inſtructions one <hi>Maſon</hi> the lord <hi>Piercy</hi>'s man carried over. This is <hi>Alfords</hi> teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as to this. And being ask'd by <hi>Mr. Love, Did not I diſſent from ſending the Commiſſion and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?</hi> he ſayes this, <hi>It was agreed in the generall, that the Commiſſion and Inſtructions ſhould be ſent, Mr.</hi> Love <hi>being then preſent.</hi> All preſent are Principles, my lord.</p>
               <p>My lord, in the next place is <hi>Major Huntington's</hi> teſtimony; and the firſt is this, <hi>That at Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, in the beginning of March</hi> 1649, <hi>I found</hi> Drake <hi>and others, and there was read a paper in the nature of a Commiſſion, Commiſſionating my</hi> lord Willoughby of Parham, Graves, Titus, <hi>Maſſey and</hi> Bunce, <hi>to treat in the behalf of the well-affected party of England, and to joyn with the Scots Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, according to ſuch Inſtructions as ſhould be therein incloſed. And this queſtion being asked, What power have wee to give or ſend ſuch a Commiſſion?</hi> Drake <hi>anſwered, Wee have the Kings Command for it, and the authority of ſome ſecluded Parliament men; for J look upon them beyond the Power that is now ſitting. Whereupon Mr.</hi> Love <hi>replyed, Come, come, let it go.</hi> You have heard <hi>Huntingtons</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and <hi>Mr. Loves</hi> paraphraſe upon thoſe words.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Adams. At the ſame time a Commiſſion and inſtructions were ſpoken of at Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, to be drawn up and ſent. As J remember, Mr.</hi> Gibbons <hi>brought the rough draught. J am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Maſter</hi> Love <hi>was there ſome part of this time; and it was in his Studie, where this was generally conſented unto. The Jnſtructions were there agreed alſo, and read by</hi> Drake, <hi>as J remember.</hi> Sterks <hi>the Scotiſh Agent met with us ſometimes at Maſter</hi> Loves <hi>houſe.</hi> This is what was teſtified by <hi>Adams:</hi> There is another to this, and that is Captain <hi>Far</hi>: William Drake <hi>read there a paper, of the nature of Commiſſion, which was not agreed to by the Company, becauſe private perſons had no authority to give Commiſſion. The Commiſſion was in the name of the Presbyterian party. A letter and inſtructions was then agreed upon, The Commiſſioners were to be the Lord</hi> Willoughby of Parham, Bunce, Maſſey <hi>and</hi> Titus; <hi>who was to move in the behalf of the Presbyterians: Papers then were read, to have been ſent to the Queen, to perſwade the King to give ſatisfaction to the Scots. But they were not aſſented to.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:47192:45"/>My lord, I have done with this that concerns this meeting; and now I ſhall apply that which I intended and ſpoke of before. The Deſign you heard, that (my lord) was at the Swan at Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, was treaſonable enough in conſcience, high enough; a partie imployed to agitate! And though wee do not finde <hi>Mr. Love</hi> to have been knowing or privie to it at firſt; yet, my lord, if there be a Treaſon hatch'd and deſigned, a partie ſent in it; and any ſubſequent act of any other party, that ſhall come into this, and approve of it, and joyn in it in what way ſoever, This man, my lord, is guilty of the firſt tranſaction of Treaſon. So that though Maſter <hi>Love</hi> did ſo walk under ground, that wee cannot bring him in to be knowing at firſt, yet I bring him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving at laſt: And, my lord, though here be his firſt appearing, it is enough and too timely; And my lord, <hi>Titus</hi> departing, and an account given of all; and for ought appears, not to be proved by mee, nor by any for the Commonwealth, whether <hi>Maſter Love</hi> did approve or not; or how far hee went in it. But hee was preſent, and at the debates and diſcourſings about it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings in it. My lord, this is far from miſpriſion of Treaſon; for miſpriſion of Treaſon is a bare ſilent act, that carryes nothing of diſcourſe nor debate with it: it is a ſimple act of omiſſion. But when Treaſons are hatch'd, and are deſign'd, and others ſhall come and treat, and debate, and diſcourſe upon carrying them on; my lord, by the ſubſequent act hee hath approved of all that paſs'd before, and made himſelf partie to it. Here is an account given by <hi>Titus</hi> of what had paſs'd there; this is brought into <hi>Maſter Loves</hi> houſe; there are debates concerning a Commiſſion: whether they took the KING for the Authoritie, or the King wrote of it, it doth not much move mee. A copie of a letter from the King was read there, let them take it among themſelves as they pleaſe. Here was a Commiſſion debated, and <hi>Maſter Love</hi> acknowledgeth hee debated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. My lord, under favour, if hee had declared an utter diſlike, and (as hee himſelfe ſayes) a deteſtation and abomination againſt it! But hee goes on, though not in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, yet in another; and hee is guilty of all. In Treaſon there are no Acceſſaries, all preſent are Principles.</p>
               <p>The crime of Treaſon is beyond the crying blood of murther, one is but private, the other is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; ſo as, my lord, though Mr. <hi>Love</hi> acknowledgeth, that he ſo far owned the Narrative from <hi>Titus</hi> and the proceedings there, the reading of it, but did diſſent from the commiſſion, and did ſpeak againſt it, and at preſent I ſhall take it ſo too; yet for the inſtructions ſent, and for the commiſſion named, you have had four witneſſes named to you; my lord, diſſent will not ſerve his turne, and yet to that there is not a pretence of a diſſent from the inſtructions, and what was ſent, and that is a conſent and concurrence, and that is an approbation of all precedent actions, and makes himſelf a party in it, and that is by one witneſſe; and, my lord, you have heard by Maſter <hi>Serjeant Witherigton,</hi> that to every circumſtance there needs not two witneſſes, but to the deſigne there muſt be two; and <hi>Adams</hi> himſelfe ſayes it was propounded to have given <hi>Titus</hi> money, as you ſhall hear by and by; and <hi>Far</hi> tels you, that there was going on ſo farre in it, that a paper was read for letters to be ſent to the Queen to move her to perſwade the King, but that was not aſſented to; but it was moved among them.</p>
               <p>My Lord, The next thing I ſhall take, as near as <hi>I</hi> can, was when this was done, and this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action paſt over, and the inſtructions ſent, that were agreed upon for Commiſſioners at <hi>Bredah,</hi> then begins the troubles in <hi>Ireland.</hi> You have heard of a Paper Book ſent, written in ſack, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a year after; that comes next: There was ſent over from Colonel <hi>Bamfield</hi> (Mr. <hi>Love</hi> ſays, he knew not the face of the man) but he lik'd his imployment it ſeems, that would be privie to ſuch proceedings from a man he knew not. There came a ſervant over, I take it from <hi>Bamfield,</hi> and that was about Chriſtmas laſt, that is the time expreſt after <hi>Dunbar</hi> fight. My Lord, This was brought, the letter was delivered to <hi>Potter,</hi> and their Superſcription was ſingly with the letter <hi>L.</hi> which I may ſay, may be better applyed to Maſter <hi>Love,</hi> then to any other, all circumſtances conſidered; yet I ſhall not conclude from it, but though he ſayes, he had no letters directed to him, I ſhall ſay as truly, that they were directed to him, as much as to any man elſe, and a little more; for Maſter <hi>Love</hi> was very unfortunate, that theſe letters ſhould be brought to him, read in his houſe, the tranſactions there, and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> to have no hand in it; this is hardly to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</p>
               <p>My lord, in the next place are theſe letters that came from <hi>Bamfield:</hi> if it pleaſe you, for that I ſhall read <hi>Potter.</hi> I <hi>received letters out of</hi> Scotland <hi>from</hi> Bamfield, <hi>with the letter</hi> L <hi>upon it, wherein was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47192:46"/>
a large Narrative of the affairs of Scotland, from</hi> Dunbar <hi>fight, to the time of the date of them, which (I think) was about Chriſtmas. I carried thoſe letters to Maſter</hi> Loves, <hi>where was one or two more with us,</hi> Jaquel, <hi>and I think Doctor</hi> Drake, <hi>we three I am ſure of it. There were letters from a name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſon, whom we ſuppoſed to be Maſter</hi> Baily; <hi>and a letter from my Lords of</hi> Argile, Louthain, <hi>and</hi> Lowden. <hi>Theſe letters wrote for ten thouſand pounds for buying of Arms and hiring of ſhipping; and for five thouſand men to be landed in England. Theſe letters were diſlik'd and diſſented from; and it was agreed to give a negative Anſwer: And we thought fit (for our own ſafety) to raiſe ſome money for the Meſſenger and</hi> Bamfield: <hi>the ſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n agreed on was forty pounds; to which I contributed ten pounds. I carried the letter to Mr</hi> Loves, <hi>to take advice upon it. Mr.</hi> Love <hi>and I, and</hi> Jaquel <hi>read thoſe letters that were opened, and thoſe that were not opened, we did open and read, and diſcourſe on them; and upon advice reſolved to do nothing in it:</hi> Neither did they reveal it. And then being demanded, whether at Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe there was not a diſcourſe for raiſing 4 or 500 l. he anſwered, <hi>There was.</hi> Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether letters were not returned to <hi>Bamfield,</hi> with the money ſent him; He anſwered, <hi>A letter was left at my ſhop, and I apprehended it came from Maſter</hi> Love, <hi>or Mr.</hi> Drake. (and <hi>Jaquel</hi> being demanded whether <hi>Mr. Drake</hi> and <hi>Mr. Love</hi> were not appointed to draw up the letter? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Yes, they were.</hi>) and that is <hi>Potters</hi> teſtimony.</p>
               <p>The next mention is, that <hi>Jaquel</hi> was preſent there, he is ſure of it; <hi>Maſter Love</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Jaquel.</hi> This is <hi>Jaquels</hi> teſtimony; <hi>At a Meeting at Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, Maſter</hi> Love <hi>being preſent, It was thought fit that forty pounds ſhould be raiſed for</hi> Bamfield. <hi>A letter was read from</hi> Bamfield <hi>at Maſter</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, Mr.</hi> Love <hi>being preſent</hi>; Mr. <hi>Love declared, he never ſaw or knew Bamfield. The letter was for five thouſand pounds to hire ſhipping. And another letter from my lords of</hi> Argile, Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thain <hi>and others, at the ſame time and place was read,</hi> to induce the Confederates to give credit to <hi>Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. Potter moved that ten pounds might be given to the Meſſenger that brought the letter, and thirty pounds to Bamfield: which was conſidered of,</hi> and nothing ſaid againſt it. <hi>There was no agreement; but it was thought convenient by all then preſent.</hi> Upon this <hi>Mr. Love</hi> ask'd <hi>Mr Jaquel</hi> a queſtion, and he ſaid, <hi>I cannot ſay that Mr.</hi> Love <hi>ſaid, It was convenient: but it was not diſſented from, or ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My lord, I ſuppoſe this is a faithfull relation of what the witneſſes ſaid. My lord, you have heard of this, and the time when it was; That <hi>Bamfields</hi> ſervant was ſent, and letters brought from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, giving an account of proceedings there: letters from <hi>Argile, Louthain, Lowden,</hi> and <hi>Belcar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is,</hi> to give credit to what <hi>Bamfield</hi> ſhould relate: money provided, though not the ſum nor the means thoſe letters did hint to them; perchance their purſes could not reach that; but ſo far as they could goe, they would; they would reward him that brought it, and him that ſent it; and thereupon 40. l. was provided, ten pounds for the meſſenger, and thirty pounds for <hi>Bamfield.</hi> In this repetition I think I have not wronged Mr <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is the letter that came from <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who were then in Scotland; and in what condition I think every man knowes; in what condition they are there: though by the way, I ſhould be ſorry to repeat that which Mr. <hi>Love</hi> did ſay the firſt day, That it did not appear to him, that the Scots were in arms againſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> but in arms for their own preſervation; and therefore did deſire Councell; here was one of his reaſons why he deſired councell to be informed, To adviſe him whether they were in arms for their own preſervation, or in oppoſition to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England:</hi> This was that Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was pleaſed to ſay the firſt day. My Lord, this of <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> gives them an account likewiſe of the affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> after <hi>Dunbar</hi> fight too. If you pleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, my lord, I will read you three witneſſes to that, and that neither doth Mr. <hi>Love</hi> deny, but that theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were read at his houſe.</p>
               <p>This is Major <hi>John Alfords. After</hi> Dunbar <hi>fight, we met at Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe in his lower room, where a letter from</hi> Maſſey <hi>was read, which gave an account of the fight there; wherein he alſo wrote for Arms, mentioning his own and</hi> Titus <hi>neceſſities. Thereupon a propoſition was made for raiſing of monies for the ſupplying of their neceſſities; and five hundred pounds being propounded, it was brought down to two or three hundred pounds, to be raiſed among our ſelves: Mr.</hi> Love <hi>did then move for contribution of money to that purpoſe; and I thereupon promiſed ten pounds, which my man paid.</hi> This, my lord, is the teſtimony which <hi>Alford</hi> gives, as to this concerning <hi>Maſſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Adams. When the money was propounded to be raiſed for</hi> Maſſey <hi>and</hi> Titus, <hi>certainly Mr.</hi> Love <hi>was then preſent</hi>; and this after the Fight at Dunbar: <hi>And the money was agreed to be raiſed by
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47192:46"/>
thoſe that were privy to the correſpondency; Mr.</hi> Love <hi>had then a paper in his hand, and did write ſome thing, I ſaw not what he did write, and ſo every man that was there did write what he would lend, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Mr</hi> Love <hi>ſummed up every mans ſum.</hi> Maſſeys <hi>letter was for Armes, and the money propounded was for</hi> Titus <hi>and</hi> Maſſey; <hi>For</hi> Titus, <hi>becauſe he was ſent by us: and Mr.</hi> Love <hi>was there.</hi> This, my Lord, is <hi>Adams</hi> his Teſtimony; and though he did not know what Mr. <hi>Love</hi> writ, yet he kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w what <hi>Mr. Love</hi> moved.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Here is another, and that is Captain <hi>Farr,</hi> which I ſhall make bold to read to the Court likewiſe, concerning the ſame action. <hi>After</hi> Dunbar <hi>fight I came ſomewhat late to a Meeting at Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, where Mr.</hi> Love <hi>told me a letter was come from</hi> Maſſy, <hi>to aſſiſt the King with Money and Armes, but it was not agreed that any Money or Armes could be ſent. And I underſtood from Mr.</hi> Love <hi>they could not do it. Mr.</hi> Love <hi>then likewiſe told me, they agreed to raiſe a ſum of money for</hi> Titus, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, <hi>and</hi> Graves, <hi>and to be ſent to relieve them in their neceſſity; which ſum, whether it was</hi> 250 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. <hi>or</hi> 300 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. <hi>I cannot poſitively ſay; but Mr.</hi> Love <hi>moved me to contribute; I told him I would give him five pound, which I brought wrapt up in a paper, and laid it down on Mr.</hi> Love<hi>'s Table, Mr.</hi> Love <hi>and ſeverall others being in the room; it was ſo done that there might be no diſcovery.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Love</hi> asking him ſome Queſtions upon this, whether it it was done ſo by Mr. <hi>Love</hi> or no, he did not know that, but it was done ſo by himſelfe, that there might be no Diſcovery. My Lord, Mr. <hi>Love</hi> did not diſagree; <hi>Far</hi> being croſſe examined by Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> did not ſay that Mr. <hi>Love</hi> did diſagree to the ſending the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Maſſy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> So I have done with that particular likewiſe, the receiving letters from <hi>Maſſy,</hi> and of the account from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the fight there.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Adams</hi> ſaith, Mr. <hi>Love</hi> having replyed unto it, concerning a letter writ to the Generall Aſſembly and Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and in that, my Lord, he is pretty poſitive. <hi>Adams</hi> Teſtimony is; <hi>There was a letter written to the Generall Aſſembly and Kirk of</hi> Scotland <hi>at Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe; Mr.</hi> Love <hi>was ſometimes preſent at this meeting: which letter was taken to be penn'd by M.</hi> Love <hi>and Mr.</hi> Drake, <hi>and I thought it to be ſo becauſe of the language of it; and that after</hi> Drake <hi>eſcaped all the meetings I know of, were at his houſe</hi>; and ſo my Lord, ſay ſome others. Being examined, he ſayes, <hi>I ſaw letters which were read in Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>houſe, Mr.</hi> Love <hi>was preſent and privy to the debating of them, and did not declare any diſſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, I have now done with theſe particulars, you have ſeen Mr. <hi>Love</hi> at the end, though you found him not at the beginning; it is not good to come at the ending of the Quarrell. But, my Lord, under favour, by the lawes and rules of Juſtice, if any ill thing be contrived and plotted, and afterwards any other perſon ſhall come into the contrivance of it, and carry it on; My Lod, I think I ſhall not need to ſay much in it, but he is culpaple and guilty of the whole, from the firſt to the laſt: And that Mr. <hi>Love</hi> ſhould be but a meer Spectatour, a meer concealing perſon, it is very hard to be beleeved by any that are rationall men; for after that once <hi>Titus</hi> hath done his errand at <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and gives his account here; my Lord, that his tranſactions, and the ſubſequent imployment, all that we know of, are all tranſacted, and carryed on in Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, in Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> Study, in Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> preſence: It was not one or two, or three times, which had been enough, and very well had it been for <hi>Mr. Love,</hi> if he had done as <hi>Bayns</hi> did, or as <hi>Barton</hi> did; they when they heard (though that were too much for them, My Lord, to conceal, as they have done, yet did confeſſe it when required) they left off when they heard of it, they would go no further in it, they knew the danger of it. <hi>Mr. Love,</hi> my lord, as you will hear anon, by what himſelf hath propoſed, what judgment and conſcience led him to carry on this; it was a conſcience of his own Covenanting intereſt and principles, for the Scots, and Religion that led him on to carry on this Deſign.</p>
               <p>My lord, I have done with this, that is the evidence againſt him; for Application to it, you have heard the ſeverall lawes read before the charge opened, that man is guilty of High treaſon, and is a Traitour by the lawes of the land now, that doth any way promote, declare, or publiſh <hi>Charls Ste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My lord, I ſhall ſay it again, if <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Drake</hi> be traitours, as their own guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences have made themſelves judge themſelves ſo; he that flies confeſſeth the fact; My lord, they are fled. My lord, if they be traitours, <hi>Mr. Love</hi> muſt be the ſame with them; for <hi>Mr. Love</hi> was carrying on, and hath agreed, and concurred, and approved of carrying on the Deſign that <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Drake</hi> have acted; Conſenters and Agents are to have the ſame puniſhments; in Treaſon there a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

no acceſſaries. My Lord, the next point is this; the next Act is that of the 17. of <hi>Janury,</hi> 1649, Having given you the evidence, you will give me leave now ſhortly to repeat the Law. The firſt is, for promoting <hi>Charls Stewart,</hi> &amp;c. That if any perſon ſhall maliciouſly and adviſedly plot, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and endeavour to ſtir up or raiſe forces againſt this preſent Parliament, and for the ſubverſion of the ſame, and ſhall declare it by any open deed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Love</hi> is pleaſed to expreſſe himſelf that none can accuſe him, nor none have ſworn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that he hath raiſed any Seditions, any Inſurrection, any Rebellions; my Lord, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay it fully, whether he be guilty of that, or no; but this I will ſay (the judgement I ſhall leave to the Court upon the evidence heard) if Mr. <hi>Love</hi> be guilty of any thing moving or tending towards the raiſing of Forces, Seditions, or Rebellions, though the thing be not done, yet, my Lord, it is Treaſon, thoſe practices; thoſe purpoſes are Treaſon by the law, though they never come to act; we ſhall not look, I hope, to ſee a Rebellion raiſed before we ſhall ſay it is Treaſon, and endeavour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; but for that, how far he is guilty upon the evidence of being inſtrumental of the war in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to have endeavoured to have a party got in <hi>England</hi>; my Lord, I ſhall leave it to your judgment upon the evidence you have heard.</p>
               <p>My Lord, There is likewiſe another in the ſame law, If any perſon procure, invite, agree, aid or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt any Forraigner or Stranger, to invade <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or adhere to any Forces raiſed by the Enemies of the Parliament, or Common-wealth, or Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England</hi>; this is High Treaſon; for this you have heard the evidence what Mr. <hi>Love</hi> hath done towards this, ſtill upon the ſame foot of account it is Treaſon, though but propoſed and intended, though not acted; then there is another clauſe upon the law, that Mr. <hi>Love</hi> hath inſiſted upon, of conſtituting this Court. But for thoſe former I have ſaid, and you ſhall give me leave to repeat it again, that theſe lawes offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, though in time before this Court was conſtituted, yet this Court hath, in expreſſe words, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Authority given them by the Parliament, to take cognizance of all Facts and offences, done after that Law, though done before your Commiſſion; and that, my Lord, is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to be a very good and legall Authority: And yet for this the law that conſtitutes this Court, of the 26 of <hi>March</hi> 1650. That no perſon after the 29 of <hi>March</hi> 1650, ſhall give or hold any Intelligence by letters, meſſages, or otherwiſe, with <hi>Charls Stewart, James Stewart,</hi> or the late Queen their mother, or the Councell abiding with any of them, prejudiciall to the Commonwealth, or with any that ſhall be in Armes againſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> or ſhall bring or ſend into <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> or any Dominions of this Commonwealth, letters, meſſages, or inſtructions, tending to raiſe inſurrections or a new war within this Nation, and ſhall not forthwith reveal the ſame to the Speaker of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to the Councell of State, or two Members thereof, or to two Juſtices of Peace, ſhall be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, &amp;c. that is a clauſe in the law that conſtitutes this Court. And no perſon ſhall voluntarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any perſon in Arms, or that ſhall be in Arms againſt the Parliament, with any Money, Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls or Amunition, on pain of death of other corporall puniſhment. And whoſoever ſhall volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily take up Arms againſt the Parliament, and ſhall encourage others to do ſo, ſhall die without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>Theſe, my Lord, are clauſes contained in the Act that conſtitutes this Court; and I read the law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the charge; and now, my Lord, I have repeated the evidence faithfully, now let it be conſidered howifar the evidence goes with them: There are there Acts of Parliament, I ſuppoſe <hi>Mr. Love</hi> knew not of the next, for he ſays, he knew not of that of the 2 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but it was publiſhed ſolemnly at the Exchange, and at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall; but ignorance cannot excuſe him, that no man will pretend.

               <p>My Lord, I ſhall not need to repeat the evidence again, but upon theſe (my Lord) I muſt leave him to your juſtice and judgement to do what in your conſciences you think is juſt upon theſe Laws, and what <hi>M. Love</hi> hath done in tranſgreſſion againſt them.</p>
               <p>My Lord, M. <hi>Love</hi> was pleaſed at the beginning of this Triall, to make ſome deep proteſtations, I think he did move all honeſt men that heard him, and truly I did think and did hope, that they were not made with any relation to equivocation, or mentall reſervation; but to a poſitive deniall of any facts of Treaſon, or looking that way; that it had been made in that ſenſe, that he had been clearly not guily of any thing: But (my lord) having looked upon them, and cauſed them to bee tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to me, <hi>I</hi> doe finde that they are ſomewhat cautious, and perchance they may be true, my lord, in the ſenſe ſpoken by M. <hi>Love,</hi> but whether true in the ſenſe they ſhould have been ſpoken by a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in a publike Aſſembly, that I ſhall not judge. His firſt proteſtation was, in the preſence of God and this Aſſembly, <hi>that I never wrote any letter to the King, or to the Church, nor to the Queen, or Church and State of Scotland in generall, or to any particular perſon of the Scotch Nation, ſince the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to this very day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, this may be true, but whether any letter hath been ſent from the King, or from the Scottiſh Nation, or others, or by <hi>Maſſie</hi> or the reſt, that ſhall bee believed as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is.</p>

                  <hi>Again</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I do likewiſe declare in the preſence of the ſame God, I never received letter written to me from the King, or from the Queen his Mother, or from the Church or State of Scotland in general, or any particular perſon of the Scottiſh Nation ſince the war began. I proteſt &amp; declare likewiſe in the preſence of the ſame God, I never collected, gave or lent penny of money either to ſend into Scotland, or any forrain parts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the King of Scots, or to the Queen his mother, to the Church or State of Scotland in general, or to any particular perſon of the Scottiſh Nation ſince the wars began</hi>; but that M. <hi>Love</hi> did not move others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute we have not a word of that. Truly, I did thinke it when hee ſpoke it. But it ſeems theſe aſſeverations were ſtudied to evade, and that he would ſpeake true, but not the whole truth. I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them but a touch, theſe may be true, my lord, but under favour there is ſomething elſe that is as true, and goes almoſt as neer as this.</p>
               <p>My lord, M. <hi>Love</hi> the laſt day had your patience and juſtice to make a large Defence, and he was very large in it; and though hee did beat us down, that are the Counſell for the Publike, that wee ſhould not uſe Oratory, nor flouriſhes, nor Querks of Law, nor Niceties, in which I ſhall be guided by him, and ſhall not doe it; yet he is pleaſed fully to make uſe of all inſinuations to the Court to trip up every Witneſs upon niceties, upon not expreſſion, upon nonſenſe, and ſuch (my lord) which I ſhall not follow him in: for I ſhall deale as truth ought to deale in pure nakedneſs and ſimplicity, and not to uſe any Oratory, but to ſet the matter of fact before you, and leave it unto the Court, who are the Judges between the Common-wealth and himſelfe for life and death. But, my lord, you ſhall give me leave to touch upon ſome few things in the late Defence of his, It was divided into four parts.</p>
               <p>The firſt, the Charge; the ſecond, the Witneſſes and Teſtimony both in one. The Witneſſes for the perſons, the Teſtimony for the fact: The third, concerning himſelf; the fourth, ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſalls to the Court, which truly (my lord) might better have been termed rather threatnings, than propoſalls.</p>
               <p>My lord, for the Charge, you have heard it hath been gone through, and the evidence concerning it; concerning the Witneſſes (my lord) I have read unto you (for I do take it upon my conſcience) what I knew, and nothing but what was true, I have not varied that <hi>I</hi> know of a ſyllable, and <hi>I</hi> think I ought not to do it, the duty of my place requires it not from me.</p>
               <p>My lord, concerning himſelf, he is pleaſed to ſay ſomething, and much of his merit, but (my lord, it is a grief to this Court, to my ſelfe, and all that are well-wiſhers to the publike, that any man that hath been a friend to the Parliament, that hath gone along with them, acted for them, ſuffered for them, done as he hath done, that this man ſhould bee called to publike Juſtice; <hi>I</hi> hope (my lord) all that heare mee beare witneſs, that I thinke (my lord) wee are all ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:47192:48"/>But, my Lord, look upon who hath been the cauſe of it, let that he look'd into, and every man will be ſatisfied in his own judgement and conſceince, whether Mr. <hi>Love</hi> were provoked or no; or whether he hath not provoked the State to bring him to be thus exemplary in Justice. M. <hi>Love</hi> ſayes, (my lord, <hi>I</hi> ſhall deſire to make uſe of the paper) <hi>I confeſs it is not ſo much the danger of my life, I am a ſickly man, and I know a diſeaſe will ere long kill me, whatſoever you doe with me; but this grieves me more, that I ſhould ſuffer from your hands, for whom I have done and ſuffred ſo much in my obſcure ſtation, and according to my weak meaſure. Had I been ſo dealt with at</hi> Oxford <hi>at the</hi> Juncto <hi>there! but to be ſo dealt withall in Weſtminſter-hall, this troubles me.</hi> And my Lord, it doth trouble me to deal ſo with him. My Lord, whether may we or himſelf better take up this complaint? Had the State been thus uſed by a Cavalier, by a poſeſt open enemy, it had not been ſo much trouble to us, you would have come to juſtice upon a little more deſire than now: But that M. <hi>Love,</hi> a Miniſter, a Miniſter of the Goſpel, a man that hath preached for us, prayed for us, acted with us, gone along with us, that he ſhould go to undermine us, that he ſhould be joyned, or in confederacy with others to undermine the State, where he did live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly, where none interrupted him; he had a free liberty, as much as a King in this Common-wealth: Truly that <hi>M. Love</hi> ſhould do this, it is (I think) an aggravation, and not an aggravation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Court or State; that they ſhould proſecute where a man is proſecuting them; what hee hath done, my Lord, you have heard; what his offences have been, and who gave the cauſe, that a Miniſter ſhould doe this, one that had a calling otherwhere, and better to imploy himſelf, than to meddle with States, and Secular Affairs; and theſe things to be done in M. <hi>Love</hi>'s houſe, and in his Study, where he ſhould have been ſtudying better things. My lord, next he ſayes, I could not leave ſuch relations as <hi>I</hi> have, nor ſuch a loving people and competent living as any Miniſter hath within London, onely Conſcience carried mee another way, and till Conſcience bee ſatiſfied, I cannot ſtirre one jot. My lord, this his Conſcience, I do not know what it hath to do in Government, or what Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> Conſcience had to doe in theſe affairs: He had a calling of his own to uſe; and ſhould I goe out of my calling and meddle with other men, I humbly conceive, I were a buſie body. M. <hi>Love</hi> had a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough for any one man to imploy himſelf in, and me thinks, when he ſayes he had ſuch a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a loving people, a competency of livelihood, that he ſhould not apply himſelf to return to them, but to wander abroad; and when we once wander, it is hard coming in again, till perchance we are fetch'd in again with the whip. But (my lord) <hi>Mr. Love</hi> had other relations of wife and children, which he might have look'd upon alſo, and taken care of them.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, he is pleaſed to ſay, (and that <hi>I</hi> believe hath carried on this deſign) <hi>The Covenant Intereſt</hi>; you have heard what <hi>Titus</hi> did, what <hi>Drake</hi> did, and what the reſt did, that all this it was upon the Covenant, and the Covenant is urged, I am ſure, to things the Parliament hath forbid. <hi>M. Love</hi> is pleaſed to declare himſelf ſtill to retain his old principles, from which (by the grace of God) hee will not be taken off by any terror. My lord, you will heare by and by what the Covenant hee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes leads him to, and (my lord) I ſhall take it aſunder, and bring it next, if you pleaſe, that is, the Covenant Intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saies <hi>M. Love, Though I own not the way of managing any papers, I neither writ them, nor ſent them, yet thus far I own the thing, I confeſs it was agreeable to my judgement and conſcience, and I thought the intereſt of godlineſs would be more promoted if the King went into Scotland upon Covenant-terms, it would be more for the good of the Nation.</hi>

               <p>No Sir, thoſe are not my words, I ſaid, than to fall in with the Iriſh Rebells, or to offer this Kingdom to the Spaniard. <hi>I</hi> thought a greater foundation of trouble would be laid, if this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception were not laid by that Nation: and the Covenant hath a clauſe in it, that we are to ſeek the good and union of both Nations; and they are judged to be incendiaries and Malignants that not onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the King from his people, but the Kingdomes one from another.</p>
               <p>Now they declaring him to be their King, according to my apprehenſion, <hi>I</hi> thought it agreeable to my Covenant to pray and deſire as a private man, and no more, that there might bee an agreement upon thoſe terms conſiſting with Religion, and the terms of the Covenant.</p>

               <p>After this, where he had mentioned his troubles at <hi>Oxford,</hi> when a Scholler there, and at <hi>London,</hi> when he came to a Lecture here; at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> when he ſpake for the Parliament there; and in <hi>Kent,</hi> when he ſpake againſt the King there; when theſe were over, after this he had a little breathing, whilſt the two Houſes of Parliament were in power: This Gentleman was troubled in the time of the King, in the time of the Biſhops, in the time of theſe Wars, for being for the Parliament: But I appeal to his own conſcience and judgment, whether ever he was troubled or diſturbed by this Parliament, or by this Government of the Commonwealth, whether he had not as free and as full liberty to preach the Goſpel, to inſtruct others, and to ſave ſouls, as his heart could wiſh; and I deſire to know whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Parliament did enterpoſe with him, till he did interpoſe with us.

               <p>My Lord, His propoſalls to the Court, I do ſay, were hardly fair propoſals, for they had a little of threatning in them; For (ſayes he) if you cenſure rather upon a Politicall intereſt, then of the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the Presbyterian name was made uſe of, you have had many concurrent evidences, and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was preſent when theſe things were mentioned; and if it be a fault which himſelfe hath acknowledged, it is right done to the Presbyterian party, who, I am ſure will not owne him in it.</p>

               <p>I beſeech your Lordſhip, it is a new ſuggeſtion of the Att. Gen. that concealment of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a tract of time, is Treaſon.</p>

               <p>I deſire to have councel upon this matter of law ariſing from the evidence; that concealment of Treaſon by your Acts, ſuppoſe it be for continuance or tract of time, yet by the law it is not Treaſons: and my concell informs me, that the Act of the 26 of <hi>March,</hi> that conſtitutes this Court, gave you power to inquire into Treaſon, but could not take cogniſance of miſpriſion of Treaſon, till there was a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Act: therefore I deſire this favour, that ſeeing it is ſo much ſuggeſted in Court, and ſeeing the witneſſes none can prove a perſonall Act of mine, to bring me under your law, as to Treaſon, I deſire my councell to clear this, that concealment of Treaſon, though for never ſo long atract of time, is not Treaſon by the law of the land.</p>

               <p>I will out Mr. <hi>Love</hi> of that ſcruple, he is not charged for miſpriſion of Treaſon, though I could have done it; but that I inſiſt upon is flat Treaſon.

               <hi>After the Court had received the precedent Exceptions, and were ſat in</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>Hall, Mr.</hi> Love <hi>was commanded to the Bar.</hi>

            <p>When <hi>Mr. Love</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appeared at the Bar, he deſired the Court that his councell might be heard to theſe Exceptions. And when Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> and <hi>Mr. Waller,</hi> who were of his councell, appeared in Court, the Court demamded of them, whether they were of Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> councell? they anſwered, they did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand they were aſſigned to be of his councell by the Court; then the Atturney Generall demanded of them, whether or no they had ſubſcribed the Engagement; they anſwered, they had not done it; and ſpake further to this purpoſe, that they were by the Court aſsigned to be of Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> councell, and were

ſent for into the Court, and in obedience thereunto they had appeared, and were ready to ſpeak, if they might be heard. It was demanded of them by the Court, whether or no they would ſubſcribe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement? they anſwered, That they deſired time to conſider of it: and ſo withdrew.</p>
            <p>After they had withdrawn, Mr. <hi>Love</hi> moved the Court that Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> another of his councell, might be ſent for.</p>

               <p>I had very late notice of this buſineſſe, it was Saturday night late before I had notice of it, and the next day was not a day to think of thoſe things. Yeſterday was Munday, and the moſt part of that day I ſpent in looking over thoſe things that had been (I think) preſented to your Lordſhip and the Court; we did not know what command your lordſhip would put upon us, whether you would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to ſpeak, and to what you would admit us to ſpeak, and when you would admit us to ſpeak. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus far <hi>I</hi> have known it, I have been commanded to be of counſell with perſons that have been impeached of Treaſon by the Parliament, <hi>I</hi> know that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> when hee was impeached of Treaſon, had a copy of his Charge, that I know he had; I know this is the uſuall courſe, that if a perſon takes Exceptions to a matter contained in an Inditement, though it is true, he ſhall not have the copy of the whole Inditement, yet he ſhall have a copy of ſo much whereupon his Exception growes; that hath been done, and will not be denied; but for the other matter, I know that in the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> caſe there was a copy of the whole Charge granted, and the like was done in the caſe of the Lord <hi>Strafford.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall give that anſwer a little more then I did, Parliamentary proceedings are no rule for other Courts to walk by; beſides (my lord) you ſit here upon a known publiſhed Law, and the offence charged is againſt thoſe Laws: I believe M. <hi>Hales</hi> well remembers, that both my lord of <hi>Straff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rds</hi> caſe, and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> caſe were both of them for many ſeverall facts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times a long time committed, which ſeverall facts being judged by Parliament, were judged to be Treaſon not againſt any ſetled poſitive Law: And for <hi>Straffords</hi> caſe, you know how the judgement, at laſt was given by Act of Parliament, King, Lords and Commons. And for the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> caſe, you know what the ſeverall complaints againſt him were, many of them not Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ſo many of them together, that in Parliament they thought fit to judge him guilty of Treaſon; but thoſe priviledges are not to be paralleld, he knowes very well it was not againſt ſuch, and ſuch, and ſuch a law, to make thoſe offences Treaſon. Having given thus much favour, I may ſay, to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, that he may by memory exhibit his Exceptions, he hath done it, if you judge that thoſe Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are worth the debating, be worthy of it, you may (as M. <hi>Hales</hi> ſaith) give directions for ſo much to be given him, otherwiſe (for my part) I did never give it unto any; but thoſe that have been in my place before, did never give it but by immediate Warrant from the King, or the Parliament now, but for ſo much as the Court thinks fit, for ſo much as concerns the Exceptions.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>For that that M. <hi>Hales</hi> objects to the Inditement, it ſtands with a great deal of juſtice; for if a priſoner layes hold of part of an Inditement, and ſay there is a miſtake in it, there is reaſon it ſhould be ſo, becauſe the Court muſt judge it whether it be ſo or not, therefore there is neceſſity of it that there ſhould be a copy of ſo much; but I think he never knew that all the Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, but that part, and that is of neceſſity for the Court, that they may ſee whether the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions accord with the Inditement or no; if there be any Exception to an Inditement, if that Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remains not as a doubt or queſtion, there ſhall be no copy of ſo much of the Inditement given: if he ſhall raiſe a doubt that there is any doubt in law, or any queſtion and variance between the Acts and the Charge, if he ſhall raiſe any ſuch doubt, then I think according to the old law he may have that part of the Charge; but we deſire he may raiſe ſome doubt to the Court.</p>

               <p>My lord, we begin with the firſt, and theſe are the Exceptions: We take it that Charge is grounded upon the Act of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>July,</hi> 1649. and we take ſome Exceptions to that firſt part of the Charge, that is, concerning what offences ſhall be adjudged Treaſon.</p>

               <p>Now we find what the inconvenience is of coming to put in our Exceptions, when we have not a cleer copy of the Charge, and that was the cauſe why we did ſubjoyn this, that in caſe any miſtake ariſe by miſtake of the copies, that we may amend: it it is true, we find <hi>maliciouſly</hi> is in.</p>

                  </gap>; for if it be maliciouſly alledged, that is over. Then the next thing we except to, is, he traiterouſly combined, confederated, and complotted together; it is true, there is plot in it, but there wants the words contrive and indeavour, but that is not the principall matter wee ſtand upon.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Then that is anſwered too. The next Exception that we take to the Charge is, that the Act upon which this part of the Charge is grounded, ſayes, that he muſt manifeſt it by an overt Act, by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen deed; now we ſay, there is (as we conceive) nothing charged upon him in purſuance of this Act, that is, there is no overt, or open deed laid in the Charge, for the words of the Act are ſo, <hi>that if any man ſhall maliciouſly plot, contrive, and endeovour to ſtir up, or raiſe forces againſt the preſent Government, and ſhall declare the ſame by open deed, that then every ſuch offence ſhall be Treaſon.</hi>

               <p>The buſineſs is not whether there be open deeds, but whether they are applied to this Act, or be Subſtantive Charges of themſelves.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I would ask him, whether that open act muſt be in the Inditement, or in the Evidence?</p>

               <p>But for that, that we may not diſpute upon thoſe things, my lord, there are the ſeverall Charges againſt the ſeverall Acts; there are ſeverall open acts that are laid in the Inditement, and (I think) if he look upon it, he will find that they are laid to every one of them, and relate and refer to every one of them.</p>

               <p>It is all contained in one Indictment, and then that that explains the overt act fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes afterwards, as a diſtinct thing in the Indictment, and ſo it was in my Lord <hi>Cobhams</hi> caſe in that Indictment, and in my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his caſe.</p>

               <speaker>M. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>We confeſſe it; but we ſupoſe it very certain, that both as this Act is penn'd, and as the Act of —is penn'd, which are much at one, as to the manner of penning them, there is of neceſſity an overt act to be laid to make good that general Charge; that, we conceive, will be plain; and that is admitted and agreed by the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in his collections of the Pleas of the Crown, <hi>fol.</hi> 12.13. where he ſaith, the <hi>Indictment of the Earl of Somerſet, in the time of</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>and all other of the like form, were againſt Law,</hi> becauſe he ſaid, that he did not follow the words of the act, and that he did it <hi>per apertum factum,</hi> and ſhews not what that open deed was; that was not a good indictment, for the fact muſt be ſet forth in the indictment; that muſt be done. Then the queſtion is, whether this be ſo done here or no? we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by this Charge it is not ſo done here, upon this ground; we ſay, there follows after this a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular charge concerning his promotion of <hi>Charles Stewart</hi>; and then ſubſequent to that, there follows this that the Court hath now read; we ſay, that in this caſe here is not a charge of an overt act, neither by the one nor by the other; there is not a charge by the former, becauſe that is a diſtinct treaſon made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly treaſonable by another act; and therfore that which is made a diſtinct charge of treaſon by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other act, ſhall not be an overt act within the former: That is one thing we ſay. And another thing we ſay is this, that in this caſe, the ſecond, that is that which the Court hath been pleaſed to direct to be read to us concerning his holding correſpondence, that ſhall not be an overt act relating to the firſt charge; for it is an uncertain relation: for there be two deſignes mentioned before, the one is a deſigne contained in the firſt charge, the other a deſigne contained in the ſecond charge, for the promoting of <hi>Charles Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi>; and we ſay, the third ſhall not be coupled up to the former, becauſe it is a diſtinct Charge of Treaſon in it ſelf, and becauſe it is uncertain to which it relates; for it refers not more to the firſt Charge then to the ſecond concerning the promoting of <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> that is called the Prince of Wales.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>For this, I take it for the preſent, that the Charge is founded upon four Statutes, if he lay the offence againſt the firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth, and he ſhall come and conclude it without rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any particular of theſe Treaſons, he did thus and thus by letters and correſpondencies, that will relate to them every one, though it come but in the concluſion; and though the Statutes be various, yet the indictment is but one, and he may put in this of the overtures in one place ſufficiently, to be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient overture to every one; and therefore though to one of them there ſhould be no overture in it at all, but <hi>valet ut valere poteſt,</hi> it will hang upon ſo much, as it will bear an overt act, and then you will not deny but that thoſe words are overtures.</p>

               <p>It is true, they are ſo, but yet ſtill we conceive this third, which we call the third Charge, that is concerning holding correſpondence, the third or fourth, I cannot tell which it is, but it is one of them; we ſay, that that is not an overt Act applied to the firſt Charge: when we come to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that Charge as it ſtands by it ſelf, then our Exceptions will riſe upon it, as it ſtands ſingly by it ſelf; but we conceive that ſhall not be a ſupplementall Charge to make good that firſt Charge, that is concerning endeavouring to ſubvert the State as it ſtands eſtabliſhed, it ſhall not be uſed as an overt Act to make good the firſt Charge; when we come to that particular Charge, that is concerning the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of correſpondence, whether it be a good Subſtantive Charge of it ſelf, then we ſhall offer our Exceptions to that; but in the mean while we are but upon debate of the firſt, whether the firſt contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch a Charge, as by the Act of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>July,</hi> 1649. is required.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Hale.</speaker>
               <p>If there be a ſubſtantial part of the Charge omitted, that ought to be alledged in fact, it is not the concluſion, <hi>that contrary to the form of the Statutes in this caſe made and provided,</hi> will help it. My Lord, (I come unprovided) the caſe of my Lord <hi>Dyer,</hi> that known caſe upon an Indictment for Recuſancy, or for a wilfull or knowing harbouring of a Jeſuite, or Prieſt: Saith my Lord <hi>Dyer, It is not enough to ſay, he did harbour him contrary to the form of the Statute,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but hee muſt ſay, he did it knowingly: he muſt alledge and purſue the ſubſtantiall words of the Act of Parliament.</hi> And ſo again, an Indictment for abſenting from Church; it is not enough to ſay, he did it <hi>contrary to the form of the Statute:</hi> but that he did it <hi>obſtinately.</hi> Therefore that generall concluſion, that this was <hi>to the hazard of the Commonwealth</hi> (it is true, it is an ill thing for any man to do ſuch a thing that is to the hazard of the Commonwealth) but thoſe words ſerve not the Statute neither: and then to ſay at the concluſion, <hi>Contrary to the form of divers Statutes,</hi> that will not help it, under favour, in caſe of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment. Then Mr. <hi>Atturney</hi> makes a difference between the caſe of an Indictment, and this Charge. I conceive that in this caſe there is no difference; the matter is the ſame, the one concerns the life of a perſon, and ſo doth the other; the offence is the ſame, the one is a charge of high Treaſon, and ſo is the other. It is true, thoſe formalities that concern the manner of the Triall, thoſe (it is true) are laid by, becauſe here is no Jury to come before your Lordſhip; but your Lordſhip tryeth upon the hearing of the teſtimony, and according to things alledged and proved: But for other matters that eſpecially are ſubſtantially required by the Act of Parliament, wee conceive that thoſe ſhall be ſupplyed no more by an intendment in caſe of a Charge before your Lordſhip, then in caſe of an Indictment for Treaſon: To this I ſhall ſay no more, but leave a word or two to your Lordſhips judgment. For the other thing (we are ſtill but upon the firſt Charge, the firſt Article) it hath firſt of all been inſiſted upon, that an overt act is not neceſſary to be alledged, becauſe ſupplyed by the words of the concluſion, <hi>Contrary to the form of the Statute:</hi> To that I have anſwered, I conceive, it is not, nor can it be ſupplyed, becauſe it is a ſubſtantiall thing in the very words and bowels of the Act, and cannot be ſupplyed by a generall concluſion. Then it hath been ſaid by Sir <hi>Thomas Withrington</hi> the States Serjeant, that in this caſe thoſe ſubſequent matters and charges ſhall be an overt act within the Statute; that is that which hee hath read to you; It is in the fourth Article (as I take it) <hi>That</hi> Chriſtopher Love, <hi>divers times between the</hi> 29 <hi>of March</hi> 1650. <hi>and the firſt of June</hi> 1651. <hi>did traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and malicouſly hold and uſe correſpondence and intelligence by letters and meſſages.</hi> But that cannot be; I may ſay it, that is not a ſufficient manifeſtation of an overt Act, becauſe there do precede it theſe particular Charges of Treaſon within particular Acts of Parliament; why then, if ſo be (to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his deſigne, for the carrying on of his deſigne aforeſaid) this ſhould be ſaid to relate to the firſt deſigne, why not to the ſecond deſigne, of promoting <hi>Charls Stewart</hi> to be King? And why not to the third deſigne? So that where there are three ſeverall deſignes before, all made Treaſon by the Acts of Parliament, that cannot be an overt act to make good the firſt part of the Charge, with ſubmiſſion to your Lordſhips judgment. And then another thing wee ſay, That this Charge which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> would carry up to the firſt Charge, and make it as an inforcing and overt act within the firſt Charge, that cannot be, for this other reaſon; becauſe it is charged as a traiterous diſtinct act in him. Now we have this learning delivered by Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his Comment upon this, in the 25 yeer of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the third</hi>: That is, where there are ſeverall acts made Treaſon; the one is an act for leavying of warr: Now there the caſe was Treaſon againſt the perſon of the King, Queen, Prince, &amp;c. that one part ſhall not be an overt act in caſe of Indictment, ſhall not be conſtrued as an overt act for the making good of another part; becauſe where all are made equally traiterous, and all are charged as equally traiterous, wee think, with ſubmiſſion, thoſe parts ſhall not be made an overt act to another Treaſon. So when here is a Treaſon made by the Act of the 17 of July, and another by a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Act, that which is charged as a Treaſon in the ſubſequent Act, ſhall not be ſaid to be an overt act for the making good of the former: if the former be not a Treaſon able to maintain and ſupport it ſelf, this ſubſequent act ſhall not ſerve as a bolſter to uphold it, and to ſupply that which is laid as a diſtinct treaſon of it ſelf. Now theſe are the three things we inſiſt upon: Firſt, That an overt act is neceſſary to be laid. Secondly, That it is not ſupplyed by the generall concluſion, nor can it be. Next of all,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47192:55"/>
that this act that is here laid to be done, traiterouſly to hold correſpondence and intelligence, it refers no more to the firſt deſigne, then to the ſecond or to the third deſigne, which are charged as three diſtinct Treaſons; and this is charged as a diſtinct and poſitive Treaſon of it ſelf, and therefore ſhall not be carried over as a ſupplement to another.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>We granting that an overt act is neceſſary to be expreſs'd; grant it ſhould be ſo, but no more but in evidence: and then granting in the next place, that the generall concluſion will not be ſufficient to maintain it, when it is requiſite an open deed ſhould be expreſs'd. Then for the third, I cannot be of his judgment in this way of impeachments; but as we ſee one perſon may commit four or five treaſons, and one act may be an offence againſt four or five Acts of Parliament; and this is the truth: for where the ſeverall acts are repeated, that (my Lord) are thoſe lawes againſt which this treaſon, and this treaſonable practice and deſigne is laid to be; then follows the ſeverall enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe practices, deſignes, and open acts of his now applyed by us. But Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> would take them and apply them to one ſingly; But I obſerve to your Lordſhip, that thoſe open acts of his are offences by an open act againſt the ſeverall Acts of Parliament; but it ſerves his turn for his Client to apply them ſo: but I hope you will not apply them ſo; but when they come between the offences, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert acts follow it, and the concluſion upon the whole, that all thoſe traiterous and wicked practices and deſignes are againſt the ſeverall Acts of Parliament: And if there be an open act ſo expreſs'd in the impeachment, that in law is an open act, ſuppoſe it ſhould be required to be expreſs'd; if there be an open act, then I hope you will be ſatisfied when it hath been well proved; if it be expreſs'd in the Indictment an open act, that I hope will ſatisfie your judgments and conſciences; eſpecially when open acts ſhall appear to you to be an offence againſt the Acts of Parliament. I ſhall leave this to your judgment, and trouble you no further; and you will finde in its place whether it be requiſite or not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>That that Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> ſaid, if it were a thing of abſolute neceſſity in an Indictment, then the concluſion will not help; if the thing were of abſolute neceſſity there charged, and not charged <hi>contra formam Statutis,</hi> will not do it: but if I underſtand it right, it is fully laid in this Charge, that he did by open and overt acts do the thing; it is laid ſo; the words of open act are not, but the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; that is, that he did by writing, by words, by meſſages, by money; and theſe are really overt acts, though hee did not call theſe overt acts; theſe are laid fully in the Charge: and then, if they be laid fully in the Charge, and we ſatisfied in the full proof of that Charge, that we have heard overt acts to maintain it, then I think this cannot come within any of thoſe caſes, that when an eſſentiall thing is left out of an Indictment, there the concluſion will not help: this I conceive ſo far. Then the next, What method or order this can be, by ſetting down the Statutes, and then withall theſe overt acts of letters, of meſſages, of money, will reach to every one of the qualities, that theſe Treaſons are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by this act; but if it were a treaſon of ſuch a nature, that none of theſe could reach to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of it, then you ſay well; but when theſe words reach to the manifeſtation of every charge laid in the Charge, then it is effectuall and reall, and the concluſion is ſufficient.</p>

               <p>But we ſay that that is not ſufficient, upon theſe reaſons, becauſe it is a charge of treaſon in it ſelf, and therfore ſhall not be made an additionall and ſupplementall charge to make out another. And then we ſay, that this is uncertainly charged, whether you will make it ſupplementall to the firſt charge of Treaſon, that is, the endeavouring of the ſubverſion of the Commonwealth; or to the ſecond charge of Treaſon, which is a diſtinct charge of treaſon, of the promotion of the intereſt of <hi>Charles Stewart.</hi>

               <speaker>L. Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>Are not theſe as perfect as before? doth not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of this Commonwealth promote the intereſt of <hi>Charls Stewart?</hi> and doth not the promotion of <hi>Charls Stewart</hi> ſubvert the intereſt of this Commonwealth? If he hath laid it, that he did both of theſe by aſſuming it, by a double or multiplyed act, and all theſe multiplyed acts are but one ſubverſion; if I ſubvert it by one, or by 20 acts, both of them are the ſame in nature; for the ſubverſion of the one, is the bringing in of the other; and the bringing in of the one is the ſubverſion of the other; and ſo they are relatives fully one to the other, and there cannot be more expreſs'd in the Charge then this: And notwithſtanding all theſe acts, though that act hath made the Treaſon, cannot it be by another act? you may proſecute by vertue of this ſubſequent act, any thing that was underſtood to be generall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the law of the Land.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, this is that we inſiſt upon. It is true, we do conceive, though the promotion of the intereſt of <hi>Cha. Stewart</hi> is not conſiſtent with the preſervation of the intereſt of the Commonwealth; yet every deſtruction of the intereſt of the Commonwealth is not therfore a promotion of the intereſt of <hi>Charles Stewart</hi>; for then there could be no Treaſon againſt the Commonwealth, but it muſt be a promotion of the others intereſt. Now there may be a Treaſon againſt the Commonwealth without the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47192:56"/>
promotion of the others intereſt. I urge it to this purpoſe, to make it appear, that they are ſeverall Charges bottomed upon ſeverall Acts, and therefore the reference here made to promote the deſigne aforeſaid, is uncertain to which it ſhall relate; it may fall out the partie may be guilty upon the firſt Article; it may fall out, he is not guilty upon the ſecond Article, and then it is uncertain to which article it relates, that hee is guilty of, or not guilty of: and here may be the conſequence of it, then you will make a Treaſon, which to this third clauſe is a Subſtantive, and contained in it ſelf, to be an overt act to another charge of Treaſon, and that you cannot do: you cannot make a Treaſon which is ſo charged, to be an overt act, or expoſition, or a declaration of that which is contained in the former, like that caſe I inſtanced in before, of the 25 of <hi>Edward the</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, That no man ſhall go about to deſtroy the perſon of the King, nor to raiſe war againſt his people: ſo that we uſe it not in any other reference, but onely to explain and bring the reaſon of that ancient Law to this Law: In that caſe a man cannot charge the overt act of going about to deſtroy his perſon, which is a diſtinct Treaſon of it ſelf, to be an overt act to the Charge of Levying war, which is another diſtinct Treaſon: And if he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, ſuch a one did go about to deſtroy the Prince, or the Conſort of the King, or the King, and to make the levying of war to be an overt act to it, this he cannot do; becauſe though it is true, it might be an overt act to it, yet notwithſtanding, it being made a diſtinct treaſon, it cannot be an overt act to another treaſon: and ſo here, this very aſſiſting and inviting of forces is made a diſtinct treaſon; and ſo if you take it ſubſtantively, it is inſufficiently laid; and if relatively, you may not do ſo, becauſe it is a treaſon of it ſelf, and ſhall not be brought in relation to another treaſon laid before it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>For that, I hope Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> will leave me to that liberty I have, that is, that if one act be an offence againſt ſeverall Acts, I may aggravate it ſo, as to make him know it is ſo; and I take it for an aggravation of his offence, when he hath offended againſt ſo many ſeveral Lawes, which he hath done; and that I may have liberty to ſay ſo, though perhaps that ſubverſion of this Government is not in every reſpect a promoting of the intereſt of <hi>Charls Stewart</hi>; but the ſubverſion of this Government, as it is here laid in this inditement, is a promotion of the intereſt of <hi>Charles Stewart:</hi> and ſo it is here. And I have done now with that.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>Then <hi>(Mr. Hales)</hi> I will add a word, becauſe that you did put the caſe of a man deſtroying the perſon of a King, and Levying of war; if it be laid, thoſe very acts, if they be laid as a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or a <hi>medium,</hi> or an enterprize, that he had taken up a war to deſtroy the perſon of the King; thoſe words in one ſenſe, if it had been laid ſolitarily by it ſelf, and deſtroying the King in another; but if he ſhewed that by levying of war he endeavoured it, then the denomination is from the end in that place; and though they be two treaſons ſubſtantively, yet when they are laid as one continued act, they are but one: and ſo it is in this caſe; all theſe, though there are ſeveral ſtatutes, and ſeveral treaſons, theſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed acts make up but one compleat in the concluſion: if there want one of theſe, if there be ſufficient in the other, it is treaſon enough, and too much too (I would it were not ſo) if they be laid in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as all theſe are, every one of them further to promote this, and to promote that; ſo they are laid in promotion of it to every one; and then they are contiguous, and depend one upon another, and are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive, and ſo ſubſtantiall, as that they may be relatives one to another, and ſo are theſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>The next is the 4 Charge; and that is, concerning holding correſpondence by letters &amp; meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, with <hi>Charls Stewart</hi> and the late Queen his mother; we ſay, that this part of the Charge is ill laid alſo; it is laid in nature of a felony by the Act, and laid to be done traiterouſly in the Charge; and that is a ſubſtantial (not a meer formality, but a ſubſtantial) miſtake; for if ſo be a woman be indited of petty treaſon becauſe it is <hi>proditoria,</hi> yet in truth it amounts but to felony; now in caſe where ſhe is an acceſſary to a felony, the inditement is naught: if a man be accuſed that he did traiterouſly ſuch an action, which in it ſelf amounts but to a felony, that charge is naught; and ſo it is here, it is miſlaid: for by the act of the 26 of <hi>March</hi> 1650, the matters therein charged are not made treaſon, at moſt but capital; but we think it only prohibited, and then we ſay it is an uncertain charge: and ſo it is, under favour; for though the act ſaith, No man ſhal hold correſpondence by letters, meſſages, or otherwiſe; yet when we come to inform upon it, or to indite upon it, it is not enough to ſay, He held correſpondence by letters, meſſages, <hi>or</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but if you will ground your deed upon that Act, you muſt ſhew what that <hi>otherwiſe</hi> is, and that is the exception to that part of the Charge.</p>

               <p>I confeſſe it is expreſſe ſo in the 26. of <hi>March</hi> 1650. and it is not ſaid what the offence is, but I conceive in the firſt place, that by the law of <hi>England,</hi> be that holds correſpondence with a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, will go very near it, my Lord; and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <speaker>Mr. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt be bold ſtill a little, to crave Mr. Atturneys favour, to reply upon him in this kind of way, for <hi>I</hi> have not had time.</p>

               <p>We ſay, the Charge is not good becauſe it is made Felony only by the Act, and laid in the Charge to be done traiterouſly; and then we ſay, that Charge is uncertain to what deſigne it relates; if it relates to the buſineſſe concerning the promoting of <hi>Charles Stewart</hi>'s intereſt, if it be ſo, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is not proved; for the proof I mention not, but that is not inſiſted upon, that <hi>Maſter Love</hi> did promote the intereſt of <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> contrary to the Act of Parliament, that (<hi>I</hi> think) is not inſiſted upon,</p>

                  <hi>And the better to carry on and accompliſh the ſaid Traiterous and Wicked Practice and Deſign, he the ſaid</hi> Chriſtopher Love, <hi>with the ſaid</hi> William Drake, <hi>&amp;c. (ſince the death of</hi> Charles Stewart, <hi>late King of</hi> England, <hi>who for his notorious Treaſons, and other Tyrannies and Murders by him committed, in the late unnaturall and cruell warrs, was by Authority derived from the Parliament, juſtly condemned to death, and executed) ſeverall dayes and times, in the reſpective years aforeſaid, at</hi> London <hi>aforeſaid, and ſundry other places within this Commonwealth and ſince this Nation was ſetled in the way of a Commonwealth or a Free State, as aforeſaid, did Traiterouſly declare, publiſh, and promote</hi> Charles Stewart, <hi>eldeſt ſon to the late King, to be King of</hi> England.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>We are informed, that there is nothing of any particular act of his, concerning that; but we have nothing to do with the Fact, but we conceive that no ſubſequent thing by way of conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or interpretation, ſhall make a publiſhing and promoting in ſuch a manner as this is, it muſt be ſuch a thing as expreſly publiſheth and promotes him to be the chief Magiſtrate of <hi>England,</hi> according to the words of the Act, and not by way of dilation; we ſay, this is not a thing to be applyed to ſerve the turne, upon this reaſon; we ſay, that the holding of correſpondence and intelligence with <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> eldeſt ſon to the late King, it cannot be coupled on to the promotion of the intereſt of <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> to be King of <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing that is but by way of interpretation to bring it within the firſt part of the Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>For that I ſhall crave your direction.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Preſ.</speaker>
               <p>It is not interpretative, but poſitive.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>then the next part of the Charge, and that is the fifth, that he did hold correſpondence with divers perſons of the Scots nation; our Exception to that is plain, we conceive, that part of it is not well laid neither, it is not laid in purſuance of the Act of Parliament, as our notes are, this is that we ſay, that it is not expreſly alledged, that they were perſons reſiding in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as our notes are.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47192:57"/>
and divers other places within this Commonwealth of</hi> England <hi>and elſewhere, as aforeſaid, did Traiterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Maliciouſly hold and maintain, correſpondence and intelligence with divers perſons of the Scots Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> viz. <hi>with the Earle of</hi> Argile, Lowden, Louthian, Bayly, Belcarris, <hi>and divers other perſons if the Scots, and other Nations, whom he well knew to adhere to the Scots Nation in this war againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Commonwealth of</hi> England.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>This we conceive, is not a good charge, for the words of the Act of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1650, upon which this is grounded, are, that no man ſhall hold correſpondence with the Scots Nation reſiding in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, there is no reſiding; for that yet comes not home, we conceive, to part of the Charge; there are two parts of the Charge, the one, <hi>That he did maintain correſpondence with divers of the Scottiſh Nation, and with divers other perſons of divers other Nations, whom he well knew to adhere to the Scots Nation in this warr againſt the Parliament.</hi> As to the firſt, that is out of doors; then here is no full charge of holding any correſpondence with any of the Scots Nation; for that part of the Charge reſts upon this, that it muſt be with holding of correſpondence with any ſuch perſons as are reſiding in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and with any other perſon reſiding there. Then as to the other part—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Preſ.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>Then here is another thing in it, that it is not averred that ſuch correſpondence and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence was held without the licenſe of Parliament.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>We ſay then, theſe are two diſtinct Charges, and grounded upon two diſtinct parts of an Act, but there is this more in it, which we conceive is not to be anſwered, with ſubmiſſion, under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it is ſaid he did it within the times aforeſaid, the times that are aforeſaid, are between the 29 of <hi>March</hi> 1650, and <hi>June</hi> 1651; now this Act whereby this is made traiterous or Treaſonable, takes not place till the 5. of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1650, ſo that it might be done within the times aforeſaid, that is, between the 29 of <hi>March</hi> 1650, and <hi>June</hi> 1651, and yet not contrary to the Act of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which was 1650</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47192:57"/>
after ſuch a time, and we ſay that before the firſt of <hi>June</hi> 1651. he did commit Treaſon in holding correſpondence, and ſending proviſions of war before that Law, though it were before the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1650. that were not againſt that Law.</p>

               <p>The proof ſhall never ſupply the inſufficiency of the Charge; for we may as intirely offer you an Exception to this matter, after you have heard the proof, as before you have heard it; for it ſtands now as upon the Charge ſingly, ſo that it ſhall not be ſupplyed out of matter that appears in the proof, but it muſt be conſidered whether the Charge can ſupply it ſelf or not; for that that is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able againſt the Charge before the proof made, is alledgable as well afterwards; if it were not good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the proof, the proof ſhall not be ſupplementall to it; for upon that reaſon, if an Inditement did want time, or certainty, then after the party were heard upon his Defence, it might be ſaid when this Exception was taken to the Inditement, all this might appear upon the Evidence, but that will not ſupply the defect of the Indictment.</p>

               <p>I am ſure wee have laid it late enough, the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> 1651. before that time, and Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> his Exception is ſtill upon that way of proceedings upon Indictments; he muſt have that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and ſtrict certainty in it in each particular, <hi>I</hi> muſt give it that anſwer ſtill, that if you do in theſe caſes put me to it, to expreſs every particular circumſtance of every particular fact, and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time, and that it muſt conduce in the concluſion of it, I muſt make you Impeachments that will not be fit for you to read nor hear; but under favour, if that it contains in it in this way of Charge that convenient certainty, that conveniency that may put the priſoner to the knowledge of it, and to prove it; for this relates not ſingly, for if I ſhould go that way M. <hi>Hales</hi> hath laboured to draw me, that is to take every one of theſe ſeverally, and that I muſt make a diſtinct Charge upon one, and upon the other, and a diſtinct Evidence upon one, and upon the others I conceive theſe run quite through all the laws eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them; had I confined this now between the 5. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1650. and <hi>June</hi> 1651. then what had become of all the laws before that time? therefore to make them relative to all, I have expreſs'd ſuch a time as may relate to all; for had I confined it ſingly upon this or that act, whereas I humbly conceive, that theſe acts and theſe offences of M. <hi>Love</hi> are relative to more than one Act of Parliament, and go to ſeverall acts; and therefore I cannot confine my ſelf to one act, and ſay, it was done at ſuch a time, and there limit it and let it die; but my indeavour hath been, and upon this particular we debated it, when we did draw it, we put it ſo, that the ſeverall acts may have the ſeverall effects, and M. <hi>Loves</hi> Treaſons look upon every one of them, and they upon every one of his Treaſons, and as his offences run through, and againſt all the acts, ſo muſt our laying it upon him run, and the evidence alſo; and though we took care to lay it back far enough, that was to the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> 1651. and ſo laid it high enough to the other that it might reach the reſt, and in this way we are not tied ſo to expreſs it in every particular, as other Indictments run.</p>

               <p>I conceive it is much better as it is too, and more obvious to every underſtanding, and their interpretation, then as you would have it, a great deale; for the neceſſities of the day it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, that you will agree, nor the week if they lay a time ſo many moneths before, or after, if the proof come and fall within the compaſs of the Charge, as the proof is laid, ſo is the fact, the proof determines whether it were within the times without the Law, or within the times aforeſaid; for it is not within that time, and every of them, but within the times generally laid, all thoſe acts were done, and thoſe muſt be laid in particular, which was at one time, and one at another, which were two yeers a brewing, and are by the proofs laid in generall, that is beſt to ſay, one fact was done at one time, and another at another time, and at ſuch a time, and not at ſuch a time, it can be no mans judgement to be ſo laid in an Indictment or Charge, but they muſt be laid thus in generall, and the Evidence muſt make it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that it was within the times that are laid, as when there are no times, as from <hi>March</hi> to <hi>June</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and after if they be both laid, if the fact be within ſuch a time that is within the law, all the other is out of doors.</p>

               <p>My Lord, thus if it pleaſe your Lordſhip, I think with ſubmiſſion to your Lordſhips judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in ſuch a caſe it is not in the proof to make good a Charge; if the Charge do not containe a ſufficient certainty, it is not in the proofe to make it good. My Lord, I inſiſt now upon the neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a day to be preciſely laid; I know (though it is true, it hath been otherwiſe held in ſome caſes) yet, in a caſe of this nature, the day is now materiall, for now we are upon an Act of Parliament: As now, if ſo be the Statute of the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Elizabenh</hi> enacts that every man that ſhall knowingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a Jeſuite, that that man ſhall be a Traytor, ſhall ſtand guilty of Treaſon; if ſo be a man would ſay in an Indictment that ſuch a man between the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>November,</hi> in the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. year of the Queen, and the 28. of <hi>December</hi> in the 29. year of the Queen, did entertain ſuch a Jeſuite, this Indictment would be naught, not upon the uncertainty of the day, but becauſe it takes in a time which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Statute, the Inditement may be true that he did receive a Jeſuit within that time, and yet that he did not receive him contrary to the form of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> objection, that it is not done contrary to the form of the Statute, becauſe it takes in ſuch a time, as that it might be done before the Statute came forth; we ſay, that when there is a time laid between the 29. of <hi>March</hi> 1650, and <hi>June,</hi> 1651. and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that time he did do thus, and thus, that there is the fault, it doth over-reach the time of the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Statute, for any thing appears to the Court, the Court may finde the Inditement or Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation true, that he did it within this time, that is, between the 29. of <hi>March</hi> 1650. and <hi>June,</hi> 1651. and yet for all that, the party not in fault to be impeached, becauſe he might not do it contrary to the Act, for he might do it between the 29. of <hi>March,</hi> 1650. and <hi>June,</hi> 1651. and yet do it before the Act came forth, which was in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1650.</p>

               <p>That I conceive you are upon is this, the very Letter of the Charge; for you ſay at this time that is laid, he could not be a Traytor, and you joyn it with a time in which he might be a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; This (you ſay) they lay in the Inditement, that he did in ſuch a time of <hi>March,</hi> and afterwards, and at that time there was no law to prohibite it, and ſo that could not be a crime againſt him, and this,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47192:58"/>
you ſay, no proof will help it, I take it, M. <hi>Hales,</hi> this is the ſubſtance; but if this be thus laid, and the proof doth come in, this is very eſſentiall in my judgement, when upon the matter, if this be as you ſee it appears upon the face of the thing, that the proof muſt go to that time within the Law, and therefore that will not vitiate at all ſuch an Inditement, if it were ſo as you ſay; but <hi>I</hi> take it, that this being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with more Lawes, as I ſaid before, though he were not guilty upon this, yet in the concluſion he is found guilty of that which is as to other offences.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I ſhall ſay but this, wee all know that a time is expreſs'd but for formality, and that time that is expreſs'd is not materall, ſo it be laid far back enough; but if I lay it in June, and prove it in June twelve months, it is time enough for this, as your Lordſhip was ſaying: that which I do ſay, is, that I cannot confine not this very act that is ſuppoſed to be, and yet not laid to be againſt that Act of the ſecond of Auguſt 1650. from this clauſe in expreſſe terms, not ſingly: But that which I humbly inſiſt upon is this, that never a one of theſe offences ſingly tranſgreſſe one ſingle Law, but is an offence againſt ſeverall Lawes. I conceive, I had done my ſelf and the Commonwealth wrong, had I limited it to any one; for his complying with the Scots, and joyning with them, and contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them, and receiving intelligence, it is more then againſt that ſingle Act; it is promotion of his intereſt, and ſubverſion of the Government, and againſt every one of the laws: And therefore, I conceive, I had not done right to the place I am entruſted with, if I ſhould have laid it ſingly; but he is indited, that as a falſe traitor he hath done theſe things; that is the preamble: and then wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtanced the particulars, and give a time, which time he will acknowledg is not poſitively neceſſary to be true, that that time muſt be the day the fact was committed, but if it be before, it is enough: But he infers, becauſe this ſeems to be an offence within the Statute of the ſecond of Auguſt 1650. and is laid between the 29 of March 1650, and the firſt of June 1651. and ſo whether this can relate to that Act; and by evidence you know it is afterwards; but this being an offence againſt ſeverall Laws, I cannot charge it to be againſt one Law: but the art is now, as Mr. <hi>Love</hi> began, to take it aſunder, and ſingly, and then it is nothing; and Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> takes it ſingly. It is not againſt this, nor againſt this; but it is againſt every one of them, and not againſt this ſingly, but againſt the reſt of them.</p>

               <p>My Lord, it cannot be contrary to the forme of the Statute, unleſſe it be done after the time, ſo that the concluſion ſhews it was laid within the time, but for that caſe, as Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, he puts a caſe of one Act of Parliament, we are now upon offences againſt ſeverall Acts of Parliament, in that caſe of retaining a Jeſuite, he is a Traitor by the Act of the 29 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo that if he laies it between the 28 of the Queen, and the 29. if the Jury find that hee did retaine him knowingly on the 10. of <hi>May</hi> 29. then it will not be denyed, but that it is an offence againſt the Statute.</p>

               <p>The laſt thing is concerning contribution to <hi>Silas Titus,</hi> and <hi>Sterks</hi> a Scotchman; and to that we have the ſame Exception, that that is not made Treaſon by any Act of Parliament, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is miſlaid to be done Traiterouſly, for the Statute of the 26 of <hi>March</hi> 1650, only prohibits it, and ſo makes it penalt, but not Treaſon. But then we ſay againe, it is laid very uncertainly too; that is, at the times before mentioned; if Mr. Atturney of the Dutchie his conſtructions ſhould ſtand, that is, that the times before mentioned refer to the time paſt, then he may refer to a time before the Act. But we conceive the thing it ſelfe is not Treaſon by the Act, but only prohibited; and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, under favour ſtill, that by way of reduction to any of the former Charges, this ſhall not be made as an inſtance or an overt act by way of reduction to any of the former Charges, becauſe it is charged particularly to be traiterouſly done, becauſe there are ſeverall charges of Treaſon before, and that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Atturny was pleaſed to obſerve upon another occaſion, that in this caſe the charge is againſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Acts of Parliament, it is true, but though it be againſt ſeverall Acts of Parliament, yet it muſt bind &amp; pinch upon one; for we ſay, one Treaſon is not to be made an inſtance to another, and ſo to be made acceſſary, and depending, and accidentall to another, and then we ſay in this caſe, that this being not a Treaſon in it ſelfe, and being as uncertain to which of the former Treaſons it is applyed, it cannot be well laid, nor well applyed, that is, to the laſt, that he did voluntarily relieve <hi>Silas Titus,</hi> it is not made Treaſon.</p>

               <p>We have ſhewed our reaſons in the Caſe, my lord, it is as much as we can ſay upon this ſudden concerning this Charge; there are ſome other things that are mentioned here by Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> as how far forth there be ſufficient Witneſſes, admitting the Charge were good; how far forth the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ſufficient in themſelves; and then whether here bee two concurring Witneſſes to any one act, and whether any thing be more proved then Miſpriſion of treaſon, and concealment of treaſon; theſe are things Mr. <hi>Love</hi> takes upon him in fact to ſay: And now for thoſe, when the caſe is made, we ſhall be ready to ſpeak to theſe things; for truly it is ſudden and new to me, for theſe matters came not to my knowledg till this morning after eight a clock; that is, concerning the laſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he offers to your Lordſhip, and that is, Exception to Witneſſes, proof, and matter of the proof, whether the bare concealment (for thus it is ſtated unto us, the <hi>concealment</hi>) of any thing that is treaſon whether that be treaſon or no in the party that conceals it; theſe are things that if we were prepared for, we ſhould ſpeak to. Firſt, we conceive by the Statute of <hi>primo &amp; quinto Elizabethae,</hi> there is a neceſſity in this proceeding before your Lordſhip to have two lawfull and ſufficient Witneſſes. Next of all, we thinke, that if theſe witneſſes be ſuch as he hath ſtated them to be; which whether they be or
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47192:59"/>
no, we know not, for we are utterly unacquainted with the evidence, yet we ſhould think they are no ſufficient witneſſes; and then admitting they were ſufficient witneſſes, yet if ſo be one witneſſe ſpeaks to one fact, another to another, we conceive theſe are not ſufficient witneſſes within the Statute, not ſufficient to convict him. And then, if that which they have witneſſed be nothing that amounts to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, haply committed by others, that makes him not guilty within the Acts. If we had time to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and digeſt, and conſider, what were the matters that are alledged, we ſhould be able to ſay ſomewhat to it. My Lord, that which we have ſaid, we have ſaid of a ſudden, and ſo it appears becauſe we had not that clear underſtanding of the Charge as otherwiſe we might have had, and ſo have ſaved much of your time.</p>

               <p>For that that hath been ſaid ſuddenly by Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> I ſhall ſuddenly give it this anſwer, he hath had more time then I, he hath ſaid from Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and not from himſelfe: he ſaith when the caſe is made; I think it will appear then that theſe Exceptions have been made to the Court, that the witneſſes have not been competent neither in quality nor number, they have been ſpoken to; for the witneſſes, the Exception to the quality becauſe they were of the ſame gang, they had a hand in the ſome Treaſon, that was the Exception, I think that will not be allowed to be a legall Exception, they are perſons that (as Mr. <hi>Love</hi> pretended) had a hand with him in this Fact, and therefore they ſhould not be competent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; that I ſhall appeal to Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s judgment, before conviction and upon a proceeding, whether they may not diſcover (and after conviction) if they be Approvers. For the next, for two witneſſes; when the caſe is made, you will find one, two, three, four, five, ſix, and to moſt of them two, three and four, for ſo I may make bold to ſay, for ſo I read them to you the laſt day. And then for the laſt Exception, that was for the concealment of Treaſon, it is far from it, for I know not what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment Mr. <hi>Love</hi> may intend, I am ſure Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> will not think that a concealment to run on one, two, or three years, and run on, and ſend letters; that when he acts along with them, and hath the meetings at his houſe continually; moves them to receive money, and contribute; I think hee was the higheſt Actor amongſt them, for the meetings were continually at his houſe, the advices were there reſolved upon debates, there he gave his advice one way, and they another way; I think he will not think this is but miſpriſion of Treaſon; and we never did charge it, nor intend it ſo, but went a little higher.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>If that be declared to be inſiſted upon, that the non-revealing of Treaſon, though it be a month or two, or a year or two, can be no Treaſon, then we have done with that queſtion; for then it wil reſt ſingly upon the Fact before your Lordſhip, whether there be any thing more proved, then ſuch a concealment, then it is true, we are diſcharged of that queſtion. But then concerning the proof, if Maſter Atturney will pleaſe to admit, that the proofs are ſuch as Maſter <hi>Love</hi> hath ſtated in this paper.—</p>

               <p>That I ſhall not do before hand, but to debate upon the proof, I ſhall crave your Lordſhips directions; I have gone over them already, and it hath been trouble enough to me, if it be your Lordſhips pleaſure I muſt go over the proof again, I ſhall ſubmit to you, but not to him.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> there is no witneſſes that have been heard, but they have been of the ſaid confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, that was one Exception Mr. <hi>Love</hi> made; it was debated at the producing, and over-ruled, and I beleeve your judgement will go well with us, that it was no Exception. Another was, that they have been promiſed rewards, that was likewiſe moved, and over-ruled, the Court was of opinion that they may do it; that if there bee a Treaſon, and there be many correſpondents in it, and one out of remorſe, as ſome of theſe did ſay, that when they had been there they did not like their waies, but went from them, and came to them no more; if this man, or any other man afterwards ſhall come and reveal this, it is in the power of the State either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him with monies, and to promiſe him life too, if hee ſhall faithfully do it; and this wee ſay, is a ſtronger caſe then the caſe of an Approver, which afterwards when they became Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, they muſt confeſſe the Fact, and ſay they are guilty of the Fact plainely, and openly, and yet then they are good witneſſes to diſcover this, as it was plotted in hell, for this was no other, though they had a vizard upon them, which was no otherwiſe; I ſay, if any one will diſcover ſuch; nay haply it was offered to Maſter <hi>Love</hi> himſelfe, if he would have done it: I beleeve there was ſome overtures made to him; but this is law too, by the law of this land, which is the law of God; for we have no law practiſed in this land, but is the law of God, and ſo did the Lawyers maintain it before the King in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time, the Popes, Legates, and chief Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> and did
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47192:60"/>
then prove it to them, that there was no law practiſed in <hi>England</hi> but the law of God, which our Miniſters are loath to touch, and buſie themſelves to ſtudy, but ſtudy the Ceremoniall Lawes of the Jewes, which are <hi>Mortua Mortifera,</hi> which are not to be practiſed by any other Nation, till they be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by a law; and that which is the law of God in this land, that hath ſo much preſerved it, theſe they are wilfully ignorant of, and ſay, it is civill; but I ſay, his Chriſtian law: and therefore never diſtinguiſh in a Chriſtian Nation, that the lawes are Morall and Eccleſiaſticall, with that fained diſtinction; but all the Lawes of this Nation are Chriſtian, and ſtand with Evangelicall Truth, as well as With naturall reaſon, and they are founded upon it; and therefore, Maſter <hi>Hales,</hi> we are here now to go on by theſe lawes, which are the lawes of God, and wee muſt walk in them, as wee would walk to Heaven. And for that you ſpeak of now, Mr. Atturney hath anſwered all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions every one, and I think for that matter of Fact, every one of them particularly. <hi>Mr. Love</hi> did take his Exceptions too, and they were over-ruled. Now to come, whether theſe are lawfull witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes over again, when it is in matter of Fact, and over-ruled by the judgement of the Court, Maſter <hi>Hales</hi> will not think that is regular. And then, whether there be two to one point or nor, that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your Exceptions; that I take it (Maſter <hi>Hales</hi>) is not matter of law, but for the Judges to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it; that which ſhould be matter of law, is this, whether that ſingle proofs, ſome to one, and ſome to another, joyned all together do iſſue out all this Treaſon; we want not preſidents for that, for this is a heterogeneall Treaſon, every particular that theſe Statutes make a Treaſon, they are all of them complicated, he hath gone through them all in his act, and we muſt paſſe through them all in our judgments: though every one is particular Treaſon, had it been ſingularly laid by it ſelf; yet now being laid as one concatinated Treaſon, they all of them make but one. For the next, for that of miſpriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is not charged here with miſpriſion at all, but direct Treaſons; and if it be but miſpriſion, we ſhall not for miſpriſion judge him a Traitor upon this Charge; but then, what is in his judgment miſpriſion? if this be nothing but a concealment, I think that the Court upon the Evidence will judge that it is more then a bare concealment, and whether Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> will think if I be a promoter, and concealer from one to another, and have ſo many continued meetings, whether two or three years together acting with them, &amp; concealing them, for it is not a bare concealment, but a complicated Act; for if it were but a bare notion of it, we ſhould have much ado to prove it, but (I think) the Court is ſatisfied, it is more then notion.</p>

               <p>I ſhall ſpeak a word to that <hi>Mr. Hales</hi> moved laſt, whether you will be pleaſed to hear any more of Councels, in theſe three particulars; for, under favour, theſe three particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the witneſſes, concerning their quality and number, and the Treaſon it ſelfe, theſe are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of another kind of nature then all the reſt he inſiſted upon, for the reſt are meer matters of Law, upon the formality, and inſufficiency of the Charge; theſe queſtions of the witneſſes, are queſtions that are mixt, for they depend upon the matters in Fact, and cannot be otherwiſe ſtated; now <hi>Mr. Love,</hi> though he had no Councell appeared before, yet he had in his Defence all theſe Objections too; as of the incompetency of them, becauſe they were <hi>participes criminis,</hi> and for that I think (under favour of your Lordſhips judgement) he had a full and a cleer anſwer to it, in caſe of an Approver, he is <hi>Particeps criminis,</hi> and accuſeth men that are <hi>Participes criminis,</hi> yet that man even <hi>ex merito ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia,</hi> he ſhall be pardoned, ſaith our Law, and therefore that Objection that is made againſt the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that they are promiſed rewards and pardon, that is no Objection, for in that caſe the Approver ſhall have his pardon, <hi>ex merito juſtitiae.</hi> Then for the other point, that is, whether by two witneſſes in ſuch a plot or no, to prove a Treaſonable act, that is, conſiſting meerly upon the matter of fact, that I ſhall not take upon me to repeat, you have heard it; but this I ſaid then, and this I humbly offer now, that if there be two witneſſes, though they concur not in the ſame individuall act, yet if they concur in two acts, concurring to the ſame Treaſon, they prove the ſame Treaſon; if one prove the ſending of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and another the ſending of mony, I take it theſe are two witneſſes, though they ſpeak of two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct acts; but in our proof we have gone on to two witneſſes, three or four in moſt points. But then for the miſpriſion of Treaſon, we did apprehend that, that which <hi>M. Love</hi> himſelf hath confeſſ'd, is Treaſon it ſelf; but Mr. <hi>Love</hi> is pleaſed to make his own collection upon his owne confeſſion, <hi>for I confeſſe my preſence and ſilence after theſe meetings and conſultations; but this I take to be miſpriſion of Treaſon</hi>: To this I replyed, we took it to be Treaſon it ſelfe, for our books ſay, a man muſt not ſleep, nor look, back, but go preſently to a Magiſtrate to reveal it; but when a man will not only ſleep upon it, but keep it back, and act in it, this is more then miſpriſion. But our charge is for a Treaſon it ſelfe, and truly Treaſon comprehends a miſpriſion of Treaſon in it, but this point I think neither will come in queſtion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47192:60"/>
now; for we ſay and charge, that it is a treaſon it ſelf, not Miſpriſion; and that collection <hi>Mr. Love</hi> makes, it is his own, but the judgment is yours, whether it be a Treaſon or not.</p>

               <p>Theſe points, I ſhall onely mention them, I cannot argue them now.

               <speaker>Mr. Love.</speaker>
               <p>I humbly crave leave to that effect, to prove that particular.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>No, not now, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Hales.</speaker>
               <p>Wee conceive ſuch a perſon is not a competent witneſſe: then that is out of the caſe, it ſhould ſeem, Sir. Truly, then the caſe that is put concerning an Approver, comes not to the queſtion, under favour; for though it is true, an approver at Common law, might be an accuſer; yet we are not now upon a proceeding at the Common law, when we talk of witneſſes now; but we are upon a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how far forth warranted for the witneſſes, by the ſtat. of the firſt and fifth of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6: ſo that what is ſaid concerning an Approver, comes not to this queſtion; he that may be a competent witneſſe at Common law, he is not a competent witneſſe upon thoſe ſtatutes, for the words of the ſtatute are expreſly, <hi>that hee ſhall be a lawfull and a ſufficient witneſſe:</hi> and if ſo be that ſuch a caſe were now, it is not to ſample this caſe that is before you, with the caſe of an Approver, which is a bare accuſation at Common law, and where the Jury likewiſe are to have other evidence; for either the defendant may wage his battell, or put himſelf upon his Country; and then it is at the pleaſure of the Jury whether they will beleeve the Approver or no: but by the Act of the firſt and fifth of <hi>Edward the Sixth,</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>There ſhall be two ſufficient witneſſes in caſe of Treaſon</hi>; ſo that that hath made an alteration of what was in the Common law before; one witneſſe was enough before, now two witneſſes are requiſite: and we conceive, the words <hi>lawfull and ſufficient</hi> conclude ſuch perſons: if there be not any ſuch, we are not to ſay we know, or know not: but if ſo be any perſon is drawn to make ſuch a teſtimony for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his life, and ſhall make ſuch an expreſſion, wee think, that though it is true, he is a perſon that is attainted, yet he is a perſon that is thus drawn, and we think he is not ſuch a witneſſe as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, eſpecially in ſuch a caſe as this is, where the tryall of the fact is before your Lordſhip, which is both Jury and Judg, to try the fact, and determine the law; and therefore perhaps here will be a more rigorous expectation who ſhould be, and who ſhould not be a ſufficient Witneſſe, then in caſe it were a bare tryall by Jury; there may be thoſe exceptions alledged againſt a witneſſe when the tryall is as now it is, that may not be when a triall is by a Jury; and threfore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo be that a party be thus drawn to teſtifie for the preſervation of his life, we think that this is not ſuch a lawfull and ſufficient Witneſſe as is required in ſuch a caſe. Next of all, it is ſaid in the paper, that they have detected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being parties of as deep a guilt as the perſon that is accuſed: I will not diſpute that at this time; for it is not the caſe, whether a perſon that is a plotter and confederate with one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Treaſon, may be a Witneſſe; but when a perſon is detected by lawfull Authority, before the Charge exhibited, whether ſuch a perſon who is ſo detected, whoſe life is in the hands of the State, be one of theſe competent witneſſes, we muſt leave it to your judgment in that, but we think he is not a competent witneſſe; for there is not a bare accuſation of a perſon, but (as the caſe is ſtated to us) by a perſon that ſhould be examined and confeſſe himſelf guilty of thoſe things whereof Mr. <hi>Love</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, and that before the Charge is exhibited. My Lord, the next matter is concerning the plurality of witneſſes, the number of them, we think, under favour, with ſubmiſſion, that in this caſe, ſuppoſe the Charge had been ſingly upon one act of Treaſon, wee conceive, that in that caſe there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of two perſons to prove that Charge: If the Charge be upon ſeverall Acts of Treaſon, be the Charge ſo; yet if you will bring them within any one of the acts, you muſt have two Witneſſes to bring them within that act: For ſuppoſe a man were indited of Treaſon heretofore for Levying of war, and another Treaſon for adhering to the Enemies, and another Treaſon for counterfeiting of the Coin, or thoſe kinde of things; theſe are ſeverall Treaſons, though they are all put into one Information, and haply may be put, in caſe of neceſſity, into one Indictment, as here are ſeverall acts put into one Charge. But now a proof of Treaſon within one of the Acts by one Witneſs, and a proof of a Treaſon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47192:61"/>
within another of the Acts by another witneſſe, will not be eſteemed and accounted a proof by two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; for it muſt be a proof, not that he is within the Charge, but within that part of the Charge upon which he is to be arraigned; and here is not a proving each diſtinct part of the Charge by two witneſſes, as the Statute requires. And then to come neerer, ſuppoſe the Charge were but upon one Act, as that he held correſpondence with the Scots, and did invite them &amp;c. I conceive that in this caſe, under favor, that that particular Act with which you will charge him to be a Traitor within any one law, muſt be proved by two Witneſſes. The Star-chamber courſe I know what it was, that in caſe there were one generall charge, and then it did deſcend to ſeverall particulars, one witneſs would ſerve for one, and another to another, and a third to a third, and theſe ſhould make up two witneſſes to convict the party; but we are not now in a proceeding of Star-chamber, that is laid by, it was not altogether ſo regular in all things: and then, we are not in a thing barely criminal, but in a caſe of life; and not in the caſe of life ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in a caſe wherein a party is accuſed of Treaſon, wherein the Statute doth provide that there ſhall be two Witneſſes (as I conceive) to ſwear to the ſame thing, by which you would bring him within it; otherwiſe they ſtand as ſingle Witneſſes every one apart. I have heard of a caſe (I have not had ſo much time as to look into it) concerning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rolph,</hi> indited at <hi>Wincheſter</hi>; I will not ſo much as repeat over the Caſe upon my credit to the Court; but I take it, it was thus: Hee was indited for ſomewhat about the perſon of the King; one Witneſſe depoſed about the preſenting of a Piſtol, or that he ſaid he would; another about poiſoning, or that he ſaid he would: theſe two things did conclude in one &amp; the ſame act; and though they concluded in one and the ſame as evidences, complicated eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make good one Charge, and either of them had been ſufficient, if proved by two; yet as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (this is the inconvenience, upon the ſudden we cannot offer it upon the confidence of our own knowledg, which a little time would make us wholly decline the mentioning of it, or affirm it upon our credit; but this I am informed) was not held a caſe proved by two witneſſes; and if that be ſo, then I conceive theſe ſteps; the firſt will be agreed, that the proof of ſeverall Charges by ſeverall Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, againſt ſeverall Acts, will not make a proof by two Witneſſes; it muſt be a proof by two Witneſſes againſt one act: therefore the proof of any thing againſt the Act of the 17 of July 1649, and another proof of a thing done againſt the Act of the thirtieth of January 1648; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a thing done againſt the Act of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of Aug. 1650; here the offences are ſeverall, the Treaſons ſeverall, and the Witneſſes to either ſtand ſingly by themſelves: How the caſe of the Fact is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the proof, I cannot tell; that is, whether this falls out to be the caſe. But again, if the Charge were ſingle, as now upon the Act of the 30 of January 1648, for proclaiming of the King, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Prince of Wales his intereſt to be King of England; we think, with ſubmiſſion, (which we ſhall leave to your judgment) that in that caſe there is a neceſſity of two Witneſſes to ſpeak to one thing; and not one to ſupply one part, and another to ſupply another: That ſhall be as much as I ſhall ſay concerning that; and I could wiſh that wee had had ſo much time as to look into it, to inquire what the truth of that caſe was which was tryed at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> as I take it. Now for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, that is, Whether Miſpriſion of Treaſon, concealment of Treaſon be Treaſon? if that be not inſiſted upon.</p>

               <p>Under favour, the law is, That concealment of Treaſon is not Treaſon; but if that be not inſiſted upon, then the queſtion of the fact is, whether there be any more then a proof of a conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of a Miſpriſion of treaſon; which if ſo be it be not, I can ſay no more.</p>

               <p>Truly (my Lord) I did intend to ſpeak to that of <hi>M. Loves</hi> caſe, and as of his making, but not now of his making, but as he hath made it formerly; ſurely, it is a great deal of patience and favour you have afforded him, that for matter of fact and law you have heard it all over again: As for that firſt, of the Competency of the Teſtimony, I ſhall remember his own diviſion; Firſt, of the Charge: Secondly, of the Witneſſes and the Teſtimony: The third, concerning Himſelf: And the fourth, his humble Propoſals to the Court. One part of his Defence was concerning the Witneſſes and Teſtimony, that he made a long defence to; and if it be not good evidence, that parties that are of the ſame robberies may not accuſe their fellow theeves, I think ſome muſt be unhanged that have been han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: but that I ſhall not ſpeak to, for I think not that <hi>Mr. Hales</hi> his judgment leads him to it; but if they were threatned, and ſhould be made afraid of their lives, that were ſomewhat; but that is not the caſe here. The next is for two Witneſſes: I might ſay, that by the Common Law of England, one witneſſe was enough before the Law of <hi>quinto Edwardi ſexti</hi> was made; for elſe it was not needfull
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47192:61"/>
to be made; and <hi>Mr. Hales</hi> knowes again, that as to Triall, thoſe Lawes are repealed; but not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with theſe things, or to ſay wherein they muſt concur, I did crave the favour of you to read the Witneſſes as they depoſed, and I did tell you when it was by hear-ſay, and when upon knowledge, and when by two, three, and foure, to ſeverall acts of M. <hi>Loves</hi> own actings, two, three, foure witneſſes, I think they are number enough to accuſe, and detect a perſon of as high quality. And for the laſt, for miſpriſion of Treaſon, M. <hi>Love</hi> hath ſaid that which never came into my thoughts, that ſuch actings done by <hi>M. Love</hi> could be judged miſpriſion, he that acted with them, conſulted, and debated, and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, gave his judgement one way, moved to raiſe mony, received intelligence, all brought to his houſe, and tranſacted there; I would appeal to M. <hi>Hales</hi> his judgment, whether this could be miſpriſion of Treaſon, when a party acts in it, hath the meetings at his own houſe, and hath there debates of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and Inſtructions, and Letters, I think this goes as far beyond miſpriſion, as Treaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond miſpriſion; but ſeeing theſe are new caſes before you, you have ſpent enough of your time, I ſhall not ſpend more to argue the caſes that are not.</p>

               <p>And Sir, there are witneſſes here preſent that will prove that which M.

               <p>This is to ſatisfie other men, but it is not ſo regular, and orderly to be done; but my Lord, and the Court are pleaſed to give you a faire hearing, and proceedings, that no Exceptions may bee taken to it: there was another that was as good as his word, that hee could not finde in his conſcience to ſweare againſt Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> and that was a Miniſter, that conſcience deſerved to be rectified more than five hundred pound comes to, and perpetuall impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment: that man that cannot finde in his conſcience to judge him that was a godly perſon (as hee thought) and againſt him hee muſt not give witneſs, not for Treaſon, not to ſave a Common-wealth;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47192:62"/>
and he hath had your ſentence, and moſt juſtly; <hi>I</hi> thinke all that was, was too little, my Lord. Then for the reſt, this is a diſcourſe to ſatisfie people, the Spectators here; for ſurely theſe are extravagancies, and totall irregularities; he hath had his time to except, and heard to except, and ſaid all that he hath ſaid now; and ſo there is nothing more to be done, but now for us to reſt in your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments what you will do further.</p>

               <p>You have as ill Comments as any man that wears a cap; your guiltineſs appears in this you ſay; we have heard all this that you require before; thoſe very words that you ſay of this man now particularly, go to them firſt, that he was ſaying, he was not under an Oath. It was ſaid ſo again, and again, and again at that time we brought him, and before he was examined, holding up his hand, we asked him it, and he ſaid he did, and put it to him again, and again, Are you under an Oath? till at the laſt he did conclude and teſtifie he was under an Oath; I teſtifie this before all the company here, this is noiſed abroad, again by many people, the care we had of that very man you ſpeak of, you asked him three or four times then, and at the laſt upon the concluſion, he confeſſed himſelfe he was under an Oath, hee did not doe as you doe, you will ſay things are truth, but you will not ſpeake thoſe Truths before God in a teſtimoniall way, though ſome of your Witneſſes that proved, ſaid it was true in the preſence of God, what they gave under their hands; theſe men that do thus, are no better than Jeſuits in reality, though not in name. You made a Confeſſion of miſpriſion of Treaſon you ſaid, but you have confeſſed Treaſon. I will tell you who did the like in the very words almoſt that you did, and that was Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> when hee came to ſee the evidence produced ſo full againſt him by thoſe that were <hi>participes criminis,</hi> as you are, himſelfe confeſſed when hee came to the laſt, Had I thought (ſaith hee) that the State had had ſuch cleare proofe againſt mee, I would have ingenuouſly confeſſed it, and not trifled with them as I have done: So you ſaid, you did not thinke it would have been proved ſo farre as miſpriſion; but when it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſufficiently in your apprehenſion, and convicted, and your counſell had informed you it could not be leſſe than miſpriſion, then you would ingenuouſly confeſſe, ſo did <hi>Garnet.</hi> The other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was threatned, it was teſtified by a worthy Captaine; I ſpeak it again, was not it debated as much as the wit of man could? did you not object that then that you do now? and did not the Court then ſatisfie you, or at leaſt ſatisfie themſelves that it was not ſo? For I tell you in that verie thing wherein you ſay he was threatned, it was told you, that the Captaine that was here then, depoſed what hee had done, and how hee had done it, and at what time it was delivered; for you were diſcovered long before that, and your Examinations taken long before that; upon this now when your Treaſon was diſcovered and declared by ſeverall Witneſſes, and that ſuch a one was in confederacy, and I think the State might ſafely promiſe him life, and reward too; for there is more in the plot yet, then is yet found out, and that ſome are like to hear of within this fortnight, that were here, which is a dangerous thing; but this you did declare, and the Court was ſatisfied,
<pb facs="tcp:47192:62"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:47192:63"/>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47192:63"/>
that all that was promiſed as a reward, was for diſcovering of a plot againſt the State: and that was lawfull by the Lawes of God and man. And now you bring Witneſſe; you were at firſt demanded whether you would bring them or no; and you asked indempnity for them, and the next time you denyed you would bring none; and now you are asked what you have to offer to the Court, and after all this time, what come you to doe now? to prove that that was acted here in the Court; you ſay, we threatned them; true, that we did threaten ſome, and I think we went thus far, that if he would not, we would ſet five hundred pounds fine upon his head; but he would none of that, but came in again, and delivered his knowledg. But you had another of your own Robe too that came in, and hee would not teſtifie, and why? His conſcience was tender; his ſcience was perfect enough to ſpeak againſt you; for hee was confederate with you, and hath confeſſed enough of it; but his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was tender: No man can tell here whoſe conſcience is crazy, and tender; conſcience is a thing betwixt God and man onely; and they that lay nothing upon their Conſciences to prove their integrity, they had as good ſay nothing before a Judg; for though wee have a Law of Conſcience in England, yet that Law is judged by rules; and therefore he, whoever he be that pretends Conſcience, there are ſo many conſciences, as there are men, and no men have power to judge of it but God; but Sir, for that cauſe that he would not for his tender conſcience, we did ſet a fine of 500 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. upon him, and ſentenced him to the Fleet til he paid it: we call not this terrifying, neither doth the law; nor any reward favour nor affection, for the diſcovery of a Traitour, is no illegall act, this wee told you before; but you muſt have it again, and again, and again; ſo that you may delay, no time ſhall be omitted by you.</p>

               <p>It is true, we are here only to do that duty that your Lordſhip injoyns us to (my Lord.) It is true, for us to diſpute whether this evidence proveth ſuch a thing or no, haply it may not belong to us to do that: But thus far, if your Lordſhip think fit, this may haply be allowable (with ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Court) that is, whether, if the proofs be admitted, this man poſitively proves thus, the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther man proves poſitively thus; whether that theſe two proofs do make a proof of one fact, haply (if your Lordſhip ſhall ſo think fit) there may be ſomewhat of Law in that; that is, whether it make a double Teſtimony within the Statute of <hi>Primo</hi> and <hi>Quinto:</hi> For (with ſubmiſſion to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) the Statute of <hi>Primo</hi> and <hi>Quinto</hi> is not repealed as to point of Teſtimony; it is repealed as to the place from whence the triall is to come; but not in point of Witneſſes, therein it may come in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe (if your Lordſhip ſhall think fit:) But truly, I have not ſeen one word of the evidence from the beginning to the end; and if ſo be that any matter ſhould riſe, that the Court ſhould think fit, as well as proper for me to offer in the defence of this Gentleman, I muſt profeſſe I cannot, unleſſe I had ſeen the things; for I have not ſeen one word.</p>

Though there be but little between him and death, he knows, there is but little between him and heaven; and that raviſheth his heart. The Lord bleſs and require thee for thy wiſe and good counſel; thou haſt prevented me, the very things I thought to have written to thee, thou haſt written to me: I have had more comfort from thy gracious letter, than from all the counſel I have had from any elſe in the world; well, be aſſured, we ſhall meet in heaven.

                  <p>I Am now going from a Priſon to a Palace; I have finiſhed my work, I am now to receive my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; I am going to heaven, where are two of my children, and leaving thee on the earth where are three of my babes; thoſe two above need not my care, but the three below need thine. It comforts me to think two of my children are in the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and three of them will be in the arms and care of ſo tender and godly a Mother: I know thou art a woman of a ſorrowfull ſpirit, yet be comforted: though thy ſorrow be great for thy Husbands going out of the world; yet thy pains ſhall be the leſs in bringing thy child into the world; thou ſhalt be a joyfull Mother, though thou beeſt a ſad Widdow. God hath many mercies in ſtore for thee; the prayers of a dying Husband for thee will not be loſt. To my ſhame I ſpeak it, I never pray'd ſo much for thee at liberty, as I have done in priſon. I cannot write more, but I have a few practical counſels to leave with thee, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Keep under a found, orthodox, and ſoul-ſearching Miniſtry; Oh there are many deceivers gone out into the world, but Chriſts ſheep know his voice, and a ſtranger will they not follow. Attend on that Miniſtry that teaches the way of God in truth, and follow <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, Prov. 19.27. <hi>Ceaſe to bear inſtruction that cauſes to erre from the ways of knowledg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Bring up thy children in the knowledg and admonition of the Lord: the mother ought to be a teacher in the fathers abſence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.27. <hi>The words which his mother taught him:</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> was inſtructed by his Grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> and his mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.5.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47192:66"/>3. Pray in thy family daily, that thy dwelling may be in the number of the families that do call on God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Labour for a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Pore not on the comforts thou wanteſt, but on the mercies thou haſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Look rather at Gods end in afflicting, than at the meaſure and degree of thy afflictions.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Labour to clear up thy evidences for heaven, when God takes from thee the comforts of earth, that as thy ſufferings do abound, ſo thy conſolations in Chriſt may abound much more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Though it is good to maintain a holy jealouſie of the deceitfulneſs of thy heart, yet it is evill for thee to cheriſh fears and doubts, about the truth of thy graces; If ever I had confidence touching the grace of another, I have confidence of grace in thee; I can ſay of thee as <hi>Peter</hi> did of <hi>Silvanus,</hi> I am perſwaded that this is the grace of God wherein thou ſtandeſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.12. Oh my dear ſoul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doſt thou doubt, whoſe heart hath been upright, whoſe walkings have been holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could venture my ſoul in thy ſouls ſtead, ſuch a confidence have I of thee.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. When thou findeſt thy heart ſecure, preſumptuous and proud, then pore upon corruption, more than upon grace; but when thou findeſt thy heart doubting and unbelieving, then look on thy graces, not on thy infirmities.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Study the covenant of grace and merits of Chriſt, and then be troubled if thou canſt. Thou art intereſted in ſuch a covenant that accepts purpoſes for performances, deſires for deeds, ſincerity for perfection, the righteouſneſs of another, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Jeſus Chriſt, as if it were thine own. Oh my Love! reſt, reſt then in the love of God, in the boſome of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Swallow up thy will in the will of God; it is a bitter cup we are to drink, but it is the cup our Father hath put into our hands, When <hi>Paul</hi> was to go to ſuffer at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Chriſtians could ſay, The will of the Lord be done; Oh, ſay thou, when I go to Tower-hill, The will of the Lord be done.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Rejoyce in my joy; to mourn for me inordinately, argues that either thou envieſt, or ſuſpecteſt my happineſs. The joy of the Lord is my ſtrength, oh let it be thine alſo. Dear wife, farewell; I will call thee wife no more, I ſhall ſee thy face no more: yet I am not much troubled, for now I am going to meet the Bridegroome the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom I ſhall be eternally marryed.</p>
