         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Proceedings at the Seſsions in the <hi>Old bayly,</hi> on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 17th of this Inſtant <hi>January</hi> 1676/7.</head>
            <p>NOt to trouble the Reader with a tedious Relation of things trivial or impertinent, the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable or remarkable Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Seſſions were as follows.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the tryal of that grand and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impoſtor <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> of whom to give the world a brief Account, we muſt acquaint you, that he was originally a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyman-Taylor, and (ſome ſay) afterwards kept a Botchers ſtall; but having a ſtrange enthuſiaſtick head, began about the year 1651, to enter into Confederacy with one <hi>Reeves</hi> (another Brother of the Sheers) who reſolve to cut out a new Scheme or Faſhion of Religion; and to that purpoſe declare
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38180:3"/>
themſelves, The two laſt VVitneſſes of God that ever ſhould be upon the Earth; and that they had abſolute and irrevocable power to ſave and damn whom they pleas'd; to which end one call'd himſelf the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> the other the <hi>Curſing</hi> Prophet. And the ſaid <hi>Reeves</hi> dying ſome years ſince, <hi>Muggleton</hi> pretends his Spirit was left with him, and the whole power of <hi>Witneſſing, Bleſſing,</hi> and <hi>Curſing,</hi> devolved into his hands, which he as im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piouſly practiſed upon the leaſt affront or oppoſition; pronouncing perſons damn'd by their particular Names, blaſphemouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>That God, Angels, or Men could not afterwards ſave them.</hi> And as all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks covet to be Authors and Ring-leaders to a Sect, ſo by divers printed Books and Corner conferences, he eaſily ſeduced divers weak and inſtable people (eſpecially of the Female-Sex) to become his Proſelytes, who from him call themſelves <hi>Muggletonians:</hi> So impoſſible it is for the wildeſt and moſt ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as well as moſt impious Notions, when broached with impudence among the Rabble, not to meet with ſome heads ſo irregular as to embrace them for ſerious Truths, or divine Revelations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38180:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This <hi>Muggleton</hi>'s houſe being ſearched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, a great quantity of his books were ſeized, ſome of which, it was now proved, he owned the writing of, and that he had caus'd them to be printed; for which he was now indicted, many wicked Paſſages out of them being recited in the Indictment, but ſo horrid and blaſphemous, that we think fit to ſpare the Chriſtian modeſty of each pious ear, by not repeating the ſame here, where there is no neceſſity for it. The Priſoner pleaded not guilty, but fruſtrated the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expectation, by ſaying nothing further ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to excuſe or juſtice himſelf, but had a Counſel appear'd for him, who ingenuouſly declar'd himſelf aſham'd to ſpeak a word in favour of ſuch a Cauſe; onely deſired the Court to take notice, that the Books were dated before the laſt Act of Grace; but it being uſual to Antedate or Poſt-date Titles of books, as beſt ſuits with the Publiſher's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and that he had ſince that Act owned and publiſhed the ſame, that Plea was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd; and the ſaid <hi>Muggleton</hi> being found guilty by the Jury, was afterwards ſentenced by the Court to ſtand three days in the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38180:4"/>
at three the moſt eminent places of the City, with Papers ſhewing his Crime; and his Books ſo ſeized, divided into three parts, to be burnt over his head upon the Pillory: And beſides, to be fined Five hundred pound, and to continue in Goal till the ſame be paid, and afterwards for his life, unleſs he procured good Bail, ſuch as the Court ſhould accept of, and not of his own Gang, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or Sect, for his being of the good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
            <p>The next was a woman of about Forty years of age, and one that had ſix Children by a Husband ſince dead, but was, it ſeems, ſtill of too Youthful a temper; for being lately deliver'd, by her ſelf, of a Baſtard-child on a <hi>Wedneſday</hi>-morning, ſhe moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly murthered it by cruſhing the head, and wounding it both in the ſcull and eyes (as is ſuppoſed) with a pair of Sizzars, and then fairly puts it into a Platter and ſets it upon a ſhelf, where it continued till <hi>Saturday</hi>-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when a woman lodging above her in the ſame houſe, coming down to viſit her, and examining her more ſtrictly, by reaſon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38180:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of ſome ſymptoms the obſerved, ſhe now Priſoner confeſs'd ſhe had miſcarried, and looking for the <hi>Embryo</hi> they found a perfect Child murthered, as you have heard. She pretended her ſelf diſtracted when the fact was done; but it appearing that ſhe had ſenſe enough to endeavour to conceal it, ſhe was Convicted and Condemned</p>
            <p>A man was likewiſe Condemned to die for a kind of unuſual Crime, but ſuch as the Law, by reaſon of its bad example and miſchievous tendency, has thought fit to reſtrain with capital Puniſhment; which was, that there being a Suit at Law depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two perſons, the Priſoner comes and perſonating another man, is Bayl for one of the parties before a Judge; upon which afterwards the man whoſe name he had aſſumed knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the buſineſs, was taken up, to his great damage, &amp;c. He begg'd heartily for Tranſportation, but it could not be granted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38180:5"/>
Four Bayliffs and Followers were arraigned by one they went to arreſt, who pretended to have loſt ſome odde Trifles; but they were not found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Two perſons were Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die, two Burn'd in the hand, and two ſentenced to be Whip'd: And ſo the Seſsions ended with the day.</p>
