            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SINCE through Prejudice, Misapprehension, or other Weakness (sometimes or other the Fate of all Mankind, I have incurr'd the Censure of many; 'tis but reason I should let them know, that my more Enlightned Understanding has sufficiently convinced me of my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hasty and prejudicial censure of the <hi>Discipline of the Church of England,</hi> as it stands now by Law Established; and since of late by many worthy Champions for the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> the <hi>Church of England</hi> has been sufficiently vindicated from the least Aspersion, her malicious Adversaries the <hi>Romanists,</hi> especially the <hi>Priests,</hi> could against her Reputation suggest: So I my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>elf (for some time past) have not to my poor Ability been wanting in my care and endeavours to support Her Honour and Credit, and free Her from the least Imputation of ill whatsoever: And though my Misfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>une meeting with an unhappy Juncture of time, may have rendred me Obnoxious to the Censure even of some good men; yet since the Effects of those Designs which <hi>England</hi> has by sad Experience seen levelled against even the foundation of <hi>Protestant Interest,</hi> have been both Publick &amp; Answerable to the Conjectures of every wise man, that at that time took any Obervation of them; I have no reason to Dispair now at last of Reconciling my Self again to their good Opinion, and truly, though I am sufficiently satisfied of my Error (or my Crime) in adhering to a Party, or Person (whose Title to the Office he then took upon him was every way Questionable) yet they that will without prejudice consider the great Dangers at that time threatning the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> and State of this Kingdom, will I believe, be easily induced to lay aside all Animosities conceived against me, and conclude, that I rather mistook the manner and methood of Curing, than that I was any ways Ignorant of the malignity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper; however, His Royal Highness the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> has already dissipated all our Fears as to this Point, who as he seems by a peculiar Providence: to have been mark'd out for the Work he has now Undertaken, so besides the Justice of his Claim to the <hi>Protection of our Religion and Laws,</hi> has by all the Actions of his Life, demonstrated that Pity and Piety, Religion and Justice, more than any other Consideration whatsoever, has prompted him to this glorious Undertaking: and though the Glory of the best and greatest Action in the World, like the Sun, may meet with some cloudy Obstruction and Interpretation, in the Hearts of some few preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd, I will not say ignorant men, yet does the general Joy that has, and yet fill the Hearts of the Nobility, and Commons of these Kingdoms, does evidently demonstrate, that all his Royal Highnesses proceedings, before, and since his Arrival, tend to no other thing, nor the least point deviate from fulfilling the utmost expectation and desires of this Nation: We are not now (having by woful Experience, bought our Knowledge) ignorant of the crafty Divices, and Arts of the Romish Priests, to divide and disturb the Hearts of the People of <hi>England;</hi> by insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and suggesting to them his Royal Highnesses inclination, to alter or restrain any part of the Service of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law Established; but as the Objection to any that have the Honour, to know the Prince is frivolous and groundless; so a very little time will repose these false Dreamers, to the unavoidable necessity of being found in a Lye: and though it has been the Opinion of many pious and zealous Assertors of the Interest of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it now stands, Establish that with all submission, some Regulations in the the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, might be offered for the better Accommodating and Uniting some small diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which by the malicious Fomentations of our common Adversaries have prov'd fatal to this Nation. Yet it has ever been his Royal Highnesses Resolution, to leave them the open Consideration, and final Determination of a Free Parliament; 'tis rather likely than impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that this Innocent, though Hearts Vindication of my <hi>Self;</hi> (for he must be over grown with prejudice that can misdoubt the rest) may meet with a reception very unsuitable to the design it is writ with, for such is our vitious Nature, that we much rather strive to lash past miscarriages, than encourage good Resolutions; and as I can appeal to the Natural, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently necessary infirmities of all which Nature, for Favour, if not Pardon for my past Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; so my Experience of the Fatigue and Vanity of all Worldly business, with the assistance of God, which I heartily pray for; has reduced me to fix my Resolution of setting my self <hi>apart,</hi> wholly for the Service of God, before whose Alter I shall by his Grace to endeavour to present my self an Holy, Pure, and Unspottted Sacrifice for ever.</p>
