            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>May it pleaſe your Honour,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE the Commons of <hi>London,</hi> in Common-Hall Aſſembled, being deeply ſenſible, that many of the Miſchiefs and Grievances that we at preſent groan under, are occaſioned by the Miſbehaviour, and irregular Carriages of ſome of the principal Officers of this City, particularly of Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> Knight, our preſent Recorder, who, by very confident but falſe Affirmations, hath endeavoured to miſlead the Common-Council, in Matters of higheſt Moment: And alſo, contrary to the Duty of his Place, and the greateſt Truſt repoſed in him, hath, as we have juſt reaſon to believe, frequently made other falſe Suggeſtions and Miſrepreſentations to his Majeſty, of our moſt Loyal and Dutiful Actions and Demeanours. And finding that he hath maliciouſly contrived, to ſubvert one of the great Foundations of our Engliſh Liberties, by menacing and threatning Juries, thereby to make them bring in Verdicts, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Conſcience, but his own Will and Pleaſure; and diſcharging others contrary to Law, before they had compleated all the Buſineſs for which they were ſworn: as doth notoriouſly appear, by his late and terrible Uſage of the Grand-Inqueſt of this City, at the Seſſions of Peace holden in <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi> And laſtly; That he doth frequently affront, and moſt ſcurrilouſly intreat Witneſſes, appearing to give their Teſtimonies in the ſeveral Judicatures, whereby they many times become affrighted and confounded: Tending to the great Oppreſſion of his Majeſty's Subjects, to the Scandal and Diſhonour of the City, and to the diſquieting of the Peace and Unity thereof; to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Juſtice, and dangerous Prejudice of the Publick-Weal of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. By which ill Carriages, and moſt inſolent Behaviour, he hath rendred himſelf moſt obnoxious, and inſupportably burdenſom in that Office.</p>
            <p>We do therefore moſt humbly pray your Lordſhip, to conſider with your Worſhipful Brethren the Aldermen, of the moſt ſpeedy and effectual Way that can be taken, for the immediate removing of the ſaid Sir <hi>Geo. Jefferies,</hi> from the Place of Recorder of this City, as a Perſon dangerous and deſtructive to the Publick Peace, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and Proſperity thereof: To the end that ſome other more fit and honest Perſon, learned in the Laws, of known Loyalty, Modeſty, Integrity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Zeal for the true Proteſtant Religion, may be Elected into the ſame: Which, We humbly conceived, may be the beſt and moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Means, conducing to the Remedy of theſe Miſchiefs, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the good Government of this renowned City.</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioners ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</closer>
