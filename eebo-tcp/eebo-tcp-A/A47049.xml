            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Stonehenge</hi> Situated in the midst of the Plains, 6 Miles distant from the City of Satisbury, is esteemed one of the wonders
of England. It is a great huddle of large unpolisht Stones, placed in a circular fashion, but in such an irregular manner that
its affirmed to be impossible to count their Number, some of these Stones are 30 feet high, and there are some Stones laid across
the Tops of others, that all the strength of Man could not perform without the help of Engines, nor are there any Carriages
now in use, that could carry such prodigious Bodies of Stone, so that how they came there no body can imagine, for there
is no such Stone within 100 Miles of it, nor any Quarries of Stone in any Countries about. Most Authors are silent
concerning the Compilers of this Stupenduous Work, the best of them are only uncertain Guessers.</p>

            <head>STONEHENG
RESTORED,
BY
INIGO IONES Esquire.</head>
            <p>BEing naturally inclined in my younger years to
study the <hi>Arts of Designe,</hi> I passed into forrain parts to
converse with the great Masters thereof in <hi>Italy;</hi>
where I applied my self to search out the ruines of those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Buildings,</hi> which in despight of <hi>Time</hi> it self, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of <hi>Barbarians</hi> are yet remaining. Having satisfied my
self in these, and returning to my native <hi>Countrey,</hi> I applied
my minde more particularly to the study of <hi>Architecture.</hi>
Among the ancient monuments whereof, found here, I
deemed none more worthy the searching after, then this of
<hi>Stoneheng;</hi> not only in regard of the <hi>Founders</hi> thereof, the
<hi>Time</hi> when built, the <hi>Work</hi> it self, but also for the rarity of
its <hi>Invention,</hi> being different in <hi>Forme</hi> from all I had seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
likewise, of as beautifull <hi>Proportions,</hi> as elegant in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and as stately in <hi>Aspect,</hi> as any.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames,</hi> in his progresse, the year one thousand six
hundred and twenty, being at <hi>Wilton,</hi> and discoursing of this
<hi>Antiquity,</hi> I was sent for by the right Honourable <hi>William</hi> then
<hi>Earl of Pembrook,</hi> and received there his Majesties commands
to produce out of mine own practise in <hi>Architecture,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in <hi>Antiquities</hi> abroad, what possibly I could discover
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99064:7"/>
concerning this of <hi>Stoneheng.</hi> What mine opinion was then,
and what I have since collected in relation thereunto; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make the subject of this present Treatise. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
in the intricate, and obscure study of <hi>Antiquity</hi> it is
far easier (as <hi>Camden</hi> very well observes) to refute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
a false, then to set down a true and certain resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For mine own part, in what I shall here deliver, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to struggle against any opinion commonly, and
long since received. Let every man judge as it pleaseth
him. What opinion soever the Reader inclines to, I shall
not make much materiall, my aime being, a desire only to
vindicate, as much as in me lies, the <hi>Founders</hi> of this vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Antiquity</hi> from oblivion, and to make the truth, as far
forth as possibly I may, appeare to all men.</p>
            <p>Severall Writers, both Strangers, and our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen,
have treated of <hi>Stoneheng.</hi> Before recite whose opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
I think not amisse to seek this subject from the most
ancient times, endevouring thereby to give satisfaction
whether or no, the <hi>Druides, alias Druidae</hi> (in Authors indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
written, and in old time the <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>Britans</hi>
and <hi>Gauls</hi>) or the ancient <hi>Britans,</hi> for the <hi>Druid's</hi> use, might
not be the <hi>Founders</hi> of so notable a monument; which if
they were, there is then no cause why bestow farther study
or pains, in searching who the <hi>Founders</hi> were, but acquiesce
in the honour of our own Nations first erection of it.</p>
            <p>As far neverthelesse, as from History ancient or moderne
may be gathered, there is little likelyhood of any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
considering especially what the <hi>Druid's</hi> were; also, what
small experience the <hi>Britans,</hi> anciently inhabiting this Isle,
had, in knowledge of what ever <hi>Arts,</hi> much lesse of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
with like elegancy and proportion, such goodly
works as <hi>Stoneheng.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Druid's</hi> in the first place, true it is, they are
reported in ancient times, to have been in great esteeme in
this Island, where their discipline, and manner of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Caesar. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. lib. 6.</note>
was supposed to be first invented, and from hence
translated into <hi>Gaul. Disciplina in Britannia reperta</hi> (saith <hi>Caesar</hi>)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99064:7"/>
               <hi>atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur.</hi> They are said in
like manner to have ordered and disposed all divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as well in relation to their severall kinds of Sacrifices,
as to expounding whatever rites of their idolatrous super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition;
insomuch,<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 16.</note> you may call them (if you please) the
Bishops and Clergy of that Age.</p>
            <p>Their power moreover, and preheminence was not
confined within the strict limits of sacred matters, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
a more large prerogative, temporall negotiations,
and affairs of State were transacted by them: the managing
of Peace and War was usually remitted to their Authority,
even when Armies were ready to joyn in Battell. <hi>Publica iis</hi>
(saith <hi>Strabo</hi>) <hi>&amp; privata judicia committuntur, &amp; aliquando cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
bellorum disceptandis jam acie congressuros composuerunt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Strab. lib. 4.</note> Judges
they were (saith <hi>Caesar</hi> also) in almost all civill and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
causes:<note place="margin">Caesar. lib. 6.</note> sentence they gave in case of life and death: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
they did controversies, and debates betwixt party and
party: finally, whatever else was requisite and convenient
to keep the people in due obedience to their <hi>Princes,</hi> they
wholly took the care and charge of.</p>
            <p>These were the maine affaires wherein the employment
of the <hi>Druides</hi> consisted, and whereunto they wholly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
themselves. Whosoever desires to know more of
them, may read <hi>Caesar, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Pliny, Diogenes
Laertius, Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> and such like ancient Authors.
But, whatsoever these, or other Historians have written of
the <hi>Druides,</hi> certainly, <hi>Stoneheng</hi> could not be builded by
them, in regard, I find no mention, they were at any time
either studious in <hi>Architecture,</hi> (which in this subject is
chiefly to be respected) or skilfull in any thing else condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
thereunto. For, <hi>Academies</hi> of <hi>Designe</hi> were unknown
unto them: publique Lectures in the <hi>Mathematiques</hi> not
read amongst them: nothing of their <hi>Painting,</hi> not one
word of their <hi>Sculpture</hi> is to be found, or scarce of any Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(<hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Astronomy</hi> excepted) proper to informe
the judgement of an <hi>Architect;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vitr. li. 1.</note> who, (as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> saith)
should be <hi>peritus Graphidos, eruditus Geometria, &amp; Optices non
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99064:8"/>
ignarus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>perfect in Designe, expert in Geometry, well seen in
the Opticks, skilfull in Arithmetick, a good Historian, a diligent
hearer of Philosophers, well experienc'd in Physick, Musick, Law
and Astrologie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all that have written of the <hi>Druid's,</hi> no Author knew
them better then <hi>Caesar,</hi> neither hath any more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
them; who after a large discourse of their
discipline,<note place="margin">Caesar. li. 6.</note> priviledges, and <hi>Theologie, Multa de sideribus</hi>
(saith he) <hi>atque eorum motu, de mundi ae terrarum magnitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,
de rerum natura, &amp;c. disputant, &amp; juventuti transdunt.
They make much dispute, and instruct their Scholars in many things
concerning the Stars, and their motion, the greatnesse of Heaven and
Earth, of the nature of things &amp;c.</hi> As for other Arts relating to
the <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> or any works of this kind, he makes no
manner of mention, though himself an <hi>Architect,</hi> glorying
in his own, and much more extolling others invention in
that <hi>Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, those ancient times had no knowledge of
publique works, either Sacred or Secular, for their own use,
or honour of their <hi>Deities.</hi> Besides, they us'd not any build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Stone, or (for ought is manifest) knew so much, as
how to order working therein. The <hi>Druid's</hi> led a solitary
contemplative life, contenting themselves with such habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
as either meer necessity invented, to shelter them
from contrariety of seasons, without <hi>Art,</hi> without <hi>Order,</hi>
without any whatever means tending to perpetuity: or,

the highest secret of their mystery, rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

            </p>
            <p>To this purpose, <hi>Humphrey Lloid,</hi> in his history of <hi>Wales,</hi>
The vast woods growing in that Island, were not only by
the <hi>Romans,</hi> but afterwards, when the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith took
place in this <hi>Nation,</hi> by the <hi>Christians</hi> also fell'd and rooted
out. And why? because of the idolatry (saith he) and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
Religion used in them. Again, in his Epistle to <hi>Orte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
concerning the Isle of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> the same Author affirmes;
Though there is little wood now growing there, yet every
day the roots and bodies of huge trees of a wonderfull
length and bignesse are by the inhabitants found, and digged
out of the earth, in divers places in low grounds, and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
fields.</p>
            <p>Now, if in stead of these roots, and bodies of trees, the
ruines of ancient Structures had been there found, it might
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99064:9"/>
peradventure, with some probability, have been presumed,
either that the <hi>Druid's</hi> used <hi>Temples,</hi> or some other buildings
of stone. For, their ancient seat was in the Isle of <hi>Mona,</hi> now
<hi>Anglesey,</hi> whence modern Writers style it <hi>Insulam Druidum,</hi>
the <hi>Island</hi> of the <hi>Druid's,</hi> and <hi>sedem Druidum,</hi> the seat
of the <hi>Druid's.</hi> And from hence, questionlesse, it came
to passe, the <hi>Romans,</hi> with such difficulty, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Suetonius Paulinus,</hi> brought that Island under their
power; nor was it wholly subdued to their Empire, untill
<hi>Iulius Agricola's</hi> time. For, whereas in other parts of <hi>Britain,</hi>
the people contended for Liberty only, there, they fought <hi>pro
aris &amp; focis,</hi> for Liberty, and Religion both.</p>
            <p>There it was the <hi>British</hi> armies (saith <hi>Tacitus</hi>) being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battailed,<note place="margin">Tacit. Ann. lib. 16.</note>
the women ran to and fro amongst them in sable
weeds, their hair about their ears, and fire-brands in their
hands, like infernall furies, the <hi>Druid's</hi> round about them
also, lifting up their hands to Heaven, and pouring forth
deadly curses; the novelty of which sight bred such amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the <hi>Roman Legions,</hi> (the <hi>Romans</hi> here, it seems, were
unacquainted with the <hi>Druid's</hi> till then) that they stood
stock still, and close together, not once moving a foot, as if
possessed with a resolution to act nothing at all, but receive
their deaths tamely and without any great resistance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, besides, that History hath not remembred the
ruines of any ancient buildings digged up in <hi>Anglesey;</hi> if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this <hi>Antiquity</hi> had been remaining in that <hi>Island,</hi> or any
Author delivered such Actions of the <hi>Druid's,</hi> as aforesaid,
performed about the place, where <hi>Stoneheng</hi> remains stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there might have been some advantage made thereof to
the purpose now in hand. But <hi>Anglesey</hi> excepted, ancient
Writers give them residence in no part of <hi>Britain</hi> beside, nor
are they remembred by any, to have been found elsewhere,
throughout the whole Nation. With respect whereunto, if
the <hi>Druid's</hi> had knowledge, either to build the like magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
structures, or use, for any such, they would, without
all peradventure, have erected them upon the same place ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
where themselves resided, then elswhere.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99064:9"/>
Neither are we to wonder, they chose such an out-nook
or corner as <hi>Anglesey,</hi> to reside in; in regard, there, they lived
remote, and solitary; there, were store of caves, and dens
to instruct their Scholars in, close and retired places for their
own habitations, and plenty of groves to perform their
sacred mysteries in. Moreover, they past their days there,
like the Hermits of old time, according to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
in full contentment, and with free liberty to study,
and contemplate what they pleased. For, <hi>Anglesey</hi> (we must
know) in those times of yore, was wholly overgrown
with desert Woods, and obscure forrests, from whence the
ancient <hi>Britans</hi> call'd it <hi>Ynis Dowil,</hi> the shadowy or dark
<hi>Island.</hi> Which name it still retains, and is well known there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to the now inhabitants, who are, even at this day, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
enclined, (yea, they usually accustome themselves) to
commit things more to Memory, then Writing; and, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received it by tradition from their Ancestors, living
in those ancient times, still endevour to observe that custom
of the <hi>Druid's, who held it unlawfull to commit any thing
to writing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caes. Com. lib. 6.</note> As <hi>Caesar</hi> (in the sixth book of his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

            <p>Concerning the <hi>Britans</hi> in the next place, The condition
of those ancient inhabitants of this Island in the <hi>Druid's</hi> time
duly considered, (<hi>viz.</hi> in what manner they lived, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
in all Sciences, and civill customs, what Deities
they had, in what places they adored them, and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of buildings, or sacred or secular, were used by them)
as little reason appears, that this Antiquity was by them
erected.</p>
            <p>As for their manner of living, the <hi>Britans</hi> were then a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
and barbarous people, knowing no use at all of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<note place="margin">Herodian. lib. 3.</note>
               <hi>Vestis usum non cognoscunt</hi> (saith <hi>Herodian.</hi>) Now, if
destitute of the knowledge, even to clothe themselves, much
lesse any knowledge had they to erect stately structures, or
such remarkable works as <hi>Stoneheng.</hi> What fashions they
used to adorn their bodies with, the same Author tells us.
<hi>As a rare and rich habiliment, they wore about their wasts
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99064:10"/>
and necks ornaments of iron</hi> (saith he) <hi>and did pounce and
colour their bodies with sundry forms, in rude manner repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
severall creatures.</hi> In which regard, they would
not be otherwise clothed, lest constrain'd thereby to hide
such their simple (though with them much esteemed)
bravery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, in other their civill customs, they were no lesse
rude and ignorant; yea, so barbarous, even in things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to common sustenance, and whatever husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry;<note place="margin">Strabo li. 4.</note>
that</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Strabo) Quidam eorum ob imperitiam caseos nullos
conficiant, cum tamen lacte abundent: alii hortos colendi, &amp; aliarum
partium agriculturae ignari sunt. Many of them, though they had great
plenty of milk, yet their want of skill was such, they knew not how to
make cheese: others so simple, they knew not to order their gardens or
orchards, or any thing belonging thereunto.</p>
            <p>Their Countrey also then lay uncultivated, no corn sown:
<hi>Quaevis herba &amp; radix cibus est, Their food was herbs and roots</hi> (saith
<hi>Dion Cassius.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Ral. li. 3. c. 5.</note> And (by the way) it may not inappositely be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
milk, roots, and fruit were the chief banquetting
dishes; and skins of beasts (if clothed) the most costly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
of our Forefathers. Now who can, in reason imagine,
that any great knowledge, practice, or delight of Arts and
Sciences, wherein the elegancy of Architecture consists,
should be in use or esteem, amongst a people, wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
(as I may so say) and given over to such barbarity?</p>
            <p>There were then no publick roads, or common high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to passe from one place to another, no constant habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<hi>Nec moenia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dion li. 76.</note>

of <hi>Xiphiline</hi> hath it) much lesse <hi>Temples,</hi> or other buildings
made of stone, composed by Art, with Order, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
            <p>Moreover, who cast their eies upon this Antiquity, and
examine the same with judgement, must be enforced to
confesse it erected by people, grand masters in the Art of
building, and liberall sciences, whereof the ancient <hi>Britans</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Besides, it is not to be past over in silence, how <hi>Tacitus</hi>
expresseth himself in the before cited fourteenth Book of
his Annals, telling us; <hi>The</hi> Romans <hi>overthrew not the Temples,
or razed to the Foundations, any of the sacred structures of the</hi> Druid's
<hi>and</hi> Britans <hi>made of stone, or other materials, which he might as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
have done, if they had used any such: but positively, the</hi> Romans
<hi>cut down the</hi> Britans <hi>woods and groves, amongst them reckoned holy,
and consecrated to their execrable superstitions.</hi> True it is, other
Temples, of greater magnificence then already spoken of,
I find none: Ornaments of Art to enrich them they were
not acquainted with: such orderly composed works as
<hi>Stoneheng,</hi> they had not any: yea, no kind of sacred stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of stone were in use amongst them: their idolatrous
places being naturally adorned, only with wild, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
shades, designed and brought to perfection by
Dame Nature her self, she being Architect generall to all
their Deities. Nor did it consist with their vain Religion to
use any other, they making their worship, performing their
Ceremonies, offering their Sacrifices in dark and obscure
groves, most conformable unto their barbarous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane,
humane oblations.</p>
            <p>Neither must it seem strange, they used no other Temples
then these,<note place="margin">Mayer. 1 K. 1. Ch.</note> it not being their custom alone; for the <hi>Excelsi</hi>
or high places mentioned in the sacred Story, wherein the
Heathen performed idolatrous rites unto their Idols, were
commonly groves, affectedly sited upon some mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
place, without any <hi>House</hi> or <hi>Temple.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi>
of old, (of whom <hi>Herodotus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Herod. li. 1.</note>) <hi>Neque statuas, neque templa,
neque aras extruere consuetudo est, Erected neither Images, nor Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
nor Altars: quinimo hoc facientibus insaniae tribuere, accounting
it great folly and madnesse in those that did:</hi> but ascending to
the tops of the highest, and most lofty hils, on them offered
sacrifices to their Gods. From hence, <hi>Xerxes,</hi> in his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
burnt down the Temples of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> because they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99064:12"/>
shut up their Gods therein, to whom all things are open
and free, and to whom the whole Universe serves for a
Temple. The <hi>Abasgians</hi> also (inhabiting Mount <hi>Caucasus</hi>)
did worship, even till <hi>Procopius</hi> his time, groves and woods;
and in a barbarian simplicity esteemed the very trees them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be Gods. In like manner, the Northern and Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
people of <hi>America,</hi> made all their Invocations and
Exorcisms in woods. The ancient <hi>Germans</hi> likewise conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
woods and forests. <hi>Lucos ac nemora consecrant,</hi> saith <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
of them. And the like places for idolatrous supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
did divers other barbarous Nations use, before redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to order, and civility of life, <hi>Tacitus</hi> giving this reason
for it: They thought it a matter ill beseeming the greatnesse
of their Deities, to enclose them within Temples made by
Art. His words are, <hi>Nec cohibere parietibus Deos arbitrantur,
They thought it not fit to restrain their Deities within compacted walls:
id est, neque templis, neque domibus,</hi> viz <hi>neither within Temples or
Houses made with hands,</hi> as <hi>C. Pichenas</hi> commenting thereon
more fully interprets.</p>
            <p>Touching the manner of the buildings of the ancient
<hi>Britans,</hi> and of what materialls they consisted, I find them
so far short of the magnificence of this Antiquity, that they
were nor stately, nor sumptuous; neither had they any thing
of <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Symmetry,</hi> much lesse, of gracefulnesse, and <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
in them, being only such as <hi>Ovid</hi>

of them began to make themselves habitations of boughs, some to dig

themselves places of lome and twigs, and such like materials, to creep
into, and shroud themselves in.</hi> Directly after which manner of

they have inclosed, and fenced therewith a large circuit of wood, therein
they raise cabbins and cottages for themselves, and hovels for their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
of no great continuance, but only to supply their present use and

esteem'd the <hi>Polybius</hi> of the <hi>Latines</hi>) be throughly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it will evidently manifest, (whatever else hath formerly
been delivered) there was no such thing in <hi>Britain,</hi> before
the <hi>Romans</hi> arrived here, as that which we now call <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heng.</hi>
What credit else with posterity could <hi>Tacitus</hi> expect
to gain, in affirming the <hi>Britans</hi> were taught and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the liberall Sciences by the <hi>Romans;</hi> if those <hi>Arts</hi>
acknowledg'd, to be practis'd amongst the <hi>Britans</hi> before?
What need to have told us, the <hi>Romans</hi> made them skilfull
in erecting sumptuous <hi>Palaces,</hi> stately <hi>Portico's,</hi> and publick
places, if the inhabitants here, accustomed to enjoy such
noble buildings, before the <hi>Romans</hi> arrivall in this Land?
Why, tell succeeding Ages, when gentle persuasions not
prevail, to make the <hi>Britans</hi> innovate, and admit of sacred
structures to whatever Deities, <hi>Agricola</hi> compell'd them to
found magnificent <hi>Temples,</hi> and assist therein, if this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> extant before those times? Why also, should
the <hi>Britans</hi> look upon the <hi>Temple</hi> erected by the <hi>Romans</hi> at
<hi>Camalodunum,</hi> (supposed <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi>) in honour of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
sacred memory, as an <hi>Altar of perpetuall dominion</hi>
over them, if been used to such structures before? yea,
such an eye-sore the <hi>Britans</hi> accounted it, as, that <hi>Temple</hi> was
one of the principall causes, which gave birth to that fatall
insurrection under <hi>Boadicia.</hi> Neither would <hi>Tacitus</hi> have
magnified the introducing those customs amongst them, as
admirable policy in <hi>Agricola,</hi> and the true and only rule to
bring them from their rude, and dispersed manner of living
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99064:16"/>
to civility, if the <hi>Britans</hi> attain'd such discipline before, or
any knowledge in the excellency of <hi>Architecture</hi> preceding
the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> government here. No, for what saith
<hi>Camden?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cam. fo. 63.</note> 
               <hi>It was the brightnesse of that most glorious Empire, which
chased away all savage Barbarism from the</hi> Britans <hi>minds, like as
from other Nations, whom it had subdued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the time of this <hi>Agricola, Britain</hi> was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovered, the <hi>Romans</hi> had circumnavigated it, and
knew, for certain, it was an Island, formerly doubted
of till his time; yea, there was not a Port (as I may so say)
a bay, mountain, valley, hill, plain, wood, or forest, either
any custom, rite, ceremony, or what else belonging to the
knowledge of the Countrey, or manners of the People, but
the <hi>Romans</hi> were then as well acquainted with (especially,
in that part of the Island now call'd <hi>England</hi>) as, at this day,
the Inhabitants themselves are. Neverthelesse, what men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
soever is made by their Historians, concerning other
matters of the <hi>Britans,</hi> not one word is to be found of this
Antiquity, or any building of this kind in use amongst
them. But, because some curiously learned have desired
somwhat to be spoken for their better satisfaction touching
this particular, I have been too prolixe. In a word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let it suffice, <hi>Stoneheng</hi> was no work of the <hi>Druid's,</hi> or
of the ancient <hi>Britans;</hi> the learning of the <hi>Druid's</hi> consisting
more in contemplation then practice, and the ancient <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
accounting it their chiefest glory to be wholly ignorant
in whatever Arts. Neither could it be otherwise, seeing
<hi>their life so uncivil, so rude, so full of wars, and consequently void of
all literature.</hi> (as <hi>Camden</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cam. fo. 4.</note> relateth)</p>
            <p>Yet, before I come to speak of this middle Age (if I may
so call it) wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> prevailed, and to compleat
their victories gave first rise to civility in this Island; as, I
began with times of great Antiquity, so must I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to those lesse ancient, and modern, wherein, as poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
hath suffered an irreparable damage, through want of
writing in those first times, so hath it been almost at as
great a losse, by too much writing in later times; so many
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99064:17"/>
Authors, so much contrariety, so little certainty is found
amongst them. Who, when they could not search out the
truth in deed, laboured to bring forth narrations invented
by themselves, without or reason, or authority: delivering
(saith <hi>Camden</hi>) their severall opinions, rather with a certain
pleasant variety to give contentment to their <hi>Readers,</hi> then
with any care or judgement to find out the truth of
things.</p>
            <p>THOSE ancient Historians who (among other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Britans</hi>) treat of this Antiquity, differ much in
their severall reports. And, as it is usuall with <hi>Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
of other Nations, where, they cannot give a just and
rationall accompt of unwonted accidents, beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
course of things, to fill up their stories with fabulous,
and incredible relations; so, no marvell, if we hear the like
in our own Histories. <hi>Credibile enim est calamitatem bellicam,
quae ecclesias un√† cum bibliochecis exhauserat infinitis, clara vetusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
monumenta abrasisse. For evident it is, through the calamities of
wars</hi> (saith <hi>Leyland</hi>)<note place="margin">Leyland. de assert. Arth. fo. 35.</note> 
               <hi>which together with infinite Libraries ruined the
Churches themselves, the certain records of our Antiquities, are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lost. Unde scripturienti de antiquitate</hi> Britannica <hi>occultissima

of them, for the most part, very obscure and doubtfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some others again, especially the most ancient and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
<hi>British</hi> Historians, who liv'd in Ages next succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those, wherein, <hi>Stoneheng</hi> might probably be first ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
have wholly passed it over with silence. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
venerable <hi>Bede, William Malmesbury, Roger Hoveden,</hi> and
others, speak nothing thereof, as happily, willing rather
to decline it altogether, then deliver it upon frivolous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
and in so-doing cast a blemish upon their other
labours. Neither is it improbable, that the most ancient
Authors, considering the times wherein they wrote, upon
the first springing up of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> here, might
through zeal unto the true God, forbear to commemorate
unto posterity, places designed for idolatrous uses; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring

rather, to suppresse the memory thereof, and make
succeeding generations sollicitous therein; then, in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of Divine worship, to illustrate the magnificence of
the Heathens, for building such notable structures to their
false Gods. Insomuch, I find very little, or no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at all thereof in the <hi>British</hi> Stories, except by <hi>Geffrey Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
with some who follow him, and by such Authors
only, as our most judicious Writers hold in many things,
either meerly fabulous, or overladen with malicious, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentary
untruths. Such relations neverthelesse, as they
make thereof, I shall endeavour to deliver in their own
words, reduceable into two conjectures, <hi>viz.</hi> either that
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> was erected by <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> (in ancient times King
of the <hi>Britans</hi>) in memory of the <hi>British</hi> Nobility perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
slain at a treaty by <hi>Hengist</hi> the <hi>Saxon:</hi> or else, set up

King.</p>

in ancient times, a pile of stones worthy admiration, called the
<hi>Giants Dance,</hi> because Giants, from the remotest parts of <hi>Africa,</hi>
brought them into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in the plains of <hi>Kildare,</hi> not farre

he might leave some famous monument of so great a treason to after
ages, in the same order, and art, as they stood formerly, set them up,
where the flower of the <hi>British</hi> Nation fell by the cut-throat practice
of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and where under the pretence of peace, the ill secured
youth of the Kingdom, by murdrous designs were slain.</p>

               <note place="margin">Polychr. li. 5.</note> speaking of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> alias <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relianus

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99064:19"/>
(as Sir <hi>Iohn Trevisa</hi> the Priest in old English laid it down)
<hi>His brother Uter Pendragon by help of Merlin
the Prophet brought</hi> Choream Gigantum, <hi>that is
Stonehenges out of Ireland. Stonehenge is
now in the plain of Salisbury: of that bringing
of Stonehenge out of Ireland, speaketh the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It appears,</hi> Rainulph <hi>of</hi> Chester, <hi>as easie credit as he gave to
strange stories, had not much confidence in this: and if,
according to</hi> Geffrey Monmouth, <hi>or</hi> Matthew Westminster, <hi>I
should set it down, I presume you would be of his mind.
But, I affect not such conceits, they are neither fitting my
discourse, nor your perusall. Neverthelesse, seeing none of
them tell us, by what ways, or Arts, Giants (as they will have
it) brought them from the remotest parts of</hi> Africk <hi>into</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>(for it seems they could not hansomly find a</hi> Merlin <hi>to
help them therein also) I shall take so much leave, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Geffrey Monmouths <hi>steps, as to give you, at least, some part
of the story, and relate (according to their opinions) how
they came from</hi> Ireland <hi>hither. After</hi> Geffrey Monmouths <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of</hi> Uter Pendragons <hi>victory over the</hi> Irish, <hi>who with</hi>
Merlin <hi>forsooth and a great Army, were sent by</hi> A. Ambrosius
<hi>to fetch the Giants dance,</hi> Lapidum structuram adepti <hi>(saith he)</hi>

<hi>Merlinus</hi> &amp; ait, utimini viribus vestris juvenes, ut in deponendo
lapides istos, sciatis utrum ingenium virtuti, aut virtus ingenio ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat,
&amp;c. <hi>i.e.</hi> Having found the structure, from joy they fell into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and standing all of them at gaze round about it, <hi>Merlin</hi>
draws near, and thus bespeaks them: Use now your utmost strength
young men, that in taking away these stones, you may discover, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Art to strength, or strength gives place to Art. At his command
therefore, they bring severall sorts of engines, and addresse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to pulling it down. Some ropes, some cables, some had made la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ready, that what they so much desired, might be effected, but in
no wise able to atcheive their purpose. Deficientibus cunctis, solutus

All of them tired, <hi>Merlin</hi> breaks out into laughter, and provides his
engines. Lastly, when he had set all things in a readinesse, hardly to be
beleev'd it is, with what facility he took them down: being taken down,
he caused them to be carried to the Ships, and imbarqued; and so with joy
they began their return towards <hi>Britain. Leaving it for us to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
with as small labour they were imbarqued, disimbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued,
and brought from their landing place to</hi> Salisbury <hi>plain:
all (it seems) done by</hi> Merlins <hi>spels. But of this too much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, as I contemne fables, so doe I imbrace, and
take pleasure in the truth of History: and therefore, that
which concerns the slaughter of the <hi>British</hi> Nobility by
treason of <hi>Hengist</hi> commander of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as of greater
moment, and truth, I shall more fully relate. And <hi>Geffrey
Monmouth's</hi> Authority in this treacherous slaughter of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
though I respect not so much, as <hi>Ninnius, Malmsbury,
Sigebert,</hi> and others that affirm the same; yet, because he
was the first, after so many, and so ancient Authors, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> their monument, and <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> founder
thereof, and therefore must trace him, and his followers
therein; I will give you the history likewise from him, and
thus it was: <hi>Hengist,</hi> upon his return with new supplies
into <hi>Britain,</hi> finding <hi>Vortigern</hi> beyond expectation restored
to the Crown, and withall greatly alienated in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards him, prepared for his defence, with force of
arms. But, whether he thought himself too weak; or, that
he rather sought to be especially revenged on the <hi>British</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
who had wholly unriveted his designs, or both; he
thought it no difficult matter to delude him by a Treaty,
whom formerly he had so easily beguiled with his Neece
<hi>Rowena.</hi> To which purpose, he makes an overture, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the enmities betwixt them at a Parley; and the King
accepting it, appoints <hi>Ambresbury</hi> Town their meeting place,
<hi>Nec mora, statuta die instante convenerunt omnes intra nominatam

the place) <hi>statuta die instante convenerant omnes intra nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natam

for their Countreys cause neglected in their funerals,
he leaves not there, but gives us the direct place, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their buriall, affirming plainly they were buried by
a Metropolitane of those times, even in a Church yard, as
Christians should. <hi>In coemeterio, quod est juxta c<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

word mentioned (I pray observe) of <hi>Salisbury plain,</hi> where
this <hi>Antiquity Stoneheng</hi> remains, throughout all their Story.</p>
            <p>But, it's objected, although they were buried at the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
the monument for their memory might be set up
elsewhere, in a place more proper, and more conspicuous;
even, as in the most properly conspicuous places where great
actions happened <hi>Trophies</hi> were erected by the <hi>Romans,</hi>
whose customs <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> living long time amongst them,
knew very well. I answer, <hi>A. Ambrosius,</hi> is suppos'd by <hi>Bede,</hi>
and the best Authors, descended from the <hi>Romans;</hi> who,
living many years under their subjection, in forrain parts,
had fully inform'd his judgement, no doubt, with whatever
customs, civill or martiall, then in use amongst them. For,
though the <hi>Romans</hi> in those times, had utterly lost all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Arts, questionlesse civill, and martiall customs in
some sort continued with them. Neverthelesse, if <hi>A. Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
did erect any monument for the <hi>British</hi> Nobility, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doubtlesse endeavoured to observe the rules of his own
Religion, being a Christian, then the Heathenish customs
of his Ancestors. However, in erecting it, at the place of
their interment, he pursued both. As for the Christians ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
to posterity their famous men after death, it being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99064:21"/>
so well known, I need not relate it. And, as concerning the
ancient <hi>Romans</hi> manner in burying their Emperours, and
those that had triumphed, or otherwise deserved well of
the Common-wealth, though they burned their bodies
abroad,<note place="margin">Thomas. Procachio fo. 46.</note> the place for sepulture of their Ashes, was within
the City, monuments to their memory being erected, upon
the same place where buried; so was <hi>Publicola</hi> honoured, so
the <hi>Fabritii,</hi> the <hi>Caesars,</hi> and others. And, after the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
it seems, was the monument for the <hi>British</hi> Nobility
(if any) set up where they were interred; as in the place of all
others most proper for it, all the considerable circumstances
touching their deaths, happening there in like manner.</p>
            <p>It's true the <hi>Romans</hi> set up <hi>Trophies</hi> for great Victories, in
the most eminent places where those victories were obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by them; as the <hi>Trophy</hi> for <hi>Caius Marius</hi> his vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> in the most notable place where that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
field was fought. Also, the <hi>Trophy</hi> dedicated to the
memory of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> that by his happy conduct, all
the <hi>Alpine</hi> Nations, were reduced to <hi>Roman</hi> obedience, was
erected in the most conspicuous place of the <hi>Alps.</hi> Now,
this martiall custome considered, the <hi>British</hi> Nobility being
(as the aforesaid Historians maintain) slaughtered in the
Town, and buried at the Monastery adjoyning. Some one
of those high hils, on either side <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> had certainly
for site been more eminent, and the monument it self more
exposed to the daily view of travellers, then about two
miles from the Town, in a place remote, where this <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
stands. Which, though indeed eminent of it self, and
overlooking the plains adjoyning; yet, at a large distance,
especially on that side towards <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury</hi>-ward,
is so surrounded with hils; as it appears with an
Aspect of Religious horror, rather then as carrying any form
of whatever sepulture.</p>
            <p>This, though sufficient to refute the preceding objection
(the former reasons being grounded upon customs only) I
shall yet, from the histories of those times, further answer
thereunto; <hi>Mathew Westminster</hi>

compleated his victories over <hi>Hengist,</hi> and subdued his sons
at <hi>York; Deinde porrexisse ad monasterium</hi> Ambri, <hi>ubi principes
defuncti jacebant, quos</hi> Hengistus <hi>prodiderat; from thence came to
the Monastery at</hi> Ambresbury, <hi>where the deceased Nobles, whom</hi>
Hengist <hi>betrayed, lay buried.</hi> And <hi>Geffrey Monmouth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">G. Mon. li. 8.</note> prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the same story, affirms also, that <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> being
come to the Monastery, <hi>ut locum quo defuncti jacebant circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xit,
pietate motus in lachrymas solutus est, dignum namque memoria
censebat cespitem, qui tot nobiles pro patria defunctos protegebat.
So soon as he cast his eyes upon the place where the slaughtered Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
lay interred, deplored them; esteeming that very ground which
covered so many Nobles, dying for their Countreys cause, worthy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
memory.</hi> Upon this consideration, <hi>Praecepit</hi> Merlino (saith
the same Author) <hi>lapides circa sepulturam erigere, quos ex</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernia
<hi>asportaverat.</hi> A. Ambrosius <hi>commanded</hi> Merlin, <hi>that
the stones brought out of</hi> Ireland (for he still troubles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and readers therewith) <hi>should be erected about the
place of their buriall.</hi> Whereby it clearly appears their
Sepulchre was set up about the same place where they
were buried, and not elsewhere. Also, as fully that their
buriall place (as both the said Historians have told us) was
at the Monastery of <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> or Churchyard adjoyning
to it. All which former circumstances duly weighed, 'tis
not possible <hi>Stoneheng</hi> should be supposed their Monument;
except <hi>Geffrey Monmouth,</hi> having made so formall a tale of
their easie transportation from <hi>Ireland,</hi> would compell us
also to imagine, posterity might as easily be induced to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
they were in like manner removed from the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
at <hi>Ambresbury</hi> to <hi>Salisbury</hi> plain, the one being equally
as ridiculous as the other, and no manner of credit to be
given to either.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, laying all the aforesaid Authorities together.
First, that <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis</hi> formerly cited, tells us, (in that
part of his story which carries most likelihood of truth)
a Monument was set up by <hi>A. Ambrosius,</hi> in memory of the
<hi>Britans,</hi> slain at a Treaty by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> upon the very same
place <hi>where slain;</hi> and in order thereunto the aforesaid <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:99064:22"/>
Historians unanimously affirming the place at which
that treaty was held, and where those <hi>Britans were slain,</hi>
was the Town it self of <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> not where this <hi>Antiquity
Stoneheng</hi> remains: again, if suspect <hi>Cambrensis</hi> authority, and
allow rather what our Historiographer of <hi>Monmouth</hi> saith,
That the Monument was erected by <hi>A. Ambrosius,</hi> upon that
plat of ground, where the slaughtered <hi>Britans lay buryed;</hi>
he telling us also, their <hi>buriall place</hi> was in the Churchyard
of the Monastery at <hi>Ambresbury</hi> (at the Monastery it self,
saith <hi>Matthew Westminster</hi>) certainly then their Monument
(whatsoever it was) being set up at the place, where they
were both slain and buried, and (according to the aforesaid
Authors) they being nor slain nor buryed at <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> it
must necessarily follow, this <hi>Antiquity</hi> was not erected in
Honour of those <hi>Britans.</hi> Unlesse any man will undertake
to prove (which most certain it is none can) <hi>Stoneheng</hi> stands
now, where <hi>Ambresbury</hi> stood of old: or that the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
and Churchyard thereof were not at <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> but
at <hi>Stoneheng.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Monastery of three hundred Monks, stood
there, (to wit at <hi>Ambresbury) Camden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cam. fo. 254.</note> out of the Book called
<hi>Eulogium,</hi> affirms. And, that the Churchyard was close ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
to it, there's no question to be made. First, because
in all times since Monasteries erected, it was always in use,
to lay out places for Churchyards belonging to them, near
to the Monasteries themselves. Secondly, because divers
Sepulchres, upon severall occasions, broken up at <hi>Ambres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
Monastery, manifest the same. Thirdly, because <hi>Gef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
Monmouth</hi> plainly tels us, they were buried in <hi>coemeterio,
quod est juxta coenobium; in the Churchyard which is close by the
Monastery.</hi> Lastly, it is further confirmed by these his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
recited words,<note place="margin">G. Monm. lib. 6 &amp; 8.</note> 
               <hi>A. Ambrosius being come unto the Monastery,
cast his eyes upon the place where the slaughtered Princes lay interred.</hi>
Which is not possible he should have done, if the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
had been at <hi>Stoneheng;</hi> it being very well known <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heng</hi>
cannot be discerned, even from the highest hils, upon
those parts especially, that next surround <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> much

            <p>Among other Sepulchres found at the said Monastery,
it's worthy memory, that about the beginning of this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,

as much to say, <hi>Regina Guinevera,</hi> declaring her title and
name; and the date <hi>An. Chr. 600.</hi> (if truly copied) agreeing
(possibly well enough) with the time of her death? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<hi>Leyland</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leyl. de as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. Arth.</note> affirms, severall Writers make mention, she
took <hi>upon her a Nuns veil at</hi> Ambresbury, <hi>died, and was buried
there.</hi> To which he gives so much credit, that (what ever
<hi>Giraldus Cambrensis</hi> delivers to the contrary) he will by no
means allow, either her body to be afterwards translated
from <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> or, at any time, buried by her husband
King <hi>Arthur</hi> at <hi>Glastonbury.</hi> Unto <hi>Leylands</hi> reasons for her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment
at <hi>Ambresbury, Camden</hi> (it seems) inclines also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wholly silent of her Sepulchre, discovered any where
else: though he at large sets down all the circumstances of
her Husbands body, its being found at <hi>Glastenbury.</hi> For, had
<hi>Camden</hi> apprehended any thing inducing him to beleeve,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99064:24"/>
her body had been together with his there found, he would
never, certainly, have concealed it from posterity.</p>
            <p>Whether the aforesaid Tomb so found, were her
monument, yea or no, enough concerning the slaughter
and sepultures of the aforementioned <hi>Britans;</hi> as also, that
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> was not erected in memory of them. Let us come
now to <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius,</hi> and see whether <hi>Polydore Virgill's</hi>
story in relation to <hi>Stoneheng</hi> agrees with what other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have delivered of <hi>Aurelius.</hi> For from <hi>Polydore's</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
our modern Writers raise their second, and quite
contrary opinion:<note place="margin">Speed lib. 7.</note> namely, that the <hi>Britans</hi> erected this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi>
for <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> his Sepulchre.<note place="margin">Stow fo. 53.</note>
            </p>

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Britans</hi> in memory of his great atchievements for
the Commonwealth, erected a magnificent Sepulchre to their Chieftain
<hi>Ambrosius,</hi> made of great square stones in form of a Crown, even
in that place, where fighting, he was slain, that the prowesse of so great
a Commander, should neither be forgotten amongst themselves, who
then lived, or left unremembred to posterity. Which Monument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
even to this day, in the Diocese of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> near unto the
village called <hi>Amisbery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This opinion of <hi>Polydore</hi> is grounded (as I conceive) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no great likelihood. For, should the <hi>British Nobles,</hi> far
inferiour to <hi>A. Ambrosius,</hi> in honour, and dignity, be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the Churchyard of a Monastery, and a Sepulchre
assigned for <hi>Ambrosius</hi> himself in the open fields? Should
that <hi>Christian</hi> King, who had accomplished so many great
atchievements victoriously against the <hi>Pagans,</hi> enemies to
<hi>Christ?</hi> Caused Churches to be repaired, which the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism
of the <hi>Saxons</hi> had destroyed? pulled down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished
idolatrous places of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and (as is more
probable) rather, then erected by him, whilst living, to
others, or by others, to his memory after dead, the very first
that began to deface this Heathenish sacred structure, (for,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99064:24"/>
though a <hi>Roman,</hi> yet a <hi>Christian,</hi> and zeal to true Religion,
might, no doubt, cause him dispense with ruining idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
<hi>Temples</hi> though formerly built, and consecrated to
false Gods by his seduced Auncestors) should he, I say, be
buried Pagan-like, in unsanctified, unhallowed ground,
and others far lesse eminent, lesse conspicuous, in more
noble, and sacred places? It could never be. Neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of State, nor fervor of piety, in those more scrupulous
times, could ever admit thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Had</hi> Polydore, <hi>or any other, told us some Pagan-Saxon-Commander
lay there intombed, 'twould have carried a
shew of much more credit, and the ancient custome of that</hi>
Peoples <hi>burying their dead might have been produced, at
least as a probable argument, to confirm the same. For the
Saxons a Pagan Nation, if any of</hi> their Princes or Nobility died,
in their houses at home of sicknesse, were buried in pleasant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
gardens; if from home, and in the wars, not far from their
camps, in heaps of earth cast up in the fields, which heaps they called
Burrows: and the promiscuous common people in medows and open
fields. <hi>Saxones</hi> Nobiles gens Christi ignara, in hortis amoenis, si domi

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polydore</hi> neverthelesse, had great reason to imagine <hi>A. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius</hi>
famed the restorer of his Countrey (and Bulwark of

            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, at <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> that is, <hi>Ambrose</hi> his Town,<note place="margin">Cam. fo. 254.</note>
(<hi>Camden</hi> tels us) <hi>certain ancient Kings, by report of the</hi> British
<hi>story, lay interred.</hi> Whether <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> was one of them, or
no, I argue not; yet the same Author saith, <hi>Ambrose Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
gave name unto the place. And why not, he being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
there, as well, as upon the translation of the body of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
that most Christian King, the Town of <hi>Edmundsbury</hi> in
<hi>Suffolk</hi> was so called?</p>
            <p>It manifestly hence appears, <hi>Stoneheng</hi> no Sepulchre, either
erected by <hi>A. Ambrosius,</hi> or by the <hi>British</hi> Nobility, or to any of
their memories. Some Monument there was, perhaps, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
set up in honour of them, at the Monastery of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bresbury.</hi>
Which, the fury of the <hi>Saxons</hi> when victorious, or
violence of time, which destroyeth all things, utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming,
might happily be the reason, Historians in succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ages, finding so notable an <hi>Antiquity</hi> as <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> not
far from thence, and not apprehending for what use it was
first built, suppos'd no other thing worthy <hi>A. Ambrosius,</hi> or
those <hi>Britans,</hi> then such an extraordinary structure. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
the Monuments in those ancient times, made for great
Princes here in <hi>Britain,</hi> were onely two Pyramids between
which interred, of no extraordinary bignesse erected to
their memory in what e're Religious places those Princes
lay buried. Moreover, if seriously take notice of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sorts of Sepulchres used by divers Nations, none are
found bearing like <hi>Aspect</hi> with this work <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> but of
other kinde of <hi>Architecture,</hi> far different in <hi>Form, Manner,</hi>
and <hi>Composure.</hi> Some, made of one Columne onely; or,
if otherwise, only a vase erected on the place of buriall, as
amongst the <hi>Athenians:</hi> Some, had a Columne whereon the
shields used in War by the deceased, whilst living, were fixt,
as in those medals of silver, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to <hi>Vespasian:</hi> Some, a Columne with a Statue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so the famous Columne of <hi>Trajan</hi> had a <hi>Colossus</hi> on the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99064:28"/>
top thereof, as by his medals also appears. Again, the <hi>Gauls</hi>
on the tops of Mountains, erected <hi>Pyramid's</hi> or <hi>Columnes,</hi> as
Monuments to their Princes. The <hi>Saxons</hi> were buried (as
said before) in huge heaps of earth, to this day visible
among us. The <hi>Keep</hi> of the now <hi>Castell</hi> S. <hi>Angelo</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> was
the Sepulchre of the Emperour <hi>Adrian.</hi> (such mighty moles
were the Monuments of the <hi>Romans</hi>) The <hi>Greeks</hi> erected
<hi>Altars,</hi> and instituted Sacrifices to the memory of their <hi>Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
as the <hi>Spartans</hi> to <hi>Lysander:</hi> The renowned <hi>Carian</hi>
Queen made the <hi>Mausoleum</hi> for her husband, a massie bulk
of building, 140 foot high: The huge <hi>Pyramid's</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi>
causing such wonder in the world, were Sepulchres of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Kings. In a word, amongst all Nations, Sepulchres
whether little or great, were always reall and solid piles;
not airous, with frequent openings, and void spaces of
ground within, exposed to Sun and wind, neither uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
like this <hi>Antiquity;</hi> or in any manner so built, as may
enforce the least presumption, that this our <hi>Stoneheng</hi> was
ever a Sepulchre.</p>
            <p>I have given you a full relation what concerning <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heng</hi>
hath been delivered by Writers, in respect of us though
ancient, yet in regard of the great antiquity of this <hi>Work,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
but modern, <hi>Geffrey Monmouth</hi> living not full five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years ago, and <hi>Polydore Virgill</hi> long after him, in King
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighths reign: Who, as they are the principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
that write any thing of <hi>Stoneheng;</hi> so, upon what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
deliver the same, they make not appear. Insomuch,
<hi>Camden</hi> gives no more credit to their relations in this very
particular, then unto common sayings, (so he cals them)
as if grounded upon <hi>Fame</hi> only, or invented by themselves.
And it may the rather be so presumed, because, as they lived
not in ancient times, and consequently could not themselves
bear testimony of any such things; so, neither the <hi>Britans</hi>
nor <hi>Saxons</hi> for a long time after their first arrivall here, had
any Records or Writings to convey whatever actions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their own, or others to posterity. <hi>Ninnius</hi> a <hi>British</hi>
Historian, living about one thousand years ago, telling us,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99064:28"/>
Britannos <hi>doctores nullam peritiam habuisse, &amp;c. The great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Doctors of</hi> Britain <hi>had no skill, nor lest memoriall of any
thing in writing:</hi> confessing, that himself <hi>gathered whatsoever he
wrote, out of the Annals and Chronicles of the holy Fathers. Nec</hi> Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones

Saxons <hi>being unlearned</hi> (saith <hi>Leyland) leave almost any thing in
writing to posterity, of the actions performed in those times betwixt
themselves and</hi> Britans: <hi>whatsoever, remembred after Christ taught
in this Island, of the first victories of the</hi> Saxons, <hi>being both taken up
upon trust from the mouth of the common people, and committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from vulgar reports only. Neither the</hi> Britans, <hi>utterly worn out
with so many wars, had</hi> (as the same Author hath it) <hi>or desire, or
opportunity, had they desired it, to bestow their pains in compiling any
whatever history, that might commend their actions to succeeding
Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, it may be objected: If <hi>Polydore Virgill,</hi> and <hi>Geffrey
Monmouth</hi> could neither be eye-witnesses themselves, nor have
authority from other more ancient Authors for what rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them concerning <hi>Stoneheng:</hi> and that from whatever
writings ancient or modern, not any thing of certainty can
be found out concerning the same; from whence then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
for what use, or by whom <hi>Stoneheng</hi> erected? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
though not appear from Histories written either by
the <hi>Britans</hi> or <hi>Saxons;</hi> yet, as <hi>Gildas</hi> professing he wrote his
History (for the former reasons) <hi>by relations from beyond
Sea:</hi> and, as <hi>Ninnius</hi> his <hi>out of the Annals and Chronicles
of the holy Fathers</hi> as aforesaid: so, severall other ways a
possibility of truth may be gathered, namely, from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of other Nations; from the concurrence of time for
such undertakings; from the customs of forepassed Ages
in like works; from the manner and form of building
proper to severall Countries; from the use to which such
buildings applied, and the like. Upon which, as occasion
serves, intending hereafter more largely to insist, I shall in
the mean while set down the judgement our late Writers
give of this <hi>Antiquity.</hi>

Camden, <hi>a diligent searcher after Antiquities of our Nation,
having, in his</hi> Chorography <hi>of</hi> Wiltshire, <hi>collected all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
opinions, together with his own, gives a summary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of</hi> Stoneheng,<note place="margin">Cam. fo. 251.</note> 
               <hi>in words as follow.</hi> Towards the North,
about six miles from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in the plain, is to be seen a huge and
monstrous peece of work, such as <hi>Cicero</hi> termeth <hi>insanam substru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem.</hi>
For, within the circuit of a ditch, there are erected in manner
of a Crown, in three ranks or courses one within another, certain mighty
and unwrought stones, whereof some are twenty eight foot high, &amp; seven
foot broad, upon the heads of which others, like overthwart peeces, do
bear and rest cross-wise, with a small tenon and mortaise, so as the whole
frame seemeth to hang; whereof we call it <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> like as our old
Historians termed it for the greatness the Giants dance. Our Countrimen
reckon this for one of our wonders, and miracles. And much they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
from whence such huge stones were brought, considering that in
all those quarters bordering thereupon, there is hardly to be found any
common stone at all for building: as also, by what means they were set
up. For mine own part about these points I am not curiously to argue
and dispute, but rather to lament with much grief, that the Authors of
so notable a Monument are thus buried in oblivion. Yet some there
are, that think them to be no naturall stones hewn out of the rock, but
artificially made of pure sand, and by some glewy and unctuous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
knit and incorporate together, like as those ancient trophies or
monuments of victory which I have seen in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> And what
marvell? Read we not I pray you in <hi>Pliny,</hi> that the sand or dust of
<hi>Puteoli,</hi> being covered over with water, becometh forthwith a very
stone, that the cisterns in <hi>Rome</hi> of sand, digged out of the ground,
and the strongest kind of lime wrought together grow so hard, that they
seem stones indeed? and that statues and images of marble scalings,
and small grit grow together so compact and firm, that they were dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
entire and solid marble? The common saying is, that <hi>Ambrosius
Aurelianus,</hi> or his brother <hi>Uther</hi> did rear them up, by the art of
<hi>Merlin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thus far</hi> Camden, <hi>it being needlesse to repeat
more from him, having already delivered the story from the
Authors themselves. Yet here neverthelesse, as necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
thereunto, I shall take leave to observe something
more remarkable to our purpose in hand, upon his words.</hi>

In the first place then, <hi>Stoneheng</hi> is by him called <hi>a huge
and monstrous peece of work,</hi> terming it from <hi>Cicero, insanam sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structionem.</hi>
To which I say, had <hi>Camden</hi> as well attained
other abilities of an <hi>Architect,</hi> as he was skilfull in <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi>
or been as conversant in <hi>Antiquities</hi> abroad, as learned
in those of his own Nation, he would have given a far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
judgement hereof. For, whosoever is acquainted
with the ancient ruines yet remaining in and about <hi>Italy,</hi>
may easily perceive this no such huge building, either for
the circuit of the work, or bignesse of the stones, they being
as manageable to the <hi>Roman Architects,</hi> as amongst us to raise
a May-pole, or mast of a Ship. And, if this styled <hi>huge</hi> and
<hi>monstrous,</hi> what may be said of <hi>Diocletians</hi> baths? the great
<hi>Cirque? Marcellus</hi> his Theater? <hi>Vespasians Temple of Peace?</hi>
and other prodigious works of the <hi>Romans?</hi> the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
whereof now lying in the dust, breed amazement
and wonder (not without just reason too) in whosoever
beholds them with attentivenesse and judgement. Nay,
whereas he styles it <hi>insanam substructionem,</hi> it's demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable,
that betwixt this Island of great <hi>Britain,</hi> and
<hi>Rome</hi> it self, there's no one structure to be seen, wherein
more clearly shines those harmoniacall proportions, of
which only the best times could vaunt, then in this of
<hi>Stoneheng.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Our Countreymen marvell</hi> (saith he) <hi>from whence
such huge stones were brought, considering that in all those quarters
bordering thereupon, there is hardly to be found any common stone for
building.</hi> Upon what trust <hi>Camden</hi> (his extraordinary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
otherwise considered) took this relation, I know not.
For, there is not onely common stone thereabouts, for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
uses, but stone of extraordinary proportions likewise,
even for greater works (if occasion were) then <hi>Stoneheng:</hi>
the Quarries of <hi>Hasselborough</hi> and <hi>Chilmark,</hi> both of them not
far from the borders of the plain, having of a long time fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
all the adjacent parts with common stone for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And (to come nearer the matter) it is manifest, that in
divers places about the Plain, the same kinde of Stone
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99064:31"/>
whereof this <hi>Antiquity</hi> consists may be found, especially
about <hi>Aibury</hi> in North-<hi>Wiltshire,</hi> not many miles distant from
it, where not onely are Quarries of the like stone, but also
stones of far greater dimensions then any at <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> may
be had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They wonder also</hi> (saith he) <hi>by what means they</hi> (that, is such
huge stones) <hi>were set up.</hi> What may be effected by that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall
Art,</hi> which <hi>Dee</hi> in his <hi>Mathematicall Preface</hi> to <hi>Euclyde,</hi>
cals <hi>Menadry,</hi> or <hi>Art of ordering Engines for raising weights;</hi> those
(it seems) of whom <hi>Camden</hi> speaks took little notice of,
when <hi>Archimedes</hi> during the siege of <hi>Syracuse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plut. in Marcel.</note> raised out of
the Sea, and turned in the air at pleasure, the Ships and
Gallies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> full fraught as they were with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
Mariners, and their ordinary lading: and if King
<hi>Hieron</hi> could have assigned him, a fit place to firm his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
on, he would have undertaken to remove, even the
terrestriall <hi>Globe</hi> out of the worlds <hi>center,</hi> so high, perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this <hi>Art</hi> transported him. What should I say of the
<hi>Obelisk</hi> in Ages so far past, brought from the Mountains
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and erected in <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Semiramis,</hi> one hundred
&amp; fifty foot high, and at the base twenty four foot square of
one entire stone?<note place="margin">Herod. lib. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Est in fano</hi> Latonae (saith <hi>Herodotus</hi> of his
own knowledge) <hi>delubrum ex uno factum lapide, cujus parietes
aequali celsitudine ad longitudinem quadragenum cubitorum. cujus
lacunari, pro tecto impositus est alius lapis quatuor cubitorum per oras
crassitudine. In the Temple of</hi> Latona (in <hi>Aegypt) is a Chappell
framed of one stone, whose walls being of equall height, are in length
forty cubits, covered in like manner with one sole stone four cubits
thick.</hi> Those, which made this wonder would have much
more admired, if they could have seen the <hi>Obelisk</hi> raised
in times of old by King <hi>Ramesis</hi> at <hi>Heliopolis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ptol. lib. 4. Plin. lib. 36.</note> in that part of
<hi>Aegypt</hi> anciently called <hi>Thebais,</hi> in height one hundred
twenty one Geometrical feet (which of our measure makes
one hundred thirty six feet) of one entire stone: and so
little wonder made they of raising it, that the Architect
undertook and did effect it, the Kings own son being at
the same time bound to the top thereof. Amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99064:31"/>
Augustus Caesar</hi> erected in the great Cirque at <hi>Rome,</hi> an
<hi>Obelisk</hi> of one stone, one hundred and twenty foot, nine
inches long: another also, was set up in <hi>Mars</hi> field, nine foot
higher then it, by the said Emperour. And it seems also,
neither they, nor <hi>Camdens</hi> self had ever seen that <hi>Obelisk,</hi> which
even in these our days, in the year one thousand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
eighty six, <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> caused to be erected in the
<hi>Piazza</hi> of S. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dom. Font. lib. 1.</note> one hundred and eight <hi>Roman</hi>
palms high, and at the base twelve palms square, (according
to our Assise, fourscore and one foot high, and nine foot
square) of one entire stone also: <hi>Dominico Fontana</hi> being
<hi>Architect.</hi> But, there are more strange things (as Sir <hi>Walter
Raleigh</hi> hath it) in the world, then betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Stanes.</hi>
It is want of knowledge in <hi>Arts</hi> makes such admirers, and
<hi>Art</hi> it self have so many Enemies. Had I not been thought
worthy (by him who then commanded) to have been sole
<hi>Architect</hi> thereof, I would have made some mention of the
great stones used in the work, and <hi>Portico</hi> at the West end
of S <hi>Pauls</hi> Church <hi>London,</hi> but I forbear; though in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
they were equall to most in this <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and raised
to a far greater height then any there. What manner of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
the <hi>Ancients</hi> used for raising; and what secure ways
they had, for cariage and transportation of their huge
weights, is more proper for another subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some there are</hi> (saith <hi>Camden</hi>) <hi>that think them to be no naturall
stones, hewn out of the rock, but artificially made of pure sand, and
by some glewy and unctuous matter, knit and incorporate together, like
those ancient trophies, or monuments of victory, which I have seen in</hi>
Yorkshire. As for these Monuments (for my part) I have
not seen, otherwise I would give my sense upon them, and
happily they may be found as far from being artificiall, as
those at <hi>Stoneheng. And what marvell?</hi> (saith he) <hi>read we not, I
pray you, in</hi> Pliny, <hi>that the sand or dust of</hi> Puteoli, <hi>being covered over
with water, becometh forthwith a very stone &amp;c.</hi> He might as well
have told us the Rocks in <hi>Portland</hi> are artificiall. But it's true,
this sand of <hi>Puteoli,</hi> was much used by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and it is
such a kind of earth, as is very famous for its admirable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99064:32"/>
in building, being tempered with the cement of <hi>Cuma;</hi>
For, it not onely yeelds strength to all other buildings, but
thereby also, all works made in the Sea under water, are
most firmly consolidated. Yet, doe I not find, that ever the
<hi>Ancients</hi> made any artificiall stones thereof, or that <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
hath any thing to that purpose, to him the credit given to
<hi>Pliny,</hi> and others, concerning the Earth of <hi>Puteoli,</hi> being only
due; posterity being in the first place beholding unto him
for finding out the nature of that earth, he giving us not
only the effects thereof, but the cause also from whence those
effects proceed. <hi>Hoc autem fieri hac ratione videtur, qu√≤d sub his
montibus</hi> (i.e. <hi>in regionibus</hi> Baianis,<note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 2. cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; in agris, quae sunt circa</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvium
<hi>montem) &amp; terrae ferventes sunt, &amp; fontes crebri, qui nen
essent, si non in imo haberent, aut de sulphure, aut alumine, aut bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumine
ardentes maximos ignes. Which is</hi> (saith he) <hi>by reason in
those mountains</hi> (to wit, <hi>in the regions of</hi> Baiae, <hi>and fields about
mount</hi> Vesuvius) <hi>the grounds are hot, and full of springs, which heat
could not be, but that from the bottome, are nourished mighty great
fires, arising from sulphur, alume, or brimstone there.</hi> Indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Pliny,</hi> the sand upon the side of the hill of <hi>Puteoli,</hi>
being opposed to the Sea, and continually drenched, and
drowned with the water thereof, doth (by the restringent
quality, no doubt, of the salt water) become a stone so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
and united together, that scorning all the violence
of the surging billows, it hardeneth every day more and
more.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, whosoever could find out any kind of
earth in this Island, naturally apt, to make artificiall stones
of such greatnesse as these; and, like them so obdurate
also, that hardly any tool enter them: or, that our Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
in times of old, did make use of such a cement, and
in what manner composed by them. The benefit thereof
doubtlesse, would amount so ample to this Nation, that
Records could not but render him deservedly famous to all
posterity. In the mean while, as it is most certain those
stones at <hi>Stoneheng</hi> are naturall; so, am I as clearly of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the very Quarries from whence hewn, were about <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:99064:32"/>
before mentioned: where, no small quantities of the
same kind, are even at this day to be had; vast scantlings,
not only appearing about the Town it self, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the plain and fields adjoyning, the Quarries lying bare,
numbers also numberlesse of stones, are generally seen. (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no small prejudice to the bordering inhabitants) As also,
not far from the edge of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> in the ascent from <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi>
to <hi>Whitehorse hill,</hi> the like stones are daily discovered. To
mention, more places in particular is needlesse, the Quarries
at and about <hi>Aibury</hi> (without relating to <hi>Lamborn,</hi> or what
ever other) distant but fifteen miles or thereabouts from
<hi>Stoneheng,</hi> being of themselves sufficient to clear the doubt.
These, having through long time, got the very same crusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon them, are in like manner coloured, grained, bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
weighty, and of like difficulty in working, as those at
<hi>Stoneheng.</hi> Some of which, being of a whitish colour, are
intermixt and veined here and there with red: some, of a
lightish blew, glister, as if minerall amongst them: some,
for the most part white, perplexed (as it were) with a ruddy
colour: some, dark gray and russet, differing in kinds as
those stones at <hi>Aibury</hi> do. Some of them again, of a grayish
colour, are speckled or intermixt with dark green, and
white, together with yellow amongst it, resembling
after a sort, that kind of marble which the <hi>Italians</hi> (from the
valley where the Quarries are found) call <hi>Pozzevera;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
notwithstanding, so beautifull, though naturally
much harder, and being weathered by time, as in this work;
disdain the touch even of the best tempered tool. Insomuch,
that if nothing else, the more then ordinary hardnesse of
them is such, as will in part convince any indifferent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the nature and quality of stones; those, in this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi>
are not (as <hi>Camden</hi> would have them) artificiall, but
naturall.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever, worthy admiration concerning <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in relation to the greatnesse of the work in generall,
the extraordinary proportion of the stones in particular, the
wonder the people make, from whence brought, by what
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99064:33"/>
Arts or Engines raised, and in such order placed, <hi>Camden</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers:
certainly, in his judgement he was wholly opposite
to the opinions of the aforesaid <hi>British</hi> Historians. He
would never else, with so much regret have complained,
<hi>The Authors of so notable a Monument lay buried in oblivion,</hi> had he
given any the least credit, this <hi>Antiquity</hi> had been built, either
by <hi>A. Ambrosius,</hi> or the <hi>British</hi> Nobility, or to eternize either
of their names, or actions to succeeding generations. Let

or</hi> (which is fully answered already) <hi>by what Art such huge
stones were raised to so great a height.</hi> Take with you also <hi>Dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
judgement in his <hi>Poly-olbion</hi> couched under the fiction
of old <hi>Wansdikes</hi> depraving <hi>Stoneheng. (Wansdike</hi> being a huge

have remembred, some of themselves deliver, that at <hi>Kam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulan,</hi>
or <hi>Cambula</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> such habiliments of War have
been digged up, in tillage of the ground, witnessing either
the fatall field, sometimes there fought, where <hi>Mordred</hi> was

wound: or else, the reliques of that battel betwixt the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>

those which in this point may be curious, let them but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the orders of the Circles, as they now appear, and not
passe from one to another confusedly (noting neverthelesse
where they begin) and they'll find the just number easie to
be taken.</p>
            <p>Now, though whether in order to the Place it self where
this <hi>Antiquity</hi> stands, or <hi>Persons,</hi> by whom <hi>Stoneheng</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be built, enough said, to wave the reports upon
fancy, or common Fame, formerly delivered: to the state
of <hi>Time</hi> neverthelesse, wherein the <hi>British</hi> Histories would
have it erected, because nothing by me hath yet been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
I will therefore adde, 'tis not probable such a work as
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> could be then built. For, although our <hi>Britans,</hi> in
ancient time possessed, together with the <hi>Roman</hi> civility, all
good <hi>Arts,</hi> it is evident during the reign of <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi>
(about the first coming in of the <hi>Saxons</hi> here, and towards
the later end of the fifth Century, as Historians and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologists
compute it) in the last declining of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, the <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Design,</hi> of which <hi>Architecture</hi> chief, were
utterly lost even in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, much more in <hi>Britain,</hi> being
then but a Tempest-beaten <hi>Province,</hi> and utterly abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the <hi>Romans. Britain,</hi> therefore, being over-run
with enemies, and the knowledge of <hi>Arts</hi> then lost amongst
them: none, questionlesse, can reasonably apprehend so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
a work as <hi>Stoneheng</hi> could in such times be built.</p>
            <p>That, amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Britans</hi> both, <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi>
governing here, all Sciences were utterly perished, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
manifest. For, the <hi>Goths</hi> had then invaded <hi>Italy;</hi> and
that vast Empire drooping with extreme Age, by the fatall
irruption of strange Nations, was not only torn in peeces,

               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99064:35"/>
but <hi>Barbarisme</hi> having trod learning under foot, and the
sword bearing more sway then letters, or learned men, all
Sciences were neglected; and particularly that of <hi>Building</hi>
fell into such decay, that till of late about the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
five hundred and ten, it lay swallowed up, and (as I
may so say) buried in oblivion. When one <hi>Bramante</hi> of
the Dutchy of <hi>Urbin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serl. lib. 3. </note> attaining admirable perfection in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,</hi>
restored to the world again, the true rules of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
according to those Orders, by the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> in
their most flourishing times observed. Furthermore, not
onely liberall Sciences and <hi>Architecture,</hi> but <hi>Art</hi> military also,
about the time of <hi>A. Ambrosius,</hi> was so far lost amongst
the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they were ignorant, yea, in the very rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of War. Insomuch, (as <hi>Procopius</hi> in his second Book
of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Wars relate) <hi>Barbarism</hi> had bereft them of the
skill, even in what manner to sound a retreat.</p>
            <p>With us here also, the <hi>Saxons</hi> domineer'd over all, and
<hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> with the <hi>Britans</hi> had enough to do, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
the recovery of their lost Countrey from a mighty
prevailing Enemy, that in few years afterwards (maugre
all the ways which force or policy could invent) conquered
the whole Nation. Among other calamities attending that
miserable Age, <hi>Camden</hi> (from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi>) direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Britannia <hi>omni patrocinio juvenilis vigoris viduata, omni
Artium exercitio exinanita, conterminarum gentium inhiationi diu
obnoxia fuit. When the Tyrants</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Romans) had left none

but such as wholly gave themselves to belly-cheer;</hi> Britain, <hi>destitute
of all protection, by her vigorous young men, bereaved of</hi> all exercise,
and practice of good Arts, <hi>became exposed for a long time to the
greedy, and gaping jaws of Nations confining upon her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you have it from an Author, more ancient then
<hi>G. Monmouth</hi> a little, though both lived in one age, the times
about <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> government, whether before, during his
reign, or after, were so full of miseries, that he complains,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99064:36"/>
none then employed, or exercised in any whatever works
belonging to <hi>Art.</hi> They had somthing else (as appears by
divers Writers) to think upon, all their abilities being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
to defend their Countrey from forein servitude,
their Cities and Towns from ruine, and destruction, and
their habitations from rage of cruell and insolent enemies,
robbing,<note place="margin">Gildas.</note> spoiling, burning, wasting, all before them: to
which, plague, perstilence, and famine being joyned, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
part of the <hi>Island,</hi> even to the Western <hi>Ocean</hi> was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>near
totally consumed.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Countrey was so oppress'd, what with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
hostile miseries, what with intestine tumults and
troubles: that, had they not lost the <hi>practice of all Arts</hi> (as
the former Historian saith they had) so far were they from
erecting any work of this kind, that they were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to abandon their Towns, and houses, built in times
foregoing by their Auncestors, and betake themselves to
mountains, caves, and woods for shelter. Now, if the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
of those times hung over the <hi>Britans</hi> heads, in so
generall manner, that not one amongst them had leisure to
put pen to paper, (as from <hi>Leyland</hi> before remembred)
much lesse able were they, without all peradventure, to
undertake so great a work as <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> wherein, as all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
men must grant, numbers of men employed, and
many years taken up, before brought to its absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>But, nothing can better expresse the ignorance of that
Age, then the barbarous manner of inscription upon the
Tomb of the <hi>British Hector</hi> King <hi>Arthur,</hi> nephew to <hi>A. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius,</hi>
found long since in the Churchyard of the Abbey
at <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> the letters whereof, being exactly represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to our view by <hi>Camden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cam. fo. 228.</note> do, as by demonstration, fully
discover to us the Barbarism of those times. As, barbarous
in those characters, so were they ignorant in, and had lost
the use of all other <hi>Arts. Nor exercise nor practice of good Arts,
was then amongst them,</hi> saith the Historiographer of <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
And well he might so deliver himself, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Matthew Westminster</hi> tels us, <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> repaired <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
which the rage of <hi>Saxons,</hi> enemies to <hi>Christian Religion,</hi>
spoiled. For, besides, the vast difference betwixt such works
as <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> where <hi>Art</hi> overmasters the common skill of
man, and making up the decaies of ruinated buildings, is
apprehensive even to the meanest capacities: <hi>Gildas</hi> and
<hi>Bede</hi> (whose Antiquity and learning the greater it is, the
more is their authority acceptable) affirm, the <hi>Britans</hi> in
those times knew not in what manner to bring up bare wals
of stone. When, the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion sent to aid the <hi>Britans</hi>
by <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, under the conduct of <hi>Gallio</hi> of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi>
was remanded hence, for defence of <hi>France;</hi> before
departing, they exhorted the <hi>Britans</hi> to make a wall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart
the <hi>Island,</hi> to secure themselves from the <hi>Barbarians,
Picts,</hi> and <hi>Scots:</hi> which wall, <hi>Bede</hi> tels us, <hi>was made not so
much with stone, as turffes, considering they had no workmen to bring
up such works of stone; and so,</hi> (saith the venerable Historian)
<hi>they did set up one, good for nothing. 'Twas made by the rude, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
common multitude, not so much of stone, as turffes</hi> (saith
<hi>Gildas</hi> also) <hi>none being found able to give direction for building
works of stone.</hi> This was about thirty six years preceding
<hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> government. In which time, the <hi>Romans</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
<hi>Britain, Vortigern</hi> usurped; call'd in the <hi>Saxons</hi> to his
aid; was deposed by his Nobility; and <hi>Vortimer</hi> his son
set up. Whom <hi>Rowena</hi> having made away; <hi>Vortigern</hi> was
re-enthronis'd. Him <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> invades, and having burnt
him, together with <hi>Rowena</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> assumes the Crown as
his; holding continuall war with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> untill poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Pascentius</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>It being thus, that nothing but universall confusion, and
destructive broyls of war, appeared then in all parts; more
ancient, and far more propitious times, must be sought out
for designing a structure, so exquisite in the composure as
this: even such a flourishing Age, as when <hi>Architecture</hi> in
rare perfection, and such <hi>People</hi> lookt upon, as by continuall
successe, attaining unto the sole power over <hi>Arts,</hi> as well as
<hi>Empires,</hi> commanded all. I say, such <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99064:37"/>
those things, which accord not with the course of
time, which by a genetall consent of Authors agree not;
which by the approved customes of ancient Ages, and votes
of learned men, are not received and allowed, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no ways probable; I easily admit not of.</p>
            <p>Another fiction there is concerning <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> not to be
past over; and though the cause upon which it's grounded,
be far more ancient then the government of <hi>Ambrosius,</hi> or
aforesaid slaughter of the <hi>Britans:</hi> neverthelesse, in respect
it is a new conceit, not thirty years being past since hatch't, I
suppose this the most proper place to discourse thereof, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

followers.</p>
            <p>The Author thereof is <hi>Anonymus,</hi> unlesse known in being

battell betwixt her, and <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> fought upon
a Plain. Secondly, in respect the <hi>Britans</hi> buried her magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently.
For confirming this, he tels us, <hi>Had the pretious vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of the</hi> Cornelian <hi>Annals, and</hi> Dio Cassius, <hi>and</hi> John Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philine
<hi>been within the spheare of</hi> Geffrey Monmouths <hi>studies,
not</hi> Aurelius Ambrosius, <hi>nor those four hundred and sixty Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of</hi> Britain, <hi>murthered in</hi> Vortigerns <hi>reign, should have carried
away with him the fame of this materiall wonder, but magnanimous</hi>
Boadicia. It seems, he would not be behinde-hand with
<hi>Monmouth;</hi> for, as the one finding no story more famous
then of <hi>A. Ambrosius</hi> and the slaughtered <hi>Britans,</hi> fathered
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> upon them: so, to make the inventive faculty, as
apparently predominant in himself; this other, respecting
<hi>Boadicia's</hi> heroicall actions, would as willingly make the
world beleeve this <hi>Antiquity</hi> her Monument.</p>
            <p>His principall argument I delivered before; to wit, the
battell betwixt Her and the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherein <hi>Boadicia</hi> utterly
overthrown too, being fought upon a Plain. Was there in
old time (did he think) no Plain in <hi>Britain</hi> to fight a battell
on but <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain? How came <hi>Boadicia</hi> and her Army
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99064:37"/>
thither? I find indeed, <hi>Boadicia</hi> leading one hundred and
twenty thousand fighting men out of the <hi>Iconian</hi> Countries,
and like a terrible tempest, falling upon <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> that
famous <hi>Roman</hi> Colony of old, (where the first fury of the
War was felt) she surprised it and razed it to the ground;
<hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> then in <hi>Anglesey:</hi> Intercepting <hi>Petilius Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis,</hi>
who advanced with the ninth legion to relieve that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
she cut all his Infantry in peeces: Putting to the
sword all those, which imbecillity of sex, tediousnesse of age,
or pleasure of the place detained from following <hi>Suetonius</hi>
in his march from <hi>London:</hi> And taking <hi>Verulamium,</hi> sackt
and burnt it down to ashes. But, how she marcht from
thence to <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain is neither apparent nor probable;
not the least inkling being left in the world, what hostile
acts she committed, which way she moved, or what done
by her, after the ruine of <hi>Verulam,</hi> till utterly overthrown.</p>
            <p>Can it be imagined, she that destroyed so great a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
together with a free-borough of the <hi>Romans,</hi> slaid se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
or eighty thousand persons in such horrid manner as
scarce credible; reserving not one Prisoner alive, but killing,
hanging, crucifying, and burning whatsoever <hi>Romane,</hi> or
to that party enclined: that was yet victorious, and her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
encreasing daily; can it be imagined, I say, she marcht
to <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain with so huge an Army invisibly? or stole
from <hi>Verulam</hi> thither by night, lest notice should be taken
of her proceedings? <hi>Anonymus</hi> self cannot think so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
of his <hi>Boadicia,</hi> yet certainly after such manner she
went, if ever went thither at all: Otherwise, <hi>Boadicia</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in the height of glory, and bearing down all before
her till rancountred by <hi>Suetonius.</hi> Those faithfull Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Dion,</hi> (both so sedulous in delivering her
Fame to posterity) would never have omitted so notable a
march, through such a large tract of enemies Countrey, as
of necessity she was to make from <hi>Verulam,</hi> to <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain;
but would have prosecuted her War, by recording the
spoyls, rapines, burnings, and devastations made therein;
as particularly, as from the first fomenting the rebellion, till
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99064:38"/>
her advance to <hi>Verulam,</hi> they have done. Upon which Town,
and the aforementioned places only, the aforesaid Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
directly tell us the whole burden of the War fell.<note place="margin">Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</note>

ground two Towns of the</hi> Romans, <hi>and in them made that infinite
slaughter, I have mentioned before, of fourscore thousand persons.</hi> At
<hi>Verulam</hi> then, it fully appears, the course of her Victories
stopt, the inhumane butchery of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
ended with the massacre in that Town; which
could not possibly have hapned, if with such a firm reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to extirpate the <hi>Roman</hi> name in <hi>Britain,</hi> and such a
numerous Army to effect it, she had gone on victoriously
unfought with, so far as where this <hi>Antiquity</hi> stands. And
therefore the Plain of <hi>Salisbury</hi> could not be the place of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
as <hi>Anonymus</hi> would fain enforce it. Who having so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and with so good advice, discoursed the motions, and
actions of this rebellion, with all the circumstances thereof,
from the first rise, till she destroyed <hi>Verulam,</hi> should either
have found some warrantable authority for <hi>Boadicia's</hi> so
great an undertaking afterwards, else never engaged her so
far within the <hi>Roman</hi> Province; otherwise, some may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
he framed it, only out of ambition for a meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
rather, then stated it, from a reall endeavour, to make
discovery for what cause <hi>Stoneheng</hi> at first erected.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> was too well skilled in
the discipline of war, to make the seat thereof in a Countrey
so absolutely <hi>Roman,</hi> as betwixt the <hi>British</hi> Ocean and the
River <hi>Thames.</hi> He had it's true (being return'd from <hi>Anglesey</hi>)
abandoned <hi>London,</hi> no colony. But upon what result? find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his accesse of strength disproportionable to the War in
hand,<note place="margin">Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</note> and therefore <hi>determined with the losse of one Town to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the rest whole,</hi> (whether <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Camalodunum</hi> is not to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99064:38"/>
the purpose) and, by attending the motions of the enemy,
wait all fair occasions to give <hi>Boadicia</hi> battell,<note place="margin">Dion. Cass. lib. 62.</note>

what forces, the exigency of so important affairs would

            <p>Which way <hi>Suetonius</hi> marched from <hi>London</hi> is altogether
omitted, yet if lawfull to conjecture, why not? to draw
off the Forces of <hi>Catus Decianus</hi> Procurator, (not long before
fled into <hi>Gaul,</hi> for fear of this War) together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of <hi>Petilius Cerealis</hi> troops;<note place="margin">Ner. Caes. fo. 105.</note> quartered, as <hi>Anonymus</hi>
confesseth, in those very camps yet appearing about <hi>Gilds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi>
and <hi>Daintry</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> then, confining the
<hi>Icenian</hi> Dominion to the Westward. Which Troops there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
lay doubtlesse, in very great danger if not timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
especially in case <hi>Boadicia</hi> should conduct her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that way; as, ere long afterwards she did so far as <hi>Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam;</hi>
this course being taken by her, not improbably, in
pursuit of <hi>Suetonius.</hi> Neither was it very dangerous for the
<hi>Roman</hi> Generall to lead his Forces that way, the Enemies

he marched up to them or no, concluded it is, he made

Legion</hi> in the borders of the <hi>Silures,</hi> (now <hi>Herefordshire,

it brought up to his Rendezvouz, his commands being
slighted,<note place="margin">Ner. Caes. fo. 154.</note> that strength failed him. <hi>The way which</hi> Suetonius
<hi>took, after his departure, was in mine opinion</hi> (saith <hi>Anonymus</hi>) <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
Severn, <hi>where</hi> Poenius Posthumus <hi>encamped with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

<hi>English</hi> Poet finds it. Whereby it appears, <hi>Suetonius</hi> retreat
was not Westward to <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plains, but Northerly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that <hi>second Legion.</hi> In this retreat, I may not omit, <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus</hi>
conducts him over the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London;</hi>

engaging <hi>Boadicia,</hi> as <hi>Anonymus</hi> saith he did: then was
<hi>Suetonius</hi> march <hi>far away</hi> indeed from <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain. The

course of that River winding, as we all know, through
<hi>Barkshire</hi> out of <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> where <hi>Tame</hi> from the County

this course <hi>still</hi> by the Rivers side, <hi>Suetonius</hi> marcht

he will or no, bring him up close to <hi>Gildsbrough</hi> and
<hi>Daintry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ner. Caes. fo. 166.</note> as aforesaid; and thereby (for it is admitted <hi>Cerealis</hi>
horse-troops were at the fight) reconciling all opinions,
upon his direct way towards the <hi>second Legion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How far on, neverthelesse, toward <hi>Poenius Posthumus</hi> Camp
<hi>Suetonius</hi> advanced is uncertain; but, that the battell might
be fought in some Plain about <hi>Verulam,</hi> or upon that rode,
is not altogether improbable (Especially considering part
of <hi>Suetonius</hi> strength consisted of <hi>Londoners,</hi> who, as <hi>Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries</hi>
followed him in this War, and would not stay behind)
For, the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall when marshalling his Army for
fight, had with him (saith <hi>Tacitus) the aids of the places adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
What places were these? the last <hi>place</hi> named by him
was <hi>Verulam,</hi> the next place before it <hi>London;</hi> and, if the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
intends either of these two, by the <hi>places adjoyning</hi> to the
field, where the battell fought: then may <hi>Anonymus</hi> prove
the desarts in <hi>Africa,</hi> as soon as the Plains of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> to
be the place of Battell.</p>

               <hi>Roman</hi> Army consisting of scarce ten thousand armed men.
In what part of <hi>Britain</hi> soever this Plain lay, it was, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
of no great extent, being hardly able to contain the
vast multitudes of <hi>Boadicia's</hi> Army; computed two hundred
and thirty thousand fighting men, by <hi>Dion,</hi> and therefore
could not possibly be <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain. For, the <hi>Britans</hi> placing
their carts and wagons <hi>supra extremum ambitum campi, in the
utmost borders of the field,</hi> had so environed their Army there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
that upon the rout given, they could hardly flee away,
<hi>quia circumjecta vehicula sepserant abitus, by reason the carts</hi> (saith
<hi>Tacitus) hedged in the passages on every side,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ner. Caes. fo. 179.</note> and (to use <hi>Anonymus</hi>
own words) <hi>were like a wall against evasion.</hi> Now, if the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
had so surrounded the utmost borders of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain,
and in such manner barricado'd up all the passages thereof,
their numbers should rather have been millions then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
as every man knowing those Plains must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse.
Besides, <hi>Anonymus</hi> self tels us,<note place="margin">Ner. Caes. fo. 178.</note> 
               <hi>after the</hi> Britans <hi>in the head of
their battel began to shrink and turn, that alone was a blow to all behind,
who being many score of thousands, remain'd untoucht, during the
fight, because they could never come up to handy-strokes, for</hi> want of
room <hi>in the narrowings of the field.</hi> He told us even now there
was scope enough.<note place="margin">Ner. Caes. fo. 161.</note> 
               <hi>Whereabout in these parts of</hi> Britain, (saith
he) <hi>that very place was, unlesse it were upon</hi> Salisbury <hi>Plain, where
there is a black heath, and</hi> scope enough, <hi>is not for me to imagine.</hi>
Now, on the contrary, when coming to the issue, he tels
us the Plain was narrow, and they <hi>wanted room.</hi> Did the
<hi>Britans</hi> want room in the field, and were on <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain?
Surely, in the heat of his describing the Battel <hi>Anonymus</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
his own invention; the fury of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in beating
down the <hi>British</hi> squadrons, therewith dasht the main force
of his conceit to peeces. Suspicious and jealous men had
need of good memories. Upon the aforesaid situation he
might rather have observed, the great experience of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Generall</hi> in martiall affairs, then from thence suggested,
the <hi>Britans</hi> in point of honour erected <hi>Stoneheng</hi> to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of <hi>Boadicia, Suetonius</hi> not onely choosing to make
good a straight enclosed behinde with a wood, for secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99064:42"/>
his own small Troops, but such a straight also, where
the Plain or field before it, was not of sufficient extent for
<hi>Boadicia</hi> to marshall her great Army in. Furthermore, <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus</hi>
determining (it seems) to parcell out his ground pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the numbers, undertakes to give posterity an
exact survey of this Plain, telling us, it <hi>was a Plain of five or six
miles over:</hi> This makes it more apparent 'twas not <hi>Salisbury</hi>
Plain, which far and wide so expatiates it self through
the middle of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> that it is not onely <hi>five or six miles,</hi>
but (as I may say) five times six miles over. This famous
battell then, being struck upon a Plain hardly capable of
<hi>Boadicia's</hi> Army, was not fought upon <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain; but,
on some other, which <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> found best for his
own advantage, and therefore <hi>Stoneheng</hi> (as <hi>Anonymus</hi>
would fain have it) could not be the Sepulchre of <hi>Boadicia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Boadicia's</hi> magnificent obsequies; a mighty
Prince may be buried with great solemnity, yet no materiall
Monument dedicated to his memory. Examples of this
kinde are so frequent, there needs no mention of them.
<hi>Humaverunt magnific√®,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dion. Cass. lib. 62.</note> (they are <hi>Dions</hi> words) the <hi>Britans</hi> laid
her into the earth magnificently, with as much pomp, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and honour, attending her to the grave, as their barbarous
customs for their glorious Chieftain would admit; but, that
they raised any Monument, or erected whatsoever kinde
of Sepulchre for her, much lesse so notable a structure as
<hi>Stoneheng,</hi> he no where tels us. Which had the <hi>Britans</hi> done,
the Historian could not avoid, taking more knowledge
thereof, then of her bare enterment, and would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have recorded it. Again, grant <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain the place
of Battell, yet, <hi>Dion</hi> saith not, they buried her magnificently
where the battell fought, only, <hi>Humaverunt magnific√®:</hi> adding
withall, those, that escaped the field, prepared to re-enforce
themselves for a new triall, in the mean while a disease sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
on <hi>Bunduica,</hi> she died. Now then, after so terrible an
overthrow, wherein 'tis reported she lost fourscore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Britans; Boadicia,</hi> in all likelihood, endevoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the <hi>Icenian</hi> Countreys, her principall strength; having
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99064:42"/>
in her speech before the Battell insinuated the fenny parts
thereof, as a refuge if the worst should happen. In what
Countreys else could they recruit? where falling sick she
died, (whether by violent or naturall death is not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
and as ever observed among all Nations, was, no
doubt, buried in her own territories, among the graves of
her renowned Ancestors.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Britans,</hi> untill <hi>Iulius Agricolas</hi> time,<note place="margin">Ner. Caes. fo. 117.</note> had learned
nothing (as <hi>Anonymus</hi> takes speciall notice) but <hi>to fight, and
were no handicraftsmen,</hi> whereby they might be capable of
erecting such works as <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> being already fully proved
from <hi>Tacitus,</hi> I will adde, the ringleaders or heads of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
against Empires and Commonwealths were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
(in many Countreys at this day) not only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
punishable by the Laws with death, but their whole
families and kindred though guiltlesse, suffered in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
their very houses also, being razed to the ground, left
any knowledge of such pernicious undertakings should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
visible to posterity: and a capitall crime it was, in
whomsoever that restor'd them. How comes it then, <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicia</hi>
the principall promoter,<note place="margin">Sueton. in Ner.</note> and Head of an insurrection
so fatall, as accounted by <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus,</hi> among the
infortunate losses of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,<note place="margin">Dion. Cas. lib. 62.</note> and the more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
by a womans conduct, should be permitted by the
conquering <hi>Romans,</hi> a monument to eternize her fame to
succeeding Ages? <hi>Boadicia,</hi> that ript up the bellies of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Legionaries, and cutting out their bowels impal'd
their bodies upon burning stakes; that hanged up the most
noble and honourable <hi>Roman Dames</hi> naked, and slicing off
their paps, sowed them to their mouths, as in act of eating
them; that in scalding water boiled the <hi>Roman</hi> infants, and
young children to death; their Parents, Husbands, and
Commanders unable to relieve them, but enforced to give
way, and happy in so saving themselves from the cruell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanities
of the <hi>Conqueresse. We fought for to live,</hi> saith <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
Yet, when ere long afterwards, victoriously recovering
<hi>Britain</hi> to <hi>Caesar,</hi> by so memorable a battell as compared to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99064:43"/>
their victories of old, should the <hi>Romans</hi> suffer the enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Britans</hi> to erect a Trophy to her memory, whose pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was absolutely to root out all that was <hi>Roman</hi> here?
what greater infamy to the <hi>Roman</hi> name, except the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it? They, who rased and broke in peeces whatever
titles and inscriptions, bearing the names of their <hi>Caesars;</hi>
pulled down and demolished the royall <hi>Ensigns, Trophies,
Statues, Temples,</hi> or whatever else sacred, to their own Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
when actively administring to the prejudice of the
<hi>Romane</hi> State; would they permit any publick monuments
be erected to the memory of a conquered Prince, of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
so barbarously cruell as <hi>Boadicia?</hi> That she lives in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
they could not prevent; so live their worst of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
Moreover, publick Monuments were in all ages set
up in honour of the Vanquishers, not vanquished; respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
which, <hi>Anonymus</hi> should also, either have made <hi>Boadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>
Victresse, or never supposed <hi>Stoneheng</hi> her Sepulchre.</p>
            <p>The time assigned by <hi>Anonymus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ner. Caes. fo. 182.</note> for erecting these <hi>orderly
irregular, and formlesse uniform heaps of massive marble,</hi> (as he cals
them) <hi>to the everlasting remembrance of Boadicia,</hi> is much above
fifteen hundred years since: <hi>Petronius Turpilianus</hi> succeeding
<hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> in the Leivtenancy of <hi>Britain;</hi> who by his
idle and lazy life, making the world beleeve there was
peace here: <hi>Anonymus</hi> will have it a proper time, for permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>such an office to the Britans,</hi> in <hi>Boadicia's</hi> honour. Times
of peace, 'tis confest, when <hi>Arts</hi> flourish under nobly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Governours, are chiefly proper for erecting magnificent
buildings. The Government under <hi>Petronius</hi> was guilty of
none of these. As for the State of <hi>Britain</hi> in generall, <hi>Tacitus</hi>
in the life of <hi>Agricola</hi> tels us, <hi>Petronius</hi> had composed
the former troubles; but in what sort, the fourteenth book
of his <hi>Annals</hi> declares; <hi>non irritato hoste, neque lacessitus,
neither the Enemy, incensed him; nor he, provoked the Enemy:</hi>
otherwise <hi>Petronius</hi> durst not do. And, if peace setled, why
doth the Historian call them Enemies? Concerning his
own person in particular, <hi>Petronius</hi> gave himself over to an
unprofitable life, disguising it under the honourable name
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99064:43"/>
of peace, <hi>Honestum pacis nomen segni otio imposuit,</hi> saith <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
And, the <hi>Britans</hi> (as said before) were not then civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized,
nor friends to such Arts as either nourish or are
nourished by peace, therefore such a work of wonder as
this <hi>Antiquity</hi> famed, not to be expected from them. For, as
through the malignities of the Age, wherein <hi>Aurelius Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius</hi>
lived, the <hi>Britans</hi> had utterly lost the practice of all
those <hi>Sciences,</hi> in times foregoing, learned by their Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
from the <hi>Romans:</hi> so, through the neglect of civil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
in the preceding <hi>Roman</hi> Governours, in this Leivtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Petronius,</hi> the <hi>Britans</hi> had not attained the knowledge
of any those <hi>Arts,</hi> not many years afterwards, taught their
posterity by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Whose imperiall Eagles took not
wing in <hi>Britain</hi> with such lofty speed, as over other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys;<note place="margin">Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</note>
               <hi>The</hi> Britans <hi>being a fierce Nation, slowly giving ear to any
peace,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> had work enough in subduing them. <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi> rather shewed the Island to his successors, then left
them possession of it: <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> held it policy
to neglect it: <hi>Caligula</hi> intending to invade <hi>Britain,</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by his Wars in <hi>Germany: Claudius</hi> first prosecuting
the conquest with effect, established the colony at <hi>Camalodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
and his Leivtenants <hi>Aulus Plautius, Flavius Vespasianus.
Ostorius Scapula,</hi> and <hi>Didius Gallus</hi> by little and little, after
much contest, and various successe, subdued certain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
and reducing the nearest part of the Island to the form
of a Province, built also, or rather cast up some few forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
further within the land: <hi>Nero's</hi> Generals had
much to do in keeping, what their predecessors gained;
<hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> (under him) struck that fortunate battell
with <hi>Boadicia,</hi> else the <hi>Romans</hi> beaten out of all. So that, in
the time of <hi>Petronius,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> having obtained no such
assured dominion over the <hi>Britans,</hi> as might make them,
themselves confident to undertake great and stately build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
here, for their own either publick, or private accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations;
(the ruine of <hi>Camalodunum</hi> being too fresh in
memory) occasion was not offered, nor the time yet come,
to let the <hi>Britans</hi> know by what <hi>Arts</hi> all civill Nations of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99064:44"/>
the world, did erect their excessive, rather then not magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
structures, for eternizing their names to succeeding
generations. And therefore, the Leivtenancy of <hi>Petronius
Turpilianus,</hi> not proper for building this <hi>stony marvell,</hi> as <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus</hi>
suspects. For, beside what's delivered, whensoever
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> built, the preparation only of materials for the
work, and bringing them to the place, what <hi>Engines</hi> or
<hi>Arts</hi> soever used, necessarily, spent more time, then <hi>Petronius</hi>
consumed in the whole continuance of his government
here. What tumults succeeded him, let others declare.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <hi>if those</hi> times of <hi>Petronius</hi> would not, <hi>yet</hi>
(saith <hi>Anonymus) other ensuing seasons might permit such an office to
the</hi> Britans, <hi>her name for ever glorious among them.</hi> The hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnesse
of her Rebellion, horridnesse of her cruelties, and
inveterate hatred <hi>Boadicia</hi> bore to the <hi>Romans,</hi> whereby <hi>her
name for ever infamous among them,</hi> clearly manifest all other
<hi>ensuing seasons,</hi> equally improper for those ancient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of this Island, to erect <hi>Stoneheng.</hi> If the <hi>Britans,</hi> once
attaining the <hi>Romane</hi> manner of <hi>Architecture,</hi> in any succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
times had expelled the <hi>Romans,</hi> and been triumphant;
some probable reason, at least, <hi>Anonymus</hi> might have alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
towards advancing his opinion. But <hi>Boadicia</hi> and her
<hi>Complices</hi> overthrown, the <hi>Roman</hi> Power in this Island
encreasing dayly, and the liberty of the <hi>Britans</hi> as fast decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
no following <hi>season</hi> could be opportunely favourable,
for undertaking such a work by them; the erecting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yea the sole endeavouring to commemorate by such
publick means, so mortall an enemy to the <hi>Romans</hi> as <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicia:</hi>
nothing but the dearest lives of the bold attempters,
could, certainly, expiate. The <hi>Temple</hi> upon Mount <hi>Coelius</hi> at
<hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Suet. in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spas.</note> begun to <hi>Claudius</hi> sacred memory by <hi>Agrippina,</hi> was
destroyed to the very foundations by <hi>Nero.</hi> If then, insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Agrippina</hi> might not erect a memorable structure, to
the glory of her deceased <hi>Caesar;</hi> whom the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all solemne manner deified: What oppressed
<hi>Britan,</hi> durst undertake the raising a publick Monument to
the honour of vanquished <hi>Boadicia,</hi> whom the State (in all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99064:44"/>
reason) for ever declared enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire?
And though, after a long succession of years, the <hi>Romans</hi>
abandoned this Island, yet, when departed, the <hi>Britans</hi> were
left in such deplorable condition, (at large declared before)
that, albeit <hi>her name</hi> never so glorious among them, they had
much more to do, in saving their own miserable lives from
plague, famine, and the sword, then any opportunity, or
ability to erect whatever Monument to the glory of <hi>Boadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi>
But, of this enough; the invalidity of <hi>Anonymus</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
especially respected. The discovering the originall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of an <hi>Antiquity</hi> so famous, being not to be enforced by
jealous suspicions, raised upon bare and groundlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIS</hi> Antiquity (<hi>call'd by</hi> Henry Huntingdon, The second:
<hi>by</hi> Poly-olbion
<q>‚ÄîFirst wonder of the land)</q>
because the <hi>Architraves</hi> are set upon the heads of the upright
stones, and hang (as it were) in the air, is generally
known by the name of <hi>Stone-heng.</hi> It is sited upon the Plain
in the County of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> not far from <hi>Ambres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
(the foundations of whose ancient buildings, frequently
digged up, render it to have been in times past a <hi>Town</hi> of no
small fame) six miles at least from new <hi>Salisbury</hi> northwards.</p>
            <p>The whole work, in generall, being of a circular form, is
one hundred and ten foot diameter, double winged about
without a roof, anciently environed with a deep Trench, still
appearing about thirty foot broad. So that, betwixt it, and
the work it self, a large and void space of ground being left,
it had, from the Plain, three open entrances, the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
thereof lying North-east. At each of which, was
raised, on the outside of the Trench aforesaid, two huge
stones gate-wise, parallel whereunto, on the inside two
others of lesse proportion. The inner part of the work, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of an <hi>Exagonall</hi> figure, was raised, by due symmetry,
upon the bases of four equilaterall triangles, (which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the whole structure) this inner part likewise was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99064:45"/>
double, having, within it also, another <hi>Exagon</hi> raised, and
all that part within the Trench sited upon a commanding
ground, eminent, and higher by much, then any of the
Plain lying without, and, in the midst thereof, upon a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of hard chalk, the work it self was placed. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
from what part soever they came unto it, they rose
by an easie ascending hill.</p>
            <p>Which, that it may be the more clearly demonstrated,
(being by me, with no little pains, and charge measured,
and the foundations thereof diligently searched) I have
reduced into <hi>Design,</hi> not onely as the ruine thereof now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
but as (in my judgement) it was in its pristine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
And that the groundplot, with the uprights, and
profyle of the whole work may the more distinctly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
I have purposely countersigned each <hi>Design</hi> of
them with <hi>Numbers,</hi> and the particular parts thereof with

not written, or if written, utterly lost. Likewise, as
for what use set up, not yet known; so, by whom also foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

                  <p>You cannot but remember, in what manner the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

they were first instructed by them, in severall <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>

                  <p>It rests now, to endeavor the discovering by whom
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> built; in what time, and, for what use anciently
erected. But, it is not expected (I hope) any absolute reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
should be given by me, in so doubtfull a matter, for,
<hi>as it hath been always lawfull for every man in such like matters</hi> (saith

thought:</hi> So pardon me, if I take upon me, what others

any work conformable to this, in point of <hi>Order.</hi> (as the

                  <p>Howsoever, considering what magnificence the <hi>Romans</hi>
in prosperous times anciently used in all works, both
publick, and private: their knowledge and experience in
all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences:</hi> their powerfull means for effecting
great works: together with their <hi>Order</hi> in building, and
manner of workmanship accustomed amongst them:
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> in my judgement was a work, built by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and they the sole <hi>Founders</hi> thereof. For, if look upon

notice of their power and ways by which they effected
such goodly structures, their means were not ordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the common custome of other <hi>People;</hi> and why?
because, besides particular <hi>Artisans</hi> practised in severall
<hi>Arts,</hi> they employed in those their works whole bodies of
their own <hi>Armies,</hi> and whatever Nations subdued by them.
<hi>The</hi> Romans <hi>were wont to exercise therein</hi> (saith <hi>Camden</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Camden fo. 64.</note>) <hi>their
Souldiers, and the common multitude, upon great policy doing the
same, left being idle they should grow factious, and affect alteration in
the State. The</hi> Britans <hi>complained</hi> (saith <hi>Tacitus</hi> likewise) <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora
&amp; manus contrivisse, that their bodies and hands were worn out,
and consumed by the</hi> Romans, <hi>in bringing to effect their great
and admired undertakings:</hi> in that kind employing their slaves
and prisoners also, as holding it, rather then by violent
deaths to cut them off; more profitable for the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi>
more exemplary for others, and far greater punishment for
their Prisoners, to enjoyn them continuall labour.</p>
                  <p>If observe <hi>their Order</hi> in building; the only <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,</hi>
which <hi>Italy</hi> may truly glory in the invention of, is
the <hi>Tuscane Order,</hi> so called, because first found out by the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scans,</hi>
that in a more then ordinary manner they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence

Order,</hi> a plain, grave, and humble manner of <hi>Building,</hi> very
solid and strong <hi>Stoneheng</hi> principally consists. So that, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving

the <hi>Order</hi> whereof <hi>Stoneheng</hi> built, there being no
such Elements known in this <hi>Island</hi> as distinct <hi>Orders</hi> of
<hi>Architecture,</hi> untill the <hi>Romans</hi> introduced them, the very
work it self, of so great <hi>Antiquity,</hi> declares the <hi>Romans Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
thereof. Who, that hath right judgement in <hi>Architecture,</hi>
knows not the difference, and by the manner of their works
how to distinguish <hi>Aegyptian, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> structures of
old, also <hi>Italian, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> buildings in these modern
times? Is not our Shipping by the mould thereof, known
throughout the world <hi>English</hi> built? Who did not by the
very <hi>Order</hi> of the work, assure himself, the body of the
Church of S. <hi>Paul London,</hi> from its Tower to the West end
anciently built by the <hi>Saxons:</hi> as the Quire thereof, from the
said Tower to the East end by the <hi>Normans,</hi> it being <hi>Gothick</hi>
work? yet that there might be a <hi>Roman Temple</hi> in old time
standing in that place, I will not deny, the numbers of Oxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
digged up and anciently sacrificed there, setting all
other reasons aside, so probably manifesting the same. And
in all likelihood, the <hi>Romans</hi> for so notable a structure as
<hi>Stoneheng,</hi> made choice of the <hi>Tuscane</hi> rather then any other
<hi>Order,</hi> not only as best agreeing with the rude, plain, simple
nature of those they intended to instruct, and use for which
erected; but also, because presuming to challenge a certain
kind of propriety therein, they might take occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
to magnifie to those then living the virtue of their <hi>Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors</hi>
for so noble an invention, and make themselves the
more renowned to posterity, for erecting thereof, so well
ordred a building.</p>
                  <p>Besides, the <hi>Order</hi> is not only <hi>Roman,</hi> but the <hi>Scheam</hi> also
(consisting of four equilaterall triangles, inscribed within
the circumference of a Circle) by which this work <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heng</hi>
formed,<note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 5.</note> was an <hi>Architectonicall Scheam</hi> used by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
Whereof, I shall have more occasion to speak, when
I come to set down, for what use this <hi>Antiquity</hi> at first
erected.</p>
                  <p>Again, the <hi>Portico</hi> at <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> is made double, as in stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of great magnificence the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> used: so at
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99064:65"/>
the foot of the <hi>Capitol</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>Iove the Thunderer,</hi> built
by <hi>Augustus Caesar;</hi> so the <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> royally adorned
with one hundred and twenty vast columnes of rich <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
marble, by the <hi>Emperour Adrian.</hi> But, some may alledge,
the <hi>Romans</hi> made the Pillars of their double <hi>Portico's,</hi> of one
and the same symmetry, or very little different, which in
this <hi>Antiquity</hi> otherwise appearing, cannot be a <hi>Roman</hi> work.
To as much purpose it may be alledged the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Diana</hi>
at <hi>Magnesia,</hi> was no <hi>Greek</hi> work, because the Pillars of the
inner <hi>Portico</hi> were wholly left out. Yet it's true, the <hi>Romans</hi>
usually made them as is objected, and the reason was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the weight the inner Pillars carried: now, in this
work, no roof being to be sustained, nor any manner of
weight born up, though the judgement of the <hi>Architect,</hi>
thereby to save labour and expence, ordered the stones ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>Portico</hi> within, of a far lesse proportion then those
of the outward circle, it retains neverthelesse the proper
<hi>Aspect</hi> (principally aim'd at by the ancient <hi>Architects)</hi> in use
amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> and consequently for ought alledged
to the contrary by them built.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Antiquity,</hi> there is a <hi>Portico</hi> also (as I may rightly
term it) within the <hi>Cell,</hi> or greater <hi>Hexagon,</hi> reduced like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
into the same figure. Now, that the <hi>Romans</hi> used to
make <hi>Portico's</hi> on the inside of their buildings, as well sacred
as secular, by the ruines of their <hi>Basilicaes</hi> or Courts of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature;</hi>
by that <hi>Temple</hi> without a roof anciently dedicated
to <hi>Iove</hi> in Mount <hi>Quirinalis,</hi> now the <hi>Horse</hi> Mount in <hi>Rome;</hi>
by the <hi>Temple of Bacchus</hi> there of a round form, at this day
consecrate to S. <hi>Agnes</hi> without the gate <hi>Viminalis,</hi> manifestly
appears. But in what ever structures else the <hi>Romans</hi> used
them, certain it is, within their most stately <hi>Temples</hi> which
lay uncovered, and had no roofs, they always made such
<hi>Portico's;</hi> and though in other <hi>Temples</hi> they sometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spos'd
them, yet from <hi>Vitruvius</hi> it may be gathered, they
properly belonged to the <hi>Aspect Hypaethros,</hi> which was unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and rooflesse as this <hi>Antiquity Stoneheng,</hi> he peremptorily
assigning <hi>Portico's</hi> to be made on the inside of no kind of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99064:66"/>
                     <hi>Temples,</hi> but those;<note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 3. cap. 1.</note> His words are, <hi>Hypaethros in interiore parte
habet columnas, remotas √† parietibus ad circuitionem (ut porticus)
peristyliorum. Temples open to the air, and without roofs, have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes
on the inside, distant from the walls, as Courts Portico's about
them.</hi> Even, after the same <hi>decorum</hi> as at <hi>Stoneheng.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, if cast an eye upon <hi>their</hi> artifice and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of workmanship, <hi>Stoneheng</hi> appears built directly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to those rules, which the <hi>Romans</hi> observed in great
works. For, the <hi>Roman Architects,</hi> in distinguishing the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their <hi>Temples,</hi> always observed (as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in his
third book teacheth us) the greater the Columnes were, the
closer they set them together; so in this <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the stones
being great, the spaces betwixt them are likewise narrow.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Architraves</hi> also, in this work were all of them set
without morter, and fixed upon the upright stones by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
(as formerly described) in the very same manner, as
in great structures, where the stones solid, and of more then
ordinary greatnesse, the <hi>Romans</hi> were wont to doe. <hi>They
laid them without any unctuous incorporating matter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Leo Bap. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. lib. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>nullo fulta glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,</hi>
saith <hi>Leo Baptista Albertus.</hi> And divers examples of this
kind might be brought, I my self amongst other <hi>Antiquities</hi>
have seen the ruines of an <hi>Aquaeduct,</hi> built by the <hi>Romans</hi> in
<hi>Provynce,</hi> running through a deep valley, and raised in height
equall to the adjacent Mountains, upon huge Arches-fifty
eight foot wide, the stones whereof, being of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
scantlings, were laid without any cement or morter,
to incorporate them with the rest of the work. And,
where occasion guided their judgements to the observance
of this rule, they united and compacted the stones together,
by certain ligatures or holdfasts, (the <hi>Italians</hi> call them <hi>Perni,</hi>
pegs or tops, for such they resemble, and we, from the verb
<hi>tenere</hi> to hold, not improperly calling them <hi>tenons) quae infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riores,
&amp; und superiores in lapides infixae, cavatae fuere, ne quid fort√®
protrusi ordines alteri ab alteris distrahantur.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Leo Bap. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. lib. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Which</hi> (saith <hi>Albertus</hi>)
<hi>being formed in the inferiour stones, were hollowed or mortaised into
those above, lest by any chance they should start one from another, and
break the order of the work.</hi> Here the <hi>Florentine Architect</hi> gives
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99064:66"/>
us the self same manner of banding stones, when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
laid them without morter, as if he had seen this very
<hi>Antiquity Stoneheng.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, what ever footsteps of the <hi>Romans</hi> found in
other places of this Island, it's not inconsiderately to be past
over, that in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> the County (as is said before) where
our <hi>Stoneheng</hi> remains, <hi>Roman Antiquities</hi> are most perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
not only, by the apparent testimonies of the coyns of
their Emperors in divers places digged up, but by severall
their encamping places yet to be seen,<note place="margin">Camden.</note> as <hi>Leckham,</hi> in times of
yore a seat of the <hi>Romans:</hi> the place also where old <hi>Salisbury</hi>
now sheweth it self, within six miles of <hi>Stoneheng:</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three miles thereof <hi>Yanesbury</hi> Castle, supposed a work of
<hi>Vespasians</hi> when he conquered, and after kept in subjection
the <hi>Belgae,</hi> ancient inhabitants of that tract. Likewise the
ruines nearer yet to <hi>Stoneheng,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Speed.</note> of a fortresse our Historians
hold anciently a garrison of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in many other
forts of that Shire (both by their form and manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
well known to have been <hi>Roman</hi>) the tract of their
footing is yet left.</p>
                  <p>But it is objected, If <hi>Stoneheng</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> work, how comes
it, no <hi>Roman</hi> Author makes mention of it? I answer, their
Historians used not to commit to writing every particular
work, or action the <hi>Romans</hi> performed: if so, how vast
would their volumes have been? <hi>Stoneheng</hi> 'tis granted, is
much admired by us, yet, how far more admirable works
were the <hi>Romans</hi> Founders of, not mentioned in any of their
ancient stories? That notable bridge invented and built by
<hi>Caesar,</hi> for passing his Army over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> himself at large
describes, remembring little or nothing neverthelesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
divers other as great works in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Batavia,</hi>
suppos'd to be performed by him also. <hi>Dion, Herodian, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius</hi>
and other their Historians tell us, the <hi>Romans</hi> built the
so famed wall, commonly by us called the <hi>Picts wall,</hi> exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
crosse over our Island from the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea to the <hi>German</hi>
Ocean, above fourscore <hi>Italian</hi> miles in length, with many
towers and fortresses erected upon it; when works of as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99064:67"/>
great admiration in <hi>Britain</hi> they have past in silence: those
wonderfull causeys made throughout the land, by dreining
and drying up Fens, levelling hils, raising valleys, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them with stones of such breadth, that Wains might
without danger passe one by another, not any ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Author (for ought appears) directly mentioning. Yet,
who doubts them <hi>Roman</hi> works? <hi>I dare confidently avouch,
the Romans by little and little founded and raised them up,</hi> saith <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cam. fo. 64.</note>
And why? mark I pray, because, whilst <hi>Agricola</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<hi>Britain, Tacitus</hi> tels us, <hi>severall ways were enjoyned.</hi> If
then, because <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirms in generall terms only, <hi>severall
ways enjoyned, Camden</hi> confidently concludes them <hi>Roman
works,</hi> no <hi>Roman</hi> History otherwise remembring them; Why
may it not, the same <hi>Tacitus</hi> telling us in like manner,
<hi>Agricola exhorted the Britans in private, and helpt them in common,
to build Temples, Houses, and Places of publick resort,</hi> as perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily
be inferr'd, <hi>Stoneheng</hi> was a work built by the <hi>Romans,</hi>
though not particularly remembred by them in their stories?
In a word,<note place="margin">Tacitus. Beda.</note> 
                     <hi>Temples</hi> and places of publick resort, the <hi>Romans</hi>
built here, and were the first that did so, leaving it to after
ages to find out by their <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>building, Order</hi> in <hi>building,</hi>
and <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> for <hi>building,</hi> such lofty ruines, as appears
in this <hi>Antiquity,</hi> could be remains of none but <hi>Roman</hi>
building.</p>
                  <p>The next thing to be enquired after, is, in what time
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> built. Happily, about those times, when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
having setled the Country here under their own <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
and, together with bringing over <hi>Colonies</hi> reduced the
naturall inhabitants of this Island unto the society of civill
life, by training them up in the liberall Sciences. For,
<hi>then also</hi> (saith <hi>Camden</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Camden fo. 63.</note>) <hi>did they furnish the</hi> Britans, <hi>with goodly
houses, and stately buildings, in such sort, that the reliques and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
of their ruines, cause the beholders now, exceedingly to admire
the same, and the common sort of People plainly say, those</hi> Roman
<hi>works were made by Giants, of such exceeding great admiration, and
sumptuous magnificence they are.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:99064:67"/>
This relation of <hi>Camdens,</hi> reflects chiefly upon the time of
<hi>Agricola;</hi> neverthelesse, that <hi>Stoneheng</hi> (though fabled Giants
work) was then built, I dare not affirm: the great works
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> brought to perfection in this Island, being
not the work of a day. It hath been the invention of wise
<hi>Romans</hi> of old, affecting civility, to raise goodly buildings
here: but the precise times when, in things so far from all
knowledge, cannot be with any certainty avouched. For
my part, I should choose to assign those times for building
thereof, when the <hi>Romans</hi> in their chief prosperity most
flourished here, and refer the first erection to the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Agricolas</hi> government formerly mentioned, and the
reign of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great: in order to which, the times
rather somwhat after <hi>Agricola,</hi> if not during his own Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy,
then next preceding <hi>Constantine.</hi> For, long before
<hi>Constantine</hi> acquired the Soveraignty (which was not till
the year of our Lord three hundred and ten) the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
splendor of that mighty <hi>Empire</hi> began sensibly to wane,
and the ambition of the great Captains of <hi>Rome,</hi> (some few
excepted) tended rather to make parties for obtaining the
<hi>Purple Robe,</hi> then (after the manner of their ancestors) to
eternise their names by great and admirable works, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronizing
good <hi>Arts,</hi> for want whereof they began like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to decay apace; <hi>Serly</hi> in his third Book speaking of
those times, telling us, that <hi>id temporis Architecti, si cum supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioribus
conferantur, rudiores &amp; ineptiores extitisse videntur. In
those days although there were many Architects, yet, compared with
such as lived in the preceding Ages, they were very rude and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
Besides, the condition wherein this Island was, divers
years preceding <hi>Constantine,</hi> would not admit such underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.
for, by the civil discord of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Britans</hi>
taking occasion to make frequent revolts, in hope to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their lost liberty, the <hi>Romans</hi> were put upon other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Councels then to think of building; namely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the <hi>Britans</hi> to their wonted obedience, and keep the
Province in some reasonable quiet, by expelling the <hi>Scots</hi>
and <hi>Picts</hi> (savage and perfidious <hi>People</hi> even from times
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99064:68"/>
of old) making daily inroads and incursions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>Now, as for these reasons, it's not likely <hi>Stoneheng</hi> could
be built in the times next before <hi>Constantine,</hi> so, by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
it will manifestly appear, it was not erected after his
Reign. For, after his transplanting the seat of the Empire
into the East, and the government of the then known
world, under the <hi>Romans,</hi> distinguished by <hi>East</hi> and <hi>Western</hi>
Emperours, a deluge of barbarous Nations (like so many
Locusts) swarmed over all. Who, as with their vast multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
they oft had formerly attempted it, so, thence forward,
till bringing that mighty Empire unto its finall and fatall
period; and thereby utterly destroying in like manner all
<hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> together with <hi>Architecture,</hi> (not restored
again, even in <hi>Italy</hi> it self, untill, as formerly remembred)
they never desisted. Moreover, in the times after <hi>Constantine,</hi>
no <hi>Temples</hi> to Heathen <hi>Deities</hi> (such as I shall make appear
this <hi>Antiquity Stoneheng</hi> was) were erected here, they being
times of defacing, rather then erecting idolatrous places.
For, most of the succeeding Emperors becoming <hi>Christians,</hi>
the tempestuous storms of persecution were over, and the
thick clouds of superstition beginning to be dissolved by
the bright beams of the Gospel, and true light of CHRIST,
every where <hi>Temples</hi> were shut up against false Gods, and
set open to the true GOD. According to that of <hi>Gildas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gildas.</note> 
                     <hi>No
sooner was the blustering tempest, and storm of persecution blown over,
but the faithfull Christians, who in the time of trouble and danger had
hidden themselves in woods, deserts, and secret caves, being come abroad
in open sight, renovant Ecclesias ad solum usque destructas, basili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas
sanctorum martyrum fundant, construunt, perficiunt &amp;c. Churches
ruinate to the very ground they reedifie, Temples of holy Martyrs they
found, build, and finish &amp;c.</hi> So that, in stead of idolatrous <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
built in the Ages preceding <hi>Constantine,</hi> during his reign
and after, whilst the <hi>Romans</hi> continued in any prosperous
state here, by erecting <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> they began generally
to neglect, and suffer fall to decay, rather then new build
<hi>Temples</hi> to their <hi>Pagan</hi> Gods.

These pressing occurrences therefore, to wit, civill broyls
amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, frequent insurrections of
the <hi>Britans,</hi> daily inrodes by the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> together
with the <hi>downfall</hi> of <hi>Paganism, decay</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> and fatall <hi>ruine</hi>
of the whole <hi>Empire,</hi> making the times both long before
and after <hi>Constantine</hi> incompatible for undertaking such
works as this <hi>Antiquity,</hi> it may safely enough be concluded,
if <hi>Stoneheng</hi> not founded by <hi>Agricola,</hi> yet erected it might be
about fifteen hundred and fifty years ago, in the times some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
after his government,<note place="margin">Tacit. in Vit. Agr.</note> 
                     <hi>the</hi> Province <hi>being formerly left
by him in good and peaceable state,</hi> the <hi>Britans</hi> reduced from
<hi>Barbarity</hi> to order and civill conversation, and the <hi>Romans</hi>
flourishing in all manner of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, concerning the use for which <hi>Stoneheng</hi> at first ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
I am clearly of opinion, it was originally a <hi>Temple,</hi> it
being built with all accommodations properly belonging
to a sacred structure. For, it had an intervall or spacious
Court lying round about it, wherein the <hi>Victimes</hi> for obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were slain, into which it was unlawfull for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
person to enter: It was separated from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjacent
Plain, with a large Trench in stead of a wall, as
a boundary about the <hi>Temple,</hi> most conformable to the main
work, wholly exposed to open view: Without this Trench,
the promiscuous common multitude, with zeal too much,
attended the <hi>ceremonies</hi> of their solemne though superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sacrifices, and might see the oblations, but not come
within them: It had likewise its peculiar <hi>Cell,</hi> with <hi>Portico's</hi>
round about, into which <hi>Cell,</hi> as into their <hi>Sanctum sanctorum</hi>
(pardon the expression) none but the <hi>Priests</hi> entred to offer
Sacrifice, and make atonement for the <hi>People:</hi> Within the
<hi>Cell</hi> an <hi>Ara</hi> or <hi>Altar</hi> was placed, having its proper position
towards the <hi>East,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> used. <hi>Arae spectent ad Orientem,</hi>
saith <hi>Vitruvius.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 4. cap. 8.</note> And, that there hath been the heads of Bulls,
or Oxen, of Harts, and other such beasts digged up, or in,
or near this <hi>Antiquity</hi> (as divers now living can testifie) is
not to be omitted; for who can imagine, but these were the
heads of such, as anciently there offered in Sacrifice? toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99064:70"/>
with which also, were heaped up great quantities of
Charcole, happily used about the performance of their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
ceremonies. That the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> had Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole
in use amongst them, <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms.<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 16. Tom. 1. lib. 33. Tom. 2.</note> And when I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

of the stones of the greater <hi>Hexagon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Order</hi> whereof this <hi>Temple</hi> consists, according to the
rules of <hi>Art</hi> observed by the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> in works of
this kinde, is mingled of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Tuscane</hi> work. For, as
the plainnesse and solidnesse of the <hi>Tuscane Order,</hi> appears
eminently throughout the whole <hi>Antiquity:</hi> so the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the spaces betwixt the stones, visibly discovers
therein, the delicacy of the <hi>Corinthian Order.</hi> Which commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
amongst the <hi>Roman Architects</hi> was very usuall, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<hi>Vitruvius</hi> (in his fourth Book and seventh Chapter)

first shew which <hi>Temples</hi> make to those that draw near unto
them, is <hi>Dipteros Hypaethros,</hi> which is double winged about
uncovered. <hi>Dipteros circa aedem duplices habet columnarum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi>
(saith <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 3. cap. 1.</note>) <hi>Dipteros hath double orders of columnes
about the Temple. Hypaethros sub divo est, sine tecto,</hi> (as the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99064:70"/>
same Author) <hi>Hypaethros is open to the air, without a roof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Manner of this <hi>Temple</hi> is <hi>Pycnostylos,</hi> or <hi>narrow spaces.
Pycnostylos</hi> is that kinde of <hi>Temples,</hi> which hath the columnes
set thick, and close together <hi>creb<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 3. cap. 2.</note> also
hath it.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, though it appears from very good
Authorities, the Artifice, and workmanship of this <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
together with the <hi>Scheam</hi> which formed it, were <hi>Roman:</hi> and
the <hi>Order</hi> of which consisting, invented in <hi>Italy,</hi> and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<hi>Roman</hi> in like manner: as also, by the severall
peculiar accommodations, the probable reliques of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish</hi>
Sacrifices, and determinate rules of <hi>Architecture,</hi> it was
anciently a <hi>Temple:</hi> Neverthelesse it appears not, the <hi>Romans</hi>
ever used any whatever profane structure like this, much
lesse any manner of <hi>Temples</hi> of this kinde of invention,
<hi>Where the Temple lies open without walls, surrounded only with pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>
For, that the upright stones which make this work
<hi>Stoneheng,</hi> are in stead of them, may well enough be
granted.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, the learned in <hi>Antiquities</hi> very well
know, those things which oblivion hath so long removed
out of mind, are hardly to be discovered. Yet, as to the first
part of the objection, that the <hi>Romans</hi> never used any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
profane structure like this, <hi>Varro de re rustica</hi> (as I
find him cited by <hi>Philander</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. in Vitr. lib. 4.</note>) tels us, that they had in use
amongst them a round building without any wals, having
a double <hi>Order</hi> of columns round about, this he cals by the
name of <hi>Tholus, edificium rotundum, columnatum duplici colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum
ordine. A round edifice</hi> (saith he) <hi>environed about with a
double order of columns.</hi> Which double <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Columns Pyrrho
Ligorio</hi> a famous <hi>Neapolitane Architect,</hi> and great discoverer of
<hi>Antiquities,</hi> in his description thereof designes without a
roof also.</p>
                  <p>But to come to their sacred works, which in regard of
this <hi>Antiquity,</hi> are (it's true) of most concernment, I find
the <hi>Romans</hi> used (as <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 4. cap. 7.</note> witnesseth) such manner of
<hi>Temples.</hi> For (in his fourth Book, and seventh Chapter) he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99064:71"/>
delivers, there were amongst others two forms of round
<hi>Temples,</hi> commonly in use amongst them, the one called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopteros;</hi>
the other <hi>Peripteros.</hi> This, had the <hi>Cell</hi> enclosed about
with a continued wall, and at a proportionate distance from
it, the columns placed which made a <hi>Portico</hi> round about
it, clean different from <hi>Stoneheng:</hi> the other made open, and
in stead of a wall encompassed with a row of pillars only,
having no enclosed <hi>Cell</hi> within it at all, as much conducing
to our purpose in hand.<note place="margin">Aedes sacrae Templa di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta fuerunt, qu√≤d essent quasi aedes Deorum. Rosin. lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> His words are these, <hi>Fiunt autem
aedes rotundae, √® quibus aliae sine cella columnatae constituuntur. They
make also</hi> (saith he) <hi>round Temples, of which some are built without
a Cell, environed with Pillars only.</hi> These were without any
wals, (as his Commenter hath it) lying open to the Air.
And truly (as I may presume to say) from this very manner
the invention of <hi>stoneheng</hi> was principally taken,<note place="margin">Dan. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar.</note> in ordering
whereof, the <hi>Architect</hi> disdaining usuall and common
forms, of both the aforesaid forms composed one. For,
taking the outward circle from the <hi>Monopteros,</hi> he made it
open also as in that, but in stead of the continued wall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
enclosing the <hi>Cell</hi> of the <hi>Peripteros,</hi> at <hi>Stoneheng</hi> he
made only an <hi>Hexagon</hi> about the <hi>Cell,</hi> leaving the same open
in like manner. And, as <hi>Hermogenes</hi> (whom I shall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to remember again) to illustrate his work, leaving
out the inner row of Pillars, made a single <hi>Portico</hi> about
the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Magnesia,</hi> whereby it came to be a new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for which he is famous to posterity: so the subtile <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect,</hi>
whosoever he was, to ennoble this his work, adding
the said <hi>Hexagon</hi> here, made a double <hi>Portico</hi> round about
this <hi>Temple,</hi> and thereby a new invention likewise, no lesse
famous to succeeding Ages. Our <hi>Antiquity Stoneheng</hi> had
otherwise been of the self same <hi>Aspect</hi> without a <hi>Cell,</hi> as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi>
hath before delivered. That <hi>Temple Monopteros,</hi> was
environed with a row of pillars; this <hi>Temple Stoneheng,</hi> in
stead of them, supplied with a rank of pillasters (as they
may well be called) continuing round about it. That, lay
open to the air without any walls: so doth this at <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heng.</hi>
That, had over the pillars an <hi>Architrave, Freese,</hi> and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99064:71"/>
                     <hi>Cornice,</hi> the <hi>Order</hi> being delicate: this at <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> over the
pillasters an <hi>Architrave</hi> only, as most conformable to the
solidnesse of the <hi>Order</hi> and plainnesse of the work.</p>
                  <p>Thus it fully appears, the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> used to erect
<hi>Temples, which lay open without walls, surrounded only with pillars;</hi>
in invention like this at <hi>Stoneheng.</hi> But, let us see whether
the form <hi>Monopteros,</hi> had any roof over it. That the <hi>Romans</hi>
had <hi>Temples</hi> uncovered, and without roofs, like <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> is
in part already, and shall more manifestly be hereafter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
and searching curiously into their <hi>Antiquities,</hi> it will be
found the greatest, most splendid, and most magnificent
work of all others, which the <hi>Ancients</hi> made for service of
their <hi>Deities,</hi> were those kinde of <hi>Temples</hi> of the <hi>Aspect Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paethros.</hi>
Whether the <hi>Monopteros</hi> was one of that kind, appears
not yet, and <hi>Vitruvius</hi> is very obscure therein; neverthelesse,
that it was built without a roof, I shall illustrate by these
reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Vitruvius</hi> tels us not it had a roof; for, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of all severall kinds of <hi>Temples,</hi> after he hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the <hi>Aspect, Form,</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of them with much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnesse,
he omits not throughout his fourth Book to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
aswell the contignation, as proportion of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the roofs, belonging to all those <hi>Temples,</hi> which
had any, and when vaulted he gives us likewise the form
thereof, if the <hi>Temples</hi> so covered: but, in the description of
the form <hi>Monopteros,</hi> there is no manner of timber work,
nor form of vault, nor the least word mentioned of any
roof at all, in what place soever throughout his whole
work speaking thereof. In which respect, considering all
<hi>Temples</hi> having roofs, those roofs are described by <hi>Vitruvius,</hi>
and that he describes no roof belonging to this, it must
necessarily follow, the <hi>Temples</hi> in form <hi>Monopteros</hi> had no
roofs over them.</p>
                  <p>Again, after giving the proportion of the <hi>Architrave</hi> over
the columnes of the <hi>Monopteros,</hi> he saith, <hi>Zophorus &amp; reliqua
quae insuper imponuntur, ita uti in tertio volumine de symmetriis
scripsit. The Freese and other ornaments laid upon them, are as in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99064:72"/>
his third Book of symmetries made mention of.</hi> Now, in his third
Book, he only treats of proportions, and not one word is
so much as mentioned by him of any manner of roofs at all,
only in the close of the said Book, he gives the proportion
of frontispices belonging to quadrangular <hi>Temples:</hi> the
same referment in like manner he makes for the ornaments
of the <hi>Peripteros,</hi> and withall proceeds to a full description,
in what manner the roof of its <hi>Cell</hi> was made, which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse,
he would likewise have done in the other form,
if it had been covered. For, he saith, whatever is to be laid
above the <hi>Freese</hi> of the <hi>Monopteros,</hi> is, as set down in his third
Book: but, in his third Book, there is not one word menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
of any roofs; the conclusion then follows the <hi>Monopte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros</hi>
was without a roof.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he positively tels us it was <hi>sine Cella, without a Cell:</hi>
now the <hi>Cell</hi> (and which for distinction sake I have so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in describing this <hi>Antiquity,</hi> because it was applied to
the same use, to perform their sacred rites in) was indeed
properly,<note place="margin">Bern. Baldo.</note> the inner, or chief part of the <hi>Temple, quam nos
corpus Templi vulg√≤ dicimus, we commonly call it the body of the
Church,</hi> which enclosed with wals, was covered with a
roof, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> declares in the form <hi>Peripteros, tecti ratio
ita habeatur &amp;c. The manner of a roof</hi> (saith he) <hi>was thus &amp;c.</hi>
But, the <hi>Monopteros</hi> was without a <hi>Cell,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
without a roof also, as having no walls to bear
it. For, in regard of the manner of the <hi>Architecture,</hi> the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
standing in <hi>Island</hi> (as we say) the work could not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
bear a roof, if made of any great capacity: either
therefore, they made <hi>Temples</hi> of this form very little (in
which respect only, <hi>Palladio</hi> supposeth it might be vaulted)
inconsistent with the <hi>Roman</hi> greatnesse, or else, like <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heng</hi>
they were wholly uncovered and rooflesse. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it is manifest, the <hi>Aspect</hi> was just the same. And
if I should say, the ruines of one after the same form also,
remains yet in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> which the common people usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call <hi>Rolle-rich-stones,</hi> take it but as my conjecture only, as
likewise one or two built after the like manner in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:99064:72"/>
no man unlesse <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> knowing by what Kings.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the proportions appearing in this <hi>Antiquity
Stoneheng,</hi> are much conformable to those, assigned by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi>
to the parts of the <hi>Monopteros:</hi> He tels us, <hi>Tribunal
habent &amp; ascensum ex suae diametri tertia parte: they had the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,</hi>
(by which is understood that levell upon which the
<hi>Temple</hi> placed) <hi>and the ascent, consisting of one third part of the
Diameter.</hi> So at <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> the work it self is one <hi>third part
of the Diameter</hi> of the circumvallation: And, acording to
the proportion allowed by him to <hi>the Ascent,</hi> it seems those
<hi>Temples</hi> were sited more stately then others, (by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
great also) and certain it is, whosoever views this
<hi>Antiquity</hi> attentively with judgement, upon the place where
remaining (for the <hi>Folio</hi> being too little I could not expresse
it in Design) and doth allow a proportionate depth to
the Trench surrounding it; considering also, together
therewith, the levell of the plain lying without, he will
then finde it standing upon such a rising ground, that the
<hi>Ascent</hi> unto it, was not much lesse magnificent, then what
<hi>Vitruvius</hi> hath declared.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, besides the aforementioned round <hi>Temples,
Vitruvius</hi> in the same Chapter tels us, that, <hi>generibus aliis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituuntur
aedes, ex iisdem symmetriis ordinatae, &amp; alio genere dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positiones
habentes. The</hi> Romans <hi>built them after other manner
of inventions, following the same proportions, and having their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
after another kinde.</hi> Of which, if vouchsafed to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the descriptions, some of them might have been found,
not only agreeable in <hi>Aspect,</hi> but happily of the very self
same form also, as this <hi>Temple Stoneheng</hi> doth appear.</p>
                  <p>Now considering this discourse may happen into the
hands of those, who cannot by words so easily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
things of this <hi>Art,</hi> I have for their satisfaction brought
into <hi>Design,</hi> the plants of both the aforesaid <hi>Temples</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> whereby their conformity with <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heng,</hi>
and the invention thereof taken from them, is more
clearly manifested.</p>

But, before deliver my judgment, unto which of their <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
this <hi>Temple Stoneheng</hi> was anciently dedicated by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
I shall give you some customs in force amongst the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi>
relating the <hi>Decorum</hi> used by them, in building their
particular <hi>Temples:</hi> whereby, those several opinions seemingly
conclusive to whom <hi>Stoneheng</hi> sacred, may more evidently
appear invalid, and my own more apparently probable.
Those therefore that endevour the searching out <hi>Antiquities</hi>
of <hi>Architecture,</hi> must amongst others, especially prescribe to
themselves five things to be guided by. <hi>viz. The Situation,
Aspect, Manner, Form,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of the work as in use
amongst the <hi>Ancients.</hi> For, inventing the severall ornaments
of <hi>Architecture,</hi> at first for honour and distinction onely
of their <hi>Deities,</hi> they appropriated to each of them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>situations,</hi> precise <hi>forms,</hi> peculiar <hi>Orders,</hi> according to
the severall qualities, in regard whereof adored by them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>situation</hi> of the <hi>Temples</hi> to <hi>Venus, Mars, Vulcan,</hi> they
ordained to be chosen without their Cities, as those which
moved mens minds to lasciviousnesse, wars, and devastati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Within their Cities they placed the <hi>Temples</hi> of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
of <hi>Chastity, Peace,</hi> good <hi>Arts:</hi> and of such Gods also,
to whom the Protection of their Cities committed. To
<hi>Pallas, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Isis</hi> the chief Presidents of Artificers,
and Merchants, they built <hi>Temples</hi> near the Market places,
or upon the Market places themselves. To <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
near the <hi>Theater.</hi> To <hi>Hercules</hi> near the Cirque or <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater.</hi>
Unto <hi>Aesculapius</hi> and <hi>Salus,</hi> in places most of all
others healthfull, and near to pure streams, and waters; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the infirm people, coming out of a pestilent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
<hi>Aire,</hi> to that which was good and healthfull, by
drinking those waters might the sooner, and with lesse
difficulty be recovered, whereby zeal to those supposed <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
encreased.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aspect Hypaethros,</hi> mentioned before, of which <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heng</hi>
appears built, was proper only to some of their Gods,
as shall be remembred in due time: the other <hi>five</hi> (need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
here to name) were indifferently disposed, sometime
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99064:77"/>
to one, and sometime to another <hi>Deity,</hi> as the magnificence
of the <hi>Temples</hi> to be built required, and, as to be made with
<hi>Portico's</hi> or without.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Manner,</hi> which <hi>Vitruvius</hi> distinguishes into five kinds,
according as the intercolumnes are of five severall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
was only so far forth peculiarly appropriated to
their <hi>Deities,</hi> as it was agreeable to the proper <hi>Order,</hi> otherwise
they followed the greatnesse of the Work.</p>
                  <p>But, to each of them appropriating particular forms of
<hi>Temples;</hi> to some of their Gods, they made them of a round
form, to others quadrangular, to others of many angles:
some of them having their <hi>Temples</hi> covered, with roofs over
them; others again built uncovered, without any manner
of roofs at all: As, our <hi>Antiquity Stoneheng.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, the <hi>Order</hi> of which they built them, was so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
observed, according to the peculiar qualities of their
<hi>Deities,</hi> that seldom or never they varied: as in fit place I
shall remember. These aforesaid rules also were so firmly
observed by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that even at first sight the <hi>Roman
Architects</hi> of old were able to judge, to what <hi>Deity,</hi> this, or
that <hi>Temple</hi> sacred: and the modern <hi>Italian Architects,</hi> by the
ruines of them at this day, give such notable testimonies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the discovery of them, as are very hardly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted.
Whosoever desires more of this, may read <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,
Leo Baptista Albertus,</hi> and other Authors writing of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture.</hi>
That then we may arrive to a degree of certainty
unto whom our <hi>Stoneheng</hi> anciently dedicated; some such
<hi>Deitie</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> is to be found out, in whose honour
they built <hi>Temples,</hi> not only in such <hi>situations</hi> as this at <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heng;</hi>
but with whose nature or quality the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Aspect</hi>
thereof may be agreeable also; and the <hi>Order proper.</hi> For,
whosoever goes about to enforce other reasons, do as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but beat the air, neither can they reduce this <hi>Antiquity</hi> to
any probable Originall.</p>
                  <p>To which of the <hi>Roman</hi> Deities <hi>Stoneheng</hi> consecrated, are,
as I said before, severall opinions. Some presume it sacred
to <hi>Diana,</hi> but upon what ground their conjecture is raised,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99064:77"/>
considering both the <hi>Aspect</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of this <hi>Temple</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different from those the <hi>Ancients</hi> used to dedicate to Her,
I cannot conceive;<note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 3. cap. 1 &amp; 2.</note> for, the <hi>Manner</hi> of the <hi>Temples</hi> erected to
<hi>Diana,</hi> was <hi>Diastylos,</hi> i.e. <hi>columnis ampli√πs patentibus,</hi> made with
large and void spaces: the <hi>Aspect</hi> of that at <hi>Ephesus</hi> was
<hi>Dipteros;</hi> that at <hi>Magnesia Pseudodipteros:</hi> which <hi>Manner Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes</hi>
inventing to save expence and labour, though he
left out the <hi>Order</hi> of pillars within, and thereby the <hi>Portico</hi>
came to be more large, yet the <hi>Aspect</hi> continued still the
same. And, as in the <hi>Aspect</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> so likewise in the
<hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> it's different: that, at <hi>Ephesus</hi> aforesaid being
of the <hi>Ionick Order,</hi> the <hi>Order</hi> peculiarly appropriated to <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and quadrangular: of the same <hi>Form</hi> also, was that at
<hi>Magnesia</hi> aforesaid, and so likewise the <hi>Romans</hi> built them,
as by the now Church of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Evangelist at the <hi>Latian,</hi> or
<hi>Latine</hi> Port,<note place="margin">Fab. Cal.</note> anciently the Temple of <hi>Diana;</hi> and that in
Mount <hi>Aventine</hi> also, the chief of her <hi>Temples</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> fully
appears. The <hi>situation</hi> of the Temples dedicated to her,
was in groves, whence <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 4. cap. 7.</note> cals her grovy <hi>Diana.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Ecce suburbanae templum nemorale Dianae, <hi>saith</hi> Ovid.</l>
                        <l>See where <hi>Diana's</hi> grovy Temple stands.</l>
                     </q>
In which sort <hi>Virgil, Pliny,</hi> and other Authors also tell us
her Temples were always sited. The <hi>Architecture</hi> therefore
of the Temples to <hi>Diana,</hi> and this at <hi>Stoneheng</hi> being so far
different, there is no probable reason <hi>Stoneheng</hi> should be
suppos'd dedicated to her.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whether or no this opinion may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with any of those qualities, the Ancients endowed
this Goddesse with, let us examine further the Nature of
the Deity it self.<note place="margin">Nat. Com. lib. 3. cap. 18.</note> Is <hi>Stoneheng</hi> consecrated to <hi>Diana</hi> because
she presided over ways? what publick roads then, or
common high-ways are to be read of, which anciently led
over the Downs near this <hi>Antiquity?</hi> The most ancient
ways we meet with, and which the <hi>Romans</hi> first made in
this <hi>Island,</hi> as <hi>Camden</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Camden fo. 64.</note> sets them down, are four, <hi>Watling-street,</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:99064:78"/>
                     <hi>Ikemild-street, Ermin-street,</hi> and the <hi>Fosse. Watling-street</hi> led
through <hi>Verolamium</hi> directly as it were by a streight line to
the West side of <hi>Leicestershire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Camden fo. 517.</note> and from thence through the
Northerly Counties into <hi>Wales. Ikemild-street</hi> began in the
Countrey of the <hi>Iceni,</hi> tending Eastward. <hi>Ermin-street</hi> in the
same quarter, running through <hi>Gambridgeshire, Huntingdon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
and so on towards <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> led the right way into
the Northern Countreys on that side: (this street-way, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
may be that which among the inhabitants passeth now
by the name of <hi>High Dike.</hi>) The <hi>Fosse</hi> passing through <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickshire,</hi>
came down to <hi>Stow</hi> on the <hi>Would,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. fo. 366.</note> thence to <hi>Cirn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
from <hi>Cirncester</hi> continuing on towards <hi>Bath</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it to <hi>Somerton</hi> into the Western Provinces: the ridge
whereof is yet to be seen in divers places of that tract. All
of them lying so far from <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> that none of them are
remembred to come nearer then <hi>Cirncester</hi> to any part of the
Plains whereon it stands, and therefore in this respect there
can be no cause to imagine this <hi>Antiquity</hi> should be dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her. Or, is <hi>Stoneheng</hi> sacred to <hi>Diana,</hi> because she was
the Patronesse of Gates? for which reason the Ancients
built her Temples, either near to them within their Cities,
or not far from them in the pleasant suburbs. But what
Cities, or places having any such Gates, were ever found an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
so near <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> as might cause the dedication of so
great a work to her? surely none. Or, is <hi>Stoneheng</hi> hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Diana</hi> because she had the tutelage of Mountains? if
so, then where are those Mountains to be found near this
<hi>Antiquity</hi> on <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plains? which Plains, North, South,
East and Westward through the midst of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> are so
open, that they terminate the Horizon. If any such Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
there, why do all Historians call them Plains? But
admit Mountains somtimes on <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain, what then
became of them? were they removed by Earthquakes,
swallowed into the ground by an <hi>Hiatus</hi> of the earth, or
levell'd by inundations? then let it be made apparent when
such like accidents fell out. Or is <hi>Stoneheng</hi> dedicated to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
because she delighted to bath her self in fountains and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99064:78"/>
fresh springs? where are those fountains and fresh springs
to be found? haply, in the utmost borders they may be had,
none certainly in the body of the Plains, or any thing near
<hi>Stoneheng:</hi> spring veins being not there to be found, unlesse
by sinking wells or pits very deep, which the inhabitants
are enforced to make in severall places for watering their
sheep, and as glad they are there, as the Patriarchs of old
in the deserts of <hi>Canaan</hi> to come by them. Or is <hi>Stoneheng</hi>
sacred to <hi>Diana,</hi> because reputed Goddesse of hunting? then,
who ever desirous of a Temple for her, may finde it in
<hi>Daphne,</hi> the anciently famous suburbs of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> where
was not onely a Temple dedicated to her, but an <hi>Asylum</hi>
also,<note place="margin">Strab. li. 16.</note> as <hi>Strabo</hi> witnesseth: such places only being held pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for her mysteries, where interven'd variety of pleasures,
goodly shadowy groves, delicate walks, and pleasant springs
of most cool and fresh waters. In the midst of these delights
the Ancients sited her Temples, not in wilde Downs, or
vast Plains, so wide and open that hardly see from one side
of them to another, affording neither shelter for travellers
against canicular heats, nor succour for cattell against the
boisterous blasts of blustering <hi>Boreas.</hi> Lastly, is <hi>Stoneheng</hi>
dedicated to <hi>Diana,</hi> because the supposed guardian of
woods? then remains it to be made apparent by them, those
Plains in ancient times bore another countenance then at
present. That they were full of Forrests, woods and groves,
with variety of lawns, replenished and stored with such
sorts of game, and wilde beasts in chase whereof <hi>Diana</hi> and
her companions are said to recreate themselves: from
whence some are of opinion she was called <hi>Diana,</hi> as much
to say <hi>Deviana,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rosin. lib. 2. cap. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>quoniam venantes per devia &amp; silvas deviare solent,
captantes feras. Because of huntsmens deviating, or wandring out
of the way, through uncouth paths and woods in pursuit of their game.</hi>
That those Plains afforded as much pleasure and delights
as the <hi>Thessalian Tempe,</hi> the <hi>Syrian Daphne,</hi> or what place else
as famous where her <hi>Temples</hi> anciently stood: and, in what
unknown age they were disafforrested and laid wast.
Which, if ever so, certainly some signs thereof would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99064:79"/>
or at least be found there, as well as in other parts of
the Island, in times past overgrown with woods. As in
<hi>Anglesey</hi> formerly mentioned; in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> where, in digging
their marlepits are often found huge trees, demonstrating to
posterity the forrests there anciently growing; in the Isle
of <hi>Axholm</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> where the inhabitants have hardly
any fewell, but what such trees afford so digged out of the
earth; in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> where I my self have seen trunks of
trees lying under ground, and expressing the places in times
past overgrown with trees, very few or none being in those
places now standing. Besides, some remembrance of the
aforesaid forrests and woods History questionlesse would
yeeld; now what occasion soever Historians take for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
this tract, not one word is delivered by them to that
purpose, all unanimously consenting 'twas never other then
at present an open and champion Countrey. A Theater on
which <hi>Bellona</hi> often displayed her bloody ensigns, and
acted severall tragedies in times of old: A field of <hi>Mars,</hi>
where <hi>Romans, Saxons,</hi> and after <hi>Danes</hi> for obtaining the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of this Island decided their ambitious controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
Of which actions we have visible testimony unto this
day, witnesse those burrows, and places where they cast the
bodies of their slain, over all quarters of the plain dispersed,
which in long time are so shrowded by nature with ever
growing grasse, that their memory will remain by their
sepulchres to all posterity; that which consumes all works of
Art, making them still more fresh and flourishing: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
spoils of war there frequently digged up, as formerly
remembred: severall encamping places of those severall
Nations in all parts of the plain even yet appearing, no
place in the whole Island, respecting the circuit, having more
remains of them: Also that huge Trench, mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the name of <hi>Wansdike,</hi> running through the very
bowels of them, such manner of trenches appearing no
where in any part of <hi>England</hi> beside, saving where the like
plains interveen; so at <hi>Newmarket Heath</hi> the like trench vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
called <hi>Devils Dike,</hi> as if <hi>made by Devils not by men,</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:99064:79"/>

                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:99064:80"/>
to be seen; though in ancient times it was the limits of the
Kingdome of the East <hi>Angles,</hi> and it took end, as <hi>Camden</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Camden fo. 490.</note>
very well observes, <hi>where the passages by reason of woods grew
cumbersome:</hi> Which, if the like be granted for <hi>Wansdike</hi> (as is
very probable, it ending also with the Plains) then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
controversie there were no more woods in times of
old on <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plains then at this day; it running over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart
them, as in a direct line from East to West. And
who knows not, that other manner of fortifications then
running trenches upon direct lines are to be cast up for
defence of woody situations? But why urge more Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
when the Inhabitants of the Countrey tell us, the
soil or ground being hot, dry, and chalky is altogether
improper for the growth of trees. Thus then the situation
of the place, so antipathizing in all respects with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and qualities anciently attributed to <hi>Diana,</hi> and the
<hi>Manner, Form,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of this <hi>Antiquity,</hi> so contrary to the
custome used by the <hi>Ancients</hi> in erecting her <hi>Temples,</hi> no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
wherefore this <hi>Temple Stoneheng</hi> should be conceiv'd as
erected for celebration of the superstitious ceremonies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ascribed unto her <hi>Worship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some, again, would have <hi>Stoneheng</hi> consecrated to <hi>Pan;</hi>
because <hi>Pan</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> word signifying the <hi>Universe,</hi> under him
the whole frame of <hi>Nature</hi> was adored. And therefore, the
<hi>Ancients</hi> made his statues with horns, saith <hi>Servius,</hi> expressing
thereby the beams of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and horns of the <hi>Moon;</hi> those
issuing from his forehead, and turning upwards towards
<hi>Heaven,</hi> as <hi>Boccace</hi> will have it, signified the Celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
feigning also, as the world moves with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
swiftnesse, he excelled likewise in speed of running.
By the purple, ruddy, and enflamed face, attributed to <hi>Pan,</hi>
that pure fire, above all other <hi>Elements</hi> holding his place in
the confines of the Celestiall Sphears was demonstrated:
by his large long beard descending down upon his breast,
the two superiour Elements <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> of a masculine
nature, sending down their impressions upon the other two
naturally feminine was shewed: by the spotted skin cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99064:81"/>
his breast and shoulders, the eighth sphear wholly
embelished with glorious stars; inveloping in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
all appertaining to the nature of sublunary creatures
was represented: by the sheep-hook which he held in one
hand, Natures dominion over all things (according to <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace)</hi>
was signified: and as <hi>Servius</hi> saith, because this staffe,
or rod was crooked, the year revolving into it self, was
thereby expressed: in the other hand holding a Pipe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of seven reeds, whereby, the Celestiall harmony
conceived by some to have seven sounds, and seven diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
tunes, according to the number of the <hi>Planets,</hi> and their
<hi>Sphears</hi> which are seven, was so set forth.</p>
                  <p>After this manner <hi>Mythologists</hi> discourse of <hi>Pan,</hi> with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
opinions, according to the subtile niceties of their
severall fancies: and in these respects as having relation to
the <hi>Heavens,</hi> this <hi>Antiquity Stoneheng</hi> is imagined sacred to
<hi>Him.</hi> 'Tis true, if <hi>Mythologie,</hi> and not demonstrative rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were to be fixt upon in matters of <hi>Architecture,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
conceptions might be some ground to frame conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> sacred to <hi>Pan.</hi> But, <hi>Architecture</hi> depending
upon demonstration, not fancy, the fictions of <hi>Mythologists</hi>
are no further to be embraced, then as not impertinently
conducing to prove reall truths. Wherefore, the aforesaid
ancient rules for building <hi>Temples</hi> considered, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Order, Form, Aspect</hi> and <hi>Situation</hi> of the <hi>Temples</hi> to
<hi>Pan,</hi> with the like in this <hi>Antiquity,</hi> so much contrariety is
found betwixt them, as may convince any reasonable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> not dedicated to <hi>Him.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Rosin. lib. 2.</note> And in <hi>Arcadia</hi> it self where he was principally

of the same <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> as to <hi>Iuno:</hi> In the <hi>Town</hi> of <hi>Heraea,

<hi>Vitruvius,</hi> who tels us, <hi>To Iuno, Diana, and Bacchus,</hi> and to the
other <hi>Deities</hi> of the same quality,<note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>they built Temples of the Ionick
Order.</hi> The <hi>Form</hi> in like manner of her sacred structures was
quadrangular, as in Mount <hi>Aventine,</hi> in <hi>foro Olitorio</hi> (or the
herb Market) in Mount <hi>Quirinal,</hi> and elswhere amongst the
<hi>Romans</hi> the <hi>ruines</hi> of her <hi>Temples</hi> do evidently witnesse: as

                     <note place="margin">Alexan. Don. Pomp. Totti.</note> and amongst the <hi>Elians</hi>

But this <hi>Antiquity</hi> is of the severe <hi>Tuscane</hi> work,<note place="margin">Pausan. fo. 114. &amp; 317.</note> and of a
round figure. The <hi>Temples</hi> to <hi>Pan</hi> had a <hi>Portico</hi> onely in
<hi>front,</hi> at <hi>Stoneheng</hi> it continues round about the <hi>Cell.</hi> The
<hi>Temples</hi> to <hi>Pan</hi> were not exposed to the open <hi>Aire,</hi> and built
uncovered as <hi>Stoneheng</hi> was, but had roofs upon them. For,
<hi>Ignis eiperpetuus ardebat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. fo. 516.</note> therein <hi>they kept perpetuall fire,</hi> as at <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesium</hi>
a <hi>Town</hi> also of <hi>Arcadians;</hi> all <hi>Temples</hi> wherein they
kept such fires being covered, as the <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos</hi>
amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and to <hi>Vesta</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> amongst the
<hi>Romans.</hi> But, if at any time they did erect them distant from
a <hi>Town,</hi> reserving always the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> they chose
such situations as wholly environed with trees; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>Pan</hi> in Mount <hi>Lycaeus,</hi> was compassed
in with a thick wood, <hi>condenso circumseptum luco,</hi> as <hi>Pausanias</hi>
hath it: so likewise, that <hi>Temple</hi> sacred to <hi>Him</hi> in the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi>
Forrest, according to the said Author. Now, this
<hi>Temple Stoneheng</hi> is sited in an open champion Countrey;
where scarce a bush or tree, much lesse thick woods, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
to be seen throughout the whole Plain; nor was
there ever any in times of old as History remembers, and the
nature of the soil, as I am informed, is no wise prosperous
for their growing there, as is sufficiently before declared.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Pan</hi> (say they) being the God of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> why might
not <hi>Stoneheng</hi> to gratifie them be erected, and consequently

                     <note place="margin">Dion. lib. 1.</note> of <hi>Halicarnassus</hi> tels us the <hi>Arcadians</hi> built the
aforesaid <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>Pan, idoneo invento loco &amp;c.</hi> when they
had found out a <hi>convenient place</hi> for it adjoyning to their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations:
the condition or nature of which place is not
unworthy your observation; for by his description thereof
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99064:82"/>
we shall easily perceive what manner of situation was
by the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Shepherds held proper for performing the
ceremonies of their God <hi>Pan.</hi> His words are, <hi>Erat tum, ut
fertur, spelunca sub tumulo magna, denso querceto contecta, &amp; sub
petris profundi fonticuli, sol√∫mque rupibus contiguum nemorosum, &amp;
frequentibus ac proceris opacum arboribus: ibi ara deo extructa, more
patrio sacra fecerunt. Under the Hill</hi> (to wit, Mount <hi>Palatine)
was anciently, as report goes</hi> (saith he) <hi>a great cave or den, covered
over by a thick grove, deep wells or riverets running amongst the stones
of the cave, and round about it a wood, by the many and tall trees
growing therein very dark and obscure: there the Altar of the God was
placed, and his Sacrifices after their Country manner performed.</hi>
Now is <hi>Stoneheng</hi> thus sited, or was there ever any such
like place near this <hi>Antiquity?</hi> of all the places in <hi>England</hi>
that I know, none comes nearer that cave, then <hi>Ochy-hole</hi> in
<hi>Somersetshire:</hi> And if the Ancients held such dismall situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
only proper for <hi>Pans Temples,</hi> then without perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<hi>Stoneheng</hi> was never erected in honour of him, they
being no innovators in their superstitions.</p>
                  <p>A further observation may be made to our purpose, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the aforesaid description, <hi>Erat tum antrum magnum, it was
anciently</hi> (saith <hi>Dionysius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dion. lib. 1.</note>) <hi>a great cave.</hi> But in his own time,
which was under <hi>Augustus,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> had so choked up
the place with building, that the manner how <hi>Pans Temple</hi>
in old time stood, was hardly to be discovered: <hi>nunc quidem
aedisiciis</hi> (saith he) <hi>fanum circumquaque sepientibus, difficilis conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctura
est qualis olim loci natura fuerit. At this present, verily,
the Temple being every way environed with buildings, it is
hardly to be conjectured in what manner of place it anciently
stood.</hi> This was the cause which enforced him to deliver
to posterity the former description meerly upon report.
Certainly then, the <hi>Romans</hi> employing the place to profaner
uses, <hi>Pans</hi> Deity was little esteemed by them; otherwise,
they would never have polluted it, by setting up private
houses upon the place consecrated to him. Now the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
slighting him after this manner at home, little reason
appears so magnificent a structure as <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> should be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99064:83"/>
erected by them for adoration of <hi>Pan</hi> in other Countreys.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the Sacrifices in times of old offered to
<hi>Pan</hi> were milk and honey, offered up in simple Shepherds
crocks or earthen pitchers: <hi>quare non rit√® sacrificabant, qui
tauros illi immolabant, aut qui in aureis poculis lac aut vinum offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebant
&amp;c. Wherefore, they sacrificed not aright,</hi> saith <hi>Natalis
Comes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nat. Com. lib. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>who immolated Buls or Oxen unto him, or out of golden cups
poured forth milk or wine upon his Altars;</hi> for goblets of that
metall were proper onely for the supernall and celestiall
<hi>Deities,</hi> not to terrestriall, and such as had care of Heards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
or Shepherd Swains. To which purpose also, the same
Author out of <hi>Apollonius Smyrnaeus</hi> remembers <hi>Pan,</hi> thus
speaking of himself.
<q>
                        <l>Sum Deus agrestis, cur his sunt aurea sacris</l>
                        <l>Pocula? quo vinum funditis Italicum?</l>
                        <l>Ad petram cur stat taurus cervice ligatus?</l>
                        <l>Parcite: non haec est victima grata mihi.</l>
                        <l>Pan montanus ego sum, ligneus, ips√°que vestis</l>
                        <l>Pellicea est: mustum √® fictilib√∫sque bibo.</l>
                     </q>
In English thus:
<q>
                        <l>A rurall God am I, in golden cup</l>
                        <l>The Falern wine, why then d'yee offer up?</l>
                        <l>Why at mine Altar, stands the stern Bull bound,</l>
                        <l>Or Oxe that's fat, with laurell girland crown'd?</l>
                        <l>Spare ye such cost: no gratefull victimes these</l>
                        <l>Are unto me, others lesse costly please.</l>
                        <l>A Mountaineer, a wood-man clad in skin</l>
                        <l>Am I: your wine in earthen vessels bring.</l>
                     </q>
But the Sacrifices anciently offered at <hi>Stoneheng</hi> (already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred)
were <hi>Buls</hi> or <hi>Oxen,</hi> and severall sorts of beasts,
as appears by the heads of divers kinds of them, not many
years since there digged up.</p>
                  <p>As for that of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> it is very well known the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi>
so called it, not in any relation to <hi>Pan,</hi> but because it
was sacred to <hi>Iove</hi> the <hi>Revenger,</hi> and according to others to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99064:83"/>
                     <hi>Cibele,</hi> and all Gods. For which reason, <hi>Boniface</hi> the fourth
obtained licence from the Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Platin. in Bon.</note> to consecrate it
to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and all Saints. And who knows not the
<hi>Architecture</hi> thereof wholly different from this of <hi>Stoneheng?</hi>
The <hi>Pantheon</hi> hath its <hi>Cell</hi> enclosed with a continued solid
wall, and the <hi>Portico</hi> only in front, of the delicate <hi>Corinthian
Order;</hi> of which <hi>Order</hi> the inner part consisted likewise,
being vaulted in most admirable and magnificent manner.
From whence <hi>Dion</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dion. lib. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>Cassius</hi> delivers his opinion, <hi>inde id nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
habere, qu√≤d forma convexa fastigiatum, coeli similitudinem
ostenderet, it to be called the</hi> Pantheon, <hi>because by the form of that
vault wherewith covered, it represented the concave of Heaven,</hi> or (as
others will) the figure of the world; for the world being
mans house, the firmament is as the vaulted roof thereof.
At the crown of the vault it had an opening, by which only
it received light and air. But, this <hi>Antiquity Stoneheng</hi> built
of a grave and humble <hi>Order</hi> (as is said before) had a
double <hi>Portico</hi> continuing round about it, the <hi>Cell</hi> thereof
free and open, and every way exposed to the air, received
light from all parts.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore leaving these, <hi>Stoneheng</hi> was dedicated, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
to the God <hi>Coelus,</hi> by some Authors called <hi>Coelum,</hi> by
others <hi>Uranus,</hi> from whom the Ancients imagined all things
took their beginning. My reasons are, First, in respect of
the <hi>situation</hi> thereof; for it stands in a Plain, remote from
any <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>Village,</hi> in a free and open air, without any
groves or woods about it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the <hi>Aspect;</hi> for <hi>Stoneheng</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
covered, but built without a roof. Which <hi>Decorum</hi> the
<hi>Romans</hi> ever observed, both in the <hi>Situation</hi> and <hi>Aspect</hi> of the
<hi>Temples</hi> dedicated to this their God, and to <hi>Iove</hi> the <hi>Lightner,</hi>
the <hi>Sun,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vitr. li. 1. cap. 2.</note> and the <hi>Moon. Iovi fulguratori, &amp; Coelo, &amp; Soli, &amp; Lunae,
aedisicia sub divo Hypaethr√°que constituuntur. To</hi> Jove <hi>the Lightner,
and to Coelus, and to the Sun, and to the Moon, they erected buildings
in the open air and uncovered,</hi> saith <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in the second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his first Book. Take with you also his reason. <hi>Horum
enim Deorum &amp; species &amp; effectus in aperto mundo atque lucenti
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99064:84"/>
praesentes videmus, because both the forms and effects of these Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
we behold present before our eyes, in a clear and open view.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason I find also why they built their Temples to <hi>Coelus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Godw. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. l. 1. cap. 20.</note>
and those other Deities uncovered as <hi>Stoneheng:</hi> because
they counted it an hainous matter to see those Gods confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
under a roof, whose doing good consisted in being
abroad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, in regard of the</hi> Form <hi>of</hi> Stoneheng, <hi>which is</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.<note place="margin">Pier. Valer. Hier. lib. 39.</note>
                     <hi>This figure was proper to the</hi> Temples <hi>of</hi> Coelus <hi>and</hi>
Tellus, <hi>whom the Ancients called</hi> Vesta, <hi>as</hi> Valerianus <hi>(in
his</hi> Hieroglyphicks) <hi>affirms.</hi> Non solamente la palla, ma una sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
piegatura di ruota, appresso gli Egizziani demostrava il Cielo.
Not only <hi>(saith he)</hi> the circular form, but the meer segment of a
circle amongst the Egyptians was an Hieroglyphick of Coelus. <hi>And
to this purpose also,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Leo Bapt. Alb. lib. 7.</note> Leo Baptista Albertus <hi>useth these words.</hi>
Aedem Vestae, quam esse terram putarent, rotundam ad pilae similitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem,
faciebant. Unto Vesta, whom they reputed to be the Earth,
they built Temples of a round form globelike. <hi>Besides, observe
what</hi> Philander <hi>commenting on</hi> Vitruvius <hi>tels us.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philand. in 4. lib. Vitr. cap. 7.</note> Templorum
quanquam alia fiant quadrata, alia multorum angulorum, Coeli natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
imitati veteres, imprimis rotundis sunt delectati: Although <hi>(saith
he)</hi> the Ancients made some Temples square, some of six sides, others
of many angles, they were especially delighted with making of them
round, as representing thereby the Form or Figure of <hi>Coelum,</hi>
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, in respect of the</hi> Order <hi>whereof</hi> Stoneheng <hi>built.
The severity of this</hi> Tuscane <hi>work, retaining in it a shew
(as it were) of that first face of</hi> Antiquity<note place="margin">An. Pal. li. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>(as</hi> A. Palladio <hi>terms
it) being most agreeable to the nature of this their God,
reputed the ancientest of all their</hi> Deities, <hi>and Father of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
<hi>For, it was the custome of the Ancients (as in part I
remembred before) to appropriate the severall</hi> Orders <hi>of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,
<hi>according to the particular qualifications of those
they deified.</hi> Minervae, &amp; Marti, &amp; Herculi, aedes Doricae fient:
his enim diis propter virtutem,<note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> sine deliciis aedificia constitui decet.
To Minerva, and Mars, and Hercules, Temples of the Dorick Order
were made; for, to these Deities in respect of their valiant actions, it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99064:84"/>
was requisite to build without delicacy. Veneri, Florae, Proserpinae,
Fontium Nymphis, Corinthio genere constitutae, aptas videbuntur ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere
proprietates, qu√≤d his diis propter teneritatem, graciliora &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida,
foli√≠sque &amp; volutis ornata opera facta augere videbuntur justum
decorem. To Venus, Flora, Proserpina, the Fountain Nymphs, the
Corinthian Order was thought most proper: because unto these in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their tender natures, the work seemed to advance a just deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
when made delicate and flourishing, and adorned with leaves and
volutes. Iunoni, Dianae, Libero Patri caeter√≠sque diis qui eadem sunt
similitudine, si aedes Ionicae construerentur, habita erat ratio mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,
quod &amp; ab severo more Doricorum, &amp; √† teneritate Corinthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
temperabitur earum institutio proprietatis. To Iuno, Diana,
Bacchus, and to the other Deities of the same quality, building Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Ionick Order, they had regard unto the mean, that from
the severe manner of the Dorick, and delicacy of the Corinthian, the
condition of their indowments might be duly moderated, <hi>saith</hi> Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.
<hi>To</hi> Iupiter, Sol, <hi>and</hi> Luna, <hi>though they made Temples
sub divo open to the air and without roofs like this</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; <hi>yet were they not built of severe and humble but
most delicate</hi> Orders, <hi>and accordingly were adorned with
costly ornaments, and beautified with various enrichments
in severall sorts of sculpture, as by the ruines of them in
divers parts of</hi> Italy <hi>remaining to this day, evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.
Respecting therefore, this</hi> Decorum <hi>used by the</hi> Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<hi>in building their</hi> Temples, <hi>and that this work</hi> Stoneheng
<hi>is principally composed of a most grave</hi> Tuscane <hi>manner, by
just proportions of an agreeable form; it is in mine opinion,
as I said before, most agreeable to the quality and condition
of that ancient</hi> Coelus, <hi>whom Antiquity reputed the very stem
whence all those Deities in the succeeding Ages proceeded.
Coelus</hi> ex eadem conjuge (scilicet Tellure) procreavit <hi>Oceanum,
Coelum, Hyperionem</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Apollod. lib. 1.</note> &amp; novissimum omnium <hi>Saturnum</hi>
suscepit. <hi>Coelus,</hi> by the same wise <hi>(to wit</hi> Tellus) had <hi>Oceanus,
Coelum, Hyperion</hi> &amp;c. and last of all begat <hi>Saturn. To which
purpose also</hi> Lactantius, I finde <hi>Uranius</hi> by his wife <hi>Vesta</hi> had
<hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Ops: Saturn</hi> attaining the government, called his father
<hi>Uranius, Coelus,</hi> and his mother <hi>Terra;</hi> that by this change of names,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99064:85"/>
he might the more magnifie the splendor of his originall &amp;c. <hi>Further,
I conceive it will not be impertinent to our purpose in
hand, to deliver what the</hi> Ancients <hi>have reported of</hi> Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;
<hi>and wherefore they ascribed divine Honours unto
Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to the <hi>Poets, Coelus</hi> was not that huge machine
adorned with stars, which <hi>Orpheus</hi> saith was composed for
habitation of the <hi>Planets,</hi> and other <hi>Deities,</hi> and which we
behold moving with continuall revolution: but a certain
man so called, son to <hi>Aether</hi> and <hi>Dies,</hi> that, <hi>is della virt√π ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente,
&amp; della luce famosa, of transcendent influence and resplendent
brightness,</hi> as <hi>Boccace</hi> hath it.<note place="margin">Boccace lib. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Historians, especially</hi> Diodorus<note place="margin">Dioder. lib. 4.</note> Siculus, <hi>it's thus delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
Scribunt prim√πm regnasse apud Atlantides <hi>Coelum:</hi> Homin√©s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
antea per agros dispersos, ad coetum, condend√°sque urbes exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum,
√† fera eos agrest√≠que vita ad mitiorem cultum extitisse &amp;c.
They write, he which first reigned over the <hi>Atlantides</hi> was <hi>Coelus,</hi> and
that he invited men living dispersedly before throughout the fields, to
convene, and dwell in companies together, exhorting them to build
Towns, and reducing them from wild and savage to the conversation
of civill life: Taught them also to sow corn and seeds, and divers
other things belonging to the common use of mankind; Ruled likewise
over a great part of the world from East to West; Was a diligent
observer of the stars, and foretold men divers things to come: The year
(before confus'd) bringing into Order, according to the course of the
Sun, reducing it also into moneths after the Moons course, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewise the severall seasons of the year. Whereby many ignorant
of the perpetuall course of the stars, and amazed at his future predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
did verily believe he participated of Divine Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after his death, as well for benefits received from him, as great
knowledge of the stars, they conferred on him immortall honours, and
adored him as a God. And, as appears, called <hi>Coelus</hi> in regard of his
skill in the celestiall bodies, as also, for divers other causes eternall
King of all the world. <hi>Thus</hi> Diodorus. <hi>It being an ordinary cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
among the Heathens to deifie, and esteem for
Gods, such excellent personages, as either had well ruled,
or governed them, or done any notable thing among

them to their especiall benefit, or good liking. Such,
were they men, or women, remained with the name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and reverence of</hi> Gods <hi>or</hi> Goddesses <hi>after their
deaths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, according to the <hi>Philosophers; Men</hi> (they
knew not how) by nature soon wanting, and by instinct
as soon seeking some God (in stead of apprehending bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
deified the <hi>best</hi> to sense. Whereupon, out of all <hi>Entities</hi>
as most glorious to the eye, they first made choice of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and <hi>Heavenly</hi> bodies;<note place="margin">Plu<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Phil. opin. lib. 1.</note> considering again, as the most
beneficiall objects, those living creatures, and fruits which
the <hi>Earth</hi> beneath brought forth, to make compleat genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they coupled <hi>Coelus</hi> to <hi>Tellus,</hi> adoring <hi>Heaven</hi> as Father,
and <hi>Earth</hi> as Mother to these; the pouring down of show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from <hi>Heaven</hi> seeming in stead of naturall seeds, and
the <hi>Earth</hi> as a Mother to conceive, and bring forth the
same.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Sacrifices in times of old offered to <hi>Coelus</hi>
were Bulls or Oxen, their great God <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself, as I find
in <hi>Rosinus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rosin. lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> offering such Victimes unto him. <hi>Ante pugnam,

in</hi> Crete, <hi>they say</hi> Jupiter <hi>sacrificed an Oxe to</hi> Sol, Coelus, <hi>and</hi>

anciently in that place sacrificed; I need not again
remember, being it is so well known.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, all the upright stones in this <hi>Antiquity</hi> are <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midall</hi>

alla materia &amp; esca, da che si pasce, finisce in acuta fiamma che
riguardo al Cielo. Because, being large at the bottome, in respect of the
matter and fewell, by which it is fed, it finishes in an acute flame
tending upwards towards Heaven.</hi> And, that the Heavens are
adorned with fires, <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> in his Mythology, out of
<hi>Orpheus,</hi> makes apparent. <hi>Nihil aliud esse Coelum existimans, nisi
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99064:87"/>
hunc aethera qui constat ex altissimis illis ignibus. Supposing the
Heaven to be no other thing, but this Air which consisteth of those
transcendent Fires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, that <hi>Stoneheng</hi> was anciently dedicated to <hi>Coelus</hi>
I collect from the <hi>Conformation</hi> of the work. For the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
of the <hi>Cell</hi> and <hi>Porticus</hi> in the Plant, was designed
with four equilaterall <hi>Triangles,</hi> inscribed in a <hi>Circle,</hi> such
as the <hi>Astrologers</hi> use in describing the twelve <hi>celestiall</hi> signs
in musicall proportions.<note place="margin">Vitr. lib. 5.</note> According to that of <hi>Vitruvius; In
ea conformatione quatuor scribantur trigona paribus lateribus &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallis,
quae extremam lineam circinationis tangant; In the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
thereof, let four triangles be inscribed of equall sides and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
which may touch the extreme part of the circumference: quibus
etiam in duodecim signorum coelestium descriptione, Astrologi ex mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sica
convenientia astrorum ratiocinantur; by which figures also, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers
from the musicall harmony of the stars ground their reasonings,
as concerning the description of the twelve celestiall signs.</hi> Besides
the <hi>Cell</hi> it self in the formation thereof, is cast into an <hi>Exagon,</hi>
one of the three figures, likewise used by <hi>Astrologers</hi> in their
aforesaid arguments of the <hi>sympathy</hi> of the stars. <hi>Figuris tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
(saith <hi>Philander) utuntur Astrologi, Trigono, Tetragono &amp; Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gono.
The Astrologers make use of three sorts of figures; the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,
Tetragon, and Hexagon.</hi> Furthermore, the three entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
leading into the Temple from the Plain, were compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by an equilaterall <hi>triangle;</hi> which was the figure
whereby the Ancients expressed what appertained to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and divine mysteries also. <hi>Aggiungono i Magi</hi> (saith <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Valerianus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pier. Valer. Hier. lib. 39.</note>) <hi>che un triangolo semplice di lati uguali, √® indizio di
divinit√†, overo effigie di cose celesti. The</hi> Magi <hi>adde that a triangle
of equall sides is a symbole of Divinity, or sign of celestiall matters.</hi>
Now this <hi>Antiquity</hi> consisting of severall stones, orderly
disposed into one entire work, in imitation, as it were, of
those severall stars which appearing to us in the Heavens
in form of a circle, are called the <hi>celestiall Crown;</hi> and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
designed by those <hi>Scheams</hi> wherewith <hi>Astrologers</hi> use to
describe <hi>celestiall</hi> bodies; which figures, usually applied
by them to particular accidents onely, being all joyntly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99064:87"/>
made use of by the <hi>Architect</hi> for conformation of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
structure, it is not improbable <hi>Stoneheng</hi> was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
because dedicated to <hi>Coelum.</hi> Yea further, (if lawfull
to compare an idolatrous place with so divine a work) was
not the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> adorned with the figures of
<hi>Cherubims,</hi> that thereby the Nations of the Earth might
know it was the habitation of the living God? and, why
not in like manner this <hi>Temple</hi> composed by <hi>Astrologicall</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
that after Ages might apprehend, it was anciently
consecrated to <hi>Coelus</hi> or <hi>Coelum</hi> Heaven?</p>
                  <p>But in this conjuncture; concerning such kinde of
<hi>Temples</hi> as this at <hi>Stoneheng,</hi> what saith the learned <hi>Patriarch</hi>
of <hi>Aquileia?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. Barba. in lib. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Io credo, che quel Tempio senza parete significava al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cune
cose del Cielo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vitr. cap. 7. in Ven. 1584.</note> 
                     <hi>gli effetti delle quali sono nello scoperto. I beleeve
that Temple without walls</hi> (speaking of the <hi>Monopteros</hi> aforesaid)
<hi>had a relation to</hi> Coelum (<hi>Heaven) because the effects thereof are
openly displaied to the full view of all men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Camden</hi> tels us he had heard, that in the time of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the eighth, a table of metall was found, not far from this
<hi>Antiquity,</hi> engraven with divers strange characters, which
being not legible, was neglected and lost: had, indeed, that
Table been found within the work it self it might happily
have brought to light somwhat in relation to <hi>Stoneheng.</hi>
And by all likelihood, in time some inscriptions may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
be found, it being the custome as well of <hi>Greeks</hi> as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
in times of greatest <hi>Antiquity,</hi> to lay inscriptions (usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
under the first stones set in what works soever; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
those of any great magnificence. Wherefore, I advise
mine honoured Friend <hi>Laurence Washington</hi> Esquire in
whose demeasnes this <hi>Antiquity</hi> stands, to whom I am much
obliged, for his friendly notice of what things have been
there of late years digged up, that he would be solicitous
upon any search made there, to enquire after them, and if
any found not to neglect, or curiously conceal them, but
preserve and willingly produce the same.</p>
                  <p>I suppose, I have now proved from Authentick Authors,
and the rules of Art, <hi>Stoneheng</hi> anciently a <hi>Temple,</hi> dedicated
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99064:88"/>
to <hi>Coelus,</hi> built by the <hi>Romans;</hi> either in, or not long after
those times (by all likelihood) when the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles
spreading their commanding wings over this <hi>Island,</hi> the
more to civilize the Natives, introduc'd the <hi>Art</hi> of Building
amongst them, discovering their ambitious desire, by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
and prodigious works, to eternize the memory
of their high minds to succeeding Ages. For, the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of that stately <hi>Empire,</hi> is at this day clearly visible in
nothing more, then in the ruines of their <hi>Temples, Palaces,
Arch's Triumphals, Aquaeducts, Thermae, Theaters, Amphitheaters,
Cirques,</hi> and other secular, and sacred structures.</p>
                  <p>History affords only <hi>Contemplation,</hi> whereby their great
Actions are made conceivable alone to reasoning: but the
ruines of their buildings <hi>Demonstration,</hi> which obvious to
sense, are even yet as so many eye-witnesses of their admir'd
atchievements.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Roma</hi> quanta fuit, ipsa ruina docet,</l>
                        <l>How great <hi>Rome</hi> was, her ruines yet declare.</l>
                     </q>
Opinions fancied to the contrary, I have rendred impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
the Authors of them in respect of this <hi>Antiquity</hi> being
not only modern; but also, what said by them <hi>Romance</hi>-like
hatched out of their own brains,<note place="margin">Camd. fo. 8.</note> even as other fables
invented by them, touching the <hi>Britains</hi> of old. Men possest
neverthelesse, with a former conceit of things, endure not
by any means new opinions, having not commonly pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to search long after the truth thereof. To them, ever
the more generally received, the truer things seem, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all of their own time despicable; insomuch, as some
are so far in love with vulgarly receiv'd reports, that it
must be taken for truth, whatsoever related by them, though
nor head, nor tail, nor foot, nor footstep in it oftentimes of
reason or common sense. They that beleeve <hi>Geffrey Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouths
ipse dixit,</hi> may make themselves merry therewith; in
pleasing their own fancy, they displease not mine. As I
have delivered my own judgement freely, all reason they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99064:88"/>
should enjoy theirs. But such as sail in the vast Ocean of
time, amongst the craggy rocks of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> steering their
course, betwixt anciently approved customs, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
arguments, guided by good Authority, and sound
judgement, arrive much safer, and with better repute, in
the secure Haven of undoubted <hi>Truth.</hi> For mine own part,
I had rather erre happily with venerable <hi>Antiquity,</hi> then so
much as trouble my thoughts with modern conceits.
Whether, in this adventure, I have wafted my Barque into
the wished <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Truths</hi> discovery concerning <hi>Stoneheng,</hi>
I leave to the judgement of skilfull <hi>Pilots.</hi> I have endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
at least, to give life to the attempt, trending perhaps,
to such a degree, as either may invite others to undertake
the Voyage anew, or prosecute the same in more ample
manner, in which, I with them their desired successe, and
that with prosperous gales they may make a more full
and certain discovery.</p>
