         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I tolde him that matter would be soone amended, if he wanted pence, to leaue a pawne for his breakfast: The man hearing me say so: answered, my counsaile was better then my charity, and yet (quoth he) your charity may be better then my pawne: for I assure you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> suppose you have more to giue, then I have to gage: and yet yesterday, I had as much money as would fill a quart potte, if my wisedome had boene so good to keepe it: Certainly (said I) he that would spend so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, and so much in one day, without any regard, in my opinion is worthy so fast the next day without pitty: So sir,
<pb facs="tcp:11206:3"/>
I have your iudgement already (quoth he:) it is pitty you should be made a Iustice of peace, that can examine a cause no better: If you had asked me how I had spent so much money in so short a time, and how much the sum had béene, you had shewen some wit: but to pronounce me prodigall at the first dash, for so trifling a cause, argues in deede a man of smnall discretion. Why qd. he, is not he to be blamde, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a thristlesse waster, that spends the quantity of a quart of money at one day: if you had gamde it away, it had béene an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other matter, because I know it a thing soone done, and you not so much to be blamed: for that a man cannot commaund the dice as he may his dogge, to say, sira fetch me the same againe?

I seeing him feede so hartely, said if his legs were as good as his stomacke he needed not to feare his journey to <hi>Plimmoth</hi>: so at length being well refresht, I tould him that according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise I would pay for his breakfast, but he should pay for the two penny loaues in his pocket: By the masse (quoth he) I am perswaded your purse is better linde then mine, not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

In his attire, he is neat and fine, and in his speech stately, with a long piccade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant after the French cut, and of a scornefull countenance, and when he comes into Westm. hall, he bends his browes, as if he would beare downe the Kinges Bench barre with his lookes.

I pray you let me heare that (qd. <hi>Freeman</hi>) for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties bréedes most delight. It is so, qd. <hi>Goodcole</hi> as you know, that Newgate being a prison for all kind of fellons, and other mallefactors, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly replenished with more store, then any other prison in England, by reason ef the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulacie and great number of lewde persons, that lurke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the citie of London: which these good knights looking into, and smelling out what great profite might be gotten by them, sought meanes to come acquainted with certaine cutpursses and other pilfering companions, such indéede, as can not forbeare once in a quarter at the least, to weare a paire of shackels in Newgate: and sée their good fortune, it was their chaunce to be in company vpon a time, where one of cutpursse hall made great mone for a friende of his that was clapt vp vpon suspition, a proper youth qd. hee and of good parentage, &amp; falling in badde company, was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended with the rest as a partner of their practises: and yet I may say to you, the youth is well knowne to diuers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Captaines, for a proper fellow, and an excellent Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and such an one as hath serued her Maiestie both in
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> yet to sée his hard destinie, he is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come after all his credite gotten in the fielde, to suffer shame in his owne Countrie: and I promise you I feare he will

hardly escape death. Alas poore fellow, qd. the knight of the poste, hath he no friendes in the Citie that will doe somewhat for him, and bayle him forth till the Sessions come: he hath many friendes qd the other, but he is ashamed to make the matter knowne to them, fearing it shoulde come to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes eares: which he would not for an hundred pounds, What qd. the K. hath he any thing to helpe himselfe withal? In troth qd. the other, he hath small store of money, but he hath good thinges to make money of. Why what would he giue qd. they, to such as would procure his libertie and set him out of danger, mary qd. the other he would giue foure Angels withal his heart, in troth qd. they for sixe Angels, we will for your sake finde meanes to fetch him forth: and put in good sufficient men to be sureties for his appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at the next assises, but wée will haue our money readie to bee paid: but wil not receiue one penny before we haue done it, you speak like honest men qd. the other: I will thus much presume, though without my friendes knowledge, that you shall haue sixe Angels or thrée poundes in white money, so soone as it is done: therefore I would wish you goe about it straight: and because I know, you cannot trot about without expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there is for a pottle of wine, and with that he throweth them downe a shilling: desiring them to tell him where hée should méete them at euening or in the morning: the place being appointed, &amp; themselues with all circumstances pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, dressing themselues very handsomly, to a I. they go, if he chaunce not to be within, then they trudge to another, and doe not rest till they speake with one or other. And thus with a very graue looke, and duetifull obedience they begin to speake in this sort. We are come to intreat your good Worship for a poore young man that is in prison, one that is come of very honest parents though he be farre from them, who by méere chaunce, lighting in company of some lewde persons, was with them committed to Newgate, where the poore young man, hauing béene tenderly brought vp. through the weakenesse of his owne nature, and the noysome smell
