            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Second Letter
TO
Mr. MILES PRANCE,
In REPLY to the
GHOST
OF
Sir Edmond-bury Godfrey.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. <hi>PRANCE,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce my laſt to you of the 23 paſt, I have
ſeen a prolix, railing, and impertinent
Pamphlet, intituled, Sir <hi>E. B. G</hi>'s. Ghoſt,
and pretended to be an Anſwer to my
ſaid Letter. And conceiving You are better
acquain<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed with Ghoſts than my ſelf, I thought
fit to direct my Anſwer to that Ghoſt to You,
and thereby ſhew the ridiculouſneſs thereof, as
alſo vindicate the Truths contained in my ſaid
former Letter, and ſhew You and the world
further circumſtances to juſtifie the ſame, and
therefore, according to the method of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Letter, I ſhall proceed by theſe Heads.</p>
            <p>And firſt, not underſtanding what the Ghoſt
means, by arraigning the Juſtice of the Nation,
unleſs he would aſſert that all that are legally,
(are likewiſe juſtly hanged;) and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that the Mother and her two Sons
were ju<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tly hanged in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> for the
Murder of the Lady Viſcounteſs <hi>Campden</hi>'s
Steward, though he afterwards appeared alive;
And I do not find that ever his appearance ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd
the Juſtice of the Nation And remitting
the conſideration of Mr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owns,</hi> the Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Mrs <hi>Curtis</hi>'s Evidence in relation to the
Blood, to its proper place; and affirming, (as
the truth is,) that Mrs. <hi>Celliers,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mary
Gibbon</hi> the <hi>Newgate</hi> Prieſts, <hi>James Magragh,</hi>
and all other <hi>Iriſh</hi> men, or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evidences, or
other Papiſt or Papiſts, or Popiſhly affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
whatſoever; as alſo thoſe concerned in the
late Sham of his having hang'd himſelf, are
ſtrangers to, and had not the leaſt knowledge
or intimation of the Contents of my ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Letter, nor any way concerned therein, or
in or with any part thereof; (as the ſaid Ghoſt
moſt falſly and maliciouſly inſinuates.) I take
notice that the ſaid Ghoſt ſeems to admit ſo
much of the truth of the ſaid Letter, as that
it was reported divers days before the dead
Body was found, that he was murdered in
<hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi> by the Papiſts, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
was made even the next morning after he
was miſſing, (being Sunday 13 <hi>Octob.</hi> 1678)
Now I would fain have this Ghoſt to inform the
world who firſt raiſed that Report: But as to
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Letter of it I cannot give it any
better Anſwer, than that as his Evidence hath
ſince been disbelieved in matters of greater
conſequence, ſo he not producing any ſuch
Letter, you muſt give me leave alſo to ſuſpect
him in this. But as to the other Evidences of
Mr. <hi>Birch</hi> and the reſt, Theirs I believe to be
very true; for it's no miracle that a Report ſo
cunningly raiſed, (without any ground) might
as induſtriouſly be promulged to moſt parts of
the Kingdom before the reſpective days they
ſpeak of, eſpecially when the Plot had filled all
mens heads with Fears and Jeolouſies, without
which it had not been in the power or art of the
Ghoſt, or any of his Tribe, to have ſuggeſted
the leaſt Surmiſe to contradict his being <hi>Felo
de ſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61689:2"/>
Next, whereas my Letter ſaith, (and that
truly) that the Coroner's Jury were firſt of
opinion, and accordingly declared, he was <hi>Felo
de ſe,</hi> and that much Art and Skill was uſed
to procure their Verdict to the contrary. This
Ghoſt, inſtead of contradicting that Truth,
would inſinuate, as if that Letter reflected upon
the Reputation of the Jurors, when as there
was no ſuch thing imply'd or intended, they
being known to be honeſt men, of good Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and free from Fraud or Guile, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the eaſier to be over-reach'd, by the
Cunning of thoſe and that Party, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
it was to deceive them, and who never
leave any ſtone unturned to attain their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
And I cannot but obſerve how skilful
and induſtrious theſe People ſtill are, to hide
and prevent the truth of that man's Death
from clearly appearing and ſhining forth, as
without doubt it would, and muſt do, was not
the matter now (as formerly) puzled with
Legends, and long Stories, nothing to the
purpoſe And as to the Coroner's Warrant for
burying the Body, and recited in the Ghoſt, it's
Notorious they are common Tricks, uſed by
men of his Profeſſion, who (if any money is
like to come) will uſually adjourn the Jury,
and then make ſuch Warrants, (they knowing,
that if the Verdict be <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> it's then out
of their power to give leave to bury the Corps.)
And it would be very material, if the Coroner
would declare what he received for that Jobb,
and of whom, and what Evidence he had to
induce the Jury to find (as the Inquiſition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports)
that he was ſtrangled with a Linen
Cloth, a matter of Fact never ſo much as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, until You came in with your Evidence,
which was not in ſome weeks after. And I do
again aver, That the Body was required by
the Jurors to be opened, and was refuſed; and
if the Body was in their and the Coroner's
power, (as the Ghoſt inſinuates) ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was concealed from, and denied the Jury.
And it's very probable the Coroner of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>'s
aſſiſtance was refuſed, for ſome ſuch
indirect doings, for that there was not the leaſt
difference betwixt the Coroners in relation to
their Juriſdictions, and the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Coroner
came not voluntarily of himſelf, but was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
to be there by Mr. <hi>Wigg,</hi> and divers
others of the chief Inhabitants of St: <hi>Martyn</hi>'s
Pariſh. And particularly, the Reverend Dr.
<hi>Lloyd</hi> (who preached the Funeral Sermon)
ſpoke to the Coroner of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> before he
went, ſo that it had been proper to have given
the matters mentioned in that Sermon in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
before the Jury. And it's obſervable, the
perſon mentioned to give the Information to
the Doctor of the two wounds in the Body,
and that two hours before it was found, was
never produced; For if he had, and that Sir
<hi>E. B. G.</hi> had been murthered, ſuch perſon
might have been ſecured, and thereby the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
detected. But I ſuppoſe the Ghoſt will
not pretend either that Sermon, or the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
printed by <hi>Nat. Thompſon</hi> to be legal, or
(indeed) any Evidence at all.</p>
            <p>And now, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> being come to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Paragraphs of my Letter, I ſhall take
them in order as they are placed, and give the
Ghoſt particular Anſwers accordingly.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi>'s Perambulations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mentioned to be on the Saturday he was firſt
miſſing, they are true in every particular, and
will be proved by divers able, credible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Witneſſes. And how vain it is for the
Ghoſt to ask, Why theſe Witneſſes did not
come in ſooner at the Tryal of <hi>Greene, Berry</hi>
and <hi>Hill,</hi> do you judge, when all the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
the great Torrent that carried all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it in favour of the Plot, and the murder of
Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> by the Papiſts, without which (as
<hi>T. O.</hi> was heard to ſay) his Plot had failed; And
when it is duly conſidered, that the two perſons
that firſt found the Body, (for no other cauſe)
ſuffered much in their Perſons and Eſtates, by
a long and chargeable Impriſonment. And all
others that then ſeemed to doubt of the truth
of that man's being murdered by the Papiſts,
were ſtigmatized with the odious Names of
Papiſts, and Diſcouragers (if not Promoters)
of the Plot; It will appear no wonder, if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were unwilling to diſcover their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
or to come voluntarily (without proceſs)
to give their Evidence. And how can it be
imagined thoſe three unfortunate men, being
kept cloſe Priſoners, could make inquiry after
proper Evidences, or (againſt the common
vogue) draw into ſuſpition the aſſertion of his
being murdered by the Papiſts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Ghoſt hath ſo much ingenuity to
grant the 2d Paragraph of my Letter, as to the
place and poſture he was found in, but would
avoid the inacceſſableneſs of the place, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
a Lane near, when as that Lane is, in
effect, unpaſſable, with two on a Horſe, and
comes not within 500 yards of the place, and
the Mounds thither very high, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
and his Aſſiſtants, (though they lived in
the Pariſh, and well knew the way) were forced
to break a Gap in the Mounds, though they
were ſingly Hors'd. And whereas the Ghoſt
alledges, That you do not depoſe he was
carried to the place wholly on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
he hath run himſelf into a worſe
Dilemma, having made no proviſion of men
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61689:3"/>
(either as to ſtrength or number) to carry ſo
great and weighty a Corps, in the dead of the
night, over ſuch Mounds and Fences; But let
all inquiſitive People, deſirous of Truth, take
the pain, but to go to the place (and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any burthen on their backs) they will ſoon
be convinced of the Aſſertion of the difficulty
(if not impoſſibility) of the bringing a Dead
Corps thither, either on Foot or on Horſeback.
And the pretenſions of the Ghoſt's, as to the
limberneſs of the Body and Joynts, does not
anſwer that part of my Letter which relates to
the impoſſibility of his being put into a <hi>Sedan.</hi>
For his Body, when found, was ſtiff; ſo that
what limberneſs happened or appeared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
hath no relation to the Queſtion. For
it's a certain Maxim, a dead limber Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſtiff'ned. And pray, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> give
us an account what became of the <hi>Sedan,</hi> and
the Cords? and how you could carry it with
Cords; for the meaneſt Sedan-man in Town
will tell you it is impracticable, or rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible;
And you may, if you pleaſe, make
an experiment with a Cord.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As to the Body being full of Bloud, when
found; the Ghoſt endeavours to diſprove that
Aſſertion, by the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> the
Conſtable, the two Chyrurgeons and Mrs. <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſs,</hi>
and produceth the Evidence given at the
Tryal of <hi>Green, Berry</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> and an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
Affidavit ſince made by Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi>
and another by Mrs. <hi>Curtiſs,</hi> to countenance
ſuch his denyal. But, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> (when you
ſee the Ghoſt) tell him the matter of the
Bloud will (and I aſſure you and all the world
it will) be proved by divers credible and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Evidence; And that I may pacifie the
Ghoſt in the mean time, he is to underſtand that
Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> the two Chyrurgeons, and Mrs.
<hi>Curtiſs,</hi> are no competent (nor can be mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial)
Witneſſes in this caſe. For Mr. <hi>Brown;</hi>
as he did a raſh and unaccountable act (to
give it no worſe name) in removing the Body
before the Coroner and Jury ſaw it, (which
hath occaſion'd all this diſpute;,) ſo he muſt
not think to help himſelf by Affidavits, or to
juſtifie one Ill Act by another; And beſides, as
he unadviſedly (and contrary to all Law and
Practice) removed the Body before the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Jury came; ſo he did the ſame in the
dark, (about Eight a clock at night) when the
Candle was blown out; whereby it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to look for any Bloud, ſo as to
find it; And neither he or the Chyrurgeons (by
any day-light) ſaw the place where the Body
was found, or where the Sword was pulled
out, until after 10 a Clock the next day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which time much of the Bloud was taken
up, and the reſt trampl'd out of ſight by the
great concourſe of the People which came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And as for Mrs. <hi>Curtiſs,</hi> ſhe only ſaw the
Body after it was brought home, when
as the Body was ſtript at the <hi>White-Houſe,</hi> and
a Blanket borrow'd there to wrap the Body in,
So the world may judge of the Truth of her
Affidavit. But (Mr <hi>Prance</hi>) it will be fully
proved, that the Body was full of Bloud; and
that the<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were Cakes or Gobbets of dry Bloud
found in his Cloaths, which (with his Body)
ſtunk extremely. And it will be alſo fully and
effectually proved, that his Eyes, Noſtrils, and
Corners of his Mouth, were Fly blown; tho'
the Ghoſt (without the leaſt colour of reaſon)
pretends it to be contrary to Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
when as common experience daily evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the contrary. And I do obſerve, that the
Ghoſt omits to take notice of Two material
Circumſtances in this 3 <hi>d.</hi> Paragraph, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
The firſt as to the Swords craſhing againſt the
Back-bone: The ſecond, as to that part of the
Sword which was in his Body being diſcolou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And pray, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> do You (or the
Ghoſt) give the reaſons thereof, and of its
Point being Ruſty; As alſo, what was, or could
be the cauſe of the Spots in the Shirt, Waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat
and Drawers, of Greeniſh Colour, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Mrs. <hi>Curtiſſes</hi> Affidavit.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As to the <hi>4th.</hi> Paragraph of my Letter,
I perceive the Ghoſt admits, that when a man
is Strangled or Hanged, his Eyes will be extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and admits, that Sir <hi>E. B. Godfrey</hi>'s Eyes
(when found) were ſhut; only he ſeems to
quarrel with the colour of his Face; And, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he admits his Face not Black (as all Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
mens are, when cold) I care not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
whether his Face was Pale or Ruddy, or
a little Swell'd, or not, thoſe being very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Circumſtances. But his denying the
putrefaction charged in that Paragraph, and
the conſequences deduced from thence, is not
only a great untruth, but is directly oppoſite to
the Evidence given by Mr. <hi>Skillard,</hi> at the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
before mentioned. <hi>Page</hi> 37, 38.</p>
            <p n="5">V. As to the <hi>5th.</hi> Paragraph; The Ghoſt is
ſo far from anſwering the Aſſertions therein,
as that he only quibbles at words; and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Queſtion, deduces thence impertinent
and ridiculous Arguments. For it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that his Shoes were glazed at the bottom
of the Soles, and which muſt of neceſſity be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by his walking on the Graſs. And (Mr.
<hi>Prance</hi>) if you and the Ghoſt will walk thither,
you will eaſily experience it, and ſo may any
body elſe ſatisfie himſelf in this ſpeculation;
As alſo, as to the Graſs-ſeeds that ſtuck in the
ſeams of his Shoes; which is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impoſſible at that time of the year, (as the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61689:4"/>
Ghoſt would argue) as that it will be proved
by undeniable Evidence. But (Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi>)
pray ask the Ghoſt how he came there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſpeck of Dirt? and who pick'd the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hairs
off his Cloaths; and let him contrive (if
he can) a probable or rational way for a Dead
Man on Horſe-back. to hold up his Legs, or to
ſave them or his Cloaths from the dirt: For
though a man may walk thither very clean, yet
it<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s impoſſible at that time of the year to ride,
either without being dirtied and ſome Horſe
hairs ſticking on his Cloaths: But perhaps the
next account from the Ghoſt will be, that he
either rid with Gambadoes, or elſe a pair of
Fiſher-mens Boots.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. As to the ſixth Paragraph, Pray Mr.
<hi>Prance</hi> tell the Ghoſt, his railing againſt Popiſh
Nurſes and Popiſh Midwives is no anſwer to
the Aſſertions in that Paragraph: for all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Town are competent Judges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and I hope the Ghoſt will not ſay they are
all Papiſts. But pray tell the Ghoſt he takes
no notice of the heighth of the Collar, and its
being faſt button'd about his Neck when found.
Nor the concluſion of that Paragraph; and
therefore I ſuppoſe he admits it to be all true.</p>
            <p n="7">VII And as to the 7 and laſt Paragraph, which
relates only to the difference betwixt Yours,
and Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Evidence; I muſt take notice,
that what You and He ſwear, are very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory,
and much more than I hinted in my
ſaid Letter: And though part of it be as He and
You were informed, yet You and He ſwear the
Informations were received from the Perſons
actually concerned in the Murder, and who
had confidence enough in Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> (though
he refuſed <hi>4000l</hi> to help to kill him, and <hi>2000l</hi>
to help carry him away,) as to ſhew him the
dead Body, and ſo were under no temptation
of miſ-informing either him or your ſelf. And
pray Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> will You let the world know
what reward You were to have for that Job:
For certainly You deſerved as much as Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
and needed more, you having a Wife and
Children, and he a Batchelor.</p>
            <p>Thus, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> having gone through each
Paragraph of my Letter, and anſwered the
Ghoſt to your ſatisfaction; I ſhould leave here,
fearing I have been too tedious already: But
I cannot omit to take further notice of Mrs.
<hi>Curtis</hi>'s Affidavit, in relation to the drops of
Wax found upon the Cloaths, in which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay but ſhe may ſwear true; but this I do
aver, that if it be ſo, thoſe drops were put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cloaths long after he was found, and
after the Jury had ſat on the Body; for there
was no ſuch thing then on the Cloaths: And I
ſuppoſe this was ſome Artifice uſed by thoſe,
who, either out of Intereſt or Deſign, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to confirm his being murthered at <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-houſe,</hi>
and to carry on the great lie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
ſtory then invented, and given out
(amongſt others,) that he was laid under the
High Altar there; And if my Information fail
not, there were other ſuch like tricks uſed,
which I ſhall make bold to acquaint thoſe more
nearly concerned therein, than your ſelf; and
ſhall give them to underſtand, that it's no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a man in Sir <hi>E. B. G</hi>'s circumſtances, ſhould
kill himſelf, ſuch accidents being no News to
that Family, wherein Melancholly and Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
(that often produces ſuch effects.) hath
been predominant, and might occaſion the
words he ſpake to Sir <hi>Tho. Robinſon,</hi> as to his
being the firſt Martyr.</p>
            <p>And now, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> for a Concluſion, If
you were guilty of the murder of Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi>
how durſt you (as you did) on the Friday after
he was found, go to <hi>Primroſe-Hill</hi> to ſee the
Body, and not be afraid it ſhould at your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
have bled afreſh? And how came you
(after <hi>Green, Bury,</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> were hanged,) to
declare in anſwer to a ſolemn Queſtion, that
you knew nothing of the death of Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi>
Pray remember me to your old Friend and
Lodger Mr. <hi>Renn,</hi> My Reſpects alſo to your
Wife, not forgetting your little Daughter, who
gave you ſo good advice before you took your
Journey into <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and help'd to
take <hi>Beddingfield,</hi> who was bury'd 14 months.</p>
