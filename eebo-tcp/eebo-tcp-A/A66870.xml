            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The first

Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:63883:3"/>

which the Answer
Here set down was
Then given by the

whole is now made

and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
about this

thereupon.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N incapacity for
the ends of
marriage, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to it,
makes a Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the marriage upon a
subsequent discovery of it.
This needs no determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by any positive Law;
For the Law of Nature,
and the reason of the thing
it self gives an universal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63883:5"/>
of it every
where.</p>
            <p>By the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastity
before Marriage or
contraction (if concealed)
and all unchastity after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
or Marriage, was to
be punished with death, and
no mention made in the Law
of any such thing as Divorce
in that Case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> in the 24th of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy,</hi>
gave This allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for Divorce, <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2.
When a man hath taken a
Wife, and Marryed her, and
it come to pass that she find
no favour in his eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath found some
uncleanness in her: Then
let him write her a Bill of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63883:5"/>
Divorcement, and give it in
her hand, and send her out
of his house; And when
she is departed out of his
house, she may go and be
another mans wife; which
was but an allowance in
some Cases, and in those too
did rather <hi>liberare à Poena</hi>
than a <hi>Vitio.</hi> We need
not inquire farther why this
was done: our Saviour has
given us a perfect account
of it; such a permission
was granted to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the hardness of
their hearts, and the unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stubborn behaviour of
the Jews towards their
Wives in that particular.
<hi>Moses,</hi> who we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63883:6"/>
as a Legislator to a
State, as well as a Church,
suffered it to be, as the most
tolerable remedy that That
people were capable of, and
in favour chiefly of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This permission of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>came in the practice of
it to be so far extended
amongst them, that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
desired to put away his
Wife, was allowed to do
it without giving any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at all, besides his own
pleasure why he did it.
This we may see in
Mr.</hi> Selden'<hi>s</hi> Vxor Haebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica;
<hi>and</hi> Grotius <hi>tells us,</hi>
Quod Consuetudo legis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpres

            <p>Our Saviour in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
before the Pharisees
asked him any Question
about this matter, (which
they did, and their Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and his answer is set
down in the 19th. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
and the 10th. of <hi>Mark)</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63883:7"/>
determines it in the 5th. of
<hi>Matthew</hi> in his Sermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Mount, there being
indeed nothing wherein
That people needed more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
than in That
particular; His words are
<hi>verse</hi> the 31; <hi>It hath been
said, whosoever shall put
away his Wife, let him give
her a Writing of Divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
And verse the 32.
But I say unto you, <hi>that
whosoever shall put away
his Wife, saving for the
cause of Fornication, caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her to commit Adultery
and whosoever shall marry
her that is Divorced, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
Adultery.</hi> By this
it is plain, that whatsoever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63883:8"/>
toleration they had from
<hi>Moses</hi> about putting away
their Wives, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
farther liberty they
took to themselves in That
matter, it is totally repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and condemned, and no
cause of divorce and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away allowed to be
good, but in case of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Unchastity.</p>
            <p>There ariseth this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
from the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Saviour's words;
whether he he did thereby
intend to institute a new
Law in the Case; or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he only spake Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively
with reference
to the Law of God Then
in being. Those who are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63883:8"/>
inclined to think he did
institute a New Law, urge
it from hence, That our
Saviour speaks of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Unchastity as a
ground, and the only ground
of Divorce, which by the
Law had another punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
appointed for it, and
such a one as made Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
impossible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable,
for they were
to be put to death that
were so found guilty, and
of That Law, our Saviour
takes no notice; say they,
the punishment the Law
appointed to be inflicted for
Fornication and Adultery,
and the direction our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
gives about it cannot
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63883:9"/>
consist together, the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
Divorce, the other
appoints death. I suppose
our Saviour in what he
Here determines about this
matter (as in many other
of his determinations about
other things) speaks so, as
that he gives a full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to men according to
the present state of things
then in being; and also esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth
a Divine Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such grounds that shall
last for ever in the
Church.</p>
            <p>For the first, That he
spake with reference to the
Law Then in being, and
to settle the Consciences of
men, who desired to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63883:9"/>
their duty as things
Then stood, I gather from
hence. First, because he
spake to such who were
then all of them under an
obligation to the whole
Mosaical Law, for so were
the Jews, and Christ's own
Disciples to whom he
Preached.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He plainly
seems all along that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
to comment upon the
Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
it, and to give the true
and genuine meaning of it,
against the corrupt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
interpretations of the
Scribes and Pharisees; And
when he sayes, <hi>But I say
unto you,</hi> he does not so much
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63883:10"/>
oppose himself and what he
said Then, to <hi>Moses</hi> and
what <hi>Moses</hi> had said Before,
as to what the Scribes and
Pharisees had falsly said in
<hi>Moses</hi> name, and so rather
vindicates the true sense
and intention of the Law
under his own name. And
though his determinations
in some things exceed the
Law, yet in all things they
contain the true sence and
end of the Law.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When the Scribes
and Pharisees asked our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the 19th. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
about this matter
what lawfully might be done
in it, our Saviour answers
them with the very same
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63883:10"/>
determination, and therefore
'tis plain he spake with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to what was at that
time to be accounted Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
according to the Laws
and institutions of God Then
in force; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in what our Saviour
sayes, that does any way
contradict the Law of God
in being, but gives a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to mens Consciences
how they were to behave
themselves under it.</p>
            <p>We must note this, that
our Saviour is singly upon
the point of Divorce and
putting away, he meddles
not at all with the Law
about Adultery, but leaves
it to its due execution; His
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63883:11"/>
saying, That crime was the
only lawful cause of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
did not prejudge it
from any greater punishment
due to it, he only determines
about the matter of Putting
away and Divorce, and
he determines thus in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the Jewish practice,
and the first permission of
<hi>Moses</hi> to them, that there is
no cause at all upon which
a Wife may be put away,
but where the marriage-bond
is dissolved, which is
only in the case of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Adultery, where
the Woman was Then le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
dead, and ought to be
put to death, if prosecuted
and the fact proved, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63883:11"/>
that all putting away the
Wife upon any other ground
is unalawful and sinful. Now
this determination of our
Saviour about Divorce
might be a satisfaction to
men in Conscience, and a
ground for them to put
away their Wives for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and Adultery,
though the Law of God
against Fornication and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
to punish it with
death was unrepealed, and
they under the obligation
of it, and that in three
Cases.</p>
            <p>First, The Law did not
oblige the Husband to go
to the Judge, and prosecute
his Wife for Adultery;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63883:12"/>
Nor does our Saviour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
farther in that case then
the Law did upon him, and
therefore such who were
<hi>Lenes mariti,</hi> as <hi>Joseph</hi> was,
and had no mind to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their Wives to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
were by this deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from a necessity, either
to live with an Adulteress,
or else to prosecute her to
death, and are set free in
Conscience to give her <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum
repudii,</hi> and part from
her.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Supposing a
man could not have Justice
done upon an Adulterous
Wife, when he did his best
in prosecution of her, (and
this was like enough to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63883:12"/>
the condition of many a man
in that corrupt state of things
amongst the Jews at that
time, and was actually so,
the execution of That Law
having been for a long time
forborn, and well may we

               </gap>hink it should be so, for all
Capital punishment was at

               </gap>hat time taken from the
Jews, and not in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
so the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> confess,
<hi>John</hi> 18. 31. 'Tis not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for us to put any man
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o death,) in that case our
Saviour gives free liberty for

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:63883:13"/>
Thirdly, Supposing a man
were inwardly satisfied o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

yet had not such proof<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
as would make it out in a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
her in putting her to death
in such a case, (which we
may easily suppose might
often fall out) our Saviour
sets the mans Conscience fre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to put her away, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce

all these cases our Saviour<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
allowing Divorce in case o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>
Then to settle the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men, who were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63883:13"/>
to the Law, and no
infringement at all of the
Law it self: He gives a rule
to limit that exorbitant li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
men took to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of putting their Wives
away, and tells them in what
case only it may be done,
which was in case of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
and that might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well happen to be the
Case, though the Law for
punishing it with death were
still in force, and so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
speaks of it as<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ words">
                  <desc>〈◊…〉</desc>
               </gap>
Then accidentally <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
but no way layes any A<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>
upon the punishment the
Law inflicted upon it.
The truth is, our Saviour
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63883:14"/>
promulged such a general
Law in the case, as gave a
sufficient determination as
things Then stood, and
might satisfie mens Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
what Then to do in
the point of Divorce, and
was to be also a Rule to the
Church about that matter
to all future Ages. That
our Saviour intended it so,
is very evident from those
general grounds upon which
it is established, and all the
circumstances that attend it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Nor is there one word in
that whole Chapter but is
of that nature, 'tis Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
as well as Legal, and
looks forward to the Gospel-Church
to come, as well
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63883:14"/>
as it contains a direction to
the present Church of the
Jews; Whereever through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Chapter our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
speaks of any Law in
force amongst the Jews,
even of the Judicial Laws,
he induceth by his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
about them that
Equity that was moral and
perpetual in them, and to
last for ever in the Church.
It seems also necessary there
should be some direction left
by our Saviour in this point,
or else the Church under the
Go<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pel would have been
wholly without any Rule
about it, and there could
never have been upon any
terms whatever any such
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63883:15"/>
thing as Divorce practised
in the Gospel-world, for
what <hi>Moses</hi> permitted about
it was accidental and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
and peculiar to the
Jews, and our Saviour shews
us the rise of it, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it, and forbids all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
practice of it; The
Law against Adultery and
uncleanness determined those
crimes another way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
That Law of punishing
Adultery with death was
purely Judicial, as much as
punishing a di<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>obedient child
with death was so, and wholly
relating to the Jewish Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy;
'Tis true, the offences
in these cases were moral
and natural evills, and do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63883:15"/>
still so continue, but That
manner of punishing them
Then, was Judicial and
temporary. We see at This
day 'tis not a general esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Law, no not in the
most Christian Nations to
punish Adultery with death,
and therefore our Saviour,
who was guided by infinite
wisdom in all he did, spake
so as might give satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to every Conscience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law at That time,
upon what terms only to
make use of the liberty of
Divorce and putting away,
Then so frequently and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
practised, and also
gave a perpetual Rule to the
Church, that the bond of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63883:16"/>
marriage should be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Sacred, and upon no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
but that of Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
dissolved, and in That
case whatever the Laws of
particular States might be
about it, yet the obligation
of marriage ceased, and the
Consciences of men were for
ever set free.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
about Divorce esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the 5th. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
is again repeated by
him in the 19th. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
in answer to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,
who there questioned
with him about the same
matter; He there tells them,
there is no cause lawful for
a man to put away his Wife,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63883:16"/>
but only Fornication, and
that he admits to be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
cause, and the only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
cause. In the 10th. of
<hi>Mark</hi> our Savious discourse
is set down without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Fornication, and
runs general, that whoever
puts his Wife away, and
marries another, commits
Adultery, and so in the
16th. of <hi>Luke</hi> our Saviour
sayes, without any of the
circumstances in his other
discourses of it, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and without the exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of Fornication, That
whosoever shall <hi>put away
his Wife and marry another
commits Adultery.</hi> It must
be noted, that what <hi>Mark</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63883:17"/>
sets down, in the 10th. of
<hi>Mark,</hi> is the very same
story recorded by <hi>Matthew</hi>
chapter the 19th, and both
the Evangelists give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the same discourse
between our Saviour and
the Pharisees at one and the
same time; That is so clear,
that 'tis not to be denyed,
and therefore whatever is
set down by <hi>Matthew</hi> must
be admitted to belong to
the story, and be implyed in
it, though omitted and not
expressed by <hi>Mark,</hi> and so
whatever is in <hi>Mark,</hi> that
<hi>Matthew</hi> hath omitted, must
be likewise supposed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the story, or else
we must imagine the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63883:17"/>
not to be both in the
right in their relation of the
same story, which cannot but
be, and therefore <hi>Matthew</hi>
expressing that our Saviour
added That exception, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in the <hi>cause of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation)</hi>
'tis to be supposed
and implyed in the relation
<hi>Mark</hi> makes of the story,
though he express it not,
neither in what he said to
the Disciples nor to the
Jews themselves, for the
answer is There general to
both; <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
upon the Evangelists
sayes upon this place, that
'tis the same story related in
both places, and there is no
other difference, sayes he,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63883:18"/>
but that one sets down the
matter of our Saviours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
more fully than the
other, it being, sayes he,
most usual for one Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
to omit some passages
and circumstances in the
same story mentioned by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in his relation
of what our Saviour said
about this matter, omits all
the circumstances of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and only mentions in
short this general expression
of our Saviour, That <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
should put away his
wife and marry another,
committed Adultery,</hi> which
is evidently spoken of those
unlawful Divorces daily
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63883:18"/>
practised amongst the Jews,
and directed against Them.</p>
            <p>Some conceive that our
Saviours determinations in
this point were intended with
a distinction; that is, that
when he spake in general
against putting away without
any exception, he spake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively
to his Disciples, and
to the Gospel-Church to
come; but when he spake
of it with the exception of
Fornication annexed to it,
he intended That only with
relation to the Jews, and
so the exception Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
not us, but was only
meant to Them, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
There.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63883:19"/>
Very many things strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppose this apprehension;
First, in the 5th. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
where our Saviour
gives the first, and most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
determination about
this point, 'tis plain he spake
to his Disciples, as well as
the multitude of the Jews;
For the Chapter begins,
<hi>And seeing the multitudes,
he went up into a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
and when he was set,
his Disciples came unto him;
And he opened his mouth
and taught them saying, &amp;c.</hi>
And he often in that Sermon
directed his discourse parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to his Disciples, for
so he did in the 14th. verse,
where he tells them, <hi>ye are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63883:19"/>
the salt of the World; A
City set on an hill cannot be
hid;</hi> which must be spoken
to them: Nor was there any
reason why our Saviour
should Preach one Doctrine
in this matter to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and another to the
Jews; For the Disciples
were equally obliged Then
to the Law, and concerned
in all that the Jews were,
and therefore the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
must needs be common
to them both.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We find not
the least ground from any
thing our Saviour said any
where to make any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in this matter, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Rule was given ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63883:20"/>
to one sort of men,
and with an exception to
another, but we find the
Rule often generally laid
down by our Saviour with
this general exception an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to it, and in that
case where our Saviour
once gives a general rule,
with a general exception
annexed to it, wheresoever
our Saviour after repeats
the same Rule, we must
suppose the exception, or
else we can never be able
to make our Saviour to
agree with himself. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more usual than to
imply remote exceptions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
generals to reconcile the
Scripture with it self, much
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63883:20"/>
more in This case, where
our Saviour himself so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
joyned the Rule and the
exception together. Our
Saviour bids us positively in
the same Chapter not to
swear at all, in general terms,
yet every man that is sober
will, under This general,
imply all the lawful swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture any where
else enjoins or approves,
because we must not make
the Scripture militate with it
self.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There can be no
good reason to limit what
our Saviour said about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
in the 5th. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
and the 19th. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
to the Jews only, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63883:21"/>
we must needs admit it to
be a general Law given in
the case to all Ages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he grounds his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
about it, not upon
the Judicial Law, but upon
reasons drawn from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Law of Nature, and
the first institution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
by God in the Creation
of man and woman at the
beginning, and such general
principles, as had no pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
at all to the Jews,
(though they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by them) but such
wherein all mankind were
equally concerned: Our
Saviour opposed the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
and the Judaical practice,
and establishes the Law he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63883:21"/>
introduceth about it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the matter of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and Divorce to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
rule of it, and to the
natural and perpetual reason
of the things in themselves
considered, and therein spake
not only to them, but to
all mankind, and to the
whole world; He directs
them to look to the first rise
and original of Marriage,
God made at first but one
man and one woman, a male
and a female, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Them two in those two
kinds to be in the relation
of Marriage one flesh, so
that Nature and Institution,
the very Laws of mans first
Creation, make the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Union
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63883:22"/>
very sacred, and
from thence our Saviour
derives his direction about
it; And for Divorce,
whereas the Jews upon every
trivial occasion allowed it,
our Saviour denies it to be
lawful upon any occasion
but one, and that grounded
upon the natural and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
reason of the thing
in it self considered: The
very essence of the
marriage-Union, both by
nature and primitive institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lyes in this, that two
are one flesh; where forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is committed the
Union is dissolved, for as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, whoever <hi>joyns
himself to an Harlot, is one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63883:22"/>
flesh with her,</hi> and so in cases
of such turpitude two are
no longer one, but three or
four or more in that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-sense
of oneness, and so
the oneness of two in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which is the essence
of it being dissolved, the
marriage it self must needs
be so likewise, nor can it
in reason be supposed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
where the ends of
God and Nature in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
are frustrated and
made void: And this could
not be limited to the Jews,
nor have a peculiar and
single respect to Them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
founded upon principles
that are common and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
moral and perpetual,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63883:23"/>
and wherein the interests of
all men concenter, so that if
it were lawful Then for a
Jew, or any man, to put
away his Wife for Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
upon those grounds
upon which our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
it to be lawful, it
seems reasonable to think it
must continue to be so for
every man to the worlds end,
because those grounds are in
their own nature general and
perpetual, and will Justifie
the doing of the thing for
ever.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There seems to
be no ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of belief, that
our Saviour should indulge
the Jews in this point, and
frame this exception only
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63883:23"/>
for Them, and not intend it
to others, but rather the
contrary, That he should
have particularly restrained
Them in this matter more
than others, because of their
enormous practices this way
above any other Nation in
the World; Besides that the
general Rule without the
exception, has a fairer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
towards Them
than any, and our Saviour
might well say, pointing
only to Them <hi>Whoever puts
away his Wife,</hi> (that is, as
your manner of putting them
away now is) <hi>and marries
another, commits Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
There seems no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at all to appropriate
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63883:24"/>
that exception to Them,
especially when 'tis made
upon grounds common to
all.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To confine that
Rule our Saviour Then gave
about Marriage and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
as he conjoyned
them, to the Jews only at
That time, and to extend
it in that conjunction no
farther, is to confine it to
that interpretation, wherein
'tis most hard and difficult to
be understood, and deny the
effects of it, where the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
lyes most plain and
easie. To our selves under
the Gospel the direction of
our Saviours Law is plain
and evident, and without any
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63883:24"/>
difficulty may be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
but in its relation to
the Jews, and the state of
things Then, it seems some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
obscure, and without an
admittance of a non-execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in some cases of the
Law of God Then in force,
for punishing Fornication and
Adultery with death, very
hard to be understood, and
therefore 'tis no way reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to relate the Law solely
to Them, and deny the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of it to our selves.</p>
            <p>The practice in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church seems to have
been regulated by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
direction, and Divorces
admitted in case of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Emperour <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius,</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:63883:25"/>
who, as one sayes of
him, was <hi>Christianus &amp; pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
&amp; Episcoporum quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano
usus concilio,</hi> made Laws
for a man to put away his
Wife in case of Fornication
and Adultery, and extended
it to the very suspicion of it.
<hi>Sufficere Judicavit, si mulier
viro ignorante, vel nolente
extraneorum virorum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivia
appeteret, si ipso invito
sine Justa &amp; probabili causa
foris pernoctaret, nisi apud
suos Parentes, vel si Circensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
theatralibus, vel Ludis
&amp; Arenarum spectaculis ipso
prohibente gauderet.</hi> The
Emperour <hi>Justinian</hi> made
many additions to these
Laws, which although for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63883:25"/>
the manner of them, we must
suppose accommodated much
to the Customes of those
times, yet were all built upon
our Saviours direction in that
case. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> is positive,
That, <hi>Vbicunque est Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio,
&amp; Fornicationis suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio
liberè uxor dimittitur;</hi>
which yet we must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to every Jealous suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
but suppose spoken, <hi>Ne
ad legum subtilitatem res
semper exigatur,</hi> and must be
understood with restriction;
'Tis no way fit a mans own
Jealous apprehension should
be always the rule in the case,
and yet in matters of That
nature it may so fall out, that
a man may be certain of that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63883:26"/>
of which he can make no
evident proof. St. <hi>Austine</hi>
plainly takes our Saviours
direction Then to be the rule
Now in this matter, in his
89th. Epistle, says he, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
praecepit, ne quisquam
uxorem dimi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tat, excepta
causâ Fornicationis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divorce <hi>à mensâ &amp; toro</hi>
seems to be a fiction in the
Canon-law, and to have no
ground, neither in any Law
of God, nor in reason. Not
in any Law of God, for
wheresoever divorce was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by any Divine Law,
it was a total Divorce, and
the persons were allowed to
marry again; It was so
amongst the Jews, whoever
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63883:26"/>
was Then Divorced, might
go to a second marriage; It
is so in what our Saviour
sayes, he evidently implyes
it, (putting away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marrying
are conjoyned)
<hi>whoever,</hi> sayes he, <hi>puts away
his wife, and Marries ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
except for the cause of
Fornication,</hi> &amp;c. where the
implication is evident, that
in that case of Fornication,
he may both put away his
wife, and also lawfully Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
another, the first marriage
being dissolved: the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> constantly used by our
Saviour in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Divorce and putting
away implyes a nulling of
the marriage and discharge
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63883:27"/>
of the obligation, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
to absolve, loose, release,
discharge; so that if what
our Saviour hath said about
Divorce in case of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be a rule to the Church
Now, 'tis plain the Divorce
allowed by him in that case
admits of a second marriage:
If it be not a rule to the
Church Now, then there is
not the least positive allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
under the Gospel for any
Divorce at all, and if so, all
Divorces a <hi>Mensâ &amp; Toro</hi>
are without any Divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>Not in reason, for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can be sufficient to
Justifie a Divorce from all
the ends of Marriage, must
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63883:27"/>
needs be sufficient to Justifie
a Divorce from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Marriage, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but in order to the other;
It seems no way reasonable
to bring any man into that
condition, that the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of marriage should remain,
and the helps and advantages
of it be taken away; 'Tis
to divide what God hath
joyned, for he never appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the one to go without the
other; It seems very unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to say, two shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
one flesh, and yet be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from all converse each
with the other. If the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
bond of marriage be
broken (as in fornication),
That gives a rational ground
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63883:28"/>
for a Total divorce; If it be
not, while the bond continues
unbroken, the duty ought to
be performed, there appears
no ground to suspend the one,
and continue the other.</p>
            <p>The practice of marrying
again after Divorce hath
been frequent; The Greek
Church practise it generally.
<hi>Grotius</hi> says, some Christians
have thought better to forbear
it, <hi>Quam sententiam,</hi> says he,
<hi>ex bonitate peculiari magis
ortam, quam ex communi
receptaque lege, tum ex aliis,
tum ex Tertulliano apparet,

qui ob Adulterium uxorem
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63883:28"/>
dimisissent. Origen</hi> tells us,
that in his time many Bishops
allowed it. 'Tis not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

and <hi>Grotius</hi> have their
opinion, yet the Rabbies say;
Albeit the liberty of the Law,
few or none did use it: No
instance of taking that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
in Scripture; <hi>Joseph</hi>
finding the blessed Virgins
Womb swelled, presumed he
had Just cause to dismiss her:
for he knew she could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with him in point of
Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:63883:30"/>
5. It is a strong argument
to me, that whereas God says,
the nations round about the
Jews would admire their wise
Laws, yet none of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
had such a loose Law, as
to divorce at every exception
the husband took; It is <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
in his Apology, who
sayes, that from <hi>Romulus</hi> to
<hi>Sp. Camilius</hi> for 500. years
Divorces were never heard
of in <hi>Rome,</hi> and he began
it upon the barrenness of his
Wife. <hi>Tully</hi> broke good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
above all men; For he
marryed a young Gentle-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
his <hi>Pupilla,</hi> his Ward,
as we call it, that he might
pay his debts with her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63883:31"/>
he never prospered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it.</p>
            <p>6. The Jews to this day
confess in their writings,
that the penalty for Adultery
was not inflicted, as it ought
to have been, chiefly because
it was so hard to prove it by
two witnesses, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the nocent party
would not serve; because
no such Trial appears in their
Law.</p>
            <p>7. In <hi>Matthew</hi> there's men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of putting away, not a
word to allow the innocent
person to marry again: but
here is a strong argument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:63883:31"/>
never allowed their petulant
putting away for every cause;
For Christ, as you well observe
rendred the right sense of the
old Law, gave no new.</p>
            <p>8. When the marriage-bond
is dissolved; That is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
not proved.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 9. is not
every way the same determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with his doctrine,
<hi>Matth. 5.;</hi> for <hi>chap.</hi> 19. he
speaks in his case that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
another, but <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.
in his case that marries her
that is put away. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was not legally dead,
if not convinced by two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:63883:32"/>
10. The first case of <hi>Lenes
Mariti,</hi> and the third of a
prosecutor that could not
prove, in the Event come all
to one, That with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
he might put the
Adulteress away. I concur
for putting away, but no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
But for the second
member, when he prosecuted
openly against her and could
not prove, Surely she ought to
have the common benefit of
all Law, to be <hi>recta in curiis,</hi>
and the utmost must be to take
the water of Jealousie.</p>
            <p>11. If you speak of the
5th. of <hi>Matthew</hi> (not of the
19th.) it is true that it is a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63883:32"/>
compleat exposition of the
right understanding of some
points in <hi>Moses</hi> Law, in the
morality so to be in force for
ever.</p>
            <p>12. Punishment by death
for Adultery not a general
Law. But far more Nations
have it, than others with
whom it prevails not.</p>
            <p>13. That Christ intended
the obligation of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
should cease; <hi>Presumitur
non probatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. <hi>Mark</hi> sets down the
same story recorded by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
that not to be denyed.
Yes, 'tis evidently to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63883:33"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 3. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
asked him him about
divorce, so <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 2. the
Pharisees asked him about
that matter; but read fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>verse</hi> the <hi>10th;</hi> and in
the house the Disciples asked
him again of the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and he saith unto them,
whosoever puts away his
Wife, and doth marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
commits Adultery,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 1. The chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
He saith to his Disciples,
not to the Pharisees; Then
at the <hi>19th. verse,</hi> whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
puts away his Wife, and
marries another, commits
Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
our Saviour spake in
Gospel rules, repealing the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63883:33"/>
license given to the Jews in
their Law Judicial to marry
again, if Divorced for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
I dissent from <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
who will have the
same carriage of the story in
in all the three Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.</p>
            <p>15. Very right, his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
were present at the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. but there is
no mention of a giving allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to marry after Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce;
If you argue from
Christs silence, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
it not, 'tis your own
assumption, but no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>Second Reason.]</hi> What
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63883:34"/>
need you more ground than
the express words of Christ;
you say, Why should the rule
be general to one sort of
men, with exception to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Nay, the general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is not to one sort of
men, but to all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God and Disciples
of Christ, the exception is
to the Jews, for the hardness
of their hearts.</p>
            <p>More strict duty required
of Christians, for the exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance
of grace given us;
<hi>Abundantia spiritus sancti
est Elogium regni Christi;</hi>
They are <hi>Calvines</hi> words.
A command not to swear
at all, is never in any
place limitted by exceptions,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63883:34"/>
(except to swear by the name
of the Lord) but hath an
hundred Texts to allow it
justly done, so hath not this
case which you put.</p>
            <p>17. The <hi>third Reason</hi>
makes against you. Christ
cites original Scriptures,
light of Nature, grounds not
to be shaken but by the God
of Scripture and Nature,
who indulged to the Jews,
that albeit those great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
they might marry
after Divorce for Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
those times of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
God winked at, as
he did at many superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Gentiles, but
these are the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63883:35"/>
under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
            <p>18. If either commit For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
the Vnion is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.
<hi>Gratis dicitur;</hi> For
may not the innocent person
remit the fault of foul lust
to the other? <hi>deductosque
jugo cogat alieno;</hi> may they
not live together as Man and
Wife? which could not be,
if the union were intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
dissolved; As the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
do often challenge the
Jews for spiritual Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Idolatry, yet the Lord
took them again to him for
his people, and it hath a
great Evangelical considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in it, that for any
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63883:35"/>
trespass, while the offended
and the offender live together
in this world, there may be
a way left for reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to take that admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
sin no more lest a
worse thing come unto thee:
but marrying another while
the offender lives, excludes
all possibility of charitable
pardon.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>Fourth Reason.]</hi> Our
Saviour did not restrain the
Jews more than <hi>Moses</hi> had
restrained, but expounds
Scripture, that they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
license above what God
had indulged to them for
the hardness of their hearts;
It was the hardness of their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63883:36"/>
hearts, that caused the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God to give them a
latitude, the Lord being gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to their infirmities;
But you would have God
lay more burden upon them,
because of their perverse
hearts, which is not Gods
method, but to whom much
is given, of him much will be
required.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Fifth Reason]</hi> soon
satisfied; whoever said that
Christs precept about Divorce
was injoyned Then to the
Jews, and only at That times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It was in force from the beginning
without indulgence
but in force with that indulgence
from <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. a<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:63883:36"/>
no time so opportune, as
when Christ was on the
earth, and spake with his
own mouth to his Disciples,
to let them know, they were not
priviledged like the Jews, if
their Wife were an Adulteress,
but to take up their cross
and bear it.</p>
            <p>21. Divorce admitted in
the Christian Church for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
but superinduction
of another Wife is another
thing.</p>
            <p>There were great mistakes
in the Imperial Laws. Did
not <hi>Valentinian</hi> make a
Law for marrying within
degrees prohibited? Others
for Bigamy? I have not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63883:37"/>
leasure to search the Books.
I lay St. <hi>Austine</hi> against
St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who did not
write transcursorily, but two
studied Books upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p>22. Why should not the
orders of the Canon-Law
be as rational as the Laws
of <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian?
Separatio à toro &amp;
mensa</hi> is for peace sake, till
opportunity of attoning.
Must all directions to keep
them aloof, that are imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
one against the other,
and to prove them for a
time how they will piece
again, be grounded upon
Scripture? Shall humane
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63883:37"/>
Prudence have no hand in
such things? These are no
fictions of the Canon Law,
for they falsifie no Text,
but make tryal of such ways
as may conduce to the
good of both parties. What
if <hi>à toro &amp; mensa</hi> have no
divine warrant, is there
any divine warrant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it? They that look
for divine warrant express
in all frames of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in all circumstances
of Gods worship, have been
told sufficiently how much
they mistake the purpose
and use of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:63883:38"/>
23. You say, <hi>'Tis not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that the obligation of
marriage should remain, and
the helps and advantages of
it be taken away;</hi> why,
what if a ma<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or a woman
be taken Captive? Incur
an irremediable diseass? or
the Wife, though chaste, will
not render due benevolence?
or, her Joynture she brought
be consumed by fire? Here
are helps and advantages
substracted, yet no wedlock
broken.</p>
            <p>24. By Divorce <hi>à toro &amp;
mensa</hi> they are not shut from
all converse with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they may return to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63883:38"/>
mutual embraces again;
though the bond of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
be not broken, the
use and comfort may be
suspended.</p>
            <p>25. Far more Bishops by
thousands have disliked it,
than that have allowed it.
I reverence the Councils, yet
they were but Provincial;
Had I leisure to peruse them,
I should know to interpret
them.</p>
            <p>26. <hi>Grotius</hi> lived in the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> and wrote af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their practice and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
It hath been the
practice of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> but once in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63883:39"/>
               <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and once
in this late Session of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.
I take no pick at
any man that is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
judgement to me. But
the first instance of <hi>Parre</hi>
Marquess of <hi>Northampton,</hi>
who had two Children in
secret, before the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
passed on his side,
makes his case far worse
than the Lord <hi>Rosse</hi>'s,
but the Marquess and his
posterity sunk quite away,
and let survivors behold
the end of this last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For an Appendix, I will
ingeniously add the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of the Church of</hi>
Rome, <hi>who generally deny
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63883:39"/>
him that puts away his
Wife for Adultery, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
again, yet they consent to
the sentence of Pope</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
<hi>the first, who resolves
this upon a question mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
Questio est, quidam
parentes, mulieres preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,
proprios filios susce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perunt

easily thus refuted by their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63883:40"/>
own doctrine,</hi> Si proprios

            <p>27. To end, such as hold
to my opinion, lay it the
more to Conscience, foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the contrary may
stir up some wicked Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
to suborn false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
upon Oath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
innocent Wives, that
They being divorced, it may

                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>The first is evident, that
unchastity when punished
with death was to be proved
by two witnesses, not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of any particular dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
about the proof in
That case, but because God
established That as a general
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63883:43"/>
rule for all Judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
that by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
every sentence should
be established, Deut. 19. 15.
<hi>One witness shall not rise up
against any man for any
iniquity, at the mouth of
two witnesses or three shall
the matter be established.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second, that if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastity
were proved but by
one witness, it was Then
matter of Divorce, I crave
leave to dissent from; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastity,
if proved, could
never be ground for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
for death was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
so that if one witness
in case of unchastity were
sufficient proof, it produced
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63883:44"/>
death, if it were not, it
amounted to no more than
suspicion; Nor do I find
any direction for any proof
at all to be made as Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in case of Divorce, nor
in any case, where proof
was Judicially required was
one witness sufficient, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the first allowance
of Divorce, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. Nor
in the subsequent practice
of it amongst the Jews was
there any proof required in
case of Divorce, nor any
Judgement to be passed by
the Magistrate about it, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than that there should
be <hi>libellum repudii</hi> given to
the Woman; It seems to
me that the judgement in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63883:44"/>
case of Divorce rested in
every mans own breast,
though every man was in
his own private conscience
obliged by rules in his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
therein, and sinned if
he transgressed them; For

I assent to it, he that
doubted his Wives chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in case he could be

not to part with her,
and if she were found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste,
desired the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Law upon her,
obtained his end by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Jealousie; But I much
question whether That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an extraordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
were enjoyed by the
Jews till our Saviours time:
I rather suppose they never
had the benefit of it after
the Captivity, but that the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63883:47"/>
use of it ceased, as it did of
the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi>
That Church being to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
God removed the
Pillars of it by degrees; I
believe in our Saviours time
in fact things stood Thus;
The Law against Adultery
was not executed, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was it in their power
to have it executed, for the
Romans had reserved mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of life to their own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories,
(though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the people would vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently

they thought to insnare our

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63883:48"/>
the woman taken in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
The water of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
they had not the use of,
and so nothing was done
in these cases, but only they
made use of the liberty <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
allowed for Divorces.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63883:49"/>
the Jews I confess differed
much about it; I find
in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> there were
three Schools amongst them,
that maintained three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
opinions about it; The
School of <hi>Hillel,</hi> the School
of <hi>Sammai,</hi> and the School
of <hi>Aquiba:</hi> That of <hi>Hillel</hi>
maintained it lawful for a
man to put his Wife away
for any cause, but not sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon his own pleasure;
That of <hi>Sammai</hi> for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of Turpitude only;
and That of <hi>Aquiba,</hi> that a
man might put away his
Wife upon his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
without any ground at
all; That which was the
most general received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63883:49"/>
amongst the Jews, he
says, was, that for light
causes, as dislike of Beauty,
age, and many other such
things, Wives might be put
away, and he adds, <hi>idque
ex sacrae legis mente,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the sense of the Law,
and 'tis most certain they did
so interpret it for the most
part.</p>
                  <p>The School of <hi>Sammai,</hi>
as <hi>Grotius</hi> observes, had the
fewest disciples, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of turpitude
they extended Divorce so
far, that they thought a
Womans going with open
breasts a sufficient ground
for it. <hi>Philo</hi> sayes, a man
may Divorce his Wife for

he disliked her manners.
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his Homilies
upon <hi>Matthew</hi> speaking of
what the Pharisees said to
our Saviour about Divorce,
sayes he, <hi>Erat hoc in veteri

                     <hi>Erasmus</hi> hath with very
great learning in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
about Divorce proved
that by Uncleanness in the
24th. of <hi>Deut.</hi> Unchastity
cannot be meant, he is so
confident and positive, that
he stakes his credit upon it.
<hi>Ainsworth</hi> and our best late
Commentators render it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
from the Hebrew,
(matter of nakedness) or
by transposing the words
(any thing of nakedness)
which, saith <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> is
not meant of Adultery, but
of some evil thing in her
conditions or actions that
displeased her Husband, and
he adds that the phrase is so
taken in the same sense for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63883:51"/>
any thing unseemly in the
23 of <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 14 Nor did
I ever yet meet with any
that thought the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
word used in the 24 of <hi>Deut.</hi>
as the ground of <hi>Moses</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Divorce, could be
rendred by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
which is that used by our
Saviour. But to put it out
of all farther question, that
the licence <hi>Moses</hi> gave to
Divorce, cannot be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Adultery and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
there is this unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
evidence; If that
were so, we must make our
Saviour palpably to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
himself, and at the
same time to establish what
himself repeals, and to do
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63883:51"/>
the same thing which he
finds fault with as done by
<hi>Moses,</hi> being not that which
was from the beginning,
but that which was done
only temporarily and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
for the hardness of
That peoples hearts; our
Saviour's speech would Then
run Thus, <hi>Moses</hi> for the
hardness of your hearts suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
you to put away your
Wives for Fornication and
Adultery, which was not
so from the beginning,
(and so ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue)
But I say unto you,
that whosoever puts away
his Wife, except for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and Adultery,
and marries another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63883:52"/>
Adultery in so doing;
There needs no more than
our Saviours own-words to
assure us that the liberty <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
gave for Divorce, and
That Christ gave were upon
different grounds: The plain
meaning of our Saviour seems
to be this, <hi>Moses</hi> heretofore
upon a particular reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the hardness of your
hearts, suffered you to put
away your Wives upon
grounds that were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be a lawful cause
of Divorce from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
I'le have that to be so
no more, but I'le have it to
be as it was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and from the beginning
there was no good cause o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:63883:52"/>
Divorce but Fornication, and
This cause was a good cause
from the beginning and the
first institution of marriage,
and appears by our Saviours
interpretation of the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Marriage to be
so, and to be implyed in the
general institution at the first,
and reserved as much as the
service of the Temple, and
liberty to works of mercy
and necessity are declared by
him to be reserved and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in the first positive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Sabbath,
though not expressed; so
that, if we look to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
given by <hi>Moses,</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Law about Divorce is
a new Law, for he repealed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63883:53"/>
That, if we look to the Law
of Creation and first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of marriage, 'tis the same
that was from the beginning,
only the Mosaical indulgence
had interposed, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
by repealing That set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
the matter upon the old
and lasting foundation,
wherein Jews and Gentiles,
and all men to the worlds
end are to acquiesce, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that exception of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
to be virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and implyed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of marriage from the
beginning.</p>

says he, we give general li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

our Saviour spake in

again, if Divorced for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;

                  <p>I humbly conceive that
the two Evangelists relate
the same story, both from the
matter of it, and all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
that attend it,
'tis said in the 19th. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
in the beginning of the
Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Saviour came
into <hi>Judaea</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi>
and in the beginning of
<hi>Mark</hi> 10. 'tis said he came
into the same place, and in
both the Evangelists 'tis said
the multitude came unto him,
and the discourse related be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the Pharisees
appears evidently in both
Evangelists to have been the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63883:61"/>
same, at the same time, and
in the same place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the same company, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
somewhat varied in the
relation, which is usual; In
the 10th. of <hi>Mark</hi> there is
no mention made, that our
Saviour gave to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
any allowance of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
in any case, which is
expressed in the 19th. of
<hi>Matthew,</hi> and 'tis granted
our Saviour admitted it to the
Jews; what our Saviour
saith about it in the 19th.
of <hi>Matthew,</hi> was as much
spoken to the Disciples, as
what he sayes in the 10th.
of <hi>Mark,</hi> as appears from
hence, that the Disciples
themselves make immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63883:62"/>
the answer; In the
19th. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where our
Saviour saith, <hi>Whoever puts
away his wife, except for
Fornication, &amp;c.</hi> If the case
be so, say the Disciples,
taking it to themselves, 'tis
good not to marry, looking
upon it as a strict doctrine,
even with that exception and
such a one as the world had
not been acquainted with,
and which they thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable.
<hi>Calvin</hi> says,
'tis the same passage that is
reported in <hi>Mark,</hi> only
<hi>Mark</hi> reporteth 'twas spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the House to the
Disciples, and <hi>Matthew</hi> omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that circumstance sets
down barely our Saviours
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63883:62"/>
speech; Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> agrees
with <hi>Calvin</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
speaking of these places
and about this very occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
sayes he, that these
places, That in <hi>Matthew</hi> on
the one side, and in the other
two Evangelists, at least in
St. <hi>Mark</hi> on the other side,
are a report of the same pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of story, and of the
same part of Christs speech,
appealing from the <hi>Mosaical</hi>
permission to the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of marriage, there is
no ground of making any
question, and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that one must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
by the other, so
thinks he. But suppose it
were otherwise, when seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63883:63"/>
of the Evangelists relate
discourses of our Saviour
about the same subject, by
all judgement of reason those
Evangelists that are more
explicite and large must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
those that are more
implicite and brief, and there
is no fitness at all in it to
interpret those that are most
large, and say most upon a
subject, by those that are
more brief and say least
of it.</p>
                  <p>But that which overrules
me in this case is, that I
find our Saviour no where
Preaching one doctrine to
the Jews and another to his
Disciples, and that must be
proved in this case, or else
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63883:63"/>
the point of Divorce and
remarriage is visibly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in case of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if our Saviour gave
that liberty only to the
Jews, and made the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
singly for them, Then
when he speaks generally to
his Disciples, he must not
only repeal the liberty <hi>Moses</hi>
gave to the Jews, but the
liberty which himself gave
to the Jews, which is not
fit to suppose; Nor indeed
has our Saviour throughout
the whole Gospel given any
one new Law peculiar only
to the Jews, which this
about Divorce in case of
Fornication only must needs
be, if it be restrained to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63883:64"/>
Them, for they had no such
Law before; <hi>Moses</hi> permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Divorce, and this of
our Saviour could not be
the same, for our Saviour
would never have condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what <hi>Moses</hi> did, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
have instituted
the same thing himself:
Nay, it must not only, if
restrained to them, be a new
Law to them, but a new Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Law, which were
strange to suppose our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
should Then institute;
for if we deny it to be
Judicial, and acknowledge
it to be (as indeed it is)
a Law moral, sounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mans first Creation and
the first institution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63883:64"/>
then it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to the Jews, but
must needs by the nature of
it belong to all.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>third Reason</hi> makes

cites original Scripture,

of Scripture and Nature,
who indulged to the Jews,
that albeit those great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
they might marry
after Divorce for Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
those times of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
God winked at, as
he did at many things in
the superstitions of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
but these are the times
of reformation under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>

                  <p>I conceive Christ would
never have established mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
upon those grounds,
and then have given a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation
for divorce that
those grounds would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of; our Saviours speech
must then be thus understood,
by the Law of mans first
Creation, and the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of marriage this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
for Fornication and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage
upon it, ought not
to be, yet I will give you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to do it. Without
doubt the divorce our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
then allowed was very
well corresponding with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63883:66"/>
those principles upon which
he established marriage, and
those principles being general
and perpetual, his allowance
of divorce must needs be so
too; Christs time was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
time, not a word in
the Gospel of Christs wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at any thing, he settles
every thing upon its true and
lasting foundation, they are
times indeed of reformation,
and from whence can we
more reasonably expect That
reformation than from
Christs own mouth; He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
not the Jews in any
one Title of their corrupt
practice, but exactly reduceth
them to the rule, and in this
case he plainly tells them,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63883:66"/>
the dispensation they had
from <hi>Moses</hi> was not the rule,
but the law of Creation and
Gods first institution was the
rule, and that admits of no
exception but this of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
'tis not reasonable to
think Christ should indulge
them for the hardness of
their hearts in any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he came to reform eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, but especially not in
this matter, because he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repeals what <hi>Moses</hi> had
done in it before upon that

'tis a liberty given
in favour to him that is
wronged in the matrimonial
contract, which he is not
bound to make use of unless
he will; God seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
so much in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Where is the Bill of
your mothers divorcement?</hi>
there was cause enough, the
Covenant was broken on
their part, yet God pleased
to forgive it and not take the
forfeiture, no Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
was actually given,
if it had, they could have
returned no more, the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had been irremedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63883:69"/>
Now that Fornication
in this sense is a dissolution
of the marriage-bond, that
'tis a sufficient ground to
dissolve it, if the innocent
party please, will appear,
both from Christ permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
about it, and from the
nature of the thing it self.</p>
                  <p>First, From Christs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
about it, he plainly
admitted Fornication to be a
good ground of Divorce,
and permitted remarriage
upon that Divorce: let his
permission be to whom it
will, our Saviour would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have given liberty to
any man to remarry upon
Fornication, unless That had
dissolved the first marriage,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63883:69"/>
for it had been to permit a
positive sin upon those very
grounds, upon which our
Saviour himself in that very
place does establish the bond
of marriage; If the bond of
marriage can be broken in
no case, our Saviour would
never have allowed putting
away and remarrying in any
case.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing it self, it
cuts the very knot of the
marriage-contract, which is,
that two shall become one
flesh, and in that case two
are not one flesh, which they
covenant to be, and are to
be, in a chaste and peculiar
enjoyment of each other in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63883:70"/>
the marriage-bed, for St. <hi>Paul</hi>
sayes, <hi>He that joyns himself
to an Harlot is one flesh with
her;</hi> By the marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
they have resigned their
bodies over each to other, and
have not power in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
over their own bodies;
In case of Fornication, there
is the highest breach of That
obligation.</p>
                  <p>All other things whatever
relating to marriage may be
enjoyed upon other accounts
and in other relations, but
only the body and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of it, and therefore
when the Faith about the
body is broken, Faith is
broken about that which is
the peculiar property of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63883:70"/>
and that which does
formally distinguish it from
all other relations.</p>
                  <p>A charitable pardoning
spirit is very suitable to the
Gospel and becoming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
but I think a man ought
not to be imposed upon in this
case, where a man is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Christ hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a way to right him, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in That case must not be
denyed him, if he require it;
A man may, if he please for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
an unclean wife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to live with her, But I
incline to <hi>Calvins</hi> opinion,
that he will do much better
to put her away and cleanse
his house (nay his bed) from
defilement and wickedness.</p>

                  <p>I conceive it not reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any thing should be
thought of validity to take
away the ends of marriage
that is not sufficient to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the obligation; because
they are relatives intrinsecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conjoyned each to other,
the ends and advantages of
marriage ought never to be
suspended, where there is not
sufficient ground to dissolve
the bond of marriage; because
the bond being entred into for
the sake of those advantages
that belong to it, by the Law
of God, and by the Law of
Nature, those advantages
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63883:72"/>
ought never to be denyed,
where the bond is continued;
our Saviour saith, <hi>Whom God
hath joyned, let no man put
asunder,</hi> that is, not put asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as God hath joyned them,
and he has joyned them so,
that the duties to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and the obligation should
go together; whoever divides
in That kind, I think falls

in either party, the
duties of marriage cannot be
performed, yet the marriage-bond
continues unbroken,
though the ends cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63883:73"/>
this I assent to, but it
will not reach this case; Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to perform is implyed in
all contracts, providential
disability no way cancels the
matrimonial obligation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis entred into with a
supposition of them; But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
God in his just Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and as a punishment
upon both, may bring marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
persons into such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet 'tis not a ground for
men to make a rule to go by,
especially for the offence of
one, 'tis There matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and not of choice,
There the ends of marriage
cannot be attained, Here they
may, only we obstruct them.
God does that many times
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63883:73"/>
providentially, and Judicial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which we can neither do
reasonably nor regularly; 'tis
mens duty to submit to God
when he takes away those
helps marriage affords, but
that is no ground for us to
take them away, while he
continues them. A man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by an oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to his Prince may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially
be brought into
such a condition he cannot
perform it, but That will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
warrant us to bring any
man into such a condition,
where the obligation to a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is necessary, and the suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it is voluntary; It may
so fall out, a Prince cannot
protect his subjects, nor his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63883:74"/>
subjects obey him, yet the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
upon both remain,
But this will never justifie us
upon any account to bring
things into such a posture.
But suppose the woman refuse
due benevolence, where there
is no disability. I say she
lives by so doing in a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sin, and 'tis not fit that
what is a sin in either party
voluntarily to do, Both should
be enjoyned to do, which they
are by divorce <hi>à mensa &amp; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro:</hi>
The woman in that kind
is lyable to punishment for
not performing matrimonial
duties, and in case all means
used to reduce her to her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
prove ineffectual, 'tis wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
consideration, whether
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63883:74"/>
she may, not at last come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the equity of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direction
about desertion,
which is nothing as I take it,
relating to divorce or putting
away in that sense our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
speaks of it, but a help
that the Law of nature
(which is ever implyed in
all divine institutions) affords
to an innocent wronged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
unjustly forsaken, and
actually or perhaps virtually
put away, the Apostle says,
<hi>A brother or a sister <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
is not inslaved in such a case.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of this whole
matter is, our Saviour has in
the Gospel established a Law
for Divorce and Remarriage
in the single case of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63883:75"/>
instead of That liberty
given by <hi>Moses</hi> under the
Law, it must be proved that
he intended That part of the
Gospel as a rule to the Jews
only, which he never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any other part of it to be,
nor does any where say he
intended This to be, or else
the matter is determined.
Amongst the Jews never any
Divorce heard of without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to remarry, and it was
only intended for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<hi>Calvin</hi> upon that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<hi>(He that marries her
that is put away, commits
Adultery)</hi> speaks fully, says
he, This sentence hath been
most corruptly expounded by
many Interpreters, for they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63883:75"/>
thought generally and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
that is was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to live sole after Divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so, if the Husband
should put away the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teress,
of necessity They both
should live unmarried, as if
This were the liberty of
Divorcement, only to lye
away from the Wise, as if
also Christ did not evidently
in this case permit That to be
done, which the Jews were
wont generally to usurp unto
themselves according to their
own pleasure; Therefore
their errour was too gross, for
when Christ condemneth him
for Adultery that marries her
that is put away, 'tis certain
that this is to be understood
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63883:76"/>
of unlawful and frivolous
Divorcements.</p>
                  <p>By the Roman Laws all
Divorces admitted of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
marriage; In the Christian
Church in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it was so: Nor indeed
was Divorce ever thought of
any where but in order to a
second marriage, till this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement
of a Divorce <hi>à



mensa &amp; toro</hi> came in, the
effect of which in the Roman
Church, where it hath been
chiefly practised, has been
such as does no way credit it;
<hi>Cajetan,</hi> one of their own, is
so ingenuous, that upon the
19th. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> he saith,
<hi>Intelligo igitur ex hac Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
Jesu Christi l<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ge, licitum
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63883:76"/>
esse Christiano dimittere uxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
ob fornicationem carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
ipsius uxoris, &amp; posse ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
ducere;</hi> And a little after
adds, <hi>Non solum miror, sed
stupeo, quod Christo clarè ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiente
causam fornicatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,
torrens Doctorum non
admittat illam mariti liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</hi>
Wherever that kind
of Divorce has been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the consequence hath
most commonly been, that
the innocent party hath by
temptation fallen into sin, the
offending party into farther
transgression; for 'tis not a
thing probable or likely, that
such who would not live
chastely in a marryed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
should do so in a single
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63883:77"/>
condition, and at last greater
inconveniences and animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
have arisen from such a
separation and the parties ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rarely if ever again united.
It inslaves mankind into a
very sad dilemma, either to
lye in a polluted bed, and
yield to every impudent
Adulteress, (for so they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
grow at last, or else to
udnergo all those temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
men are subject to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Wife in a single and
unmarried condition: God
no where seems to have given
the <hi>woman</hi> such an advantage
over the Masculine Sex, as to
be able to intrap the Man in
such a snare.</p>

nature that can be brought to

                  <p>In the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63883:79"/>
passed to inable the King to

to reform Ecclesiastical
Laws; This in the 6 year of
<hi>Edward</hi> the sixth's Raign was
put in execution, and the
<hi>Quorum</hi> of them by letters
Patents reduced to eight,
they met and took great

Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,

and other the chief of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
<hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and other
eminent Divines, and the
most eminent Canonists, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians,
and Common-Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
then in the Kingdom,
they set forth a Book called
<hi>Reformatio legum Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum,</hi>
which we may well
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63883:79"/>
reckon the judgement of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> at That
time about those things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
composed by such men
impowred by the supream
Authority, and in That Book
the lawfulness of Divorce in
case of fornication and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage
upon it is fully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
and justified.</p>
                  <p>I shall only add, that
amongst learned men I find
great disagreement in resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Question, whether
the same right of Divorce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Woman that does
to the man; some say the
superiority of the Sex makes
this a peculiar prerogative to
the man, who is the head of
the Woman; `Tis certain, in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63883:80"/>
the Mosaical Law no such
thing as a Womans putting
away her Husband was ever
allowed, sometimes in fact it
was illegally and irregularly
practised, yet very rarely, we
find in all the Jewish Writers
but one instance, and that is
in <hi>Josephus;</hi> The Roman
Laws allowed it; Those who
espouse the Womans cause in
this point, urge that passage
of our Saviour in the 10th.
of <hi>Mark,</hi> where he saith
<hi>(And if a woman put away
her husband, and marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
she commits Adultery)</hi>
and so seems to make the
right of putting away equal;
<hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place saith
that although the Husband
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63883:80"/>
be superior in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
yet in the marriage-bed
the man and the woman
are equal, therefore saith he,
when as the Adulterer shall
fall away from the knot of
matrimony, the Wife is set
at liberty: they also urge
that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who saith,
in case of desertion a Brother
or a Sister is not bound; and
so seems to put the matter
between Man and Wife up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
even terms in all conjugal
respects. The Christian
Church affords us but two
instances that look this way;
The first of one <hi>Thecla,</hi> who
refused to marry one <hi>Thamy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
in <hi>Iconium,</hi> after she was
contracted to him; This
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63883:81"/>
story Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> relates at
large, from the report of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi>
of <hi>Selencia,</hi> but seems not
much to credit it himself,
however it was but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
Marriage after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> calls her
only <hi>Sponsa,</hi> and saith, <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptias
noluit, &amp; sponsalibus
renunciavit,</hi> and it was to
one that most bitterly detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christianity; The other
instance is that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Justine Martyrs</hi> first
Apology, where a Christian
woman made use of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Laws to put away her
Husband, and he commends
her for it, but that was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in case of desertion, for
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63883:81"/>
her Husband was a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
wicked person and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from her.</p>
                  <p>In this matter I shall make
much a better choice, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
