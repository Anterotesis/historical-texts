         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ithens at my returne from Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich (Right worshipfull) you vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to imparte vnto me your earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to vnderstand the order and manner how hir Maiestie was receyued into that worthy Citie: I am bold likewise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher vnto your worship what occasion offered themselues to me vpon the same your request. First appeared to me the Maiestie of my Prince, which beautifieth her kingdome, as the bright shining beames of beautiful <hi>Phoebus</hi> decketh forth the earth: which gladded the hartes of the people there, as they no lesse laboured to trauayle forth to view the excellency of their soueraigne, than the true labouring Bee enforceth hir self in the Spring tyme (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dame <hi>Flora</hi> first decketh the soile) to seeke their delights, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, amongst the sweete smelling floures. Then the aboundant clemencie of hir highnes, receyuing the loyall hartes of hir lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing people in parte, as good as their meaning deserued, so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed their former desires, as euery sparke kindled a bonfire. The Nobilitie delighting this Harmony, so endeuoured to hold in tune euery string of this heauenly Musike, as there semed but one hart in Queene, Counsaile, and Communaltie.

to holde on this happy beginning, the Prince had hir pleasure, the Nobilitie their desire, the whole traine such inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: As for the tyme of hir continuance there, Norwich seemed (if any such there be) a terrestriall Paradise. But when the frowning Friday folowed, which called hir Maiestie thence, I leaue (because I am loth to tel) the dolour that was, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of them that did see it. These all, right Worshipfull, vpon your demaund, presented themselues vnto me to be vttred, and these (I thinke) are the thinges which you desired to heare. And because I doubt not but that there are a great number of your vertuous mynd herein: to satisfie both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and you, I haue here set forth what my final capacitie could collect (touching the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses) during the whole tyme of hir abode there.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Saturday being the. xvj. of August. <hi>1578.</hi> and in the twentith yéere of the raigne of our most gratious soueraign Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by the grace of God Quéen of England, Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and Irelande, Defendor of the Faith. &amp;c. The same our moste dread and soueraigne Lady (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing hir Progresse in Norf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke) immediately after dinner set forward from Brakenashe, where she had dyned with the Ladye Style, béeyng fiue myles distant from Norwich, towardes the same hir most dutifull Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Sir <hi>Robert Wood,</hi> then Esquire, and nowe Knight, Maior of the same Citie, at one of the Clock the same happy day, sette forwarde to méete with hir Maiestie in this order: First there roade before him wel and séemly mounted, thréescore of the most comelie yong men of the Citie as Bachelers, apparelled all in blacke Sattyn doublets, blacke Hose, blacke Taffata Hattes and yeallowe Bandes, and their vniuersall liuerie was a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylion of purple Taffata, layde about with siluer Lace: and so apparelled, marched forwardes two and two in a ranke. Then one which represented King <hi>GVRGVNT,</hi> sometime King of Englande, which builded the Castle of <hi>Norwich,</hi> called <hi>Blanch Floure,</hi> and layde the foundation of the Citie. He was mounted vppon a braue Courser, and was thus furnished: His body Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:


<pb facs="tcp:6011:4"/>
his Bases of gréen and white silke: on his head a black vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet Hat, with a plume of white Feathers. There attended vpon him thrée Henchmen in white and gréene: one of them did beare his Helmet, the seconde his Tergat, the third his Staffe. After him a noble companye of Gentlemen, and wealthie Citizens in veluet Coates, and other costly furniture, brauely mounted. Then followed the Officers of the Citie euery one in his place. Then Maister Sword bearer, with the Sworde and Hatte of Maintainaunce. Then Maister Maior, and foure and twentye Aldermen, and Maister Recorder, al in Scarlet gownes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, so many as had bin Maiors of the Citie, and were Iustices, did weare their scarlet cloakes. Then followed so many as had bin Sherifs, and were no Aldermen, in violet Gowns, &amp; satten tippets. Then followed diuers other, to kéepe the people from disturbing the array aforesaide. Ths euery thing in due and comely order, they al (except <hi>GVRGVNT</hi> which stayed hir ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming within a flight shot or two of the city, where the Castle of <hi>Blaunche Flowre</hi> was in moste beautifull prospect) marched forwardes to a bridge, called <hi>Hartforde Bridge,</hi> the vttermoste lymit that way, distaunt from the Citie two miles or thereaboutes, to méete with hir Maiestie: who, within one houre or little more after their attendaunce, came in such gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Princely wife, as rauished the harts of all hir louing subiects, and might haue terrifyed the stoutest heart of any eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to beholde. Whether the Maiestie of the Prince, whiche is incomparable, or ioy of hir subiectes, which excéeded measure, were the greater, I thinke woulde haue appalled the iudgement of <hi>Apollo</hi> to define. The acclamations and cries of the people to the Almighty God for the preseruation of hir Maiesty, ratled so loude, as hardly for a great time coulde any thing be hearde: But at laste, as euery thing hath an ende, the noise appeased: &amp; Maister Maior saluted hir highnesse with the Oration follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, and yéelded to hir Maiestie there with the sworde of the Citie, and a faire standing cup of siluer and guilt, with a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

a thousand deathes with the safetie and preseruation as well of minde as bodie: for these thy singuler benefits of Godlinesse towards vs, and that wee liue vnder so good a tutor beeing magistrate in this the Citie of Norwich, which thy maiestie hath of elemencie granted vnto vs for a mansion place, which were banished for Christ his religion, &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer that we finde the mindes of the people fauourable towards vs, first we geue immortall thanks, not suche as we ought, but such as we are able vnto God the father, and the Lorde our only sauiour Iesus Christ, and then vnto thee most mercifull Queene.

Enuie being the desire of euill things, and couetousnesse of transitorie renowne, is often times the occasion of mans destruction: but touching the minde of Iosephus, the same was endued with suche temperance and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that he might be thought no lesse vniust then wicked, that would accuse him so much as with the least affection of reuengement: so wholly did he commit him self and all the gouernement of his life, his life, I say, put in hazard in a strange kingdom vnto the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that he seemed to hang of no other thing then the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will of God. But to what ende speake I this? Are not these selfe same things, and others their like (ô most excellent Queene) by the eyes of all men cleerely beholden in thee, and the order of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? What man (I say) hauing his wittes, can deny these thinges to be the most happie ioy, spirituall crowne, and cheefest ornament of Christes churche, and truely of this kingdome the princely beautie and perpetuall renowne? Thou surely doest followe moste hollily, the minde of Iosephus, by the singular goodnes of God, aswell in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing thy kingdome, as in amplifying the kingdome of Christe (ô thou most faithfull nourse of the churche of God:) for it is in God onely to destroy this man by prosperitie (as it seemeth vnto man) and aduaunce another by all kindes of aduersitie and humaine daunger: whome he acknowledgeth as the vessels of his mercie: and so by his goodnesse, together with the consolation and strength of his spirite, doth bring them to the happinesse of eternall life, which our petition

that good and mercifull God graunt may be ratified in establishing your maiestie and gouernance of your kingdom with spirituall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vnderstanding, in preseruing the same for many yeres, and in induing your maiesties subiectes more and more with true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, for his sonnes sake our Lorde Iesus Christ.

notable mercie of your highnesse, most renowmed Queene, &amp; vncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible readinesse to releeue the neede of poore men, then the which of many vertues none can be more acceptable vnto God, as Homer wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, neither any vertue in a mightie Prince more wondered at amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest men. This hospitall of poore men is moste famous, whiche will be a monument of princely vertue and beneficence amongest all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, instituted by the moste mightie King Henry your highnesse father, confirmed with the great seale, by the moste noble King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your brother, but by your maiestie whiche deserueth no lesse praise, of late notably encreased and amplified by the landes &amp; pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of Cringleforde, that you may not nowe worthily reioyce so much in others ornamentes, as your owne vertues. For you are saide for your singular wisedome and learning, to haue studied that diuine lawe of the moste wise Plato, which he left written in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth booke of lawes. Such your great bountie therefore, so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and incredible mercie (O most vertuous Prince) in what books shall wee comprehende? with what dueties, or with what voice shall wee testifie the good will of a thankfull minde? For when wee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently seeke all the moste exquisite and curious meanes of thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing: wee cannot so much as attaine vnto the greatnesse of this one benefite, by the which we acknowledge our selues bounde &amp; streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holden to your moste royall maiestie. We shalbe ouercome, euen with this one and singular benefite, so muche the lesse hope haue wee then in any point to counteruaile the huge Sea of the rest of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites which ouerfloweth on euery side aswell publikely and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ouer all thy Subiectes, as properly and particularly vppon this Citie. We certeinly nowe inhabite, and lead our liues in those most happie Ilands of the which Hesiodus maketh mention, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abounde with all manner of graine, woll, cattell, and other aydes of mans life, but much more with the moste precious treasure of true religion and the worde of God, in the which onely the mindes of men haue rest and peace. There be that call Englande another worlde, which I thinke may bee moste true in this our age: For whereas all landes on euery side of vs are afflicted with most greuous warres, &amp; tossed with the floudes of dissention, we onely, your highnesse gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our sterne, do saile in a moste peaceable hauen, and seuered from the worlde of mischiefes, do seeme after a sorte to bee taken vp into a heauen of happinesse.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. VVhich verse <hi>Gellius</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner expoundeth: That of sorrows &amp; pleasures there be changes, that it cannot be well euery daye with vs, but this day well, and that day yl. And surely, that nothing hath bin at any time more gallauntly or truely spoken, both the continuall course of mans vncertaine estate, and the often alterations wherto he is subiect, manifestly declare, beside that, this present day giueth euident proofe thereof. For, the most ioyfull comming of your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, did not so muche recreate and comforte vs in our daylye desire and longing, as we are discouraged by this your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whereto we see preparation made on al hands. And as all ages and degrees receyued your Maiestie, with ioy and gladnes at your comming: so there is not one but lamenteth and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at your graces going. And doubtlesse for my part, bycause myne owne hart is best knowne to my selfe, I protest that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tooke vppon me a greater charge, then that, wherewyth at this present I am burthened: not onely to speake face to face with a most learned lady and princesse, which notwithstanding is, of it self, a harde and a busie matter: but, which is much more, that to me is befalle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sad and sorowful office of leaue taking. For, who woulde not be exceedingly greeued, to see the thing which he principallye desired, in a verye shorte time, and as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, at an instant taken away, before he might haue therof full fruition? How lamentable a thing is it, to pul away sucking babes from the breastes and bosomes of their most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing


<pb facs="tcp:6011:24"/>
mothers? That sonnes and fathers, through some miserable misfortune, shoulde be sundered? Yet I notwithstanding am of opinion, that nature hath not ingendered in any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, such large loue, and so great good will, no not towarde them whom they haue begotten, or of whom they themselues haue bene begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as is the loue and good will wherewith we aduaunce, obey, and reuerence your Maiestie, being the mother and nurse of this whole Common welth, and Countrie. Great is the force of friendshippe and familiaritie, which oftentimes bringeth to passe, that they, which eyther by some kinde of fellowshippe, or by an accustomed condition of life, in tracte of time haue bin closely knitte, and so become both of one minde, and as it were growne togither, that hard and scant they may be seperated, &amp; set in sunder. Hereof sprang the faithfulnesse of <hi>Theseus,</hi> comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the mouth and monumentes of all men: and the entier friendshippe of innumerable more, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no daungers, nor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, eyther by sea or land, coulde sequester from their sweete society &amp; comfortable company, with whom they long had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And what desires, or what delightes haue any where bin founde, that may be compared with the sincere affection, and vnfayned good wil, which we beare to your Highnesse, moste excellent Princesse? These are not sufficiente shewes of our fayth and beneuolence, which is much greater, than that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of any learned man, or that the slendernesse of my witte and capacitie maye make it manifest. Nature at no tyme tyed any thyng with a straighter knotte, or set seueral things at greater agreement, than the soule and the bodie: a declaration wherof is, the incredible consent and concorde of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, the mutual care and regard of succouring each other resting in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both: and the grieuous departing, at the houre of death, the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other remayning in them both. But we whiche professe Christian religion and godlynesse, haue learned this lesson, not only to loue our countrye, but also hir highnesse, in whom the health and safetie of our countrey consisteth, farre aboue the valiaunt <hi>Decij,</hi> the <hi>Scaeuolae</hi> the <hi>Curtij,</hi> which ventured their liues for the Common wealth of Rome: yea, to loue hir grace much


<pb facs="tcp:6011:25"/>
better than our owne liues. For, what is he that woulde doubt to dye for hir sake, who if she were not, he should be constrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to abide a bondage much more bitter than death? Neyther is this faithfull loue of vs your subiectes (most excellente Queene) lightly layde vp in our heartes, and scarcely couered as it were in the ground, but deepely rooted, so that by no stormes nor tempestes of Fortune it can be shaken, by no engines ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, by no force or violence vndertroden. For how muche maketh it for the establishmente of faith and loue, in that we know your Maiestie hath obteyned regimente and rule, not at the pleasure and appoyntmente of wauering Fortune, but by right of inheritance, that is to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: nor that the Homericall Iuppiter <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but that the maker and Creator of all things delyuered it into your Highnesse handes? And therefore a singular neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of obedience is layde vpon vs, euen by God himselfe, least in Giant guise as it is feygned, we set shoulder against God, and being at defiance with him most wickedly, bidde him battell. When we beholde those excellent and diuine benefites, whiche youre grace hathe bestowed vpon the common wealthe, in so much that among manye, yea innumerable Countreys, and nations vnder the Sunne, none (I will not saye maye bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before vs) but not so much as one may be compared with vs. Ought not then a singulare loue and good will to be linc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with that lawe, and necessitie of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? For what should I make rehearsall of full twenty yeares, wherein we haue liued in such peace and tranquilitie, as not only this our age hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seene the like, but as in olde recordes and aunciente Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of all ages and people, is no where mentioned? What shoulde I call to memorie hurlyburlies foreseene a farre off, as from an espyall: exceeding great daungers, not only perceyued by wisedome, but also preuented by counsell: secrete snares, and priuie practises disappoynted, not to muche by violence, as by policie: finally, all Treacherous attemptes, and Rebellious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, with great gladnesse and reioicing extinguished, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tumult at all, or very little (doúbtlesse) insuing among


<pb facs="tcp:6011:25"/>
the people? These things might make vs (although your Grace were otherwise than you are) performe all dutie of fayth and loue, with most willing mindes to your Maiestie. Nowe, for so muche as we haue your highnesse, our mercifull and bountifull Soueraigne, who possessing principalitie and royall regimente, doest not swarue an heares breadth from iustice and equitie, what is he for a man so sauage and obstinate, whome these so singulare and rare vertues may not allure to all loue and allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Wherefore, if the surest safetie of Princes is the faith of their subiectes (as we haue heard very wise men holde opinion) what can be more safe, what can be more sure, than your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, which the studies and endeauoures of your people, being so great, haue fenced and fortifyed? I haue made mine Oration the longer (most noble Queene) to the intent we might the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger enioy your comfortable presence, from the whiche, to oure great griefe and sorow, we shall depart. But bycause lucke must be borne, which can not be auoyded, least I might seeme more than is meete to delay youre Graces progresse, whiles I am in hand to please mine owne humour, I will make an ende. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Maiestie, whose presence this day will shutte from our sight, we will notwithstanding in your absence behold and reuerence, we will loue youre Highnesse with all oure heartes, mindes, and endeauoures: we will most dutyfully obey youre Graces Lawes and Commaundementes.
