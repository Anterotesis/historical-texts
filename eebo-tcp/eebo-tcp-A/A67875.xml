            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PErhaps thou art not ignorant that I set forth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pamphlet intituled, <hi>A Justification of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Schoolmen;</hi> the drift whereof was to shew That the generally received opinion of the <hi>Privative Nature of sin,</hi> was neither so absurd nor so impious as it had been represented by a <hi>Luxuriant</hi> pen. After about a twelve moneths labour and travail Mr. <hi>T. P.</hi> conceived and brought forth something which he called the <hi>Discoverer Discovered,</hi> elemented of such palpable untruths, as did scarce ever drop from the pen of any person pretending to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or ingenuity. In way of Appendix to that monstrous peece, something was added relating to me, but so worded and managed, as if the Authors design had been only to make an essay, whether it were not possible when he despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to subdue my judgment by reason, at least to conquer my patience by clamour. I had hoped, that after he had shot so many bitter words against my credit and reputation, we should


<pb facs="tcp:119770:3"/>
at last have received something from him savouring if not of the meekness of a Christian, yet of the Candor of a Scholar. But contrary to my desire I still find him <hi>foaming out his own shame;</hi> and as is the nature of seducers, <hi>waxing worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</hi> In such a case what is most adviseable? Should I pay him with words as bad as he brings? that were impossible; unless I would have been at the charges to keep and maintain for some time a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor at <hi>Billings-gate. 2.</hi> If such a course had pleased some wanton wits, yet it must needs have much displeased the more sober and judicious, to whom I must strive to approve my self and my writings. Should I chastise the folly of the man with a more innocent satyr? Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> hath so done, and what is the effect of it? why, (after an Apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Parenthesis for bringing so unclean a thing into a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans presence) he is arraigned before the Tribunal of Mris. <hi>Peito,</hi> and is told, that it is the honour of her Sex that they read Mr. <hi>P's</hi> writings, and the shame of ours that we so much slight them: in which way, if Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> should follow him, it would be such a peece of — as scarse hath had its parallel since the time that the two Kings after some years fighting about Religion, left the controversie at last to be decided by the fisti-cuffs of their two — For what though Mris. <hi>Peito</hi> be a gentlewoman made up of grace, and every thing that may render her amiable (as I believe she is) yet being but a Gentlewoman, she cannot well be presumed to be a meet Umpire in so great a Controversie as that of Gods Decrees. Shall I therefore take notice of the Argumentative part of his book? then there's nothing for me to do, he having never ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to make the least assault on the rational part of my book; save that he once saith, That I make no difference betwixt an action and a quality: and why so? because, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, I say, <hi>the Action of hatred;</hi> as if they who say, the act of Adultery, or <hi>actus adulterii</hi> in Latine, do present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make adultery not a quality but an action. The folly of such reasonings are already made manifest; but the huge plot


<pb facs="tcp:119770:3"/>
is to make the world believe I am a <hi>Compilator,</hi> a <hi>Plagiary.</hi> Is this worth writing a book about? then sure we are <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digi temporis, cujus solius honesta est avaritia.</hi> If Mr. <hi>P.</hi> be of the temper of the Cardinal in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who said, That he could willingly consent to a Reformation, but only he liked not that it should be brought about by means of such a poor Monk as <hi>Luther:</hi> or if he have any thing of the humour of <hi>Bucephalus</hi> in him, who would be mounted by none but <hi>Alexander.</hi> If he can be content to acknowledg that his cause is fallen to the gronnd, I can easily so far gratifie his ambition, as to let it be thought that the blow was given by a learneder hand then my own. Let Mr. <hi>P.</hi> have as low thoughts of me as he pleaseth; I shall alwayes endeavour to have low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thoughts of my self. I daily more and more see how far I fall short not only of what others have attained unto, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of what I my self might have attained, had I but spent my time with that diligence and industry which for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I shall aim at. Yet shall I not altogether leave that blot which Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and his egregious advocates Dr. <hi>H.</hi> and <hi>M. O.</hi> have let fall, to dry on my name. I am charged to have played the Plagiary, and to make good the charge Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath employed I know not how many hands to pick up any words or phrases that they could meet with in any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour that had affinity with my words and phrases; and when they were so picked, to fagot them up together, with an intent that they may by him be made publick for my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. Had he made it appear that I had borrowed any set continued discourse from any Author, he had then, though not helped his own cause, yet sufficiently disgraced me. But seeing he only chargeth me with taking here and there a quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and applying it to my purpose, naming the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour though not the second: the matter is not much if the charge were true. Whether it be so or no will shortly be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Were I a Plagiary, I should not be alone; others and those none of the meanest, are impeached of the like crime,

Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> hath observed many examples hereof among the Greeks, and <hi>Plinie</hi> in his Preface spcaketh very plainly, that conferring his Authors, and comparing their works  together; he generally found those that went before <hi>verbatim</hi> transcribed by those that followed after and their original never so much as mentioned. To omit how much the wittiest peece of <hi>Ovid</hi> is beholding unto <hi>Partheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Chius;</hi> even the magnified Virgil hath borrowed almost in all his works: in his <hi>Eclogues</hi> from <hi>Theocritus,</hi> his <hi>Georgicks</hi> from <hi>Hesiod</hi> and <hi>Aratus,</hi> his <hi>AEneads</hi> from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> the second Book whereof containing the exploit of <hi>Sinon,</hi> and the <hi>Troian</hi> Horse (as <hi>Macrobius</hi> observeth) he hath <hi>Verbatim,</hi> derived from <hi>Pisander.</hi> Our own proses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is not excusable herein. Thus <hi>Oribasus, Etius,</hi> and <hi>AEgineta</hi> have in a manner transcribed <hi>Galen.</hi> But <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus Empiricus,</hi> who hath left a famous work, <hi>de medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentis</hi> hath word for word, transcribed all <hi>Scribonius</hi>

The same <hi>Keckerman</hi> also somwhere tells us, the censures passed upon <hi>Aristodes</hi> Logick by <hi>Ramus</hi> are most of them taken out of <hi>Ludovicus Vives;</hi> and that the <hi>Methodus Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiae</hi> made by <hi>Hyperius,</hi> was reprinted under the name of <hi>Laurentius Villavincentius</hi> an Augustinian Monk. It is a most undoubted truth, that the commentaries of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, especially of the Jesuits, do owe very much to <hi>Bucer, Mercer, Bullinger, Lavater, Beza, Calvin.

Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> stands charged by Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> for having stoln all his supposition out of Bellarmine, and that with so little Art, that the whole school could not but take notice of it. The learned Dr. <hi>Downham,</hi> is said by his answerer to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his arguments for Episcopacy out of Bishop <hi>Bilson;</hi> Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> indeed hath told us, that the day was yet to come, in the which he ever read word of any of Arminius his works, but his antagonists have shewed the same Testimonies and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities commended by one and the other: and not to disturb

Dr. <hi>Jer.

            <p>I have sufficiently proved that if I am guilty of what Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and Dr. <hi>H.</hi> charge me with, yet I am not the first that did offend in this kind. But I farther plead, Not guilty to the accusation; and do here confidently aver, That what he chargeth me to have borrowed from Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> I borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not from him, but took from the books that I quote them out of: those questions and answers in the Bible printed <hi>1607.</hi> I saw and read before I knew there was such a Tract in the world as Mr. <hi>Prynnes Anti-Armin.</hi> and all my Fathers house can bear me witness, that they are in the very Bible that we constantly made use of as oft as we read Chapters in the Family. And I must now inform Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> That he is much mistaken if he think (what he would feign have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think) that those questions and answers are no older then <hi>1607.</hi> for I my self can direct him to a Bible printed twenty years before that time, that hath them, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bibles there may be older than that, I know not: as for the Act Quest.

C.</hi> knows, for he lent it me; Mr. <hi>Burscough</hi> of <hi>B.

I also profess that I read Dr. <hi>John Bridges,</hi> and took not his words upon Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> credit, and so I did the works of <hi>T. F.</hi> and <hi>B. Balaeus</hi> also I consulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Ancient Protestant Divines, thence I had their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and this as it proves, our Library-keeper can witness,

for I came to him to direct me to that book, having searched for it among the Divinity, whereas it is placed among the Humanity books. Now after I had taken all this pains, and trusted nothing but my own eyes, was I bound to tell the world that such quotations might be found in Mr. <hi>Prynne?</hi> Yet I have made use of his History of the Tr. of the <hi>A.</hi> and have acknowledged my self so to have done; or if I had made no such acknowledgment, yet all would have thought that I had lighted my candle at his Historie, no man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving written those transactions but himself: As for what he chargeth me to have stolen from Dr. <hi>W.</hi> or Mr. <hi>M.</hi> or Mr. <hi>Good.</hi> I am told that they are but sentences or Apothegmes; and truly it is hard that a man should be bound if he have read a sentence or Apothegme twenty times to quote the last Author. Let any one in the behalf of those Gentlemen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead me, and if it be made appear that I have used any thing that is properly theirs, and not given them the credit, I shall soon acknowledg my fault and cry them pardon. As for a phrase or expression I labour not to acquit my self, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is not possible to read an Author but that something of his stile will stick upon the memory, and ming'e it self with whatever a man shall write, till those impressions are blotted out. I thank God that whatever I am defective in, yet I did never find my self at any great loss for sit and apt words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the conceptions of my mind.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the world may expect that I should take notice of a late Whifler who notifieth himself by two letters, <hi>M.

book did never put me into a fit of the toothach; and all my Scholars will say, That I never forewarned any of them from reading of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> his book: The Printer and Stationer know that the Review was never intended to come forth in my name; yea, that it was almost off the Press before Mr. <hi>P.</hi> his book came to <hi>Oxon.</hi> And therefore that poor Creature hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but only gratified the Devil by raising groundless ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies; and I heartily wish he may have time and grace to see how much he hath abused not only me, but himself in so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate an attempt.</p>
            <p>As for the following Tract, the Lord knows, and some men do know, that I send it into the world with a very unwilling mind. For I know they are mostly my superiours upon whose writings I have made Animadversions. I know that my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking may possibly be interpreted a sounding of an Alarum to War, whereas it becomes us to study all possible wayes and means of accord and reconciliation, that so our pens and hearts may be united against the common adversaries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, Papists and Atheists, &amp;c. But I consider that well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning people are drawn into opinions Diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the Doctrine by Law and Authority established a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and that by those who esteeme themselves the only obedient sons of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore thought it not amiss to let our Country-men understand, that the plants they so greedily feed upon, are exotick, not planted by our first Reformers; and that it is a sad sign their temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution is altered, if they can digest such Positions as I have manifested old Protestants would have nauseated. All along thou hearest men speaking in their own words, and therefore certainly no wrong is done them; if their meaning be mistaken; I hope it will teach them to express themselves more warily, and to abstain not only from that which is Popery, but also from every thing that hath the appearance of it. If any of them will so far take notice of what I have done, as to give a fair reconciliation of their sayings to our <hi>Artic. Homil.</hi>

               <hi>But alas! it is but too evident that some of our Canterburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (<hi>I call them so not to disgrace, but to distinguish them</hi>) <hi>have removed the old Land-marks placed by our Protestant Forefathers, and are gone over into the Tents and Camps of our adversaries. It was of old reckoned Popery to hold,</hi> That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was borbn free of Original sin; <hi>we have now one risen up among us who holds that, and holds also that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one else is born so too: Who also maintains,</hi> That she ever kept a dominion over her Passions, which never had been taught to rebel beyond the meer possibilities of Natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection <hi>Gr. Ex. p.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>He entitleth her,</hi> To a Faith that had no scruple: <hi>And that,</hi> Though she was Espoused to an honest and just person of her Kinred and Family, and so might not dispair to become a Mother, yet she was a person of so rare sanctity, and so mortified a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that for all this desponsation of her, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of her parents, and the Custome of the Nation, she had not set one step forward toward the consummation of her Marriage so much as in thought, and possibly had set her self back from it by a Vow of Chastity and holy celibate. <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>p.</hi> 19. <hi>We are further told,</hi> Of her being brought up in the Temple eleven years in her childhood, <hi>p.</hi> 22.

which is not denyed by any Protestant, but will abuse Scripture to prove it; <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Ezek. 44. 2.</hi> p. <hi>27. &amp; Ibid.</hi> He adopts the uncertain conceit of <hi>Christs being laid in a Manger between Sheep and Oxen:</hi> and for this quotes <hi>Hab. 3. 4.</hi> whence no such thing is deducible. And p. <hi>28.</hi> he writes in favour of Vows of Poverty; for he saith, <hi>That many wise men make such Vows:</hi> whereas no wise man did ever make such a Vow, or if he did, the making of the Vow was no part of his Wisdom. Ile not follow that Author any further, though seeing his books are so greedily bought up by our Gentry, it would be pains well spent if some one who abounds with leisure, would pick up his Popish passages, that the world might see what a kind of man he is whom they so much admire. For my part I think I could produce hundreds of Papists that were less Popish then he; though I do not take him to be a perfect, through-paced Tridentine Papist. Nor would I be thought to impute all his opinions to every one with whom I deal in the ensuing Tract; they are not all of a mind in all things: But they have all (if I mistake not) departed more or less from the Protestant Doctrine, by which means the Papists will be hardned in their errors, and some scandal be cast on our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>

               <hi>1.</hi> I have observed they are hugely nncharitable to those that are of a different mind from them, though in smaller matters. 'Tis notorious that they have unchurched all the Transmarine Churches for want of such an Officer as they are not convinced that Christ did ever Institute: And 'tis also well known that Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> condemns those Churches of great impiety which do not observe Christmas.</p>

               <hi>2.</hi> They do pretend great Antiquity for their Opinions; whereas if all things were well observed and examined, no such Antiquity could be pleaded. I had thought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplisie this in Mr. <hi>Montagues</hi> Discourse about the time of Christs Nativity, but that is already done to my hand by <hi>Gis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

Veter. p. <hi>163.</hi> thus declares himself, <hi>The Lent Fast was not alone of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial use to the advancement of true godliness and increase of Piety, but also of such reverend Antiquity, that it hath good right and title to be reckoned among the Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been recommended to the Church of God.</hi> To prove this he alledgeth the Canons of the Apost. <hi>Can. 69.</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> But he might have done well to consider that of <hi>August. Epist. 86. ad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul.</hi> As for the authorities he quoteth, they are both spurious, as is proved by the most learned <hi>Usher.

            <p>Therefore when ever thou sindest Antiquity pleaded mark well, and by comparing Editions enquire whether that which is brought be as ancient as is pretended, and not something foisted into the writings of the Ancients by men of later times. See also whether the Testimonies do prove that for which they are produced: for it would be great weakness to think that every Father who mentioneth or commendeth Episcopacy, doth presently allow or approve of such an Episcopacy as did here obtain in <hi>England,</hi> and as some would fain have restored. The question is not whether Antiquity had Bishops, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Antiquity did believe a Bishop to be of a superior order to a Presbyter; and if that were proved, it would be a second question whether that superiority of order were founded on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Divine institution; and if it could be proved that there is a Divine Institution of and for a Bishop, it may still be questioned whether that divine institution do make him so necessary and essential to Ordination, that any Ordination which is made by meer Presbyters is <hi>in naturâ rei,</hi> null and void. I am fully convinced that Imposition of hands is a Rite no way to be omitted in Ordination; yet if any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that Ceremony to have been proper and peculiar to the Apostolical times, should omit it, I should be loath to say that the person Ordained without it was no true Minister; there are examples for many things in Scripture for which there is no precept; and there may be <hi>necessitas praecepti</hi> for many things which yet are not necessary <hi>necessitate medii: multa fieri non debuerunt quae tamen facta valuerunt.</hi> I conclude all with an earnest desire and prayer, That such a spirit of Love may be poured out upon us, as <hi>that whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have already attained we may walk by the same rule,</hi> and bear with one another in those lesser things in which we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;

And I conceive, That from that time forwards the names and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of some leading men of the foraign Churches, which till then did carry all before them, did begin to lessen: Divines growing every day more willing to free themselves from that servitude &amp; vassalage, to which the authority of those names had enslaved their judgements: But so, that no man had the courage to make such a general assault against the late received opinions, as Bishop <hi>Mountague,</hi> though many when the ice was broken, followed gladly after him. <hi>Dr. Heylin  Preface to Theologia Veterum.</hi>

               <p>There are divers places of Scripture containing in them mysteries and questions of great concernment, and yet the fabrick and constitution is such, that there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mark to determine whether the sense of them should be literal or figurative, nothing in the nature of the thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the sense and meaning, but it must be got out as it can; and therefore it is unreasonable, that what is in it self ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous should be understood in its own prime sense and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the pain of either a sin or Anathema: I instance in that place, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> the words are plain and apt to be understood in a literal sense, which yet doth violence to reason; but if you expound these words figuratively, besides that you contest against a world of prejudices, you give your self the liberty, which if others should take, when they have either a reason or necessity so to do, they may perhaps turn all into Allegory, and so may evacuate any precept, and elude  any Argument. <hi>Lib.

As for the two places you instance in, the sense of them is quite mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Papists, as our reformed Divines undeniably prove; and me thinks the Romanists should easily yield they are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or else they must needs leave themselves under horrible doubts about their eternal salvation; for if they that dye unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised go to some part of Hell, and none are baptised but those

whom the Priest had an intention of baptizing when he sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them with, or dipped them in water, how many of them must lose the joys of Heaven on that account?

               <p>For a thing to be true, <hi>i. e.</hi> to have a being either potential or actual, depends partly on Gods power, partly on his will; in respect of its potential being, it depends on his power; in respect of its actual, on his will. Now Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though it may in some sense be said communicable to the creature, because all ability in the creature is a gleam of infinite ability in God, yet is not this so communicated as his Justice or Goodness was said to be; for goodness in the creature is a kind of image truly resembling the goodness in God, and that a kind of natural image, as is the face in the glass; not a voluntary one, which hath its being from the variable will of the Artificer. But power in the creature, is not thus a natural image of Gods power, but as reflection of a thing, which voluntarily and variously casts its beams: Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, I say, because the dispensing of his power, either in manner or measure, is a free act of his will; and variously, because he doth it, first unequally, and secondly not so to any, but that he can (and sometimes doth) withdraw or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend it, when it is bestowed, so that I cannot say, that as that which is just in God to be done, is just to be done by the creature; so what is possible to be done by God, is possible to be done by the creature; the reason of the not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of Gods power to the creature as well as his justice, may be this because it conduced not to the end of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures creation, as the other did: for though God intended to make a creature truly good and just, yet he did not truly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful.  <hi>Reas.

               <p>Here are sundry things which I cannot digest 1 I do not see, but that the creature is truly powerful as well as truly just or good; if that power which is in the creature be true power, then it denominates the creature truly power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. 2 Nor secondly, Do I see but that goodness is as the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a thing which voluntarily and variously casts its beams, as well as power; for doth not God communicate his goodness unequally as well as his power? 3. I dare not say, that what is just in God to be done, is just to to be done by the creature; To let a creature starve, whom it was in my power to relieve, it would not be just in me, but it is just in God, he being not so


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119770:24"/>
bound to the creature as I am. And 4. I must from all conclude, that as the reason of the creature apprehends many things to be impossible, which yet are possible; so it may also apprehend sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things not to be just which yet are just; as the <hi>Stulta Dei sunt credenda,</hi> so the <hi>Impia Dei sunt facienda;</hi> that which our reason counts folly, is to be believed; that which it counts wicked, to be done.</p>

               <p>This doth not satisfie. Those words (things ordained of them as necessary to salvation, have neither strength nor authority, unless) do suppose that it is not impossible for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council to determine those points to be necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which are not; and if so, why not also those not to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary which are? Besides, the reason assigned is, because they are an assembly of men, whereof all are not governed by the Spirit and Word of God. Now I would argue thus; May a General Council consist of men not guided by the Spirit, or may it not? If you say it may not, I ask, what assurance have you that there shall never be an Assembly made up of such men?

should be for ever at so much peace for this sin, that a man shall never give one groan for his share of guilt in <hi>Adams</hi> sin, unless some or other scare him with an impertinent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; Why (I say) the Conscience should not naturally be afflicted for it, nor so much as naturally know it?

               <speaker>Laud.</speaker>
               <p>One cause of the Universal Iniquity of the world is, because our Nature is so hard put to it in many instances: not because Nature is originally corrupted, but because Gods Laws command such things which are a restraint to the indifferent and otherwise lawful inclinations of nature. I instance in the matters of Temperance, Abstinence, Patience, Humility, Self-denyal and Mortification. But more particularly thus; A man is naturally inclined to desire the company of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he fancies, this is naturally no sin; for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral desire was put into us by God and therefore could not be evil. But then God as an instance and tryal of our obedience, put fetters upon the indefinite desire and determined us to one woman; which provision was enough to satisfie our need but not all our possibility: This therefore he left as a reserve, that by obeying God in the so reasonable restraint of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral desire, we might give him something of our own. But then


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119770:26"/>
it is to be considered, that our unwillingness to obey in this instance, or in any of the other, cannot be attributed to Original sin, or natural disability derived as a punishment from <hi>Adam,</hi> because the particular instances were postnate a long time to the fall of man; and it was for a long time lawful to do some things which now are unlawful: But our unwillingness and aversness came by occasion of the Law coming cross upon our nature, not because our nature is contrary to God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God was pleased to super-induce some Commandments contrary to our nature: For if God had commanded us to eat the best meats and drink the richest Wines as long as they could please us and were to be had; I suppose, it will not be thought, that Original sin would hinder us from obedience. But because we are forbidden to do some things which naturally we desire to do and love, therefore our nature  is hard put to it; and this is the true state of the difficulty. <hi>Unum.

               <p>I am neither taken with the Logick nor Divinity of this discourse: not with the Logick; for whereas you should have given us an account of the Universal wickedness of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, you only give us an account of some carnal wickednesses; whereas you cannot but know, that men do universally defile themselves with the pollutions of the spirit as well as of the flesh; men are prone to hypocrisie and lying, &amp;c. How comes this about? Is it because Gods Law layeth restraint in these instances on the natural and lawful inclinations of men? But I am somewhat more displeased with the Divinity of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; for you seem to me all along to excuse mens corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and lay all the blame of their wickedness on the Laws of God, which certainly are holy, just and good. There's no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but the nature of fallen man would readily enough obey such a law as should command to eat the best meat, and drink the richest Wines as long as they could please us and were to be had; but such a law would be a wicked law: The query is, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter of Gods Law doth consist mostly of things that are good, before commanded, why the men of the world do not close with them?

A man would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most think, that you do strike in with those who hold no <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones boni &amp; mali aeternas &amp; indispensabiles,</hi> but think that all moral good and evil depends wholly on the free and arbitrary volition and constitution of God; so that there's no action so intrinsecally good, but it might have been made evil; no action so intrinsecally evil, but it might have been made good if God had so pleased: which opinion if you should hold, you would thereby destroy the certainty of all Christian Religion; for if God may, if he so please, will the deceiving of the creature, how know I but he hath?

               <p>As it had a little image of Repentance, so it had something of Promises, to be as a grace and auxiliary to set forward Obedience. But this would not do it, the Promises were temporal, and that could not secure Obedience in great instances; and there being for them no remedy appointed by Repentance, the Law could not justifie, it did not promise life Eternal, nor give sufficient security against the temporal,  only it was brought in as a paedagogy for the present necessity.

then to receive them as a quit-rent from the hands of men, in testimony that they held their estates from him as the Supreme Landlord; for though this may be held as to Sacrifices Eucharistical, yet there was another sort which we may call Expiatory, ordained by God himself as the Types and Figures of that one only real and propitiatory Sacrifice, which was to be performed in the death of Christ; yet were they not bare Types and Figures that had no efficacy in themselves, but such efficacy as they had was not natural to them, but either in reference to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be made of Christ, or else extrinsecal by the Divine Ordinance and Institution of Almighty God; and that they might be so in this last respect, there want not very pregnant reasons in the Word of God; for whereas God, considered as the Supreme Law-giver, had imposed a Commandment on man under pain of death, although it stood not with his wisdom to reverse the Law, which with such infinite wisdom had bin first ordained, yet it seemed very sutable to his grace and goodness to commute the punishment and satisfie himself with the death of Beasts, offered in Sacrifice unto him by that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creature. <hi>Id p.</hi> 93. &amp; <hi>p.</hi> 95. for ought appeareth to the contrary, the Sacrifices both before and under the Law, had in themselves a power of Propitiation by vertue of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Institution of Almighty God, and not a relative vertue only in reference to the All-sufficient Sacrifice of our  Saviour Christ.</p>

The government of <hi>Israel</hi> was a Theocracy, and God who would have any other laws made with cruelty, would not make his own laws without merciful condescension to the infirmity of men: therefore as he would not let those sins go unpunished for which Sacrifices were appointed, so he would not have all offenders cut off by

the hand of justice, but mercifully appointed a commutation, that not the sinner, but the Beast should be slain, and the slaying of the Beast did procure a man immunity from that death temporal, which else would have been inflicted on the offendor in that Common-wealth; but that God ever made any Institution or Ordination, that upon the offering of a Sacrifice, without respect to Christ the Anti-type, sin should be forgiven in the Court of Conscience or of Heaven, that (with the common consent of Divines) I deny; you that say he did, must show us where any such Ordination or Institution is recorded.</p>

               <p>All this goeth quite against the hair with me; I do not think that the Affirmative Precepts of the Gospel for the measure, are left under our liberty and choice to signifie our greater love: Whatever the Law of the Gospel requires us to do, it requireth that we do it <hi>cum omni valdè,</hi> in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and measure: Nor doth he keep the Commandment that is not unmerciful, for the very Commandment is, that a man open his hand and heart and give plentifully to the poor; he that sows plentifully shall reap more plentifully than he that sows but sparingly, not because he doth more then the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requireth, but because that merciful God who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to reward the least grace with Heaven, hath yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to reserve higher Mansions in Heaven for those that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip their fellow Christians in zeal; nor is it acceptable to God that a man should quit the possessions of the world to follow Christ, except it so happen that a man cannot follow Christ and keep the possessions of the world too, and if such a case hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, I trow the Law of the Gospel requireth that a man should rather forsake the world then not follow Christ; if a man do not follow Christ to the forsaking all he hath, when he is by providence called so to do, he performeth not all his duty; if you gainsay this, you introduce counsels of perfection and works of supererogation, quite contrary to the Articles of our Church. <hi>Artic.</hi> 14. <hi>Voluntary works besides over and above Gods Commandments, which they call works of supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety; for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to do do, but that they do more for his sake than of bounden duty is required, whereas Christ saith plainly; when ye have done all that are commanded you, say, we be unprofitable servants.</hi>

               <p>If this be all you can say, I shall never be troubled that bowing towards the Altar is disused; for when you say, that in the Altar 'tis <hi>hoc est Corpus meum,</hi> either you mean that it is the Body of Christ in a gross carnal way or in a spiritual Sacrament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way; if in a gross carnal way, you shall excuse me if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not swallow that opinion, in defiance and detestation of which our Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes did lose their lives: If you mean only in a Sacramental way; is not the bloud of Christ and whole Christ, and so by consequence his Body exhibited and represented to us in Baptism as well as in the Supper? Why then were men enjoyned rather to worship towards the Table or the Eucharistical Bread, then towards the Baptismal water or the Baptistery? Besides, when there was no Sacrament, there was upon the Table or Altar neither the Body of Christ nor any sacred Symbole of Christ; nay if there were a Sacrament, yet I hope the Bread was not in any sense the Body of Christ till it was consecrated by the Word and Prayer; but as I take it, we were bound to bow towards the Table, not only when there was a Sacrament, and after the consecration of the Elements, but


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119770:35"/>
at all times. And when the Sacrament was administred in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houses, might not it be said, that there it was <hi>hoc est Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum?</hi> and yet I trow men were not under obligation to bow towards that Table upon which the Bread did stand when it was consecrated? This sufficiently invalidateth your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore I need not further ask whether that honor which you expressed by bowing towards the Altar were civil or divine and religious, though which soever part you should choose, you would run into most grievous absurdities and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.

               <p>Here are sundry things, wherein you seem to me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from our Church and from Scripture which is worse; for to pray, <hi>St.</hi> Laurence <hi>pray for me,</hi> in such a sense as the Papists do, must needs be great impiety, no less than Idolatry, because they do ascribe that unto the creature which is only proper unto the Creator.

But that we should pray unto Saints, neither have we any Commandment in Scipture, nor yet example which we may safely follow; so that being done without authority of Gods Word, it lacketh the ground of Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore cannot be acceptable to God; For what soever is not of faith is sin: And the Apostle saith, That faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God: Yet thou wilt object further, That the Saints in Heaven pray for us, and that their prayer proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of an earnest charity that they have toward their Brethren on earth. Whereto it may well be answered; First, that no man knoweth whether they do pray for us or no. And if any man will go about to prove it by the nature of charity, concluding, that because they did pray for men on earth, therefore they do much more now in heaven: then may it be said by the same reason, that as oft as we do weep on earth, they do also weep in Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause while they lived in this world, it is most certain and sure they did so.</hi> And whereas some of late have much endeavoured to re-introduce into our Church the antiquated custom of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead.

               <p>The examples of the Seraphims and Brazen Serpent tell us, that to make pictures or statues of creatures is not against a natural reason, and that they may have uses, which are profitable, as well as be abused to danger and superstition. Now although the nature of that people was apt to the abuse, yet Christianity hath so far removed that danger, that our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Law-giver thought it not necessary to remove us from su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition by a prohibition of the use of images and pictures; and for the matter of images we have no other rule left us in the New Testament; the rules of reason and nature, and the other parts of the Institution are abundantly sufficient for our security. And possibly St. <hi>Paul</hi> might relate to this, when he affirmed concerning the fifth, that it was the first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a promise; for the second Commandment had a promise of shewing mercy to thousand generations; but because the body of this Commandment was not transcribed into the Christian Law, the first of the Decalogue which we retain, and in which a promise is inserted is the fift Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.  <hi>G.

               <p>By the Natural Law it was not unlawful to swear by an oath that implyed not Idolatry, or the belief of a false God, (I say) any grave or prudent oath when they spake a grave truth.

Do the more sage sort of profane Writers say so? or do not all rather say, who have not blinded Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conscience, That it is not lawful to swear in the gravest matter, if a man may be credited without an oath, or if his oath be not like to be an end of strife? Or what man who knows that God was alway tender of his Name and Glory, canthink that it was lawful for the Jews to swear by God in ordinary entercourse? They did ordinarily swear, but it was not lawful so to do. The son of <hi>Sirach</hi> reproves it, Heathens condemn it: it is indeed said, <hi>They that swear by him shall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Psal.</hi> 63. 11. but it is not said, They that swear by him in ordinary entercourse shall glory, if they should, they would glory in their shame.

               <p>There are in the few words by you uttered certain things that you must pardon me if I cannot presently close with. 1. You say that the Primitive Church till the <hi>Laodicaean</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil kept both the Sabbath and the Lords Day. <hi>Quanta est haec propositio?</hi> Do you mean that the whole Primitive Church did so? that will be hard, if not impossible to prove, for the Books that are come to our hands have neither declared nor do they pretend to declare what all the Churches of Christ did; nay it appears from <hi>Socrates,</hi> that the Roman and Alexandrian Church kept not the Saturday at all, as I think is acknowledged by Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> himself, <hi>Part.</hi> 2. But <hi>dato sed non concesso</hi> that there had been such an universal custom of observing both dayes, how doth it hence follow, that the Lords Day was not substituted in the place of the obliterated Sabbath? Would you argue that Baptism came not in the place of Circumcision, because to gain


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119770:41"/>
over the weak Jews they used Circumcision for some season? They might use the Saturday as a meeting day, that by comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Jews and Proselytes they might obtain familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and gain opportunity to instruct them in the Christian Faith, by reason that the people had been accustomed to meet together on that day.</p>

For I can in my little reading produce a considerable Author, who lived in the 4th Century, and another who lived in the beginning of the 12th Century, who both call the Lords Day a Sabbath, and how many others have done so, neither you nor I, without more search then such a thing is worth, shall be able to say: but it is to little purpose to contend about a name or word, provided we be agreed in the thing, and this I am sure of, that our Church in the Homily for the time and place of worship commends and enjoyns the Lords Day to be kept as a Sabbath with rest from all week-day and worldly labours, and to be spent wholly in the service of God, and of this I think none can doubt who comes to the reading of that Homily unprejudiced.</p>

No such intire, clear and integral determinate and presential effects of repentance, but an imperfect, little, growing, uncertain and hazardous reconciliation. A repentance, that is alwayes in production, a renovation by parts, a pardon that is revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, a salvation to be wrought by fear and trembling; all our remanent life must be in bitterness, our hopes allayed with fears, our meat attempered with <hi>Colloquintida,</hi> and death is in the pot; as our best actions are imperfect, so our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est graces are but possibilities and aptnesses to reconcilement, and all our life we are working our selves into that condition

               <p>Strange doctrine, for which you can neither produce Scripture, nor yet the authority of any one Protestant Writer; we are not justified upon other terms before baptism and after, nor is our reconciliation after baptism more uncertain or hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then before, nor our pardon more revocable. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth pardon to adult persons only upon the condition of Faith, Repentance; where these are, a man is justified, though he have not as yet had an opportunity of being baptized; where these are not, baptism is but the washing away of the filth of the flesh. It is not Baptism but Gods Covenant of grace that gives the first right and title to Justification, Adoption, Salvation, and that Covenant gives them on the like terms to all; upon our first unfeigned repentance all past sins are pardoned, upon the renewal of our repentance after relapses they also are pardoned and the guilt of them presently done away, and this pardon God did never recal, never will he recal.</p>

               <p>God who knows the weaknesses on our part, and yet the strictness and necessity of conferring Baptismal Grace, by the Covenant Evangelical hath appointed the auxiliaries of the Holy Spirit to be ministred to all baptized people in the holy rite of confirmation, that it might be made possible to be done by Divine aids, which is necessary to be done by the Divine Commandments; and this might not improperly be said to be the meaning of those words of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>He that speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him, but he that speaks a word against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, i. e.</hi> those sins which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in infidelity, before we become Disciples of the holy Jesus, are to be remitted in Baptism and our first profession of the Religion: but the sins committed after Baptism and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in which we receive the Holy Ghost, and by which we grieve the Holy Ghost, are to be accounted for, with more  severity.

tend to the setling and reforming our Churches; but you speak a little too like the adversary, when you say, that God hath by the Covenant Evangelical appointed auxiliaries of the HolySpirit to be ministred to all baptized people in the holy rite of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; as also when you say, that in Confirmation we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghost; for if you speak of adult persons, they are at least supposed to have received the Holy Ghost before Baptism or Confirmation, yea the very miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost came upon men before Baptism, as is plain, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44. But as for your Explication of the place of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list concerning the sin or word against the Holy Ghost, that the meaning should be only this, that the sins we commit after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and Confirmation must be accounted for with more seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then those committed by us in infidelity, it is both singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and hugely uncouth; the Articles of the Church as now we have them, mention nothing of the sin against the Holy Ghost, but in that old Copy I have of them as they were agreed upon in the dayes of King <hi>Edward,</hi> I find that which is now our 16th Article thus worded and entitled</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Of Sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism, is not sin against the Holy Ghost and unpardonable, where the place for Penitents is not to be denyed, to such as fall into sin after Baptism; after we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may rise again and amend our lives; and therefore they are to be condemned, who say, they can no more sin, as long as they live hear, or deny the place for penitents to  such as truly repent and amend their lives. Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is, when a man of malice and stubbornness of mind doth rail upon the Truth of Gods Word, manifestly perceived, and being enemy thereunto, persecutoth the same, and because such be guilty of Gods curse they entangle themselves with a most grievous and hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crime: whereupon this kind of sin is called and affirmed of  the Lord unpardonable.</p>

When St. <hi>Peter</hi> had declared to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> that he was in the gall of bitterness, and yet made him pray, if peradventure the thought of his heart may be forgiven him; he did not by any thing that was revealed know that he should be pardoned; but by something that he did not know there might be hope.

Our Martyr of blessed memory, Mr. <hi>Bilney. Acts Mon. Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 271. thus expresseth himself; I dare be bold to say, that as many as I have heard of late to preach, have preached such repentance, that if I had heard such repentance in times past, I should utterly have been in despair; and to speak of one of those famous men, after he had sharply inveighed against vice, he concluded; Behold


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119770:48"/>
thou has lien rotten in thy own lusts by the space of 60 years, and wilt thou presume in one year to go forward towards heaven, and that in thine age, as much as thou wentest back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from heaven toward hell in 60 years? Is not this think you a goodly argument? Is this the preaching of Repentance in the Name of Jesus? or rather to tread down Christ with Antichrists Doctrine? for what other thing did he speak in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than that Christ dyed in vain for thee? he will not be thy Jesus or Saviour, thou must make satisfaction for thy self  or perish eternally. As for our Homilies, they plainly declare that there is a revealed Word for the pardon of late Penitents, and they answer the objections of the despairing, as well as of the presumptuous, concluding at last thus; <hi>God which hath promised his mercy to them that be truly repentant</hi> (<hi>although it be at the later end</hi>) <hi>hath not promised to the presumptuous sinner, either that he shall have long life, or that he shall have true repentance at the last exd.</hi> And I pray you, why may not God work the habit of saving grace, and give the Holy Ghost to those who are ready to give up the ghost? are not such habits infused?</p>

               <p>Every Christian man sinning, is to consider the horrible threatnings of the Gospel, the severe intermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternal pains, the goodnese of God leading to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the severity of his justice in exacting great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of criminals, the reasonableness of this justice punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such persons intolerably, who would not use so great a grace in so pleasing a service, for the purchase of so glorious a reward. The terrors of the Law did end in temporal death, they could affright no further; but in the Gospel Heaven and Hell were opened, and laid before all mankind: and therefore by these measures a sinner is to enter into the sorrows of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and the care of his amendment. And it is so vain a thing to think every sinner must in his Repentance pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the terrors of the Law, that this is a very destruction of that reason for which they are fallen upon the opinion; the Law is not enough to affright sinners, and the terrors of the Gospel are far more to persevering impenitent sinners, then the terrors of the Law were to the breakers of it; the cause of the mistake is this: The Law was more terrible then the Gospel is, because it allowed no mercy to the sinner in great instances; but the Gospel does. But then, if we compare the state of these men who fell under the evils of the Law, with those who fall under the evils threatned in the Gospel, we shall find these to be in a worse condition then those by


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119770:50"/>

               <p>All men will grant that Heaven and Hell are more clearly opened under the New than under the Old Testament: But this I cannot digest, That the terrors of the Law did end in Temporal death, and could affright no further, or that the Law is not enough to affright sinners. For what mean you by the Law, the Covenant of Works, or the Law administred by <hi>Moses?</hi> either of them sure is enough to affright sinners; or else God had been wanting, not threatning terror sufficient to affright people from wickedness. Christ freeth us from the wrath to come, and yet he freeth us but from that wrath which as transgressors of the Law we have incurred. What think you of those sinners who never heard of the Gospel? shall they die only a Temporal death? If so, Hell will be more empty then is generally believed. If they dye an Eternal death, then the Law threatneth more then Temporal death, for they can suffer only as transgressors and offenders of the Law. But I pray you what do you think of Satisfaction, is not that made only by Christ?</p>

For what can be more honourable to the person of Christ, then that the Patriarchs and other holy men of God who dyed under the Law, were kept from being admitted into a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the joyes of heaven, till he by his divine power took them by the hand, conducted them into the blessed gates of Paradise? What could add more to the dignity and reputation of the Gospel of Christ, then that all such as faithfully believe the same, and frame themselves to live thereafter, should have a greater priviledge then their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the rest who dyed before in the fear of God before the coming of our Saviour, and be admitted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently  into the joyes of Paradise?

It may be said, That though the <hi>inferi</hi> in it self were a place of punishment,


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119770:52"/>
yet God was able to command the fire that it should not burn them, and the torments of the pit that they should not touch them. Nor is this all that may be said in justification and  defence of those ancient writers, &amp;c. <hi>Id. ibid. &amp; p.</hi> 222.</p>

               <p>Possibly they might mean no more by those expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of bringing back the souls of the just from <hi>Hades,</hi> then that by the descent of Christ into Hell, all the claim and challenge which the devil could pretend unto them were  made void and of none effect.

               <p>Very good: Then it seems till Christ descended into Hell the claime of the Divel to the souls of the just, was not made void and of none effect: but I had thought that the death of Christ, though he had never descended into Hell, had been sufficient to have vacated all the claim that the Devil could make to the souls of those who dyed in the fear of God. And this death of Christ had its effects and operations upon those who dyed before Christ, as well as upon those who dyed since he actually offered himself upon the Cross. But the truth is, all this discourse of Christs bringing of the souls of the Fathers out of <hi>Hades,</hi> doth depend upon that which is hugely uncertain and inevident; <hi>viz</hi> that Christ did descend into Hell. Now this I humbly conceive can neither be proved from Scripture, nor yet from the Apostles Creed, nor yet from any Article of our Church.</p>

               <p>That this was the mind of the major part of those who met together for the composing of the Articles in 1552. is certain; but it is as certain that there were then men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts, and in all probability men imployed in that Synod, of a contrary mind: I instance only in Bishop <hi>Hooper,</hi> who


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119770:53"/>
in his Exposition on the Creed doth most expresly and <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> write against the Local descent of Christ into Hell. As for the Articles of 1562. they are so worded as to leave to all their liberty to opine in this matter, as in their own minds they shall be perswaded; and so much is asserted by Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> in his Exposition of the Articles. As for the Apostles Creed it is, and that most deservedly, of great credit and esteem in all the Churches of Christ throught the whole world: but then it must be considered, that the Symbol of the Apostles hath not been alwayes the same; particularly, <hi>Ruffinus</hi> assures us, that this additament, <hi>descendit ad inferos</hi> is neither found in the Creed used by the Roman Church, nor yet in the Creeds of the Eastern Church. <hi>Vid. Mr. Peirs. on the Creed. p.</hi> 456. <hi>Amyraldus</hi> also hath observed, that in some Creeds where these words <hi>He descended into Hell</hi> are found, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs Burial; nay, the Learned observe, That in the very <hi>Aquileian</hi> Creed, where this Article was first expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, there was no mention of Christs Burial, which is at least a very probable argument that the first intention of putting these words into the Creed, was only to express the Burial of our Saviour. This <hi>Aquileian</hi> Creed in which we first find the words was not till above 300 years after Christ.</p>

               <p>That in this question I may separate the certain from the uncertain; 1. It is certain that the Torments of Hell shall certainly last as long as the soul lasts. 2. The generality of Christians have been taught to believe worse things yet concerning them. 3. Yet if God should deal with man hereafter more mercifully and proportionably to his weak nature then he doth to Angels, and as he admits him to repentance here, so in hell also to a period of smart, even when he keeps the Angels in pains for ever, yet he will never admit him to favour, he shall be tormented beyond all the measure of humane ages, and be destroyed for ever and for  ever.

               <p>So then, it seems it is only certain that torments shall last as long as the soul lasts; but that the soul shall live for ever, that is not certain; only the generality have been taught so to believe. Do Protestant Doctors use to teach their hearers <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in a matter of so high and huge concernment in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the practice of godliness?</p>

it hath been sufficiently proved by more Authors then one, That the Church hath all along expressed her dislike to the full of all Arminian notions, and hath made use of all her authority to censure and impose recantation upon as many as have ventured to broach them.</p>

               <p>So indeed it hath been printed with much confidence by some of the Puritanical faction, but how falsely, the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath largely shewed in his late <hi>Historia quin<expan>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> doth so much mingle his Passion with all that he writes, that he marreth every cause he medleth with; and I have been told by a Master of Arts and Fellow of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, That Dr. <hi>H. Hammond</hi> walking with him once in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen Colledg Cloyster did confess so much.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Laud.</speaker>
               <p>But Dr. <hi>H. H.</hi> denyeth that ever he so said; and we are told by one who writes himself <hi>M. O.</hi> B. of A. that the Doctor is a great admirer of Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> labours.</p>

               <p>I have told you upon what authority <hi>T.

But I must not count my self engaged to believe any thing of this nature till I see something testified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> his own hand; then the world shall know who told the story.</p>

               <p>But the Doctor hopeth he hath made it appear that <hi>Calvinism</hi> was not the Native and Original doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though in a short time it overspread a great part thereof. <hi>Pres. to His. Quin. Artic.</hi>

               <p>He may hope where no hope is; and that he doth so in this particular <hi>Theophilus Churchman</hi> hath evinced in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the <hi>Certam. Epistolare</hi> which was bnt an Epitome of this <hi>Historia quin. Artic.</hi> the Doctor all along using the very same shifts, and almost the very same words in one book that he


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119770:55"/>
doth in the other; and herein he doth but <hi>antiquum obtinere;</hi> for so in his <hi>Resp. Pet.</hi> he tels the very same tale that he did in the History of the Sab. not vouchsafing to take any notice that two learned men had in print many years before answered all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges. And he that can thus bring an old book upon the Stage under a new Title, and rob his former writings to fill up the bulk of his latter, doth but declare that he hath got an itch of scribling which I am not so good a Physician as to be able to cure. As for the indignities that he hath offered to the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, I leave him to be chastized by the pens of some of their owm Members, who will easily manifest that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Dort</hi> was not so ugly a creature as he hath made it, and that the proceedings against the Remonstrants were neither unjust nor yet rigorous: Mean while I refer the reader to what <hi>Horne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> hath said in his <hi>Summa Contr.</hi> I must only take leave to say something in vindication of <hi>T. C.</hi> in throwing reproaches upon whom, the Doctor is so very not only liberal but also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse. He tels us that the gentleman whom he did strive to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Mag. was none of his blood; <hi>T. C.</hi> never said that he was: and that he was a singular good Scholar; <hi>T. C.</hi> never denyed it. As for Mr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> he was one of the means of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him an exhibition of fifteen pound <hi>per annum</hi> to help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his subsistence in the Universitie till he should be able to provide himself of some such place as might alone suffice to keep him. But sure Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> when he sought to bring in this his friend (a friend I hope is <hi>relatum</hi>) did not take the Colledge to be a nest of Cuckoos; he would not sure have took a courtesie from Mr. <hi>Praesi</hi> if he had not judged him to have power sufficient to bestow it: And had his friend been made Fellow of the Colledg, he would sure for his sake have been so civil as not to have used so ugly a similitude. Indeed if singing alway the same note and tune make a Cuckoo, all the Cuckoos do not lodg at Mag. Colledge. Next the Doctor labours to prove that it was no slander to say, <hi>That the new Sabbath speculations of Dr.</hi> Bound <hi>had been more passionately embraced of late, then any one Article of Religion here by Law established.</hi> But this he proveth by such an argument as I perswade my self he himself takes not to have any colour of truth in it. Because impunity is


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119770:55"/>
indulged by them to all, <hi>Anabaptists, Familists, Ranters.</hi> By them! whom meaneth the Doctor? if he mean by any that deserve the name of <hi>Calvinists,</hi> his Conscience cannot but flie in his face: if by them he mean the Souldiers whose violence prevailed so far as to seclude the Members of that Parliament, which was, if any, the Presbyterian Parliament, then his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must run thus; The Souldiers, many of whom are Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists and Arminians, all of them Anticalvinists, have procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red impunity to Familists, Ranters, Quakers, and yet not for those who transgress the Laws about the Sabbath, therefore the <hi>Calvinists</hi> are more zealous about the Sabbath speculations then about any one Article of Religion by Law established. If the world will be cheated with such arguments, let it be cheated: yet dare not I imitate the Doctour in despising of authority or speaking evil of dignities; I dare not leave it in print, That the Justice used <hi>cursed rigor</hi> who made a Victualler pay ten shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for selling a half-penny loaf to a poor man in time of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. I rather think it was cursed rigor to Excommunicate Mr. <hi>Paul Bains</hi> for withdrawing to drink a little Wine or Beer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had spent himself in Preaching a Sermon: yet this I find practised.</p>
               <p>The Doctor next proceedeth to make some Apology for his calling himself, <hi>His Majesties Creature, and the workmanship of his hands:</hi> One while he seems to say no such thing dropped from his Pen; another while, that if it had, the expression might have been justified. He hath been told where and by whom it was averred that he did use those expressions; I only now tell him, The Gentleman was fasting when he so said, and that <hi>M. C. Bursery</hi> is not a place in which men are, or I hope ever were suffered to inflame themselves with wine and strong drink, so as to make them talk that which they would be ashamed to own afterwards. As to the expression it self, I had well hoped, that if a Courtier could have stooped so low in flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, yet no Divine, whose work is to be Kings remembrancer; that they are but Mortal Creatures and Creeping Dust, durst have used any such language: if the Doctor dare, he shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me if I do not take him to be the tenderest Conscienced Theologue in Christendome. As for what concerneth Dr.


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119770:56"/>
                  <hi>Barlow,</hi> I say but this, That both Mr. <hi>John Martin</hi> Fellow of C. C. C. <hi>Ox.</hi> and also Dr. <hi>Henry Wilkinson</hi> will witness that Mr. <hi>Sparks</hi> did assert all that to be truth which <hi>T. C.</hi> hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished; and that Mr. <hi>Sparks</hi> was both a learned man and a good man, all the University will witness: but as for the aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who related this to Mr. <hi>Sparks,</hi> he either is, or very lately was alive. In a word, the book written by <hi>T. C.</hi> never was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, never will be answered, except by such an Animal as <hi>M. O.</hi> whose eyes Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> have put out that he might the more easily grind in their mill. The book was made by one whom the Vic. of <hi>Oxon</hi> loves and respects, and that a sheet or two were printed ar <hi>London</hi> was by the Authors own consent, meerly to avoid that clamour which else the Dr. might have raised upon the Vice. who loveth not to meddle with those Salamanders that are never in their Element but when they are in the fire of contention. The Doctor complaineth much of <hi>ribaldry, obscenity,</hi> &amp;c. but let him first pull out the beam that is in his own eye, <hi>Loripedem rectus derideat, AEthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pem Albus.</hi> There's a pretty story of a Cardinal and the Abbot of <hi>Fulda,</hi> travelling together towards <hi>Ulma,</hi> either of them attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 30. horsemen compleatly armed; <hi>My Lord,</hi> saith the Cardinal, <hi>do you think St. Bennet, who was the Author of your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der went thus attended?</hi> The Abbot presently replyed upon him, and demanded, <hi>If St. Peter ever rode in that state as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood did.</hi> If Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> blame <hi>T. C.</hi> for one unseemly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and that's all he can charge him with (which had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged also, had not the Impression been so suddenly took off the Stationers hand) <hi>T. C.</hi> will not be at a loss to find one as bad, or far worse to lay in the Doctors dish. I must spare neither, and therefore say, They both have so worded matters now and then, that they have reason to beg the charity of men to excuse them, and the mercy of God to pardon them; and that the world may learn by their example more to mind the Doctrine which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to godliness, and less and more rarely to engage in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, is the prayer of,</p>
