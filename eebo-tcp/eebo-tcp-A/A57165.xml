            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

they were in single Sheets: Tho I must confess I propos'd a great Advantage, knowing that they shall live above the reach of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure under your Lordships Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not without some Ambition of being known to your Lordship by the Title of,</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IF I thought you would not smile immoderately, I cou'd tell you, That by the Command of some Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Personages, <hi>Mark ye!</hi> and at the Request of my Noble Friends, <hi>D'ye mind me!</hi> these Trifles made


<pb facs="tcp:100386:4"/>
a Sally into the World, stept into the Light, appear'd in this undress, or as a Modern Author has it, was Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Hurried into the Press, (by which he verified, <hi>Festinans Canis coecos peperit catulos.</hi>)</p>
            <p>This you know is the true Cant of many Prefacers; as who should say, Gentlemen, my Book begs your pardon for this Intrusion. But if such kind of Stuff will not pass as an Excuse for Publication, I'll tell ye what will; by chance I overheard an offer of some foolish Guinneys, and


<pb facs="tcp:100386:4"/>
when those Toys are propos'd, such is our Human Frailty, we consent to the printing of any thing.</p>
            <p>I have not further to say in the behalf of this Affair, since many of these things were wrote several years ago, when Youth and too much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney represented Extravagance a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>This is the last of this nature I shall ever own; the next shall be some Remarks upon the Life and Death of a true pious Protestant Dissenter, with


<pb facs="tcp:100386:5"/>
the Excellency and Necessity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and Equivocation in a devout Separatist; and that you'll say is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious business.</p>

            <p>THE Ingenious Author having, next to his pleasure of writing these Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, taken care to Dedicate them to a Person of Honour, and also provided an Epistle to the Reader, hath left me nothing to do, but for my profit to print and to sell them. But there having been some part of <hi>The Ramble</hi> formerly printed, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Natural Presumptive to my Lord <hi>Rochester,</hi> for Justice to that Noble Lord, as also for defending of Liberty and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to my Author, whose Right as well as my own is invaded; I resolved to bring an <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas


<pb facs="tcp:100386:6"/>
Corpus,</hi> and remove <hi>The Ramble</hi> home again, which was so falsly, maliciously, imperfectly, and feloniously made publick.</p>
            <p>I am likewise to tell you, that the foresaid Poem called <hi>The Ramble,</hi> is here enlarged above two thirds more than heretofore you have seen it. I hope it will please you, good honest Gentile Reader; if so, it will sell; and if it sells, it will please me too; and so our little share of the world will naturally run in a concord, without tormenting our selves with Fears and Jealousies, or setting up for mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Whigs, Tantivy Tories, Abhorring Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressers, or other inferiour no Protestant Plots and Tory Plots. For my part (Gentlemen) I am resolved <hi>(nemine contradicente)</hi> to live in a whole skin so long as I can, hoping


<pb facs="tcp:100386:6"/>
no <hi>Irishman</hi> will make a dead blow upon me; and I do hereby promise upon the word of an honest Stationer, that I will not endeavour to alter the Government, as it is established by Law either in Church or State. In fine, I am satisfied this Book of Poems hath no couched Treason in it, nor Arbitrary Power, and therefore I presume to Print it, without staying for the Sussrage of an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such as it is take it amongst you, and so God bless you all. <hi>Vale.</hi>
