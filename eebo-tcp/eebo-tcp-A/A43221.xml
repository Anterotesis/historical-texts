         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Treatise,</hi> made the
<hi>Sentiments</hi> of the Great <hi>Littleton</hi>
his <hi>Rule,</hi> in Chusing that <hi>Subject</hi>
He so much Commendeth in his <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures,</hi>
viz. <hi>The Science of good
Pleading,</hi> as the most Nice and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Part in the <hi>Study</hi> of the Law;
which <hi>He</hi> hath Manag'd in such an
<hi>Extraordinary Method,</hi> that all
Men of Sense, of that Profession,
cannot sufficiently enough Admire
<pb facs="tcp:93066:3"/>
and Value this His most <hi>Excellent
Discourse of Pleading,</hi> suitable to
the Greatness of his Performance
therein</p>
            <p>To do him Iustice, No Person
(among the Writers of the <hi>Common
Law</hi>) hath been more happy in the
Contrivance of his Design, being so
Concise, and his Matter so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
Couch'd, that I must beg
the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Pardon, if I confess it
to be very difficult to Imitate him,
without taking up as much Time, as
He was pleased to allow himself;
which, by the way, was not within the
Limits of my Province: However, I
have so far taken Care to come near
him, that the Author himself, if he
were alive, would not, I presume,
altogether dislike what I have
done.</p>
            <p>But the greatest Obstacle I am to
remove, is, what some Persons, who
have seen the Original, do Object,
<pb facs="tcp:93066:3"/>
               <hi>That it is only taken from the</hi>
Year-Books, Plowden'<hi>s</hi> Commentaries
<hi>and</hi> Dyer'<hi>s</hi> Reports; <hi>Things proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
good in their Times: But alas!</hi>
(say they) <hi>what's that to the most
Refin'd, Polite, and never enough
Valued, Equalled, much less Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi>
Reports, Abridgments, Tracts,
&amp;c. <hi>since their Times?</hi> (Tho' these
are not wanting in our Composition)
I think to all this I may modestly
Answer:</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Year-Books</hi> are the
very Foundation of the Law; <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
and <hi>Dyer</hi> perhaps Inimitable;
and, I hope, this may be further said,
without Offence, That had it not been
for the Clear, Pespicuous Light of
the <hi>Year-Books,</hi> the later Reporters
would have but grop'd (as it were)
in the Dark, and been beholden too
much to that incertain Goddess, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
(the <hi>Mistress of Fools,</hi>
as accounted by the Learned) which,
<pb facs="tcp:93066:4"/>
how far <hi>Experimental Knowledge</hi>
differs from <hi>Right Reason,</hi> drawn
by Succession of <hi>Time,</hi> from the
<hi>Maxims</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of the Ancients,
in all <hi>Ages,</hi> I leave the <hi>Reader</hi>
to guess at; and, if he Doubts, to
Consult his <hi>Coke</hi> upon <hi>Littleton.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Counts, or Declarations.</head>
               <p>A Declaration,<note place="margin">A Declaration, what?</note> is the setting forth,
comprizing, or exhibiting in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the Cause of Action in any
Suit, or Plaint, grounded upon the
Common or Statute Law, wherein the
Party supposeth himself to be injured. This
hath been by some supposed in an Action
Real, to be most properly termed a Count;
but that, being a <hi>Norman</hi> (or Law-<hi>French</hi>)
word, is frequently, if not as often, used in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93066:5"/>
our Books, in all other Actions, whether
Personal or Mixt, for a Declaration.</p>
               <p>A Count or Declaration therefore (being
Terms equivocal,<note place="margin">Of the formal Parts of which a Declaration ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</note> and so used in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Discourse) ought principally to
contain Three things:</p>
               <p>First, The Plaintiffs and the Defendant's
Names, (which in Actions Real are called,
Demandant and Tenant) and the Nature
of the Action; and this by some is termed
the Demonstration, or Demonstrative Part
of the Count.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Time, the Place, and the
Act; in which ought to be comprehended,
How, and in what manner the Action did
accrue, or first arise between the Parties;
When, what Day, what Year, and what
Place, and to Whom the Action shall be
given; which is called the Declarative Part
of the Count.</p>
               <p>And Lastly, The Perclose or Conclusion,
which is <hi>Unde deterioratus est, &amp;c.</hi> In which
the Plainti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f ought to Aver, and Profer to
prove his Suit, and shew the Damage he
hath sustained, by the Wrong and Injury
done unto him by the Defendant.</p>
               <p>And this Definition, (consisting of a <hi>Tria,</hi>
somewhat resembling the Logical <hi>Major,
Minor,</hi> and <hi>Conclusion</hi>) some of the Ancients
(among whom none more fond of it than
Mr. <hi>Fleetwood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Temp. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Regin.</note> the Famous Recorder of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>)
conceived to be a perfect Syllogism.</p>
               <p>The Statute of 36 <hi>Ed. 3. cap. ult.</hi> seemeth
to help want of Form in Counts, in these
words;—<hi>By the Ancient Terms and Forms
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93066:5"/>
of Pleaders, no Man shall be prejudiced; so that
the Matter of the Action be fully shewed in the
Declaration, and in the Writ</hi>—. However,
it was always at least so presumed by the
most Eminent Pleaders and Sages of the
Law, by drawing this Conclusion from the
words; <hi>Count ne abatera pur default de Form,
issint que eyt Substance;</hi> that is to say in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
<hi>A Declaration shall not abate for want of
Form, so that it hath substance.</hi> But Counts
are more especially Relieved, when defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
by the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 14. of
Jeofails after Verdict, although they want
Form or Agreement with the Register.
Note well the Statute, and what Cases are
remedied by the same. For, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Statute of 36 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Vide Tit. <hi>Jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fails</hi> &amp; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaders,</hi> infra. <hi>Maxim.</hi>
                  </note> before recited,
there is holden a Maxim in our Books, That,
<hi>It sufficeth if a Bar be good to Common Intent;
but a Count in the Substance thereof must be good
to every Intent.</hi> And so is 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 11, &amp; 12.
where the Retorn of a Writ of Rescous was
adjudged ill, because the Sheriff named no
Place where the Rescous was made; <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn
of a Sheriff resembling a Count, which must
be good to every Intent.</hi> And so is 3 <hi>Ed. 4. 21.
That a Declaration must be certain to every Intent.</hi>
And yet, <hi>In some Cases a Count shall be holden
good by Intendment;</hi> as 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6 35. the Plaintiff
in Debt did Declare upon an Obligation
made at <hi>D.</hi> which extended into two
Counties; yet it shall be taken without
other Declaration to be made in the County
where the Action is laid; where Note, that
the County is not by express Name de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93066:6"/>
And 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 23. the Plaintiff in
Account did declare, that the Defendant
was Receiver until the Feast of St. <hi>Michael,</hi>
but shewed not which St. <hi>Michael;</hi> and by
<hi>Intendment</hi> shall be taken for St. <hi>Michael</hi> the
<hi>Archangel.</hi> And 38 <hi>H.</hi> 6. In Debt by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
against his Master for Wages, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
upon a Retainer for Eight years,
taking for every year Twenty shillings; it
shall be intended from year to year, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Statute.</p>
               <p>Next is to be considered what shall vitiate
a Count, and what shall not. And first
Note well, that it hath been held for a
Maxim, among the Sages of the Law and
Ancient Pleaders, that <hi>for Surplusage the
Count doth not abate; (Surplusagium non nocet)</hi>
as is 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 25. by <hi>Rolfe:</hi> And so is 46 <hi>Ed.</hi>
3. 21. Where in a <hi>Quod ei deforceat</hi> the
Demandant did alledge Esplees in himself,
and likewise in the Donor, and yet good:
Although, as it seemeth by the Book of
3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 41. if the Count want Esplees, the
same is ill. And so is 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 41. where said,
That if one, in an Attachment upon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
doth not expresly declare, that the
Prohibition was deliver'd to the Defendant;
Ill: For there is said to be a Form to be
observed. And by 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 14. and 20 <hi>H.</hi>
6. 18. a Blank or Space left in a Declaration
doth abate the same. But, by 24 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 35,
<hi>&amp;</hi> 54. if the Obligation be <hi>Anno Domini</hi>
only in the Date, without mentioning the
King's Reign, the Declaration may be so
also; and, as it seemeth, may be otherwise;
<hi>viz. è contra.</hi>

By 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 72. its said, That in Debt against
the Ordinary or Gaoler, you shall not
need to declare how they were made Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
because an Action lieth against Officers
in possession. And Note, that where a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
contained in the Obligation is to the
advantage of the Plaintiff, there he must
declare thereof by 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 36. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if it be to his disadvantage, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Condition of the Obligation;
and to that intent is 22 <hi>Ed. 4. Bro.</hi> tit. <hi>Count</hi> 13.
where any thing is to be done by the Plaintiff;
and 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 3. putteth the difference, where it
is contained in the Obligation, and where in
the Condition: And to that Intent is 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6.
15, <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. But yet 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 1. the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was Indorsed to this purpose, That if
the Obligee deliver to the Obligor a Bull,
that then the Obligation shall be void;
otherwise not: There the Plaintiff is to
Declare upon the Condition; but <hi>Shelley</hi>
doubted, if he shall be compelled to do the
same of necessity. And by 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 8. If the
Defendant do bind himself by Indenture in
Forty Pounds, to perform all Covenants
contained in the same, the Plaintiff shall
declare upon the Breach of every Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to which the Defendant shall plead,
<hi>Covenants performed generally;</hi> and then the
Plaintiff shall assign one or more Breaches
specially, whereupon Issue shall be joyned.
But as before, so in Annuity <hi>pro Consilio
impenso &amp; impendendo,</hi> the Plaintiff in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
or in Debt for the Arrearages
thereof, ought to count that he did (or

               <p>But yet 21 <hi>Ed. 4. 49. Brook, Count</hi> 72. this
difference is Ruled there, That where an
Annuity is so brought by a Special Officer;
as by a Keeper, Bailiff, Steward, &amp;c. there
he must declare of the Service; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in a Declaration <hi>pro Consilio,</hi> because
more general, there the Defendant may
assign the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Breach, or lay the default; <hi>quod
Nota.</hi> Also, if an Annuity be granted to
an Attorney <hi>pro Consilio impenso &amp; impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi>
and a Suit happens to be depending,
after the Grant made, between the Grantor
and a Stranger, and the Attorney (not
being requested to give Counsel in that
Cause to the Grantor) gives Counsel to the
Stranger therein: Resolved by the Court,
that this is not against the Intent of the
Grant, but that the Annuity (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
such Advice given against the
Grantor) should continue, 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>Note, it is not material, when you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
in Annuity, to set forth the Title or
Estate of the Grantor, but only to say, that
the Grantor did grant the Annuity, <hi>Co. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
Annuity</hi> 49. And by 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
that <hi>the Plaintiff in Formedon may
declare of a Gift,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Count de Done fans Seisin.</note> 
                  <hi>without Seisin:</hi> And so is
34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 48. upon <hi>Dimisit;</hi> and also Common
Experience. And note, where there be two
Defendants,<note place="margin">Several Counts in one Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and the one appears, and the
Plaintiff Counts against him in Trespass in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93066:7"/>
the <hi>Simulcum,</hi> that he with the other (such
aday) did the Trespass, and when the other
came, he counted against him in like Form,
as is 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 25. But against the latter the
Plaintiff varied in the Day. And 44 <hi>Ed. 3.
41. Br.</hi> 583. a Man may have Detinue of

               <p>So, by 19 <hi>Ric. 2. Case 52. In things of the
like Nature, one Declaration may contain divers

For the taking away his Servants and Chat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tels.<note place="margin">Where the Plaintiff shall Count <hi>de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,</hi> and where not.</note>

And Note,<note place="margin">Rules to be observed in declaring of the Day, the Year, and Place.</note> touching the <hi>declaring</hi> of the

in Wast, and such like Mixt Actions, as also
in Actions Real, one shall not Count of the Day,
Year, and Place; otherwise in Personal Actions.</hi>
And to the same Intent is 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. And
therefore 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 50. a Parson brought an
Action of Debt for the Arrerages of an
Annuity granted unto him until he should
be promoted to a Benefice, and Declared,
that he took a Wife, which determined the
Annuity; yet because he did not shew the
Place where he took her to Wife, the Count
was ill. And so is 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. In an Action of
Debt brought by an Administrator, for not
shewing in what Place the Administration
was committed unto him: But it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of an Executor; for he is not bound
to shew where he was made Executor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he may be Executor of his own
Wrong.</p>
               <p>And Note, 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 38. where the Plaintiff
in Debt did Count upon a Lease of four
Acres for the Rent of three Pounds; and
the Defendant did plead to the Count, that
he did Let those four Acres and other Lands,
and a good Plea: But the greater Doubt,
whether he should in that case take a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
for in our Books it is obvious, That
<hi>if the Plaintiff in his Declaration mistake the

And in <hi>Fogassa</hi>'s Case, in <hi>Pl. Com. If

<hi>the Plaintiff shall not give in Evidence

an Action of Debt was brought upon a

and four Acres more; <hi>Absque hoc,</hi> that he
Let the six and twenty Acres <hi>tantum;</hi>
whereupon Issue was taken, and the Verdict
found the Demise only of one and twenty
Acres; and thereupon the Question was,
Whether the Verdict had found for the
Plaintiff, or for the Defendant? And by
<hi>Fitz.</hi> and <hi>Englefield</hi> it was found for the
Plaintiff, because Agreed of both sides, that
six and twenty Acres were Let, and the
Question was upon the four Acres: But
<hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Shelley</hi> seemed to be of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the Verdict was ill: But <hi>Shelley</hi>
said therein, That if the Defendant had
pleaded a Plea without a <hi>Travers,</hi> (because
he had confess'd the Count, and more, it
would have been good.) Or if the <hi>Travers</hi>
had been, <hi>Absque hoc quod predictus le Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff

<hi>Brook,</hi> Title <hi>Brief,</hi> by the better Opinion,
<q>That in Debt, Resceit of Parcel, Hanging
the Writ, doth abate the whole Writ;
but that (as it seemeth) is intended where
the Count and Demand is of one entire
Contract; as a Precipe of a Mannor, and
Entry into part: For it is otherwise (as it
seemeth) where a <hi>Precipe</hi> is of sundry Acres,
and the Demandant enter into but one
of the Acres: But (by the same Book
50 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 4.) that ought to be pleaded, <hi>Puis
le darein Continuance:</hi> And (by most of the
other Books) if the Action were upon Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty,
then it can neither be pleaded to
the Writ, or in Bar of the Action, without
Specialty; and if the Defendant conclude
his Plea, in Bar, it goeth but to the
Action for part: But (as it seemeth) be the
Action either upon Specialty, or not, if
the Defendant plead in Bar the Resceit of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93066:9"/>
parcel, either before, or hanging the Writ,
he must plead the same by Deed, and it
goeth but to that part: But if the Plaintiff
bringeth an Action of twenty Pounds, and
declare that he is satisfied of ten Pounds,
the Writ doth abate of his own shewing;
for he ought to bring his Action only for
that which is behind, and declare himself
to be satisfied of the rest: But if he bring
his Action for the Whole, and <hi>Nil debet;</hi>
or a Release be pleaded to Part, that goeth
but to the same; and so it seemeth by the
Plea, <hi>quod non debet predict as vigints libras,
nec aliquem denarium inde.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in the said Book of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. Debt
was brought for Forty Pounds, declaring
part upon a Lease, parcel upon a Contract,
and part for Work done: And to part the
Defendant tendred his Law, to other part
he pleaded, <hi>ne Lessa pas (non dimisit,)</hi> and to
the residue he tendred the Mony in Court;
and the Plaintiff, as to the Plea of the
Lease, took Issue; and, to that of the Mony
tendred, he Rejoyn'd, that he had received
it accordingly; and, as to the residue, he
refused the Law; and to that, and the Point
of Receipt, the Writ only did abate, <hi>quod

General,<note place="margin">Reasons for Pleading the Common Bar, and giving a new Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</note> as in Trespass <hi>Quare clausum fregit,</hi>
if the Plaintiff so Declare, the Defendant,
as all the Books agree, may plead a Special
Plea to inforce the Plaintaiff in his Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to assign the Place more certain:
But this Plea of the Defendant must be also
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93066:10"/>
very certain, as 4 <hi>&amp; 5 Ph. &amp; Mar. Dyer</hi> 161.
for the Defendant to say, That the Place
where is six Acres, is no Plea, unless he also
give it a Name, or Boundaries: And so is
22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 24. that the Defendant shall plead
certainly; and this for the advantage of the
Defendant, for if he plead the <hi>General Issue,</hi>
the Plaintiff may in any Place in that
Town assign the Trespass: Or else, as is the
Book 28 <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> 23. If the Defendant
doth say, that the Place where is six Acres,
which is his Freehold, and the Plaintiff
Reply, That it is not his Freehold, &amp;c. If the
Plaintiff have a Close of like quantity, it
shall be intended the same: But the Plaintiffs
New Assignment must also be as true and
certain to all Intents, as is 9 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 204.
It must be both true in the Name, and in
the Boundaries; and must not be (as there)
<hi>una acr' prat' sive terr'.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 11. and 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 2. and
other Books, the Plaintiff must say also in
his Declaration, <hi>alia quam, &amp;c.</hi> And then,
as in 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 24. the Defendant shall not
plead, that the Place where <hi>is all one, &amp;c.</hi>
but shall have advantage thereof best by
the General Issue, if the Pleas aforesaid be
entred; and so is, 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 5. 4. Yet in the
said Book 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 2. the Defendant did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn,
that the Place was <hi>all one, &amp;c.</hi> and
known by one Name. But as 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 22.
where the Defendant in his Bar said, <hi>The
Place where was an Acre and three Roods;</hi> the
Plaintiff might have assigned the Trespass
in the three Roods, without the Acre, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93066:10"/>
the Bar, as to the Acre, to no purpose.
And 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 11. the Defendant did plead,
That the Place where was three Acres par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel

him enfeoff, &amp;c. To which the Plaintiff
Replied, That the Place where was the said
three Acres, and thirty Acres more, parcel
of the said Mannor; and <hi>no Plea,</hi> because
he doth not say, <hi>Al' quam;</hi> or agreeing with
the Defendant's Answer: So that it seemeth
the Plaintiff may Reply to, or take Issue
upon the Defendant's Plea, if it should be
untrue, as for the most part, the first part
of it is.</p>
               <p>And it should seem also by 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 24.

That the Defendant came back again the

also it appeareth, that where one Justifieth
the same Day, he need not conclude, <hi>Que est

Vide Noy</hi>'s Reports, fol. 70. <hi>Roll</hi>'s and <hi>Walter</hi>'s
Case; where in Replevin the Defendant
avowed Damage fesant, as Tenant to <hi>I. S.</hi>
who was seised <hi>in jure Ecclesiae,</hi> and demised
to him for years; and held good without

name the Defendant <hi>Parson Imparsonee,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
till then, in that Case, he cannot plead
in Bar.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Co. 1 Inst.</hi> fol. 145. the Sheriff ought to
take two sorts of Pledges in Replevin, one
by the Common Law, <hi>ad prosequend' Quere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam;</hi>
and the other by the Statute, <hi>De Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torno

By <hi>Co. 1 Inst.</hi> fol. 145. several persons, whose

that when the Plaintiff declares, that the

Plaintiff shall recover all in Damages; and
also 'tis there said, that if the Beasts are chased
into another County after they are taken,
the Party may have a Replevin in which of

               <p>Note, If Replevin be before the Sheriff
by Writ, it may be removed by the Plaintiff

               <p>Note also, If live Beasts or Cattle, and
Goods and Chattels (which are Dead, or
things Inanimate) are named together, and
Replevied by one Writ, as they may, the
live Beasts or Cattle must be named before
the dead, as <hi>Quandam vaccam suam &amp; que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
averia sua, que</hi> J. S. <hi>cepit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note farther, That by the Common Law,
when the Goods or Chattels of any Person
are taken, he may have a Writ out of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93066:12"/>
Chancery, commanding the Sheriff to make
Replevin of them, and this Writ is <hi>Vicontiel,</hi>
and in the nature of a <hi>Iusticies,</hi> (by which
the Sheriff may hold Plea of any value, and
in all Cases;) but when the Defendant
claims property, and when more than one
live Beast is taken, then the Form of the
Writ is, <hi>Quod Replegiari faceret</hi> J. S. <hi>quendam
Spadonem, vel Equam, &amp;c.</hi> And when many
dead Chattels are taken, then the Writ shall
be, <hi>Quod Replegiari faceret bona &amp; catalla sua,</hi>
and the Plaintiff must ascertain them in the
Declaration; but if but one dead Chattel
be taken, then the Writ shall be, <hi>Quod Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plegiari<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 627, 628. the Plaintiff brought
Trespass for taking an Hide; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
pleaded in Justification, That the
Major and Communalty of <hi>London</hi> were seis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of an House called <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> where he
took the said Hide Damage-feasant, as their
Servant, &amp;c. To which the Plaintiff Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
That <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> is an ancient Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
for Fridays, and that he bought the
Hide there on such a Friday; and that he
had the same on his Back, to carry away,
<hi>quousque</hi> the Defendant took it <hi>prout</hi> in
<hi>Narr':</hi> And tho' Objected, that the Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is not good, because he concludes
not, <hi>Que est eadem Captio, &amp;c.</hi> for that he
varies from the manner of the <hi>Caption,</hi> and
by his Pleading takes from the Defendant's
Authority; yet Resolved good without it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it agrees with the Defendants Plea, in
Time and Place of the <hi>Caption.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:93066:13"/>
So, 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 8. 98. in Trespass, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
pleaded, that he is <hi>Clericus &amp; seisitus de
Rectoria de</hi> A. <hi>in jure Ecclesiae,</hi> and makes
Prescription for him, and all his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
Parsons of that Church, to have had a
Way, time out of Mind, in such a place;
but says not, that he was a Parson; and
notwithstanding it was Objected, that he
had not enabled himself to make a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription;
yet forasmuch as he hath alledged,
that he is seised <hi>in jure Ecclesiae,</hi> it tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
thereto, and is good.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Plea in Abatement,</hi> in our Law, being as

(<hi>Britton,</hi> cap. 51.) or rather an Effect of it:
For the Exception alledged and made good,

               <p>There is also a Plea in Abatement <hi>to the

which is, where a Matter is alledged in any
Court, that ought to be tried in another:
Or, a Refusal of the Judge as Incompetent,

<hi>Anno 4 H. 8. cap.</hi> 2. and 22 <hi>Ejusdem cap. 2, &amp;</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>But before we Treat of Pleas in Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we shall consider, <hi>What Pleas shall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Defendant, by his Appearance, Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
&amp;c.</hi> As to which the Tenant or
Defendant ought especially to take Care,
that by his Appearance, and taking of <hi>Idem
dies</hi> or Imparlance, he Conclude not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of his Advantage in Pleading; for by
our Law-Books <hi>Idem dies</hi> is before Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and Imparlance after, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Party: And therefore Note,
<hi>That after Imparlance General, one shall not
plead to the Iurisdiction,</hi> as is 22 <hi>H. 6. a.</hi> But
if the Imparlance be Special, <hi>viz. Salvis sibi
omnibus &amp; omnimodis Advantagiis tam ad
Breve quam ad Narrationem,</hi> it is otherwise:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93066:14"/>
But to the Writ (it seemeth after a General
Imparlance one may plead Jointenancy,
Non-tenure, Over-Dale and Nether-Dale,
and the like, whereof he is not <hi>Estopped</hi> by
his Appearance, as is the Book of 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 36.
But <hi>Misnosmer,</hi> and the like, after a General
Appearance, and Imparlance, he shall be
Concluded of, as are the Books; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Jurisdiction of the Court after Declaration,
the same shall not be Entred until the Plea
be discust, and the Continuance shall be

oust the Parties of Jurisdiction, although
they themselves seem to take no advantage
thereby, as in 22 <hi>Ed 4. 23. b.</hi> in Trespass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the Judgment in that Case is, as in other

               <p>Next we shall consider what Pleas may
be pleaded to the Jurisdiction, and they are
Ancient Demesn, County Palatine, Cinque

to the Action, the Iurisdiction is admitted;</hi>
unless as in 1 <hi>R. 3. 1. Natura Brevium,</hi> and
other Books, where Trespass is brought <hi>Vi

in the County Court, or Court Baron, then
the Court ought to take Consideration
therein. And it appears by 49 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 34.
That every Castle of the Cinque-Ports is
intended Gildable, and not of the Ports,
<hi>quod nota.</hi> And the Lieutenant of <hi>Dover</hi>
Castle was Assest in King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>First</hi>'s

               </p>
               <p>This Plea to the Jurisdiction being to be
pleaded at the first, unless in special Cases,
as before: The next in order, is to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
then to the Count, after that to the
Writ, and to the Action of the Writ, and
the last is in Bar.</p>
               <p>And therefore next to the Pleas to the

                  <hi>viz. Villenage, Utlary, Alien, Hors de Protection,

the last of which, the Defendant must shew
the Letters of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which Plea
doth not abate the Writ; for upon the
Plaintiff's shewing his Letters of <hi>Absolution</hi> in
Court, he shall have a <hi>Resummons</hi> against the

                  <note place="margin">Of Pleas to the Writ.</note> they be of two
sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> the one <q>Apparent in the Writ,
of which the Defendant may at all times

of the Place where the Action is

is bound to take in time, and to look
that he be not Concluded of them by his
General Appearance, Continuance, or
Imparlance, as before is mentioned: And
Note, that it appeareth in a Report 3 <hi>Eliz.</hi>

And so 9 <hi>Ed</hi> 4. 31. where Dower was brought

               <p>In the next place we will proceed to the
Form of the Defendant's Pleadings:<note place="margin">Of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's Pleading, and first of his Defence.</note> And

Attaint,</hi> and <hi>Scire facias,</hi> the Defendant shall
only say <hi>Venit &amp; dicit,</hi> without other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
And 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 23. in an Assise of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
in the Common Pleas, there shall be
<hi>Defence,</hi> otherwise not; and in <hi>Brook</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment,

Defendant pleads to the Person, he may
make half a <hi>Defence,</hi> viz. <hi>Venit &amp; defendit

And so is 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. there in a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> or

A <hi>Protestation in Pleading</hi> therefore, is by
some defined to be a Defence of Safeguard
to the Party that makes it, from being
Concluded by the Act he is about to do,
that Issue cannot be joyned upon it, <hi>Plowd.</hi>
fol. 276, <hi>b. per Walsh ibidem.</hi> Or, it is a Form

               <p>But by <hi>Plowden,</hi> in <hi>Grayslake</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi>'s
Case in his <hi>Com.</hi> it is said to be, <q>A Saving

which is (in that Point) left doubtful by

               <p>
                  <hi>Colour</hi> signifies a Probable Plea, but in

               </p>

in the Plaintiff, without any

That where a Plea is either pleaded to the

               <p>And Note, that by the Book of 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6.

may plead the same to a Part: Where it is
said by <hi>Moyle,</hi> That a <hi>Release</hi> or <hi>Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

pleaded without an <hi>Averment</hi> of the Plea;

               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93066:22"/>
There needs no <hi>General Averment</hi> in a

But by the same Book, 251. where
the Administrator, <hi>durante minori aetate,</hi> is
Plaintiff in a Suit, there the <hi>Nonage</hi> of the
Executor must be Averred; <hi>Secus,</hi> where
he is Defendant.</p>
               <p>Yet by <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s <hi>Abridgment,</hi> Tit. <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
fo. 230. the Executor of a Grantee of

without an <hi>Averment,</hi> that the <hi>Arrerages</hi>
incurred after the Death of the Tenant for

               <p>And so by <hi>Hobart,</hi> fo. 141, 142. he that
pleads a <hi>Dispensation</hi> to hold in <hi>Commendam,</hi>
confirmed by the Kings Charter, must aver
the Performance of the Condition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it.</p>
               <p>So by <hi>Perkins, cap.</hi> 147. If the <hi>Defeasance</hi>
of a <hi>Recognizance</hi> be dated before, if in this
Case any use be to be made of it, it must
be Averred to be delivered at or after the
time of the Recognizance entred into.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Coke</hi>'s Rep. <hi>lib. 8. Case of the. City of
London,</hi> and <hi>lib. 9. 54. Averment</hi> needs not be
of what is apparent; as the Constitution
made in <hi>London,</hi> concerning the Sale of
of Wares and Merchandizes appearing to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93066:23"/>
be agreeable to, and waranted by their
Charter, the same needs not be Averred
to be so; and if the Son bring an <hi>Assize</hi> of
<hi>Mortdancestor,</hi> he needs not to Aver, that it
is within the time of Limitation, for that
it appears to be so.</p>
               <p>And by the same Author, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. 40. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
any other Consideration, than what
is a Deed, may not be <hi>Averred;</hi> yet where
there is an Express Consideration in it self
in the Case; as where a Use of Land is
limited to a Wife; this implies a sufficient
Consideration in it self, and therefore needs
<hi>no Averment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Hobart</hi> 32. an <hi>Averment</hi> may be upon
a Will; but by <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 5. 68. an <hi>Averment</hi> will
not lye of any thing that is against or besides
that, which is against or besides that which is
expressed in a Will, nor of any thing that
cannot be gathered, to be the Mind of him
that made the Will, by the Words thereof,
nor of any thing that doth not cohere
with the Will, especially if the Devise be
of Lands: As where one Devises to <hi>A.</hi> and
the Heirs of his Body, the Remainder to <hi>B.</hi>
and the Heirs Males of his Body, on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that he or they, or any of them,
shall not alien, &amp;c. In this Case no <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
may be taken by Witnesses, that it was
the Intent of the Devisor to include <hi>A.</hi>
within the Condition by the words <hi>He,</hi> or
<hi>They, &amp;c.</hi> So neither may an <hi>Averment</hi> be
taken, that the Intent was to give it to any
other besides the Devisee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:93066:23"/>
But by <hi>Hobart</hi> 50. an Arbitrement in
Writing, may not be supplied by an <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And by <hi>Bulstrode,</hi> first Part, fo. 220.
and <hi>Popham,</hi> fo. 201. it appears, that if Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for three Lives make a Lease to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Lessee, in an Action brought by
him, needs not to <hi>aver</hi> the Lives under
which he claimeth. Nor by <hi>Goldesborough,</hi>
fo. 97. needs he that sueth an Administrator
upon the <hi>Assumpsit</hi> of the Deceased, <hi>aver</hi>
he had Assets, after Debts and Legacies
paid.</p>
               <p>So by <hi>Hobart</hi> 297, and <hi>Coke</hi> on <hi>Littleton</hi> 373.
it appears, that if a Tenant disclaim
upon an Avowry in <hi>Replevin,</hi> he shall have
Judgment, tho' it be false: For no <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
will lye against a violent Presumption,
though it be false.</p>
               <p>By the Book of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 42. and of 9 <hi>Ed</hi>
4. 4. an <hi>Averment</hi> may be had against any
part of the Rolls or Records of County-Courts,
Hundred Courts, Courts-Baron, or
other Courts belonging to Lords of Mannors.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Dyer</hi> 348. 177. no <hi>Averment</hi> will
lye against such a Retorn as is definitive to
the Trial of the thing Retorned; as the
Retorn of a Sheriff upon his Writs, the
Retorn of the Mayor, Aldermen and She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
of <hi>London</hi> upon a Writ of <hi>Habeas
Corpus,</hi> sent to them, and the like.</p>
               <p>But if it be such as is not Definitive, as
upon a <hi>Rescous,</hi> or the like, there an <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and a Trial upon it may lye. So, if
it be such a Retorn as may endanger a mans
Life or Inheritance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:93066:24"/>
Also by the Statute of 1 <hi>Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 3. and
<hi>Goldesbrough</hi> 129, 130. and <hi>Croke</hi> 2 Part,
fo. 13. an <hi>Averment</hi> will lye against the
Bayliffs of <hi>Franchises,</hi> so that the Lords
thereof be not prejudiced thereby.</p>
               <p>The same Law of <hi>Certificates:</hi> For by
<hi>Co. Lib. 7. 14. &amp; Lib.</hi> 9. 31. and <hi>Bro. Abr.</hi> 332.
no <hi>Averment</hi> will lye upon such a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
as is a Definitive Trial in Law of the
thing Certified; as the Certificate of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
touching <hi>Bastardy, Excommunication,
Marriage, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by <hi>Co. Lib. 7. 14. &amp; Lib.</hi> 8. 121. and
<hi>Leon.</hi> 1 Part, <hi>Case</hi> 285. an <hi>Averment</hi> may lye,
and shall be received against a Certificate
which is only to give Information, and in
the Nature of a Trial; and may also lye
against a Certificate upon a Commission out
of any Court; and may likewise be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
against the Certificate of Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that affirm a man to be a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Bro.</hi> 332. If a Bishop Certify, that
such a Parson doth not pay his Tenths
<hi>Iuxta formam Statuti,</hi> no <hi>Averment</hi> shall be
received against it.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>More, Case</hi> 295. an <hi>Averment</hi>
will not lye against a Justice of the
<hi>Kings Bench,</hi> or <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and the <hi>Custos
Brevium, quod habetur Warantum Attorn',</hi>
albeit the Party himself (against whom the
Certificate is) be dead, and a <hi>Scire facias</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:93066:24"/>
So in <hi>Yelverton</hi> 34. an <hi>Averment</hi> will not
be admitted against a Fine taken by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
that there is no such man of the
Name of one of the Commissioners.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Co.</hi> on <hi>Littleton</hi> 171. If a Partition be
by Writ, although it be unequal it may not
be avoided by <hi>Averment;</hi> for such <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
against the Retorn of a Sheriff, shall
not be good: But by <hi>Winch,</hi> in his Reports
fo. 100. an <hi>Averment</hi> may be made in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Action, tho' not in the same.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 8. 31. and <hi>Dyer</hi> 244. and <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
277. where a man hath two Sons of one
Name, and one of them hath been long
absent and thought to be dead, and this is
the Eldest, and by Will he gives his Land
in general to his Son of that Name, and
the Eldest Son is alive: In this Case an
<hi>Averment</hi> will lye, that it was his intent to
give it to the Youngest, and not to the
Eldest Son; and upon a Trial the Jury may
find it so.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 4. fo. 4. no <hi>Averment</hi> will
lye, that the Devise was to any other use,
but to the use of the Devisee himself.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Godbolt</hi> in his Reports, fo. 131. If
one devise Land to the Heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> and
the Clerk writes it, <hi>To</hi> J. S. <hi>and his Heirs;</hi>
this may be holpen by <hi>Averment,</hi> for the
Intent is written, and more, and it shall be
naught for what is against his Will, and
good for the rest. But if the Devise be to
<hi>I. S.</hi> and his Heirs, and it is written, but
<hi>to the Heirs of</hi> J. S. there an <hi>Averment</hi> will
not help: For an <hi>Averment</hi> to take away a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93066:25"/>
                  <hi>Surplusage,</hi> is good; but not to increase
that which is defective in a Will.</p>
               <p>And Note, That an <hi>Averment</hi> will lye
against a Testament, or Letters of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
although they be under the Seal
of the Court, and it shall be tried by the
Country.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Godbolt</hi> 214. an <hi>Averment</hi> may be,
that one is Sued out of his proper Diocess,
if it doth not appear in the Libel, where
one is Sued in the Arches. So where one
Sueth in the Court of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> for a
thing done upon the Land, an <hi>Averment</hi> may
be, that the Contract was made <hi>infra Corpus
Comitatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 11. an <hi>Averment,</hi> in some
Cases, shall be received against a Verdict,
to prove it false.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Dyer</hi> 242. If the Matter contained
in an <hi>Award,</hi> and the Matter contained in
the <hi>Submission</hi> of that Award, do not agree,
it will hardly be supplied by <hi>Averment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, by <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>Commentary</hi> upon
<hi>Littleton,</hi> fo. 352. <hi>b.</hi> it appears, that the Use
of an <hi>Averment</hi> is, to ascertain that to the
Court which is generally or doubtfully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that so the Court may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
of whom, or of what it ought to be
understood; and a man shall never be
Estopped from making such an <hi>Averment,</hi>
to ascertain the Intent of the Parties; if it
be not utterly inconsistent with that which
is alledged: For an <hi>Estoppel</hi> being to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a man from speaking that which
is Truth, must be certain to every Intent,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93066:25"/>
and shall never be taken by Argument or

               <p>But of this see more Tit. <hi>Estoppel,

               <p>Next in Order,<note place="margin">Of Pleas in Bar.</note> some Points shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed
touching <hi>Matters in Bar;</hi> and herein
shall be shewn, What <hi>Pleas</hi> are sufficient in
<hi>Bar</hi> for the Matters of the same, and what
not. And,</p>
               <p>First, What <hi>Plea</hi> is good in <hi>Bar</hi> without
Deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Touching which there is a Maxim in Law,</hi>
That where the Action lieth meerly upon the
Deed,<note place="margin">Maxim in Law.</note> as upon a Bill, or Obligation, or the like,
there no Plea can go in discharge of the same,
without Deed; as all the Books agree.</p>
               <p>Yet 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 14. if one Count upon a
Lease by Indenture, or a Bailment by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture,
the Defendant may plead <hi>Nil
debet,</hi> or <hi>Non detinet,</hi> but not <hi>Non dimisit,</hi> by
<hi>Littleton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere,</hi> of a Bargain and Sale by Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for Mony to be paid at a Day: For
28 <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> 20. upon a Bill testifying a
Receipt of Mony to be laid out in Pruans,
the Defendant shall not wage his Law.</p>
               <p>The like 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 18. in an Annuity with
Clause of Distress, <hi>Levied by Distress,</hi> or
<hi>Payment without Acquittance,</hi> a good Plea:
Otherwise, if granted without Distress;
where holden also, that if one be bound in
a Bond, with Condition to pay such an
Annuity, be the same with Distress, or
without, he may (as I conceive) plead
Payment without Acquittance, because
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93066:26"/>
contained in the Condition of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And by 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. in <hi>Statam</hi>'s Case, in an
Action against the Sheriff, upon an Escape,
because the Action is not meerly upon the
Record, as Debt upon a Judgment, the
Defendant may plead, That he let the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
go at large by the Commandment of
the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>And yet it is holden in Trespass, for
taking away the Plaintiff's Apprentice,
21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 31. to be no Plea, to say, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
taking of the Apprentice away, the
Plaintiff discharged him of his Service
without Deed; <hi>quod nota.</hi> And so indeed
seemeth 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 14. in <hi>Dove</hi>'s Case, in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
against an Apprentice.</p>
               <p>And 30 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 40. no Plea in a <hi>Scire facias,</hi>
to have Execution upon an Annuity, to say,
That the Plaintiff did deliver him the Deed
of Annuity as a Release, and afterwards
took it away from him again.</p>
               <p>The like seemeth by 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 14. in <hi>Dove</hi>'s
Case before recited, in Debt upon an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
yet there holden, That by some
Pleas, as Matters in Law, <hi>viz. Infancy, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress,
Razure,</hi> and the like, one may avoid a
Deed en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ealed.</p>
               <p>In the next place we shall observe,<note place="margin">Of Bars to avoid Circuit of Action.</note> What
shall be taken to be good <hi>Bars,</hi> to avoid

to sue by <hi>Petition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so it seems of <hi>Wast,</hi> in 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 47.
be the Grant by Lease; whereof Doubt is
made afterwards in 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 23, &amp; 30. where
the Principal Case was, That the Obligee

Reason shall the <hi>Garnishee,</hi> or <hi>Tenant by
Resceit,</hi> Rebut by a Release or Waranty.</p>
               <p>And upon the Reason aforesaid it is,
that where one Thing is granted in Law, so
another, (especially of Things Executory,
and not Executed) if he be Interpleaded of
that which to him appertains, he shall plead
the same in Bar of that whereof he made
the Grant; as appears by <hi>Perkins,</hi> in the
Title of <hi>Exchanges,</hi> where Rent is granted

was, to Warant and save harmless

<hi>Quod habuit &amp; pacifice gavisus fuit;</hi> where
said by divers, that the Plea is ill, and but
Argumentative, that is, he hath peaceably
Enjoyed the Land; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he hath Waranted

to perform an Award, which was,
<hi>To deliver up all the Houses that he had.</hi> The

&amp;c.</hi> without shewing what they were, and
Adjudged <hi>ill:</hi> And where it was Awarded,
That <hi>he should discharge and save harmless</hi> A.
<hi>from such an Obligation,</hi> he pleads, <hi>Non
dampnificatus;</hi> and <hi>ill</hi> also: For he was
not only to save him harmless, but to
discharge him of the Bond, and both of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93066:29"/>
them ought to be shewed, how done parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>

with Condition to perform an Award;
which was, <hi>To Enfeoff, or Release, or pay</hi> 20s.
The Defendant pleads <hi>Performance generally,</hi>
not shewing which of them he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
and <hi>ill.</hi> For although Performance
of any one of them would have been a
good Excuse, yet he must shew what he hath
performed.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Bendloe</hi>'s <hi>Rep. 5. A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> were joyntly

Arbitrators Awarded, that <hi>A.</hi> should pay
30 <hi>s.</hi> to <hi>B,</hi> and that <hi>B.</hi> should pay unto <hi>I. S.</hi>
Ten shillings. In Debt on the Bond it will
be no good Plea for <hi>A.</hi> to say, that he had
performed the Award, without shewing in

Note, by <hi>Dyer 75. Kelway 121. Plowd. 11.
19 H.</hi> 6. 37. there is a difference between
<hi>Arbitrement</hi> and <hi>Concord:</hi> For an <hi>Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
may be pleaded, tho' the time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it be not yet come; but a
<hi>Concord</hi> must be Executed and satisfied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can be pleaded; for there is no way
to force the doing of it, as there is in Case
of Arbitrement.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Bridgman</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 58. it appears, That if
the Arbitrement be made of a thing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto, and of other things, it will be
good for what is submitted unto, and void
for the rest; and a <hi>Breach</hi> laid in that which
was submitted unto, will give good Cause
of Action.</p>

Agreed, the Plea had been <hi>good,</hi> if he had

To which the Defendant pleads, Conditions
performed. The Plaintiff Replies, That

because he shews not what he had to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for: And difference is taken, when
the Condition is in the Negative, <hi>Not to do

               <p>And therefore in 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 1. the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
in <hi>Maintenance</hi> did plead, That the

and <hi>Pleading,</hi> fo. 192. <hi>Reg.</hi> 7. a Bar may be
good to a Common Intent, tho' not to
every Intent; as if Debt be brought against
five Executors, and three of them make
default, and two appear and plead in Bar a
Recovery had against them two of 300 <hi>l.</hi>
and that they have nothing in their hands
over and above that Sum. If this Bar should
be taken strongest against them, it should
be Intended that they might have Abated
the first Suit, because the other three were
not named, and so the Recovery not duly
had against them; but according to the
the Rule the Bar is good: For that by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intendment it will be supposed, that
the two others did only Administer, and so
the Action well considered, rather than to
imagine that they would have lost the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and advantage of Abating the first Writ.</p>
               <p>So by 3 <hi>H. 7. 2. Plowd. 26. If a Bar have
Matter of Substance in it, and be good to Common
Intent, it is sufficient, albeit it be not good to
every Special Intent.</hi> As where one Sues as
Executor, and the Defendant saith, That
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93066:31"/>
the Testator made the Plaintiff and one
<hi>I. S.</hi> Executors, and do not say after this
That he did not make the Plaintiff Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
yet this may be sufficient. So in
<hi>Trespass,</hi> where the Defendant pleads, that
the Place is his Freehold, this is <hi>good;</hi> yet
the Plaintiff may have a particular Estate.
So upon an Obligation to perform Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants;
the Defendant alledgeth two
Covenants, and saith, he hath Performed
them, and doth not say, There are no more
Covenants in the Deed to be by him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
yet this is <hi>good,</hi> for it shall be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that there are no more for him to
perform.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ibidem, No substantial part of a Bar
may be omitted:</hi> As, where one is bound to
do a thing between such and such a time;
and the Defendant saith, That he did it, or
did it before the Day; this is not sufficient,
but he must shew, that he did it such a Day
within those times. So if one saith, He
was Lord of a Mannor, and entred for an
Alienation in <hi>Mortmain,</hi> and do not shew
that he did it within the Year; for this
shall not be Intended, unless it be shewed.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>per Plowden puis</hi> 28. If one plead a
Feoffment in Bar, it shall be allowed as <hi>good,</hi>
albeit it might be by an Infant, or <hi>per Duress,
&amp;c.</hi> unless it be shewed on the other side.
And if the Lessor Covenants with the Lessee,
that if he be ousted within the Term, that
he shall have as much other Land, he must
shew that he was Ousted on such a day in
certain within the term.</p>

               <p>So <hi>Ibidem,</hi> in an Assize, if the Tenant
plead in Bar a Discent to the Plaintiff, and
two others, and that he hath the Estate of

have it by Disseisin; but it shall be taken in

               <p>So <hi>per eandem,</hi> in <hi>Colthirst</hi>'s Case, where
the Ancestor is <hi>Tenant pur auter vie,</hi> and the

and says not, that he Entred <hi>first</hi> after his

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Ibidem,</hi> if a Lease be made to <hi>A.</hi> and
<hi>B.</hi> for Life, the Remainder to <hi>C.</hi> and if <hi>C.</hi>

that it shall remain to <hi>E.</hi> for Life, <hi>si ipse

<hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> and doth not say, when
they died, nor when he entred; yet held to

               </p>
               <p>For <hi>per eundem 32 &amp;</hi> 33. if it be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
it shall be Intended that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
did Enter as soon as his Title accrued;
and if the Case be otherwise in truth, than
by Common Intendment it is taken to be,
the Plaintiff must set it forth in his Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
As in a <hi>Formedon in Discender,</hi> if the
Tenant pleads in Bar a Release of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant,
without Waranty, it is <hi>good;</hi> and
yet the Release might be made by the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93066:32"/>
Demandant in the Life of his Father, and
then it is no Bar to the Issue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it seems by</hi> Brook, <hi>in his Title of</hi>
Pleading, 155. <hi>that in a Declaration or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
this way of Pleading is not good:</hi>
For tho' a Bar may be good to Common Intent,
yet a Declaration (and consequently a Replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or other Pleadings of the Plaintiff) ought
to be good to every Intent.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 3. 52. If one declare upon
an Escape in <hi>London,</hi> and the Defendant doth
Justify by the Taking again of the Prisoner
in another County, and answereth not the
Escape in <hi>London;</hi> this will not be good,
for every part of the Charge must be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
               <p>And Lastly, It appears by <hi>Hobart</hi> 127,

In other Cases the Plaintiff, upon the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
Plea, shall be barred for the present, and
yet afterwards have the Effect of his Suit by
<hi>Scire Facias,</hi> or the like Process upon that Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p>As appears in 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 27. in Debt against
an Executor, who pleads <hi>Plene Administravit,</hi>
which is found for him, and so the Plaintiff
is Barred <hi>pro tempore, viz.</hi> until <hi>Assets</hi> come
afterwards to the Defendant's Hands, and
then the Plaintiff may have a <hi>New Action.</hi>
So in Debt against an <hi>Heir,</hi> who pleads
<hi>Riens per Discent;</hi> or in a <hi>Formedon</hi> pleads
the Waranty of his <hi>Ancestor</hi> with <hi>Assets,</hi> and
after the <hi>Assets</hi> are Recovered against him,
he shall have a <hi>New Formedon;</hi> and if he
Alien the <hi>Assets,</hi> his Heir shall have a <hi>New
Formedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 10. where in <hi>Formedon, Cui

Plea is pleaded either against the Issue in
Tail, or the Heir of Tenant by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy,

               </p>

doubted, when Executors plead <hi>Fully Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>How an
Accord or Arbitrement is a good Bar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for this see first 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. That in
Debt upon a <hi>Contract, Lease,</hi> or <hi>Arrerages of
Account</hi> before the Plaintiff himself, <hi>Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is a good Plea, (although the Demand
be certain;) otherwise of <hi>Arrerages of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
before Auditors,</hi> because it seems to be
<hi>Matter of Record,</hi> and the Defendant cannot
Wage his Law, <hi>Qu.</hi> then in Debt upon a
Lease for years.</p>
               <p>And 13 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 5. is, That an <hi>Award</hi> is no
Plea in Attaint, or other Matter of Record;
but if the <hi>Matter of Record</hi> be mixt with a
<hi>Matter en fait,</hi> then it is a good Plea.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Wast,</hi> as is 11 <hi>H. 7. 13. Accord</hi> or
<hi>Arbitrement</hi> no Plea, because the Action
Mixt, nor in any Real Action; but in
<hi>Forger of Faits,</hi> and other Actions upon
Statutes, <hi>Accord</hi> or <hi>Arbitrement</hi> is a good
Plea.</p>
               <p>But 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 7. this difference is taken, that
<hi>Accord</hi> pleaded is not good, without a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
executed before the Action brought,
and that it must be Executed in the whole,
and not in part; (as is 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 10.) But an
<hi>Arbitrement</hi> is, without Execution, a good
Plea, because an Action lieth thereupon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:93066:34"/>
And therefore 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 29. the Defendant
did plead, That in Satisfaction he gave the
Plaintiff a Pottle of Wine, and did not
plead the same by way of <hi>Accord, soy prist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But see thereof more especially for the

Real, the Waranty of the Ancestor of the

Conclusion of the Plea must be considered,
which appears by the Books of <hi>Entries</hi> to
be, <hi>Si encounter le Garanty son Auncestor qui
Heir, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as it appears by 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. and <hi>H.</hi> 7.
12. and other Books in the Title <hi>Garanty</hi> in
<hi>Brook</hi>'s <hi>Abridgment,</hi> the same by the better
Opinion, is no Plea in Trespass, until the
Freehold come in debate.</p>
               <p>Yet 21 <hi>Ed. 4. 18. Ibidem</hi> 63. the Defendant
in Trespass did plead, That <hi>I. S.</hi> was seised
in Fee, to whom the Ancestor of the
Plaintiff did Release with Waranty, whose
Estate the Defendant had, and Concluded
<hi>ut supra;</hi> and there is no Question made,
whether that Plea might be in Trespass;
but whether he that made himself no Title,
shall plead the same.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 20. in Trespass
upon the Statute of <hi>Rich.</hi> the Feoffment
of the Ancestor of the Plaintiff, with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,

of a Chattel, without Esplees of Waranty,

the Plea of <hi>Auterfoits bar</hi> shall be a good

and <hi>Bro. Action sur le Case 92, &amp;</hi> 110. that
<hi>Ley gager</hi> in Detinue, is a good Bar in an

               <p>And by <hi>Bryan 2 R. 3. 14, &amp;</hi> 19. in Account
upon Goods delivered, it is a good Plea to
say, That in Detinue before brought by
the Plaintiff, the Defendant did Wage his
Law.</p>
               <p>And so seems 15 <hi>Ed. 3. Fitz. Assize</hi> 96. that
in an Assize, a <hi>Retraxit</hi> by the Plaintiff in
another Assize, is a good Bar: Otherwise of
a <hi>Nonsuit</hi> by Experience; for until the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

               </p>
               <p>But if the Plaintiff be once barred by
Judgment, in the same or in one of the like
Nature, or in an Action of a higher Nature,
he shall be also Barred in another meaner
Action.</p>
               <p>But as it appears in 14 <hi>Assize</hi> 6. the Using
of a Writ of <hi>Entry</hi> is no Bar in a <hi>Formedon;</hi>
nor in an <hi>Assize,</hi> to plead, That the Plaintiff
had of this Land brought a <hi>Formedon;</hi> but
the same is a good Plea to the Writ: And so

               <p>But,<note place="margin">Recovery pleaded.</note> as it seemeth, to Plead a Recovery of

                  <hi>And first,</hi> Where the Defendant in his Bar,

               <p>For which see 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 28. in Trespass of

               </p>
               <p>And so is 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 24. in Trespass: But see

(as in a <hi>Praecipe,</hi> or in an <hi>Assize</hi>)
the Defendant shall not in his <hi>Bar</hi> give the

(according to the Ancient Practice) in

where the Defendant pleaded his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
and the Plaintiff did not set forth
the Particulars of the Land in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>But for the understanding of this and all
other Matters relating to Practice,
more fully and at large, see before
in the <hi>Introduction</hi> of this Discourse.
And further, for <hi>Certainty in Pleading,</hi>
take these General Observations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:93066:36"/>
First, see <hi>Plowden</hi> 32, 65, 80, 81, 86, 191,
229. that which is alledged by way of
<hi>Conveyance</hi> and <hi>Inducement</hi> to the Substance
of the Matter, needs not to be so Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
alledged, as that which is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
it self; as before, where a Lease is
made to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> for Life, the Remainder
to <hi>C.</hi> and if <hi>C.</hi> die during the Life of <hi>A.</hi> or
<hi>B.</hi> that it shall go to <hi>E.</hi> for his Life, &amp;c.
and <hi>E.</hi> in Pleading shews the death of
<hi>A.B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> but shews no time of their Death.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Plowden</hi> 80, 121, 123, 126, 128,
129. that which a man cannot have Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
knowledge of, he is not bound to plead
Certainly; nor to set forth that precisely
that is out of his knowledge, or to which
he is a Stranger, or by Common Intent he
cannot see; as a Deed that belongs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 9. 108. that shall be said
to be Certainly pleaded, which may be made
Certain by Intendment, according to the
Maxim, <hi>Id Certum est, quod Certum reddi
potest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 4. 97. and <hi>Plowd.</hi> 395. that is
more Certain, which is Certain of it self.
Yet, where the Defendant in Pleading
makes Title to himself by a Lease, <hi>Haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
for so many years as <hi>I. S.</hi> shall name,
<hi>Cum hoc,</hi> that <hi>I. S.</hi> did name so many,
there the Averment makes it Certain
enough, and good.</p>
               <p>So, many times when there is an Incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in a Case, by the addition of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to a Certainty, it may be made good:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93066:37"/>
As <hi>Perkins, Sect.</hi> 36. an Estate is granted to
<hi>I. S.</hi> the Remainder to him that shall come
first the next Morning to <hi>Pauls,</hi> and one
doth come there that is capable; this is a
good Remainder, for it may be made Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by Averment.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>Pasch. 39 Eliz. in B. R. Morgan</hi> and
<hi>Iohnson</hi>'s Case, one binds himself by Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to pay me all such Sums of Mony
as his Brother oweth unto me; this by
Averment may be made Certain, and is
good.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>Plowd.</hi> 191. if one Grant his Mannors
of <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and say not in what Parish or
County they are in; or make a Lease of
all his Lands in the Parish of <hi>A.</hi> and says not
in what County; these Grants in Pleading
may be made good by <hi>Averment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, if the King by his Letters Patents
grants to one all the Mannors and Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that did belong to the Priory of <hi>H.</hi>
or that were of <hi>I. S.</hi> who was Attainted:
These Grants by 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 20. and <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 9.
47. may be made good in <hi>Pleading</hi> by <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by <hi>Anderson 1 Part,</hi> 102. an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was upon 8 <hi>H. 6. quod intravit in unum
Tenementum;</hi> and held void for the Incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
               <p>And <hi>March</hi> Rep. <hi>Case</hi> 168. in <hi>Ejectione
firmae,</hi> and <hi>Not Guilty</hi> pleaded, the Jury
found them Not Guilty for part, and Guilty
<hi>in tanto ut Ius Mesuagii in Occupatione, &amp;c.
quantum stat super Ripam,</hi> and the Verdict
was held void for <hi>Incertainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:93066:37"/>
And so is 40 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 15. and <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 9. 74.
in Debt brought against Executors, who
plead <hi>plene Administravit,</hi> and the Jury find
they have <hi>Assets,</hi> but say not to what value;
this is also void for <hi>Incertainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by <hi>Plowd.</hi> 144, and <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 10. 40.
there must be a precise Affirmation of a
thing in Pleading, where it relates to Matter
of Substance; yet if the Pleading hit not
the very Words, if it contain the Matter
by necessary Implication, it may be good
enough.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Plowd.</hi> 435. a man is not bound
to one Form of Pleading, or to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Form, so he plead the Substance of the
Matter.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Hobart</hi> 72, 78. 124. That need not
be said on the one side, that will come pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
on the other.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Plowd.</hi> 104. 202. and <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 10. 40.
If a Plea hath two Intendments, the
strongest shall be taken against him that
pleads it, and it shall be taken most for the
advantage of his Adversary: As, in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
pleaded to an Action of Trespass, the
time when it was made must be shewed, for
it might be delivered before or after the
Trespass: and if not shewed when, it shall
be taken to be before.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>Idem Lib.</hi> 9. 109, 110. where <hi>Covin</hi>

will be sufficient to shew it Generally, for
it is secret and can hardly be known; and

Pleading, to shew it exactly or certainly.</p>

Dyer 27. Yelv. 103. Hob. 258, 297. Truth</hi> and

And,</p>

               </p>
               <p>The word <hi>Issue</hi> hath divers Applications
in our Law; but that which concerns our

depending in Suit, whereon the Parties
joyn, and put their Cause to the Trial of
the Jury, and is an Effect of a Cause pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding;

or Special.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>General Issue</hi> is, where the Defendant
makes a short and peremptory Defence to
the Plaintiff's <hi>Declaration,</hi> and is always in
the Negative; as <hi>Non assumpsit</hi> to an Action

               <p>A <hi>Special Issue</hi> is that, whore Special Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Writings of Contracts, &amp;c. written,

               <p>And it is called <hi>Evidence,</hi> because thereby

               <p>By <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 10. fo. 56. upon the Issue, <hi>Non

And by <hi>Plowd.</hi> 14. the <hi>Iury</hi> may find him
<hi>Guilty</hi> upon this; but being <hi>Specially found,</hi>
the Court cannot do it.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Hobart</hi> 187. an <hi>Unreasonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer</hi>
is good Evidence for this.</p>

for <hi>taking away Timber, and the Boughs of Trees
felled,</hi> the Defendant pleaded, as to the
Timber, <hi>Non Culpabilis;</hi> and to the Boughs,
made a <hi>Special Iustification</hi> by Custom of

Timber, and the <hi>Tenants</hi> the Branches or

Tenementis Custumar' Manerii:</hi> And because
the Defendant did Entitle himself to a

               <p>And therefore, First, in <hi>Maintenance</hi> it
appears, by 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 6. that if the Defendant

where it is said, that the Defendant in <hi>Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass

and gave them to him, <hi>without that,</hi> that he
took any Goods of the Plaintiffs; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>And 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 39. the Defendant in Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass

                  <hi>For which see first,</hi> 30 H. 8. Dyer 41. <hi>upon
the Plea of</hi> Ne unques seisie que Dower, <hi>the

<hi>or the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 1 <hi>&amp; 2 Mar. Dyer</hi> 112. the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
upon <hi>Non est factum,</hi> gave in Evidence,
That the Plaintiff afterwards pull'd off one
of the Seals of the Obligation; and
Doubted.</p>
               <p>And 3 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 192. upon the Plea of
<hi>Ne unques son Baily pur Accompt render;</hi> the
Defendant shall not give in Evidence, That
according to the Bailment he did deliver
the same over; nor is the same Plea good
before Auditors; <hi>quod nota.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 5 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 222. if the Defendant in
Debt upon an Obligation, plead the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the Day, he cannot give in Evidence
an Acceptance of the same, or other thing
in lieu thereof before the day.</p>
               <p>And 10 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 276. upon <hi>Nul Wast
fait,</hi> the Defendant shall not give in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
That the Premisses were amended
before the Action brought; and yet see
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93066:50"/>
before that, to say, <hi>they were Ruinous at the
time of the Lease,</hi> and the like, shall be good
Evidence in this Case.</p>
               <p>And 10 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 272. in Debt against
an Heir, who pleaded <hi>Riens per discent;</hi> the
Plaintiff Replied, <hi>Assets</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and gave
in Evidence <hi>Assets</hi> in <hi>Cornwal;</hi> and Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But clear of Assets of Goods.</p>
               <p>Where 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. is Vouched, That where
Issue is upon <hi>Tender of Homage in a Foreign
County,</hi> they cannot find the same Tender
in the County where the Land is; but may
in any other Place, in the same County
where it is alledged to be Tendred; <hi>quod
nota:</hi> Where it is also said, that Assets al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in <hi>Dale, &amp; alibi in Com.</hi> C. all the
same must be Traversed.</p>
               <p>And yet 13 <hi>&amp; 14 Eliz. Dyer</hi> 305. in the
Case of an Obligation made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in
Debt against the Obligor in <hi>London,</hi> Issue
was taken, If the Obligation at the time
of the death of the Obligee were then in
<hi>London, viz. in Parochia beatae</hi> Mariae, when
it was in the same Ward, but not in the
same Parish, and therefore <hi>ill:</hi> But see more
of this in this Title, in the several Titles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then also further than before is declared,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Evidence suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Jury to take Cognizance of.</note>
                  <hi>shall be shewn,</hi> What is sufficient Evidence,
that the Iury shall be obliged to take Cognizance
of.</p>
               <p>And therefore, first, see 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 40. where,
upon the Plea of <hi>Ne unques Executor,</hi> if the
Defendant give in Evidence a <hi>Gift,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:93066:50"/>
in a <hi>Foreign County,</hi> the Jury are bound
to take Notice thereof upon pain of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint:</hi>
Where said also, That if the <hi>Mise</hi> be
joyned in a Writ of <hi>Right,</hi> the <hi>Grand Iury</hi>
are bound, upon Pain of Attaint, to find a
<hi>Release.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so is 40 <hi>Ass.</hi> 23. and <hi>Brook</hi> in this
Title 33. in <hi>Redisseisin,</hi> because but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of Office, and a Release not plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in those Actions.</p>
               <p>But by 43 <hi>Ass. 41. a.</hi> Release in an Assize
cannot be given in Evidence; otherwise of
a <hi>Feoffment.</hi> But <hi>Littleton</hi> is of Opinion, that
the Jury may, if they will, upon the General
Issue, find a <hi>Condition</hi> broken, or a <hi>Release,</hi>
as it seems, that doth Extinguish Right, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they may not be forced thereto upon
pain of <hi>Attaint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so it appears 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 19. That in
<hi>Decies tantum</hi> the Jury are not bound to find
a <hi>Taking</hi> in a <hi>Foreign County,</hi> although they
may, if they will; but if they find it by
Express words, then the <hi>Verdict</hi> is also
ill: And so of <hi>Assets,</hi> and such Things
Transitory; but otherwise of Local Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes.</p>
               <p>And 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1. in a Writ of <hi>Entry,</hi> in
Nature of <hi>Assize of Common,</hi> the Plaintiff
gave a Prescription in Evidence, and good;
because in this Action, as in an <hi>Assize,</hi> there
is no Title laid in the <hi>Count.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 16. where <hi>Divorce</hi> or <hi>Restore</hi>
pleaded to the Writ, the same may be given
in Evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:93066:51"/>
And it seems by 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 33. That where a
Matter in Law is given in Evidence by one,
the other may Demur.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What Writings the Jury shall take notice of, or may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them.</note> 
                  <hi>we shall Observe,</hi> What Deeds and
Writings are sufficient Evidence, such as the Iury
are to take notice of, or shall be delivered unto
them.</p>
               <p>First, It appears 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 17. and there laid
down as a <hi>Rule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rules.</note> That no <hi>Deed</hi> or <hi>Writing</hi>
whatsoever, shall be privily or secretly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the Jury, that was not openly
shewed.</p>
               <p>And, by 11 <hi>Ed. 4. 25, &amp;</hi> 38. That an
Office before an <hi>Escheator,</hi> unless Exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
not to be delivered to the Jury, no
more than a <hi>Testimonial;</hi> nor, by that
Reason, the Jury bound to Credit the
same.</p>
               <p>And 34. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 25. a Part of a <hi>Fine</hi> Indented,
unless Exemplified, not to be delivered to
the Jury, but with the Consent of both
Parties.</p>
               <p>No more shall any Copies of Books, by
9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 6. But a Part of a <hi>Fine,</hi> not Exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
delivered in Evidence, (as in <hi>Newse</hi>
and <hi>Scholastica</hi>'s Case) or any other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that they are not bound to take
notice of, they may yet, at their pleasure,
respect in their <hi>Verdict,</hi> or find the same
Specially.</p>
               <p>But 7 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 239. doubted, where the
Jury may find a Private Act of Parliament,
not delivered to them in Evidence, Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified,
or otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93066:51"/>
And the Matters aforesaid (as it seems)
are no Cause to Demur upon the Evidence,<note place="margin">Demurrer upon Evidence.</note>
no more than in <hi>Fogassa</hi>'s Case, because but
one Witness; for that the Jury may, upon
their own Knowledge, give a <hi>Verdict</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Evidence: Nor in any Case may one
Demur upon Evidence, unless he will admit
the Evidence to be true: Nor without the
Consent of the other Party (as it seems,)
which, according to the Opinion of many,
may put himself upon the Jury to find a
<hi>Verdict,</hi> which they may do either Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
or Specially, at their pleasure; which,
if they do Specially, they avoid all occasions
of Attaint.</p>
               <p>See for <hi>Demurrers in Evidence</hi> the Books
following, <hi>viz. 9 H.</hi> 6. 33. where it is said,
That upon a Matter in Law, the other
Party may Demur in Law, for it belongs
not to the Lay-Jury to Judge thereof; but
that, it seems, ought to be such a Matter that
the Judge must take to be doubtful.</p>
               <p>And so in the before-cited Case of <hi>Fogassa,</hi>
That the King's Attorney did Demur upon
the Evidence, and that (as it there appears)
whether the other would agree, or not:
But whether so in <hi>Newse</hi> and <hi>Scholastica</hi>'s
Case, <hi>quaere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And see the Book of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 36. where
the Plaintiff in Annuity, by <hi>Prescription,</hi>
shewed a Deed, in Evidence, within time
of Mind; and the Defendant prayed, That
the Evidence might be Entred, and he would
Demur upon the same, and the Plaintiff
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93066:52"/>
would not agree to it; <hi>quod nota.</hi> But if
the Court think the Evidence good, the
other side may (as in <hi>Tatam</hi>'s Action upon
the Case 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8.) desire the Justices to Seal
a <hi>Bill of Exception,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bill of Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which in the <hi>Writ of
Error</hi> he may alledge, and not in <hi>Arrest of
Iudgment, ex Rigore Iuris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And see <hi>Dyer, 6 H.</hi> 8. 2. where in <hi>Debt</hi>
against an <hi>Executor,</hi> the Defendant did plead
<hi>plene Administravit,</hi> and gave in Evidence
a Redemption of a Pledge with his own
Mony, upon which the Plaintiff did De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
and by Assent of both Parties the Jury
was discharged; <hi>quod nota.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so seems Experience at this day, that
in Demurrer on Evidence the Consent of
both Parties is requisite.</p>

               <p>And it is to be Observed, that (upon <hi>Issues</hi>)
these Words, <hi>Modo &amp; forma,</hi> are not always

               <p>The next in Order,<note place="margin">Of <hi>Traverse</hi> in Pleading. What it is.</note> is touching <hi>Traverse
in Pleading;</hi> which signifies in Pleading,
to deny some Point, Matter, or Thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
on the other side, the formal Words
of which are in our French, <hi>Sans ceo,</hi> in
Latin, <hi>Absque hoc,</hi> and in English, <hi>Without
that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, first, to begin with the <hi>Time:</hi> It is
plain, (as hath been already said) that if the
Defendant in Trespass pleads <hi>Non Culpabilis,</hi>
he shall have no advantage of the <hi>Time,</hi>
but the Jury may find him Guilty at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day, be the Trespass <hi>Transitory</hi> or
<hi>Local.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:93066:56"/>
And by <hi>Littleton,</hi> in his Chapter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leases,</hi>
so. 13. In Trespass of <hi>Battery,</hi> and the
<hi>General Issue</hi> pleaded, the Jury may find
the Defendant Guilty at another day and
place.</p>
               <p>And so is also 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 47. and 39 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
all in the Title of <hi>Traverse;</hi> But in Case of
<hi>Trespass,</hi> and other Actions, if the Plaintiff
in his Declaration, lay a time before his
Cause of Action, the Defendant in all Cases
upon the General Issue, shall have advantage
thereof.</p>
               <p>But, on the contrary, if once he have
Cause of Action, it so still continueth until
he have discharged the same, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he may lay it after the day: The like,
as it seems upon the Issue of <hi>Non dimisit;</hi>
for (as before, <hi>Littleton,</hi> in the Chapter <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leases</hi>)
the Words <hi>Modo &amp; forma</hi> in an Issue
be not always of Substance: <hi>Quaere tamen,</hi>
if not, as if in the Number of years.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>as divers Books be,</hi> In many Cases
where the Defendant doth Iustify, he may Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
the Time before, and in some Cases the
Time after, and in other some, the Time before
and after.</p>
               <p>And therefore, where the Defendant, in
Trespass of Lands or Goods, maketh himself
Title, by a <hi>Feoffment, Gift,</hi> or otherwise,
which still is in force such a day after, he
shall only Traverse the Time before the
Trespass supposed.</p>

And so is 15 <hi>Ed. 4. 23. 22 H.</hi> 6. 29. and

where by a Lease, or other Title, made and
determined before the Day of the Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
there he must Traverse the <hi>Time</hi> after

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the</hi> Rule <hi>of the Book is,</hi>

And to that Intent is 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 14. where

nothing, but as Ordinary;</hi> Judgment, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Plaintiff Replied, <hi>That such a Day, Year and

               </p>
               <p>So that, by these later Books, it appears

Cases, may be made Material upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's
<hi>Plea</hi> and <hi>Traverse;</hi> which in some
Cases shall be only to the <hi>Time</hi> before: As
namely, when the Defendant pleading a

               </p>
               <p>But where his Plea enableth him but to

the Defendant pleading a <hi>Matter in Fait,</hi>
shall take no Traverse, but the same shall

without Traverse, and that for the Mischief

               <p>As is 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. where said also, That if

no Traverse.</p>
               <p>And so Note, in what Cases there shall
not be any <hi>Traverse;</hi> as namely, where the
Defendant doth but plead in Abatement of

before in most Cases) plead in Bar, because
the Writ and Count is but a Supposal)
where one in his Plea doth Answer the

if the Defendant can plead, <hi>Tout temps prist,</hi>
of any Parcel (or, according to some, do,

the Plaintiff is at a Mischief, touching his
Recovery of the Value of the rest, because
he hath not laid several Values: But if in

               <p>First, It appears 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. That he
which is a Stranger to the Patent and Deed,

And 29 <hi>Ass.</hi> 21. seems, That he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth

to him.</p>
               <p>And 22 <hi>Ass.</hi> 52. the Under-Escheator

And 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 1. he that prays to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by reason of a Remainder; or a

               <p>And upon this Reason see the Books
38 <hi>Ed. 3. 37. 14 H. 4. 30. 11 H.</hi> 4. 83. and
divers other Books, That where the Deed
doth appertain to him, there he shall not

               <p>And so 35 <hi>H. 6. 31, &amp; 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is determined, and the Patent doth
appertain to another; as to another Officer,
and the like.</p>
               <p>And this Learning is approved of in <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
in the Case of <hi>Second Deliverance,</hi>
brought by <hi>Throgmorton</hi> against <hi>Tracy,</hi> where
one pleaded a Lease by a <hi>Corporation,</hi> to

holden, That the first Lease need not be
shewed for Three Reasons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because it did not belong to
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because that Estate was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because the Defendant's Estate
was Executed.</p>
               <p>And further, touching the <hi>Learning</hi> in this
Point, see <hi>Dyer,</hi> first, 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. fol. 29. left
doubtful, whether a Particular Grantee shall
shew the Main Grant.</p>

and therefore learn what the Law in that

               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:93066:74"/>
And some Books take a difference, where
one deriveth himself an Interest to the
Whole in Part of the thing, there he shall
shew; but if but to part of the Estate, then
not.</p>

Grantee of a Reversion and Attornment,
there he need not shew the Deed. Otherwise
to a Rent, or to Land in Remainder by
Grant of a Corporation.</p>
               <p>But the Issue in Tail of a <hi>Rent Executed</hi>
shall have a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the <hi>Discender.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 39. and 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 31. if a
Remainder be once Executed, the Issue in
Tail may have a <hi>Formedon,</hi> as of a Gift in
Possession.</p>
               <p>But in a <hi>Formedon in Remainder,</hi> the Deed
must be shewed.</p>
               <p>And so is 18 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 4. and 34 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Yet 10 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 277. in a <hi>Formedon in
Remainder,</hi> upon a Gift to Uses in Tail,
holden, that he need not shew the Deed
for two Causes: One, because the Estate
may be made without Deed; and the other,
because it appertained to the Feoffor.</p>
               <p>And therefore 1 <hi>&amp; 2 Mar. Dyer</hi> 174. a
Stranger to a Deed shall plead a Grant
without saying, that it was by Deed.</p>

               <p>And so is 21 <hi>H. 6. 23. 10 Ed. 4. 1. 16 Ed.</hi> 4. 1.

               </p>
               <p>For which see, first, 1 &amp; 2 <hi>Mar. Dyer</hi> 116.
where in an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> of Tithes, the
Defendant pleaded a <hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Assignment</hi>
from the Plaintiff himself; and the Plaintiff,
by his <hi>Replication,</hi> maintaining his <hi>Count,</hi>
took a <hi>Traverse, Absque hoc quod vendidit per

which Exception was taken, That he, being

                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:93066:87"/>
But by <hi>Stamford,</hi> he ought to have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               <p>First, See 28 <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> 27. in <hi>Debt</hi> upon
an Obligation, brought by the Abbot of

at <hi>VVestminster 10 die Novembris, Anno duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decimo</hi>

And further, If one of the Defendants in

               <p>And 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. one of the Defendants in a

               </p>
               <p>And in the same Case its said, That in

               </p>
               <p>And 19 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> the Defendant in an

Devised to the Plaintiff for years, and then

               </p>
               <p>And see 29 <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> The Defendant
in Wast did Justify the Cutting of <hi>Trees,</hi> to

               <p>For which see, first, 29 <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> 39. In

               <p>The like 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 17. If in Debt the
Plaintiff Count in like manner of a Lease
for years, and the Defendant pleads, <hi>Non

if he had demurr'd: But more question, as
the Case was there in <hi>Dyer,</hi> in an Appeal
against an Accessary, declaring his Notice
in another County, to which the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
did demur in Law: For by Demurring
all Matters in <hi>Fait,</hi> contained in a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

               <p>As if the Defendant in an <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi>

by saying, <hi>It was made by Tenant for Life,</hi>
although his Plea be otherwise appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently

same.</p>
               <p>And see 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 10. where the Defendant
in <hi>Trespass</hi> did plead a <hi>Concord</hi> to do <hi>Two

found for the Plaintiff, and yet taken to be
a <hi>Ieofail</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ieofail.</note> by the Court: For that the <hi>Bar</hi> is
not good to any Intent; because a <hi>Concord</hi>

in the Law: And where there shall be such
an ill <hi>Plea,</hi> that is not good to any intent, a

                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:93066:89"/>
But it is otherwise where the <hi>Bar</hi> is good

146. after Demurrer, without Consent of

First,<note place="margin">Its Cause.</note> Touching the Cause of <hi>Repleaders;</hi>

where part of the Matter contained in the

and the like.</p>
               <p>But as 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 2. if an ill Plea be made
good afterwards by Admittance (as hath
been said before) that is no Cause of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But otherwise, as it seems by the Books
of 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1. and 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. The <hi>Court</hi> (the
Jury being at the Bar) if there be a <hi>Ieofail</hi>
apparent in the Record,<note place="margin">Ieofail.</note> will discharge the
Jury.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Repleader,</hi> for the most part,
hath been upon <hi>Misjoyning</hi> of Issues, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Demurrer, and not after.</p>
               <p>Yet 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 35. in a <hi>Replevin,</hi> the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

Whether Judgment shall not, in like case,
be given against him that pleadeth the first

               <p>And in <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Hart</hi>'s Case, 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
the Avowry being good, and the Bar and
Rejoynder in a Replevin ill, no Repleader
after a Demurrer: But if the Declaration
be ill, or such an Avowry, which is in nature
of a Declaration; or, by that Reason, a
Replication where no Title is made in the
Declaration; there Judgment shall be given
against the Plaintiff without any Repleader.

Out of both which Statutes of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

Cases, as namely upon the first Statute,
if no Issue be joyned at all; or as a Report

               <p>See, touching that, the Book 28 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi>

               <p>As if Tenant for Life doth bring a <hi>Quod

well enough, and the <hi>Mis-Return</hi> or <hi>Insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient-Return</hi>
of the Sheriff, <hi>quoad</hi> the <hi>Heir</hi>

in <hi>Debt,</hi> upon a Demise for Rent:
To which the Defendant pleaded, That
before the Rent became due, the Plaintiff
did Enter upon him, not saying, <hi>He did
Expel,</hi> or <hi>Hold him out;</hi> so that Issue was
only, <hi>Quod Quer' non Intravit;</hi> and found
for the Defendant, and Judgment given for
him: For tho' the Plea was Insufficient;
yet the Verdict did fully answer the
Issue.</p>
               <p>And see <hi>Hob. 76. Banks</hi> versus <hi>Parker,</hi> In
<hi>Trespass,</hi> for taking a Kettle at <hi>W.</hi> The
Defendant Justified, by reason of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of the Mannor of <hi>T.</hi> And the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
took Issue <hi>de Injuria sua propria absque tali
Causa;</hi> and the <hi>Venire</hi> was awarded <hi>de Visn'
de</hi> W. <hi>&amp; Manerio de</hi> T. upon the Roll, and
a Verdict for the Plaintiff: And tho' the
Plaintiff should not have Traversed the
Cause generally, but the Custom; yet that
was Adjudged to be helped by the Statute
of <hi>Ieofails,</hi> as Matter of Form; because
<hi>Absque tali Causa</hi> contained the Custom, and
more.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Idem ibid. Parker</hi> versus <hi>Parker,</hi> The
Plaintiff brought <hi>Trover</hi> and <hi>Conversion</hi> of
certain Goods against the Defendant, and
the Declaration was Entred upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parlance-Roll,
with Blanks or Spaces for the
Day and Year of the Plaintiff's losing the
Goods, and of the Defendant's finding and
converting them to his own proper use;
but the Issue-Roll, and the other Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

And <hi>per Cur',</hi> the Imparlance-Roll, being
the Original, cannot be made perfect by
the Issue-Roll, which was waranted by it;
but in regard a Verdict was given for the
Plaintiff, upon the Issue of <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> the
Court gave Judgment for him: For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
as Entred on the Imparlance-Roll,
was good enough in Substance; for the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
and <hi>Conversion</hi> being laid in the <hi>Praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Tense,</hi> was before the Action brought,

upon a Prescription, That <hi>I. S.</hi> Prebendary
of the Prebend of <hi>P.</hi> in the Church of <hi>S.</hi>
and all his Predecessors, Prebendaries, &amp;c.
had used Time out of Mind, to keep a

the same Sheep, for the better keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them feeding together in a certain
Pasture, from the Sheep of the Earl of <hi>S.</hi>
in the same Place; and the Issue was found
accordingly: And Moved, That this was
a Void Verdict; for the Prescription was
sensless, and could not stand, That the Sheep
could be kept Time out of Mind, from the
Sheep of the Earl of <hi>S.</hi> being but one man's
Life.</p>
               <p>But yet the Plaintiff had Judgment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Verdict; for the Substance
of the Issue was, <hi>The keeping the Prebendaries
Sheep feeding together,</hi> and the other part
was but a Consequent of it, <hi>That by that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93066:96"/>

declar'd upon an Assault and Battery in
<hi>Surrey:</hi> To which the Defendant pleaded
Justification in <hi>Middlesex;</hi> and the Plaintiff
Replied, That the Defendant did Beat him
in <hi>Southwark,</hi> which is in <hi>Surrey, de Injuria
sua propria, absque tali Causa;</hi> and the Issue
was tryed by a Jury in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and found
for the Plaintiff; and Objected, That the
Trial was not good, because the <hi>Venire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi>
was from one Place, when it should have
been from both; for here are two Issues to
be Tried, and so not within the Statute of
<hi>Ieofails.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>per Cur',</hi> the Trial is well enough,
for tho' two Issues, yet by Pleading they
are made one, and so within the Statute of
<hi>Ieofails,</hi> and helped by it.</p>
               <p>And see <hi>Godbolt</hi> 85. where the Plaintiff
declared in Account of divers Receipts and
Parcels: To all which, except one, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
pleaded to Issue, but for that one
Parcel he pleaded nothing: Whereupon it
was Moved, That the Plea was <hi>Dis-continued</hi>
for not answering to that Parcel, which
<hi>Dis-continuance</hi> was not aided by the Statute
of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the Plaintiff could not have
Judgment according to his Declaration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Parcel to which no Answer
was made, no Judgment could be given.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:93066:97"/>
But <hi>per Cur',</hi> the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. did
Extend to it; for the words of that Statute
are,—<hi>After Verdict found Iudgment shall be
given, any Discontinuace notwithstanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And see <hi>Cro.</hi> Part 2. 534. where the
Plaintiff declar'd in <hi>Trespass,—Quare Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
fregit, Et alia Enormia ei intulit:</hi> The
Defendant pleaded the General Issue, <hi>Non
Culp.</hi> and the Jury found 400 <hi>l.</hi> Damages,
in respect of the Abuse done by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
to the Plaintiff's Wife; and to stay
Judgment, it was moved, that the <hi>Venire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi>
wanted these words,—<hi>Quilibet Iur'
per Pleg',</hi> and therefore is, as if there had
been no Return of the Writ.</p>
               <p>But <hi>per Cur',</hi> this is not a Blank Return,
where no Return is at all, or where the
Name of the Sheriff is omitted; but this is
an Insufficient Return, helped by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Ieofails:</hi> For the Omission of the
Pledges, is but want of Form, and not like
to <hi>Hussey</hi>'s Case, where there was no Pledges
Returned upon the <hi>Original.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Idem</hi> Part 2. 353. where the Plaintiff
did declare in <hi>Trespass</hi> against the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
for Entring his Close and House in <hi>G.</hi>
To which the Defendant pleaded in Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
That the Sheriff had directed a
Warrant to him upon a <hi>Capias Utlagatum,</hi>
to Take one <hi>I. S.</hi> who (as the Common
Voice went) was at the Plaintiff's House;
whereupon he went thither in a <hi>Foot-Path</hi>
through the said <hi>Close,</hi> and asked the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff's
Leave to Enter his House, to search
for the said <hi>I. S.</hi> and the Plaintiff giving
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93066:97"/>
him Leave, he Entred the same, and not
finding <hi>I. S.</hi> there, returned the same way:
The Plaintiff took Issue upon the License,
and had a Verdict; and to stay Judgment,
it was Objected, That there was not any
Replication for the <hi>Close,</hi> or any Issue
joyn'd thereupon; so that all was <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>per Cur',</hi> Judgment shall be given for
that which is found; and that which is <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued,</hi>
is helped by the Statute of <hi>Ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fails.</hi>

                  <hi>Vide Hob.</hi> 176. where in <hi>Trespass</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
did plead, That <hi>Locus in quo</hi> (no
Place being assigned) was two Acres called
<hi>B.</hi> in <hi>L.</hi> which was his Freehold. And the
Plaintiff Replied, That <hi>Locus in quo,</hi> was a
Piece of Land containing Twenty Acres,
<hi>Al' quam, &amp;c.</hi> To which the Defendant
Rejoyn'd, <hi>Quoad aliquam Transgr' in praedictis
viginti Acris—Non Culp'.</hi> Upon which
the Plaintiff joyn'd Issue, and the Verdict
found for him: And to stay Judgment, the
Defendant moved, That this was <hi>no Issue;</hi>
for there was <hi>no Twenty Acres,</hi> nor Place
certain in the Declaration.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>per Cur',</hi> the Plaintiff shall have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for tho' it be not in the Declaration,
yet cannot be said a <hi>Departure</hi> from the
Declaration, for both Parties agree the
<hi>Trespass</hi> to be done at <hi>L.</hi> and so no <hi>Verdict</hi>
out of the Matter, nor <hi>Issue;</hi> but a <hi>Verdict</hi>
help'd by the Statute of <hi>Ieofails.</hi>

And see <hi>Goldesbrough</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 158. where in
<hi>Trespass,</hi> for Entring the Plaintiff's House,
and breaking his Close, the Defendant
pleaded, That the House and Close con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
Twenty Acres, and was his Freehold:
To which the Plaintiff Reply'd,—<hi>Quod
locus in quo est unum Mesuagium,</hi> to which he
Entitles himself; and because by his Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
he only made Title to a Messuage,
and did not maintain his Declaration, which
was the Mesuage and Close, Awarded <hi>Nil
Capiat per Billam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere,</hi> If this amounts to any more, than
a <hi>Dis-continuance</hi> of the Close only, and so
help'd by the Verdict.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cro.</hi> Part 2. 528. In Debt upon four
Bonds, for payment of Mony, three of them
were Tried in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Trinity Term,</hi> and
the fourth at <hi>Lent Assizes</hi> after; and there
was not any Continuance from <hi>Trinity Term</hi>
to <hi>Lent Assizes,</hi> which was much insisted
upon; yet the Court gave Judgment for the
Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Brownlow</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> Part 1. fo. 81. a Bill
was Exhibited against one of the Clerks of
the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for Mony due
upon Bond; and Issue being joyn'd, the
Cause was Tried, and found for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff:
And to stay Judgment it was Objected,
That the Bill not being filed, was not
helped by the Statute of <hi>Ieofails,</hi> nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:93066:98"/>
To which Opinion the Court seemed to
Incline, but gave leave to the Plaintiff, to
File a Bill, that so the Matter might be put
to Arbitration.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Hob.</hi> 181. a Bill was Exhibited in <hi>Debt</hi>
against an Attorney of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi>
upon which a Verdict was had for the
Plaintiff; and to stay Judgment it was Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
That the Original Bill was not Filed
with the <hi>Custos Brevium,</hi> as it ought to
be: But because the Tenor of the Bill was
Entred of Record <hi>in haec verba,</hi> it seem'd to
be in the Nature of the want of an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
after Verdict, and so help'd by the
Statute of <hi>Ieofails.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which Opinion the Court did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline;
but would Advise of it, because it
had been otherwise Adjudged in that Court
before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But then we shall Enquire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matters not Remedied by the Statute.</note> What Matters

               <p>For which see, first, <hi>Goldesbrough</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi>
fo. 49. where the Plaintiff brought his Action
against the Defendant for an <hi>Assault</hi> and
<hi>Battery;</hi> and the Defendant was Condemned
therein by <hi>Nichil dicit,</hi> and a Writ of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
of Damages</hi> issued out; and then the
Plaintiff's Attorney died, and another
Attorney, without Warant, prayed the
Second Judgment, and had Execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:93066:99"/>
                  <hi>Cur',</hi> If the Attorney dies after Judgment,
a New Attorney may pray Execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Warant; but here the Attorney died
before the Second Judgment, and therefore
he that comes after, ought to have a Warant
of Attorney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prothon.</hi> If one of the Parties dies after
Judgment, the Writ shall abate.</p>
               <p>And <hi>per Cur',</hi> This is not within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Ieofails;</hi> for a <hi>Verdict</hi> is that, which
is put in Issue by the Joyning of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Hob.</hi> 112, 113. The Plaintiff declared
in Trespass for an <hi>Assault</hi> and <hi>Battery</hi> made
upon him by the Defendant, who pleaded
<hi>Iustification,</hi> and Conveyed an Estate to
himself by Copy of <hi>Court-Roll</hi> in a certain
Piece of Ground, Parcel of the Mannor
of <hi>D.</hi> whereof <hi>I. S.</hi> was seised in Fee; and
because the Plaintiff came upon it, he laid
his Hands <hi>molliter</hi> upon him.</p>
               <p>And the Plaintiff, in his Replication also,
Convey'd to himself an Estate by Copy of
<hi>Court-Roll</hi> to another Piece of Ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the said Mannor, and lays a Prescription
in the said <hi>I. S.</hi> Lord of the Mannor, to
have a Way over the Defendant's Piece of
Ground: Upon which they were at Issue,
and Verdict for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>And <hi>per Melieur Opinion,</hi> this was no Issue
at all, nor Thing, nor possibly Issuable, and
therefore the Verdict must also be void, and
so not holpen by the Statute of <hi>Ieofails:</hi>
For a Verdict cannot make that good,
which the Court sees cannot be in Law;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93066:99"/>
so that this is in the Office of the Court to
judge.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Cro.</hi> Part 2. 526. In Trespass brought
in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> for Taking and Carrying

               <p>
                  <hi>Per Cur',</hi> the Bill shall abate, for it is the
Essential part of the Declaration, and that
which induceth the Court to set a Fine for

of <hi>Ieofails:</hi> And so Adjudged <hi>Hill. 13 Iac.</hi>
in the Case between <hi>Welsted</hi> and <hi>Taylor,</hi>

                  <hi>Vide Hoh.</hi> 127. In Debt upon the Statute
of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Writ was, <hi>Praecipe</hi> A. <hi>quod

And for further Taking to Farm other
Lands, and holding the same for five

To which the Defendant pleaded,—<hi>Quod

Centum &amp; decem Libras, neque aliquem inde

And to stay Judgment, it was Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,</p>
               <p>(1) That the Verdict expresses not for
which Farm, nor which of the Months the
30 <hi>l.</hi> was due; <hi>sed non allocatur,</hi> for the
Demand and Issue were for 110 <hi>l.</hi> in several,
tho' it would have been more formal to have
distinguished them.</p>
               <p>(2) The Defendant hath not Answered
the Writ and Declaration, for the Plea
ought to have been as the Demand is,—<hi>Quod
ipse non debet dicto Domino Regi, &amp;
praefat</hi>' B. <hi>qui tam, &amp;c.</hi> And this was allowed,
because Penal Laws are Excepted out of the
Statute of <hi>Ieofails.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And see <hi>Hob.</hi> 101. where Judgment was
Reversed, because there were no <hi>Pledges to
Prosecute</hi> Entred for the Plaintiff, and so not
within the Statute of <hi>Ieofails;</hi> because a
Penal Law excepted out of the same.</p>
               <p>But see <hi>Trin. 30 Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Com. B. Goldes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi>
90. where a Writ of <hi>Right</hi> was

That <hi>I. S.</hi> was seised, and devised to his

to <hi>B.</hi> in Fee, who was his Heir, who
died, and they prayed in Aid of <hi>B.</hi> who
joyned in Aid with them, and then they
came and pleaded to the <hi>Grand Assize;</hi> and
the first Day of the Term the <hi>Assize</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and sixteen of them were Sworn,
whereof four were Knights, the rest Esquires

Tenant in that other Action for the Third
part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Per Cur',</hi> This is not aided by the Statute,
for here is no Certainty in the Grant; yet
if the Thing granted had had a certain
Name given to it, as <hi>Black-Acre,</hi> or the like;
then, tho' the Parish had been mistaken, it

               <p>What Defects in Pleading, or otherwise,

               <p>And, first, see <hi>Pasch. 23 Car. 1. Rotulo</hi> 51.
in <hi>B. R. Morefield</hi> and <hi>Webb</hi>'s Case, Reported
by <hi>Aleyn,</hi> fo. <hi>Placito</hi> Where, in a
Writ of <hi>Errour</hi> upon a Judgment in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
Court at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in an Action upon
the Case, upon a Promise, and Verdict for
the Plaintiff; it was moved for <hi>Errour,</hi> That
the <hi>Habeas Corpora Iur</hi>' was not Returned
Served, but only a Panel of the Juror's
Names annexed to it; which Case is Aided
by the Statute of 21 <hi>Iac. 1. cap.</hi> 13. of <hi>Ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fails,</hi>
which helpeth, when there is not any

Habeas Corpora Iur',</hi> and <hi>Distring as Iur';</hi> so
as a Panel of the Names of the Jurors be
Returned and annexed to the said Writs.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it was Objected;</p>
               <p>(1) That the Statute of 21 <hi>Iacobi</hi> extends
only to Writs, and not Precepts, which issue
out of the Palace-Court.</p>
               <p>(2) That the Palace-Court was Erected
by Letters Patents 6 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. which was after
the Statute.</p>
               <p>But Resolved,</p>
               <p>1. That the Palace-Court is within the
Intention of that Statute; for it provides
Amendment in any Action, Suit, Plaint,
Bill, or Demand.</p>

Points.</p>
               <p>2. Resolved, That it Extends to Courts,
Erected after the Statute, and so not within
the Equity thereof.</p>
               <p>And see <hi>Mich. 13 Car.</hi> 2. in <hi>B. R. Tubb</hi> and
<hi>Walwyn</hi>'s Case, <hi>Keble Vol. 1. Pl.</hi> 137. Tit. <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

before the Statute, in the Lady <hi>Morleys</hi> Case,
after Verdict, as here.</p>
               <p>But see <hi>Mich. 21 Car. 2. Lee</hi> versus <hi>Edwards,</hi>
in <hi>Modern Reports</hi> fo. 14.<note place="margin">Averment de Cure.</note> where an Action
upon the Case was brought upon two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the</hi> First <hi>was,</hi> That in Consideration
the Plaintiff would bestow his Labour and Pains
about the Defendant's Daughter, and would
Cure her, the Defendant did Promise to pay so
much, and would also pay for the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In Consideration the Plaintiff had
Cured the Defendants Daughter, the Defendant
did Promise to pay so much.</p>
               <p>And to stay Judgment, it was Objected
by <hi>Raymond,</hi> That the Plaintiff did not
<hi>Aver</hi> in his Declaration, <hi>That he had Cured
the Defendants Daughter,</hi> the Consideration
of the first Promise being Future; and
both Promises found, and entire Damages
given.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Twisden</hi> said, It is well enough; for
now it lies upon the whole Record, whether
he hath Cured her, or not; but if it had
rested upon the <hi>first Promise</hi> only, it had
been ill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:93066:104"/>
And in the <hi>second Promise,</hi> there is an
<hi>Averment</hi> of the Cure; so that now, after
Verdict, it is helped; and the want of an
<hi>Averment</hi> is helped by a <hi>Verdict,</hi> in many
Cases.</p>

be at <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> or 40 days after, is well
enough.</p>

<hi>Sharpley, &amp; al', Coronator' Com' Palatin'</hi> Lanc',
in <hi>Modern Reports</hi> 188, 189. where one brings
Debt against the Sheriff of that County,
and Sues him to the Outlawry, and directs
a <hi>Capias</hi> to the Chancellor, who makes a
Precept to the Coroners of the same Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
being Six, to take his Body, and have
him before the Justices of the Common

to Arrest him, doth it not; but they all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn—<hi>Non

been Taken every day.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Plaintiff brings his Action

               <p>And to stay Judgment, Serjeant <hi>Baldwyn</hi>
Objected, That the Action ought to have
been brought in <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He agreed to the Cases put in <hi>Bulwer</hi>'s
Case, in <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 7. where the Cause of
Action ariseth equally in two Counties;
but here, all that the Coroners do, subsists
and determines in the County Palatine of
<hi>Lancaster;</hi> for they make a Return to the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93066:105"/>
Chancellor of the County Palatine only,
who makes a Return to the Court.</p>
               <p>He insisted upon <hi>Hussey</hi> and <hi>Gibb</hi>'s Case,
in <hi>Dyer</hi> 38. and further said, That this Action
is grounded upon two Wrongs; one, <hi>The
not Arresting him when he was in sight;</hi> and
the other, <hi>For the Returning,</hi> Non est inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<hi>when he might have easily been taken.</hi>
Now, for the Wrong of one of them, they
are all charged, and entire Damages
given.</p>
               <p>He Allow'd, That two Sheriffs make but
one Officer; but said, That every Coroner
is responsible for himself only, and not for his

               <p>Serjeant <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Pemberton, contra;</hi>
That the Action was well brought in <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesex,</hi>

there, <hi>by not having the Body here at the

and Agreed, That the <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the
County Palatine Returns to the Court,
the same Answer that the Coroners Return
to him; so that their <hi>False Return</hi> is the
Cause of the Prejudice that accr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es to the

is the Return of <hi>Non est inventus;</hi> which is
the Act of them all.</p>
               <p>That one of them saw him, and might
have Arrested him, and that the Defendant

And they Conceiv'd, That an Action
would no more lye against one Coroner,
than against one Sheriff in <hi>London,</hi> or any
other Place, where there are two.</p>
               <p>Then, as to the first Objection taken by
<hi>Baldwyn,</hi> they said, That admitting the
Action to be laid in another County than
where it ought; yet after Verdict it is Aided
by the Statute of 16 <hi>&amp; 17 Car.</hi> 2. if the
<hi>Venire</hi> come from any place of the County
where the Action is laid: It is not said, in
any place of the County where the <hi>Cause
of Action ariseth.</hi> Now, this Action is laid
in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and so the Trial by a <hi>Middlesex</hi>
Jury is good, let the Cause of Action arise
where it will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cur',</hi> That Statute doth not help your
Case; for it is to be intended, when the
Action is laid in the <hi>proper County,</hi> where it
ought to be laid, which the words <hi>Proper
County</hi> implies.</p>
               <p>But they inclined to give Judgment for
the Plaintiff, upon the Reasons given by
<hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Pemberton.</hi>
               </p>

in Execution, after Verdict.</p>

                  <hi>Stroud</hi> moved to stay Judgment, on <hi>Het<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
34. That no Action upon the Case will
lye against the Sheriff, or by him: <hi>Sed non
allocatur,</hi> for the Sheriff may be a Beggar;
and therefore though the Plaintiff may
have an Action upon the Case against him
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93066:106"/>
for the Escape, yet he may take the Prisoner
again.</p>
               <p>And as to its being said, <hi>That the Party
being Arrested by the Sheriff of</hi> Devon, <hi>at</hi>
Topsham, <hi>the Defendant rescued him at</hi> Exeter;
the Court agreed, the Escape to be the same
all over <hi>England;</hi> but that it ought to have
been shewed, how the Party came into <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
For this cannot be intended; nor (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Paynter</hi> versus <hi>Paynter, Trin. 6 Car.</hi> 1. in <hi>B. R.</hi>
where, in an Action upon the Case <hi>sur As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpsit,</hi>

Promised, if the Plaintiff, <hi>ad ejus

               <p>Upon <hi>Non Assumpsit,</hi> it being found for
the Plaintiff, it was Moved, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
was not good; for the Promise is
but Conditional, <hi>viz. If the Plaintiff,</hi> ad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanciam
Defendentis, <hi>would Marry the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants

               <p>And see <hi>Cro. 1 Part 163. Mich. 7 Car.</hi> 1.
in <hi>B. R. Taverner</hi> and <hi>Skingles</hi> Case; where
the Plaintiff Declared in Debt upon an
Obligation, with Condition to Perform the
Award of <hi>I. S.</hi> and <hi>I. D.</hi> so that they made
it before the <hi>10th</hi> Day of <hi>October</hi> next, under

               <p>It was Moved, That the Submission was

(2) It was Objected, That the <hi>Award</hi>
was void, because the Money was appointed
to be paid at the House of one <hi>W. S.</hi> a
Stranger; <hi>sed non allocatur;</hi> for the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Payment of the Money at a
Strangers House (especially as here, being a
Common Inn) cannot be unreasonable, nor
an unlawful Act; for, by <hi>Intendment,</hi> the
Plaintiff shall procure such Kindness, that
the Mony may be paid there; so the Award
was Adjudged good <hi>prima facie,</hi> and the
Plaintiff had Judgment.</p>
               <p>And see <hi>Style</hi>'s <hi>Rep. 465. Wood</hi> and <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>'s
Case, <hi>Mich.</hi> 1655. in <hi>B. R.</hi> where in an

spoken of the Plaintiff, <hi>viz.</hi> for calling him
<hi>Traytor;</hi> the Issue was tried at the Bar, and
the Jury found for the Plaintiff, and gave
him 1500 <hi>l.</hi> Damages: And upon Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Damages were Excessive, the
Defendant moved for a <hi>New Trial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was said, That after a Verdict, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glyn</hi> Chief Justice: It is in the Discretion
of the Court to grant a <hi>New Trial;</hi> but that
must be a Judicial, and not an Arbitrary
Discretion; and the Court may take notice
of the Miscarriages of Juries, and grant
New Trials upon them: For a Jury may
sometimes, by Indirect Dealing, be moved to
side with one Party, and not to be Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
between both Parties; but it cannot be
so <hi>Intended</hi> of the Court. And a <hi>New Trial</hi>
was Awarded.</p>

                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:93066:109"/>
And see <hi>Co. Lib. 5. 120. Long</hi>'s Case,
where in an Indictment of <hi>Murder,</hi> Error
was alledged, because the Indictment was
said to be taken before <hi>W. S. Coronatore Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae
Reginae infra Libertatem dictae Dominae
Reginae Villae suae de</hi> Cossam <hi>praedict' per Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
Corporis;</hi> and it was not alledged to
what Places the Liberty did Extend, nor
what part, or any part of the Town of <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam,</hi>
was within the Liberty: So as it doth
not appear, that the Coroner had Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
and it was said, That Indictments
which do concern Life, and which are the
King's Counts, ought to have a plain and
precise Certainty, to which the Party may
answer, and shall not be taken by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But Resolved by the Court, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
was good enough: For if an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
be Certain to a general Intent, the
same is good enough: And in this Case the
Indictment is certain enough to a general
<hi>Intendment,</hi> because <hi>Cossam</hi> is within the
Liberty of <hi>Cossam;</hi> and that the Town it self
shall be <hi>Intended</hi> to be out of the Liberty
of the Town, is a strain'd Construction,
which the Law will never allow of.</p>
               <p>And see <hi>Co. Lib. 4. 65. Fulwood</hi>'s Case, <hi>Mich.

in <hi>London,</hi> acknowledges a Statute to the
<hi>Chamberlain</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> for Orphanage-Mony,
according to the Custom; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
acknowledges another Recognizance
before the Recorder and Mayor, to <hi>B.</hi> who
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93066:109"/>
sued Execution thereupon, and had a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate,</hi>
but it was not Returned; and the
Sheriffs, upon that, delivered the House in
Execution to <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Successor of the Chamberlain sued
Execution upon his Recognizance, by <hi>Elegit,</hi>
to the Serjeant at Mace.</p>
               <p>Amongst other Matters in this Case, it
was Objected;</p>
               <p>That here was no Recognizance in the
nature of a Statute found; for the Jurors
have found—<hi>Quod</hi> A. <hi>veniebat coram Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordatore
Civitatis</hi> London, <hi>&amp;</hi> T. O. <hi>Majore
Stapulae, Et recognovit se debere</hi> B. 200 l.

&amp;c.</hi> nor—<hi>Per scriptum suum Obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. provides,
that it shall be by Bill Obligatory, sealed
with three Seals. But it doth not appear
by the Verdict, that it was according to the
Statute, and although that Verdict, being
the words of Lay-men, shall be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their meaning, and there needs
not so precise Form in them, as in Pleading;
yet the Substance of the Matter ought to
appear either by Express words, or by
words Equivalent; so as there ought to be a
convenient Certainty, the which, if it be
false, the Party for such Falsity may have
an Attaint.</p>
               <p>But it was Resolved, that the Verdict was
good; for inasmuch as they have found a
Recognizance before the Mayor and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93066:110"/>
&amp;c. It shall be in a Verdict of Lay-men,

otherwise they cannot take any Record;
and also the sequel of the Verdict doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
That there was a Recognizance in the

Execution shall be against him of his own

that he had received the other 100 l.

was a Court of Record, and that they had

might not plead that in a Writ of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this difference was taken, where Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution

Debt brought upon it; and held, tho' Debt
might not be brought on such a Judgment,
yet, That upon a voidable Judgment a man
should recover, and might take out Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

amounting to a Discharge; this will
not be a Discharge <hi>Ipso facto,</hi> but by this

But if no <hi>Cepi</hi> be Returned, nor Action
brought against the Sheriff, the Law will
Adjudge the Party to be out of Execution.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Co.</hi> 5 Part 86. If Two be in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for one Debt, on a Bond made by Two,

this will not discharge the other, till the

               <p>And, first, it is taken for <hi>some Fault in a
Suit at Law;</hi> which is sometimes in the
<hi>Proceedings before Iudgment,</hi> and then it makes
void the whole Record, and sometimes in
the Judgment it self, and then it hath the
same Effect: But if it be after Judgment in
the Execution, then the Execution is only
thereby destroy'd; but the Judgment it self,
and all the Proceedings, had before the
obtaining thereof, shall stand good, and a
New Execution is only to be made out.
And where there are two Judgments, as in
some Cases there be, there the last may be
avoided, and the first stand good. And
where the Execution is avoided for such
Mistakes, the Party shall have Restitution
of that which was taken from him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>And in this Sense it is sometimes in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact,</hi> as where one of the Parties to
the Suit is dead when the Judgment is given;
and this, if it come to be Tried, is to be
Tried by Jury: And so of the like Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>

Or, it is where any <hi>Discontinuance</hi> is in the
Suit, or undue Proceeding, appearing by the
Record it self.</p>
               <p>And this sometimes is in <hi>Matter of Law,</hi>
when it shall appear by the Record it self,
That the Judgment in the Action was not
given according to Law.</p>
               <p>And these two last kind of <hi>Errors,</hi> appearing
in the Record it self, are to be tried and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the Judges of the same, or some
other Court.</p>
               <p>These Errors also, are some of them in
the <hi>Lineal Proceedings</hi> of the Suit; as in the

               <p>Or, it may be in the improper, or undue
<hi>Commencement of the Action,</hi> namely, where
one Action is brought for another, or in the
Form of the Writ, or the like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Error</hi> is taken for the <hi>Writ of

if the Defendants Plea be found against

               <p>The Judges likewise are to see, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Party in a Suit be prejudiced by any
Error or Mistake in the Clerks of the Court,
as by writing a Syllable or Letter too little,

in any Record, Process, Warrant of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,

tho' they appear suspicious to the Court, yet
the Judges may amend them.</p>

               <p>And after a Verdict given in any Cause,
on either side, neither Party in the Suit shall
be hurt, by reason of any Variance in any

               <p>And see <hi>Bridgman</hi>'s <hi>Reports 70. Bulstr.</hi>

               <p>So, by <hi>Dyer</hi> 195, 196. an Utlary in the

not in Law,</hi> as if no Utlary in the Case.</p>

in the <hi>Common-Pleas;</hi> and this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
enables that Court to amend only <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisions,</hi>
namely, when the Clerk mistakes
one word for another, or where he writes
Words which are not Latin: As,</p>

               <p>Or, as 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. Mistaking the words of

               <p>But <hi>Mich. 9 Iac.</hi> 1. in <hi>C. B.</hi> in <hi>Ejectione
firmae, Weeks</hi> against <hi>Blackstead,</hi> Lessee of
<hi>Camden;</hi> where, after Verdict to stay Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Defendants Council Objected, that
there were two Errors in the Record, one
in the Declaration, namely, <hi>prout praedictus
Willielmus,</hi> for <hi>praedictus Iohannes;</hi> and
the other was in the Issue, <hi>viz. Et de hoc
ponit se</hi> (meaning the Defendant) <hi>super Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triam,
Et praedictus Willielmus</hi> (the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Per Cur',</hi> these are but Misprisions of the
Clerk, and not Errors, and shall be amended,
being like to the Mistake in 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 23. and
11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 2. where <hi>Defendens</hi> was written for
<hi>Querens,</hi> and <hi>Iohannes</hi> for <hi>Rogerus,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:93066:156"/>
And by <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Justice, <hi>Misprisions</hi>
were amendable the same Term at the
Common Law; because, during the Term,
the Record is said to be <hi>in pectore Iudicis,</hi> and
not esteemed to be on the Roll so absolutely,
but that they may amend the same at their
Discretions.</p>
               <p>But the Justices of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> after
a Writ of <hi>Error,</hi> cannot at all amend the
Roll, where a Judgment was given the same
Term, and is mistaken in the Entry, because
the Roll is not a Record of that Term.</p>
               <p>And by 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. this was so at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, until the Statute of 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3 gave
power to amend <hi>Misprisions</hi> in another
Term.</p>
               <p>But 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. the Case was, that <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi>
was mistaken for <hi>Querens;</hi> but could
not be amended, because an Old Roll; and
the Statute gives Power only to amend New
Rolls of the same Term they are Entred.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Justices of
the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> have Power to amend a
<hi>Plea-Roll,</hi> in <hi>Misprision</hi> only; but not <hi>Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Misprisions</hi> are <hi>Vicia Scriptoris, Faults of the
Clerk;</hi> as the Declaration varying from the
Writ, or the Roll from the Original, or the
Mean or Judicial Process; these by 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6.
shall be amended, if it be only in default of
the Clerk.</p>
               <p>But if in a Plea,<note place="margin">Errors not amend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

should be Averred, this shall not be amended,
because it ought to have been part of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93066:157"/>
Plea, and cannot be said to be any Default
of the Clerk; but a meer Omission, which
makes the Plea imperfect.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>Mich. 5 &amp; 6 Mar. Dyer</hi> 164. a Record
came out of Ancient Demesn <hi>in Banco,</hi> by
Writ of <hi>False Iudgment,</hi> and the Writ was—<hi>Sub
sigillo suo &amp; sigillis quatuor legalium
hominum ejusdem Curiae;</hi> which according to
<hi>Fitzh. Nat. Brev.</hi> fo. 18. <hi>b.</hi> ought to have been—<hi>per
quatuor legales homines, &amp;c.</hi> upon
which the Court doubted, if it might be
amended; but seemed to be of Opinion,
That the Plaintiff might have a New Writ
to the Justices of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
them, to proceed to discuss the Errors in
the Record, which lay before them.</p>
               <p>So, 2 <hi>Mar. Dyer</hi> 105. a Common Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
was suffered to Bar the Issue in Tail;
and the Warrant of Attorney was, That—<hi>Alicia
po. lo. suo,</hi> for <hi>Elizabetha;</hi> also the
Writ of <hi>Error</hi> was—<hi>de loquela quae fuit
in Cur' nostra coram Iustic' nostris per breve
nostrum</hi>—It was a <hi>Quaere,</hi> if it were
amendable; but Resolved in <hi>Blackmores</hi> Case,
<hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 8. fo. 152. <hi>quod vide, &amp; nota.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And see <hi>Brownl. Rep.</hi> 2 Part, fo. 300. where
a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> was brought by <hi>Frances
Fulgham</hi> against Sergeant <hi>Harris,</hi> in this
manner—<hi>Praecipe, &amp;c. quod, &amp;c. Franciscae
Fulgham, Viduae,</hi> contrary to the Form of
the Register, which is—<hi>quae fuit Uxor,</hi> and
not <hi>Widow;</hi> and the subsequent words were
—<hi>rationabilem dotem Tenementorum quae
fuerunt</hi> Francisci Fulgham <hi>quondam viri sui.
Per Cur',</hi> this is Error; for tho' it varies not
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93066:157"/>
in substance; yet because it is contrary to
the Form of the Register, it shall not be
amended.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Cro</hi>'s <hi>Iacobi 21 Merrel</hi>'s Case, in a Writ
of <hi>Error,</hi> of a Judgment in the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi>
in Ejectment, it was assigned for Error, That
the Plaintiff declared, that <hi>I.</hi> S. 25 <hi>Martii,
Anno sexto Iacobi,</hi> had demised to him for
Seven years, by virtue whereof he Entred,
and was thereof possessed, until the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
<hi>postea scilicet Anno sexto,</hi> did oust him.</p>
               <p>After Imparlance, the Plaintiff made a
Second Declaration, wherein he supposed
the Ejectment to be done 26 <hi>Maii Anno
supradicto,</hi> and of this Ejectment the Writ
was brought; it was found against the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
and Judgment for the Plaintiff, and
whether it was Erroneous, because no day

the Question.</p>
               <p>Agreed, That the first Declaration is the
Principal, and if any Matter of Substance
be omitted in it, it cannot be helped or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the second, for that is but a
meer Recital; and therefore if the first be
not good, the Trial is Erroneous.</p>
               <p>But <hi>per Cur</hi>' the first Declaration was good,
for the Demise is laid to be 25 <hi>Martii, sexto
Iacobi,</hi> which is the first Day of the year,
and the <hi>postea scilicet 6 Iacobi,</hi> that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Ejected him is certain enough; for the
Year when the Ejectment was made, and
the Day of the Ejectment, are not material,
being before the Action brought.

Case; where, in a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> to Reverse

wat directed to the Coroners, with

because the Sheriff was one of the

               <p>That the Plaintiff might take out one or
several Writs of <hi>Venire facias,</hi> for doubt of
Challenge.</p>
               <p>And see <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 4. fo. 45. That <hi>Auterfoits</hi>
Indicted of Manslaughter, and thereof Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,

               <p>And see 6 <hi>Ed. 6. Dyer</hi> 88. where an Appeal
is brought by a Woman, of the Death of her
Husband: To which the Defendant pleaded
Not Guilty, and afterwards the Plaintiff
took another Husband; and it was Adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Appeal was determined by her
Intermarriage.</p>
               <p>See 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. where in an Appeal of Death
one Challenged above 35, and had Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of Robbery was brought, did stand Mute
out of Malice; and it was found by the
Jury that he could Speak; whereupon he
was presently Condemned to be Hanged,
and the Appellor had his Goods: But if it
had been by Indictment at the King's Suit,
he should have had Judgment of <hi>Pein fort

Lastly, by <hi>Co. 3 Inst.</hi> 212 If the Defendant
in an Appeal be Vanquished or Slain, the
Judgment is the same, that is, <hi>Suspendere per
Collum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much shall suffice of <hi>Appeals.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the next place,</hi> We shall say something of
Indictments, and the Pleadings thereupon, and
what will Maintain or Quash the same.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Indictment</hi> is an <hi>Accusation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Indictment,</hi> what?</note> drawn and
ingrossed in Form of Law, in the nature of
a Bill (or Declaration) against one for some
Offence, Criminal or Penal, and presented
to the Grand Jury to be Inquired of, who,
in case they Find the same, do write <hi>Billa
vera</hi> upon it; but otherwise do Indorse
the word <hi>Ignoramus</hi> thereupon.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Indictment</hi> is always at the Suit of the
King, so that he who Prefers it, is no way
tied to the Proof of it upon any Penalty,
except there appear Conspiracy. It ought
to be drawn with the greatest Exactness,
Curiosity and Certainty; and the Day, Year
and Place must be sure not to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indictments</hi> are called <hi>Pleas of the Crown,</hi>
and are exhibited for Treason, Felony,
Misprisions of Treason, High Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
against the Common-Weal, and all
other Crimes which touch the Life, or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation

Offences committed against his Crown and

By <hi>Co. 3 Inst.</hi> 106, 107. If any of the
Grand Jury discover what persons are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
of Felony or Treason, they are guilty
of high Misdemeanour, and shall be Fined
and Imprisoned, for thereby the parties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted

where said, That it is not necessary for the
Coroner to set down the Day precisely in
his Inquisition of Felony or Murder; for
if it be alledged to be a day before, or after
the Fact done, the Jury ought to find the
party Guilty, and also find the Day when it
was done, and the Attainder shall relate to
the Day found in the Verdict: And if he
be found Guilty thereupon, he may plead
<hi>Auterfoits acquitte.</hi>

               <p>By <hi>Cro. 2 Part</hi> 479. the Court is to take

               <p>See, first, <hi>Dyer 50. b. Co. 4. Rep. 41. a. 44. b.
47. a. 3 Cro.</hi> 739. One strikes a man in <hi>March,</hi>
who died thereof 15 <hi>April,</hi> and the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concludes, that he killed him in
<hi>March:</hi> 'Tis not good; but that he killed
him upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> is. But the best
way is to Conclude generally, and say, he
killed him, without naming the day.</p>
               <p>And Note, That in an Indictment of
Murder, the word <hi>Murdravit</hi> supplies
<hi>ex Malitia praecogitata;</hi> and so doth
<hi>Furatus fuit, Felonice cepit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where an Indictment was, That <hi>A.</hi>
assaulted <hi>B.</hi> at <hi>C. &amp; ipsum Murdravit,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
saying, <hi>adtunc &amp; ibidem,</hi> it was holden
to be ill, for want of naming the Place;
for the Assault and Murder are several
things, and may be done at several places.</p>
               <p>So, an Inquisition taken by a Coroner in
this Form—<hi>Berk</hi> ss. <hi>Inquisitio capt' pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
die Maii,</hi> without saying where, was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to be ill.</p>
               <p>So, by <hi>Co. 3 Inst.</hi> 135. if one be Indicted
for Poisoning another with <hi>Rats-bane,</hi> and it
be proved, that he was Poisoned with <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides,</hi>
it doth well maintain the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93066:166"/>
because Poison is the substance of
them both; but killing by Weapon, or
otherwise, will not maintain such Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But if the Indictment be for killing with
a Sword, Dagger, or other Weapon, it will
maintain the Indictment, because 'tis killing
under the same Clauses, by Weapons.</p>
               <p>See <hi>Dyer 99, a. 285, a. 370, a.</hi> where

stealing the Goods, <hi>Cujusdam ignoti</hi> is good;
for the party slain, or robbed, may not be

               <p>So, <hi>Stile</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 124. an Indictment for
Assaulting one <hi>Iohn</hi> of the Parish of <hi>A.</hi>
omitting his Surname, holden to be good,

if he should be Indicted again, under the

               </p>
               <p>But by <hi>Cro.</hi> 2 Part 606. an Indictment for
Striking in the Church-yard, was quashed,
because it was—<hi>Ad Generalem Sessionem

Margin, and so may be intended that
County; yet <hi>Indictments</hi> shall not be taken
by <hi>Intendment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet by <hi>Cro.</hi> 3 Part 108, an Indictment was
of a <hi>Riot,</hi> That he <hi>coram</hi> A. <hi>&amp;</hi> B. <hi>Iustic'

               </p>
               <p>So, by <hi>Co.</hi> 3. 194. an Indictment for <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
on the Coroners Inquest, being—<hi>quod

               <p>So <hi>Idem ibid.</hi> 583. an Indictment—<hi>quod

               <p>So, by <hi>Cro. 2 Part</hi> fo. 20. an Indictment
shall be taken strictly, not by Intendment;
and therefore to say, <hi>quod Rapuit Foeminum,</hi>

               <p>See a Notable Case in <hi>Co. 5 Rep.</hi> fo. 120,

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because 'tis <hi>super Mammillam in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior'

Resolved, false Latin shall not quash an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
tho' it will an Original; but an

Also <hi>super Mammillam</hi> is but a Redundancy,

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The length, breadth and depth
of the Wound was not shewed, but because
it was shewed, that he was shot through with

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because the Bill is laid joyntly—<hi>quod

the Statute, and the second Clause gives only

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the word <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And Note, by 22 <hi>Ass.</hi> an Indictment doth

that Exception was taken to it, because not

               </p>
               <p>So, <hi>Mich. 16 Car.</hi> 2. in <hi>B. R. Rex versus

               <p>Lastly, it was Objected, That the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               </p>
               <p>And see <hi>Bendl. Rep.</hi> 152. an Indictment
