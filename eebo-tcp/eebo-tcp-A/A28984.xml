         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> doubt not but it will be sufficient to
recommend to you the ensuing
Treatise, to know that the first
and most general part of it was
designed for thy Benefit, by the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Mr. BOYLE,</hi> some
Months before his Death, in complyance
with the frequent Importunities of many
curious Gentlemen, Physicians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
came to visit him, who were very desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to have Directions how they might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themselves by their Travels to the
best Advantage. Since that Time Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to it have been made, partly out
of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s own, and partly out of
other Men's Writings, brought together,
to be, as it were, under one View, for
the further Satisfaction of the Ingenious;
though in doing of this the Compiler has
<pb facs="tcp:98109:3"/>
left himself a Liberty to insert such things
as he thought might be either for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
or Profit of the Curious Traveller,
for whom the whole of this Treatise is
designed. You have here, in the First
place the General Directions, divided
into such as relate to the whole <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosme,
pag. 1. II.</hi> To Navigation,
<hi>pag. 12. III.</hi> To Mines, <hi>pag. 18.
IV.</hi> Vegetables, <hi>pag.</hi> 48.</p>
            <p>As for particular Directions, we
have begun first with <hi>Turky, pag.</hi> 58.
after that <hi>Egypt, pag. 67. III. Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
pag. IV. Poland, pag. 75.
V. Hungaria</hi> and <hi>Transilvania, p. 80.
VI. Suratte, p. 87. VII. Persia,
101. VIII. Virginia, pag. 102.
IX. Guaiana</hi> and <hi>Brasil, pag. 106.
X.</hi> The <hi>Antisles</hi> and <hi>Caribbe Islands,</hi>

for the most Material Words and Things
in the Treatise.</p>
            <p>If this Treatise meet with a favorable

            <head>General Heads
FOR
The Natural History
OF A
COUNTRY,</head>
            <p>COnsidering the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements,
that have
of late been made of
Natural History (the
only sure Foundation of Natural
Philosophy,) by the Travels of
Gentlemen, Seamen, and others;
And the gread Disadvantage ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ingenious Men are at in their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98109:4"/>
Travels, by reason they know
not before-hand, what things
they are to inform themselves of
in every Country they come to,
or by what Method they may
make Enquiries about things to
be known there, I thought it
would not be unacceptable to
such, to have Directions in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
relating to all, and also
in Particular, relating to Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Countries, in as little Bounds
as possible, presented to their
View.</p>
            <p>As for the General Heads, I
shall offer them to your Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in such Order, as they
were some Years ago given to the
Publick by the worthy and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
be forgotten Mr. <hi>Boyle;</hi> which
are those that respect the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
or concern the Air, the
Water, or the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> Under the first kind may
be reckon'd the Longitude and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98109:4"/>
Latitude of the Place, and that
in respect to the Changes made
in the Air; the Climate, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Length of the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and shortest Days, and the
Parallels come here to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
the Retrogradation of the
Sun upon Dials, within the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
and that naturally; what
fixt Stars, and what not seen
there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> About the Air is to
be considered, its Temperature
as to Heat, Dryness and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
and the Measures of them,
its Weight, Clearness, Refractive
Power, its Subtilty or Grosness,
its abounding with or wanting
an Esurine Salt; its Variation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the several Seasons of
the Year, and the Times of the
Day: How long the several kinds
of Weather continue, what sort
of Meteors it breeds most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly;
in what Order they are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98109:5"/>
generated, and how long they
usually last: Especially what
Winds 'tis lyable to; whether
any of them be stated, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> What Diseases are
Epidemical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are suppos'd to
flow from the Air: What other
Diseases the Country is subject
to, wherein that had a share,
<hi>e. g.</hi> the Plague and contagious
Sicknesses. What is the usual
Salubrity or Insalubrity of the
Air. And with what Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
it agrees better or worse
than others. As also the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
Gravity of the Air, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with the other foregoing
Qualities, for this Effect it will
be convenient the Traveller be
provided with a Travelling Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,
having the Divisions usual
in the other Baroscopes, markt
upon a sliding Ruler, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once exactly mark'd for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
may serve for other Places;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98109:5"/>
and for observing the Difference
between the Air here and in other
Places, and in most differing
Climates, as in the Torrid and
Frigid Zone, it has another
Ruler coming out perpendicular
from the lower End of the Slid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ruler, that it may mark the
heighth of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> in the
lower Leg of the <hi>Syphon;</hi> so the
Divisions in the upper end will
tell you the Specifick Gravity of
the Air at that Time. I am the
shorter in describing this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have left with Mr. <hi>Papin,</hi>
lodging at Mr. <hi>Carpenters</hi> in <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daystreet,</hi>
over against the <hi>Bell
Inn,</hi> the whole Method of this
Contrivance: Whether it will
not be more serviceable both at
home and abroad than that with
stagnant <hi>Mercury,</hi> I leave to the
Judgment of the Ingenious,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> About the Water are
to be considered, 1. The Sea,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98109:6"/>
its Depth, specifick Gravity, Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Saltness in different
Zones, the Plants, Insects and
Fishes to be found in it, Tides,
with respect to the adjacent
Lands, Currents, Whirl-pools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
2. Rivers, their Bigness, their
Course, their Inundations, their
Saltish Taste, as they report ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in <hi>Jordan,</hi> Subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Passages, fruitfulness of their
Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Lakes, as
that of <hi>Schernitzer</hi> in <hi>Carniola,</hi>
Ponds, Springs, and especially
Mineral Waters, what sorts of
Earth they run through, their
Kinds, Qualities and Vertues,
and how examin'd; the Sorts of
Fishes, their Bigness and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
compared with the Ground
at the Bottom, their Plenty, their
Seasons, their ways of Breeding,
their Haunts, and the ways of
Taking of them, especially those
that are not purely Mechanical.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98109:6"/>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> In the Earth may be
observed,</p>
            <p>I. It self.</p>
            <p>II. Its Inhabitants, and its
Productions, and those internal
or external.</p>
            <p>I. As to it self: What are its
Dimensions, Situation, East, West,
South or North, its Figure, its
Plains, Hills or Valleys, their
Extent, the highth of the Hills,
either in respect of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Valleys, or the Level of the
Sea; as also whether the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
lye scatter'd or in Ridges,
and whether those run North or
South, East or West, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What
Promontories, Fiery or Smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Hills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Country has or
hath not; whether subject to
Earthquakes or not. Whether
the Country is coherent, or much
broken into Islands. What De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98109:7"/>
the Magnet has in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Places at the same Time, and
how much it varies in different
Times at the same Place: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before the <hi>Turnados</hi> or <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes,</hi>
the Magnetical Needle
loses its Direction towards the
North, and turns to all the Points
of the Compass; and if this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
is influenced by Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Fire, destroying it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
or by Water overflowing the
Surface of it, or by its vicinity
to Iron Mines. What kinds of
Soyls are there, whether of Clay,
Sand, Gravel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What are its
Products as to Minerals, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables
or Animals: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
how all these are or may be
further improved for the Benefit
of Man; what are the Qualities
of that Soyl, peculiar to it, <hi>e. g.</hi>
that of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s, contrariety to
poysonous Beast.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98109:7"/>
II. The Inhabitants themselves
are to be consider'd, both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Strangers, that have
been long settled there; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
their Stature, Shape, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Strength, Ingenuity, Dyet,
Inclination, that seem not due to
Education. As to their Women,
their Fruitfulness or Barrenness,
their easie or hard Labour, with
their Exercises and Dyet; the
Diseases both Men and Women
are subject to, peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
compared with their Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that do influence
them.</p>
            <p>The Products External are
Plants, Trees, Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with
the Peculiarities observable in
them (<hi>e. g.</hi> that of the Poyson-wood,
call'd <hi>Machenil</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi>
with its Cures) and
what Soyls they thrive best in.
What Animals, Terrestrial or
Volatile, or Insects of all sorts,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98109:8"/>
they produce, and to what Use
applyed by the Inhabitants, as
to Meat, Physick, Surgery, or
Dying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Internal Production of
the Earth are to be understood
here, things procreated in the
Bowels of the Earth, either for
the Benefit or Hurt of Man; where
Notice is to be taken, what way
the one may be best found out,
and the other most easily avoided
or cured. Under these are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
Metals, Minerals,
Stones Precious or Common, and
how these Beds lye in reference
to North or South, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What
Clays and Earths it affords, <hi>e. g.</hi>
Tobacco-pipe-Clay, Marles, Boles,
with their Physical or other Uses,

Nice pair of Scales, and exact
Weights, for examining the
Weights of the several Waters,
that occur, which I think may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98109:11"/>
be most exactly done after the
Method proposed by the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> in his <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina
Hydrostatica, viz.</hi> weighing
a Vial close stopt with a Glass-Stopper
first in the Air, then in
Liquor: If the Vial be about two
Ounces in the Air it will do the
better; for the whole Method, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis too long to insert into
the Tract, I refer you to the Book
itself. This I propose as the most
Subtile and Accurate. If you like
a plainer way, you may use the
Method practised by the Noble
Author elswhere, <hi>viz.</hi> To fill a
Glass Vial of four Ounces or more,
with a small Neck, full of the
Water to be try'd, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Weight of it, which
you may compare with another.</p>
            <p>15. 'Twill be convenient both
for the Navigator and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
to be provided with an

first publish'd by the Ingenious
Mr. <hi>Hooke,</hi> and transferr'd hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the Benefit of the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Traveller; for by this he may
know whether the Water at the
Bottom be Heavier; and Salter
than at the Top; or whether
there be fresh Water at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
occasion'd by Springs of
Fresh Water there, as some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
there are, having observ'd
in some Places Springs of fresh
Water, a great way within the
Sea-marks: The Contrivance is
this, a Wooden Bucket is fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to an Iron rod, with a Weight
to sink it; this Bucket is shut at
Top and Bottom with two Valves
or Clacks, so contriv'd, that when
in descends, it may open and let
the Water pass through; but
when 'tis pull'd up again from
the Bottom, it may shut so close
as to keep in all the Water it has
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98109:12"/>
at that Time, by the under Valve,
and the ambient Water over it,
from getting in by the upper
Valve. If any be desirous to have
one of these, they may have them
at Mr. <hi>Papins</hi> in <hi>Frydaystreet,</hi> at
Mr. <hi>Carpenter</hi>'s, over against the
<hi>Bell-Inn.</hi>

            <p>Having gone through the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Directions both for Sea and
Land, we come to more Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ones, and shall begin first with
those that concern Mines; the
Knowledge of which, tho it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
very early, and has been
continu'd to our Times, yet is
still found improveable by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Industry, as Experience has
taught us, and therefore worthy
to be consider'd in the next Place,
especially seeing the Arts and
Inventions most useful for Man's
Life, depend more upon this than
any other; and that without it

the World should want little of
Returning to its former Barbarity.

with which that Country is

made in several Places
about <hi>Constantinople</hi> by <hi>Solyman</hi>

            <p>24. To enquire whether the
Relations of a whole City's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turned into Stone be true,
and if not what gave the first
Rise to it, and whether it lye
so near the Sea that these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
so metamophosed may be
easily brought into <hi>Europe.</hi> Here
I beg the Reader's Leave to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
a little, and give him the
Information I had of it from
one who was upon the Place,
did see this strange Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis,
and had an account of it
from one who lived near to it,
which I the rather adventure to
do, because I have had good
Proofs of his Veracity in other
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98109:35"/>
Relations, and also because I had
the same confirm'd to me in great
measure, by a Gentleman, who
had been long a Chaplain to the
Factory at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who assured
me, That there's no Doubt of
it. 'Tis this: Being obliged
to go with the Army sent by
the Bassa of <hi>Tripoly</hi> to reduce
a City that had rebelled against
him, in the way, he and some
others, after Leave got from
their Commander, did turn aside
to see this so strange Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis;
at his first coming into
the Place he saw a Sheep ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon her Belly, as if it
were chewing the Cud, whose
Head he broke off from her
Neck, with a Stone, and in
the Gullet he could perceive
some remainder of the chew'd
Grass all petrified, which he
took up, and sold afterwards
to one of his Fellow-Slaves,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98109:36"/>
who, having sent it to the Pope,
had his Ransome returned for it:
A little further they saw a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
sitting on her Knees, with
her Hands in a Trough, as if
she were kneading Dough, her
Mantle, that was clasp'd about
her Neck being cast backward,
and all turned to Stone, so
hard that they could lift her
and the Trough, in which the
Hands were, without parting
them or breaking any thing.
When he asked a Priest, that
was sent from the City to treat
with the Commander, What
way this did happen, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
him, That all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of that Place were So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,
and that God rained
down Fire and Brimstone from
Heaven upon them; upon her
which they were all turned to
Stones: And for Proof of this,
he desired him to dig in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98109:36"/>
Sand, with his Hand, a Foot
deep, which he found like blue
Ashes; which, said the Priests,
were the remainders of that
Fire.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Subject,
the next Enquiries shall be for
<hi>Egypt.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>1. Whether it rain at any
Time, and if so at what Time
of the Year; and what Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that Rain hath upon the Air,
as to the making it Wholesome
or Pestilential, or otherwise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome.</p>
            <p>2. To consider the Nitre that
is made there, to try what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
there is between the Nitre
we have and theirs, whether it
discover an Alcaly Nature by its
colluctation with Acids, as some
report, and whether after dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98109:37"/>
in Water, Filtration and
Evaporation, it give Chrystals
like to Nitre.</p>
            <p>3. Whether the Earth of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> adjoyning to the River
<hi>Nilus,</hi> preserved and weigh'd,
daily keeps the same Weight,
till the seventeenth of <hi>June,</hi> and
then grows daily heavier, with
the Increase of the River.</p>
            <p>4. Whether if the Plague be
never so great before, yet on the
first Day of the <hi>Nile</hi>'s Increase,
it not only not increaseth, but
absolutely ceaseth, not one
dying of it after; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be justly attributed to
the swelling of the <hi>Nile,</hi> or
the cool Winds that happen
about that Time, and come
from the dissolving of the Snows
on the <hi>Riphaean</hi> Hills, behind
<hi>Greece,</hi> which being impregnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Nitrous Particles of
of the Snow, doth both fan the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98109:37"/>
Air of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and communicate
to it an Antipestilential Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
which I the rather am
inclin'd to believe, because Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
