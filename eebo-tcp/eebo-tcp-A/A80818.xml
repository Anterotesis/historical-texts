            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A VVord in due ſeaſon: OR, SOME HARVEST MEDITATIONS WITH A Warning from the Lord God to all People in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> to leave off their wicked and fooliſh Cuſtoms in their Harveſt, before the anger of the Lord be kindled againſt them, and there be no Remedy.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehold the Eye of the Lord hath paſſed through the Earth, and hath beholden the abominations of the people, and their cuſtoms, which are altogether vain, and his hand is lifted up againſt them, to cut them off from the Earth, and wo to them that withſtand him, for them will the Lord God viſit in his diſpleaſure, and rebuke in his anger; therefore be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all ye Inhabitants of the Earth, and while ye have time, learn Wiſdom, and depart from vanity before ye be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed through your gain-ſaying.</p>
            <p>Upon the 29. of the 4th. Month, the Word of the Lord came unto me ſaying, <hi>Behold, the many abominations of this people in the time of their Harveſt, and although my light hath ſhined to have let them ſee them, yet they have rejected the counſel thereof; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my faithful witneſs in them hath reproved, yet they have not regarded it; and although I have ſmitten them with Mildew and with blaſting, yet they have not laid it to heart, but have perſiſted in the fooliſh cuſtoms of their forefathers, and have hated to be reformed, neither have they feared me, ſaith the Lord, but daily do they grieve my holy spirit with their iniquities:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore once more let them be warned of the vanities &amp; abominations of their Harveſt in particular, that they may return, and learn to fear before me, leſt I ſmite their fruitful fields with barrenneſs, and their goodly crops with withering, and their children with cleanneſs of teeth in all their borders, &amp;c.</hi> Am. 4. 6, 9, 10</p>
            <p>And now this is that which the Lord God hath put into my heart to warn all ye Husbandmen and Farmers, that in the time of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt when ye are taking in the fruit and the encreaſe of your Fields, and the iſſue of your labour, that ye mind the fear of God, that it may keep you in the remembrance of him from whence every good gift cometh, that ſo it may be good to you, and ye may receive it with humility and thankfulneſs; and none to murmure becauſe it is no more, nor none to glory becauſe it is ſo much, but all to be contented, and to mind that which lets you ſee and feel the bleſſing, that ye might be kept in the worthy walking, and know it to be multiplyed unto you, and let your joy be in that the light hath ſhined upon you, and let that be the joy of your Harveſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 3.</p>
            <p>And remember that the portion of the poor be not gathered, but conſider the Lord hath regarded their need; neither be churliſh nor bitter to them, but let them have their portion without diminiſhing, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 9. <hi>And when thou reapeſt the harveſt of thy land, thou ſhalt not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reap the corners of thy field,</hi> [mark] <hi>neither ſhalt thou gather the gleannings of thy Harveſt, it is for the poor, and for the ſtranger.</hi> Lay this to heart ye rich men, leſt ye eat of the portion of the poor, and the hand of the Lord be turned againſt ye through their cry, <hi>Job.</hi> 34. 28. For the Lord will maintain the right of the poor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140. 12.</p>
            <p>And take heed of inordinate feaſting, ſpending the Creation upon the luſt, making proviſion for the fleſh, which is contrary to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Example; but let your moderation appear in this alſo; <hi>For the reward of the glutton ſhall be poverty, Prov.</hi> 23. 21. And mind the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, that that may order and guide you into that which is convenient, and may ſtop the exceſs, that whatſoever is done, may be done to the praiſe and glory of God, as becometh Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And let none be over-covetous of drinking, neither in the time of your labour, nor at any other time; for that hurts the creature, and deſtroys the health, and hath overcome the life of many, when they have been ſtrengthened by the Lord to labour, then they have hurt themſelves with their inordinate drinking, and ſo abuſing the gift of God, it hath been taken from them; but let all minde God's fear, that ye may feel through that which is outward, to that which is within, namely, the thirſt of the ſoul, which that which is outward will not ſatisfie; that ſo ye may be brought to wait to know that manifeſted within, which is Drink indeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 55. which cleanſeth from the pollutions that is in the world through luſt, and ſatisfies the ſoul.</p>
            <p>And let that abominable cuſtom of ſhouting in the fields, or elſewhere, be left off, which is derived from generation to generation, from the Heathen, and from the Papiſts; and while this be left, leave off calling your ſelves Chriſtians, or Proteſtants; for even this thing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your crying of that which you call your Leargees, is a ſhame to the very Name of Chriſtians to be found amongſt them, and renders you but fooliſh ignorant people, who ſports your ſelves with your own breath, like the Heathen who knows not the Lord that gave it; ſuch as was the <hi>Moabites,</hi> whom the Lord's anger was kindled againſt, until he threatened to cut off the Vintage of <hi>Moab,</hi> and their ſhouting ſhould no more be heard in their Vineyards, becauſe the treaders ſhould tread out no Wine in their Preſſes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 16. 9, 10. And ſo will the Lord do by you except ye repent and turn from the folly of your ways; for he is not changed, neither is there reſpect of perſons with him; therefore let this be no more named amongſt you who call your ſelves Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And let all your corrupt and vain Harveſt-Songs be left off, your Night-work, which lifts up the evil ſpirit in man, but oppreſſeth the juſt, and keepeth from the true joy in the pure ſpirit, where the Song of Praiſes is ſung unto God for all his benefits, with acceptance; for in this alſo is there great abomination committed in the Land, and the Lord's Spirit hath been grieved therewith; ſometime ye are ſpending your precious time (which ſhould be for the reſting of the creature in) ſinging of filthy and abominable Songs, tending to the ſubverting and removing of modeſty and chaſtity from off the face of the Earth; and it may be the ſame night, and in the ſame mind will ye take ſome of the words of the holy Scripture, it may be of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, or ſome other of the Pſalms, and then in your wicked manner of doubling, and vain repetitions, will ſing them, which is far from ſinging to the praiſe and glory of God, or with Grace in your hearts, but to the great abuſe of the Scripture, and to the diſhonor of the Name of the Lord; and be aſſured you ſhall not be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den guiltleſs that take God's Name in vain, although in the time of your Harveſt; but your Songs ſhall be turned as the howling of <hi>Moab</hi> in the day when the Lord viſited him.</p>
            <p>But all mind the light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt within, that ye may know it lifted up upon you, which makes glad the hearts of the righteous, yea more glad then the joy of the ungodly when their Corn and Wine is encreaſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>And let that wicked and abominable Cuſtom of making Lords and Ladyes amongſt you in the Harveſt-Field, be left off for ever, which is a ſhame to your profeſſion, and renders you to be like the Gentiles, who had Lords many amongſt them, but knew not the Chriſtians one Lord; this ought not to be any more mentioned, but ought to be denyed as a fooliſh and unchriſtian cuſtom, tending to nothing but to exalt the pride of mans heart, and begetting into emulation and ſtrife; this alſo is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And let none of you who are ſtrong, boaſt and glory in your ſtrength over him that is weaker, nor ſeek to hurt him by thy ſtrength, but mind the Lord your Maker, and remember your ability to be of him, and not your own, and ſo to be uſed in his fear, without vain glory.</p>
            <p>And all you that have much of the Earth in your hands, and many hired ſervants, ſee that ye ſtand in the Power and Wiſdom of God, ruling over that part in them all, that would lead into rudeneſs and prophaneneſs, being good examples in your places, and giving them that which is due for their encouragement, not oppreſſing them in Work nor in Wages; but all mind the truth of God, the equal wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between you, which ſecretly calls for righteouſneſs towards all men, and Equity as ye would have from all men, that ſo the Lord may make your Land as a fruitful Field, and may multiply a bleſſing upon you, both within and without.</p>
            <p>Thus have I cleared my conſcience in the ſight of God, and have ſingly given my Teſtimony againſt theſe abominations which have been acted in this Nation in Harveſt time, in love to your ſouls, and in obedience to the Lord; and whether ye will hear or forbear, ye ſhall know that ye were warned by a Friend to your ſouls, and a Lover of the Truth, which was before the cuſtoms of the Heathens were (and therefore plead not Antiquity in theſe things) and one that deſires this Nation might walk in the light of the Lord, and be ſaved from the reproach of the Heathen; whoſe outward Name is</p>
