            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>IF I must dye, I'll catch at every thing</l>
                     <l>That may but mind me of my latest breath.</l>
                     <l>Deaths-heads, graves, knells, blacks, tombs, all these shall bring</l>
                     <l>Into my soul such usefull thoughts of death,</l>
                     <l>That this sable King of fears,</l>
                     <l>Though in chiefest of my health</l>
                     <l>He behind me come by stealth,</l>
                     <l>Shall not catch me unawares.</l>

                     <l>Shall reade me such a lecture of mine end,</l>
                     <l>That I'll suppose his case will be mine own.</l>
                     <l>As this poore man here doth lie</l>

                     <l>Which I see this man lye under,</l>
                     <l>What sinne earns and death doth pay,</l>
                     <l>I shall feel another day.</l>

                     <l>I once saw Phoebus in his mid-day sline</l>
                     <l>Triumphing like the Sovereigne of the skies,</l>
                     <l>Untill two brighter rayes, both more divine,</l>
                     <l>Outblazed his: and they were this Nymphs eyes.</l>
                     <l>Forthwith Sol curtain'd his light,</l>
                     <l>Looking very red for shame</l>
                     <l>To be vanquish'd by this Dame,</l>
                     <l>And did slink out of her sight.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>I once saw silver Cynthia, nights fair Queen,</l>
                     <l>In her full orb dimming each lesser flame,</l>
                     <l>Till this Nymphs beauty-vying front was seen</l>
                     <l>Outshining hers: then she look'd wan for shame.</l>
                     <l>The man in her, knew he how</l>
                     <l>But to quit that giddy place,</l>
                     <l>She had so divine a face,</l>
                     <l>Would have dwelt upon her brow.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Once was this woman pleas'd to walk the fields</l>
                     <l>Then proudly fragrant with Dame Flora's store:</l>
                     <l>The damask rose unto her beauty yields,</l>
                     <l>And was contented to be fair no more.</l>
                     <l>Sure I cannot say how truly,</l>
                     <l>Yet 'mongst many 't was a fame,</l>
                     <l>That the rose did blush for shame,</l>
                     <l>And the violet look'd most bluly.</l>

                     <l>Once did this woman to the temple go,</l>

                     <l>Cut to the life, that one can hardly know</l>
                     <l>But that it lives indeed: When she came nigh,</l>
                     <l>He who then the temple kept</l>
                     <l>After would be often telling</l>
                     <l>She was so super-excelling</l>
                     <l>That for mad the marble wept.</l>

                     <l>Swans sing their Epitaphs in curious layes,</l>
                     <l>Once with a singing Swan a part she bears:</l>
                     <l>As soon's those corall doores dismiss'd her voice,</l>
                     <l>The poore Swan held his peace and di'd:</l>
                     <l>And the spheres (as men do say)</l>
                     <l>Dumbly move unto this day.</l>
                     <l>This was by a rivers side.</l>

                     <l>What think you now of such a glorious woman?</l>
                     <l>This Phoenix sure was she, if any might,</l>
                     <l>That might be proud: And yet the tongue of no man</l>
                     <l>Can well expresse, nor any pen can write</l>
                     <l>What grim death hath done unto her;</l>
                     <l>Now she's of another feature,</l>

                     <l>Some course of providence, to make provision</l>
                     <l>At the place of's banishment:</l>
                     <l>Full-stuff'd bags of money, and</l>
                     <l>What things else might purchase land,</l>
                     <l>He into that Kingdome sent.</l>

                     <l>King sick they were; their purpose soon appeare:</l>
                     <l>A new King's chosen and the old's uncrow'nd.</l>
                     <l>And for exile, this foul beast,</l>

                        <l>Into a Dove, or Lamb, and when he would,</l>
                        <l>Into a Tiger, Lion, Bear, or Ape,</l>
                        <l>Or a Mountain, Rock, or Spring,</l>
                        <l>Or Earth, Water, Fire, Air,</l>

                        <l>Had all behaviours at his fingers ends.</l>
                        <l>He could grene when's friend was sickly,</l>
                        <l>And could weep when he was sad:</l>
                        <l>Any humour, good or bad,</l>
