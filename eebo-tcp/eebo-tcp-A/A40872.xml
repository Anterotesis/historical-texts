            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ha's some proper excellency, and remarkable motion. But amongst the well cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
objects of your Judicious Liberality, we find the chief to be the two great
Pillars of your Kingdome, your <hi>Cato,</hi> and your <hi>Fabius,</hi> your <hi>Cato</hi> is that grave
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94772:4"/>
Senator and Skilful Pilot, who in the Roughest Seas, though your Majesty ever
held the stern your self, yet help'd to guide your course so right, that you never struck
upon the shallow Promises of forein Princes, but kept still even in the safer chanel
of your Subjects Affections, and who in this season of Tranquillity, advises your
Majesty not to be becalm'd, but still to make some orderly progress in your motion
to glory. This is our <hi>Atlas,</hi> upon whose shoulders lies the burden of these three
Kingdoms, in whose head are conserv'd the Axioms of eternal truth for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this Nation, and in whose breast lodges the universal equity, or the
mitigated Justice of our Severer Laws. Your <hi>Fabius</hi> is he, who by his prudent
and prosperous Cunctation restor'd the antient Glory of the English World, who
finding himself not able to grapple with the monstrous Whale of the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

baited, tickled, and play'd with her so long, till at length the Tides forsook
her, and left her to his mercy on the dry Land. Tis he, who when the wearied
Arms of long contending fortune could no longer support your unsuccessful
Standards, recovered the Ark out of the hands of the Philistines, which those
bold Rebels who would have touch'd or pry'd into, like <hi>Uzziah</hi> perish'd, and
with a most religious caution resign'd up faithfully to your Majesty your most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and incommunicable Throne, absolving at once, and glorifying the English
Nation. We owe to him, more than our selves, that is, your Majesty, and this
bankrupt Nation must ever be indebted to him, since it has nothing to give him
of equal value with that in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stimable Present. Some Princes have made use of
their Ministers to be Skreens of envy from their People, yours are the Receivers,
and tasters of their affection, since there can be nothing Commanded by your
Majesty, which your Subjects wishes do not prevent, nothing wish'd by your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which your Majesties commands do not Confirm. Nor does the favour
they obtain from the People, by thus humouring them with your pleasing injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
impair at all, or lessen the Peoples indearments to your Majesty, since their
love is as over-flowing, and inexhaustible, as the Sources of it, your Royal Virtues,
and 'tis almost a Paradox to think we are no more in love with Virtue, since we
are so much with You. When your Majesty had thus sacrifiz'd to your own Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
in the remuneration of your Friends, to your generosity in the absolution
of your Enemies, and to your wisdome in the re-establishment of your disorder'd
Realms, when you were I say by these heroique Steps arriv'd at the supreme point
of single felicity, what remain'd there to the accumulated measures of your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
enjoyments, but the possession of a Person of such rare endowments, that
in the adorning of her, Fortune and Beauty have been aemulous competitors, in
the presenting of her to your Royal Bed, her Birth and Virtue passionate Rivals,
and there is nothing left to terminate so intricate a dispute, but the Concession of
her universal excellencies? for as each mans soul is to his human nature, so she is
yours in all, and yours in every one. She is the only Person in the World, whose
merit is proportion'd to the happiness of being enjoy'd by you, and whose trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
accomplishments exceed the measure of any other Princes pretensions.
'Tis she alone that can return you one perfection for another, exchange Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and mingle Virtues. For Marriage, which is Natures truest multiplying-glass,

those ravishing sweets that are the sole Antidotes to Adverse Fortune, and the
chief ingredients of the most flattering Prosperity, without which the insipid
World ha's nothing that rellishes to the elevated taste of man, to which all other
luke-warm pleasures are but as Dreams, or the slumbring remembrances of our
Mortality, little constrained motions to keep our selves awake from the sleep of
Eternity, exerciz'd with as much indifferency as they are accomplisn'd with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction:
whilst Beauty, the most uniting cement both of Souls and Bodies,
associating her self with Friendship to give duration to her effects, entertains, and
foments the Lethargy of this benummed Life, with a most Medicinal fountain of
ardent desires, boyling up perpetually into the chast and caelestial delights of never-surfeting
Fruitions. It is the fate of Virtues, as of Friends, sometimes to be at
odds with one another, and though their cause and end of Action be the same,
yet in their mediate operations, they do not seldome seem incompatible: but
since that vulgar Impossibilities are but <hi>Heroes</hi> easie Recreations, we may observe,
that as your Majesty has the blessed Art of reconciling Factions, and self-opposing
Vice in others, you have another no less glorious to joyn all differing and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
Virtues in your self: for there appears to be in the heavenly frame of
your mind, a Constellation of endowments rarely sociable; Acuteness of Wit,
and Solidity of Judgment; Gravity of Aspect, and Pleasantn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss of Humour;
an unrestrained Power, and a most tender Civility; an early Apprehension, and
a mature Prudence. You have a fervent kindness for your Friends, and no inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hatred to your Enemies: You are a passionate Lover of right, and as calm a
Forgiver of wrong. You enjoy the nakedness of truth by Contemplation, and
cloath it in the most ingenious Ornaments of Discourse. You have a Soul rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnish'd with heroique Passions, and an incredible temper in their Government,
and Order. You have many Pleasures that are your Favourites, but none that
mislead your Virtue, that is their Soveraign. In fine, your Judgment never errs,
but when it is Seduc'd by the powerfull imposture of your self-injurious Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
and your Goodness so disciplines and tutours your Greatness, that we
never taste of the sharper streams of Justice, till they have run through the Royal
Correctives of Tenderness, and Humanity. Yet after all these Excellencies, and
truly Royal Prerogatives, give me leave to tell you, you have left a general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
in the hearts of all your Subjects, I mean a disquieting and tormenting
desire to attempt a thing they can never accomplish, A perfect Copy of your
Virtues. For men must propose you as a pattern for their Wishes, not their
Hopes, and 'tis a loyal Virtue to Imitate those perfections, which 'tis a rebellious
presumption to think to Parallel. What need then those superfluous Oaths of
Allegiance, and Supremacy? wherefore should they so sollicitously bind our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged
affections? Those are but feeble props to tottering Monarchs, but to
your Majesty who is so unremoveably fix't in the very Centre of our hearts, the
Law-giver, and the Law it self, the Precept, and the Pattern of these three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
what needs there any greater security than those praevious Oaths, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Resolutions, that every one has made within himself, to make your Service
the most ambitious aim of all his actions? Since the same rule that makes you
our Superiour, Commands us at once to Obey your Person, and Imitate your
Virtues, and the Divinity it self ha's included in one duty, both his own Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            <l>Thus when a blasted April-Bud ha's lost</l>
            <l>It's proper season by untimely frost,</l>
            <l>If we again in Winter see it sprout,</l>
            <l>Our Startled reason puts our sense in doubt:</l>
            <l>Your Crowns once wither'd flow'rs though now you bear,</l>
            <l>Our Joyes can scarce Divest Habitual fear,</l>
            <l>And we're like those who coming out of Night</l>
            <l>At first are blinded with too great a light.</l>
            <l>Fortune sometimes makes use of good deceits,</l>
            <l>Despair and Hope were ever equal cheats.</l>
            <l>As when th' incountring Rain and Hail and Snow</l>
            <l>With cloudy brows do threaten us below,</l>
            <l>Whilst they contest and justle in the Skie,</l>
            <l>And still their self-opposings keep us dry,</l>
            <l>A North-wind comes and blows them all away,</l>
            <l>And re-invests the Monarch of the day:</l>
            <l>So when your meteor Rebels rais'd by you</l>
            <l>Had you obscur'd, and in their Gloomy Crew</l>
            <l>Tempestuous mischiefs had design'd to powre</l>
            <l>Upon our heads, their quarrels stop't the shower,</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Boreas</hi> made our Air thus pure and thin,</l>
            <l>The same wind bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w you out, and blew you in.</l>
            <l>Nature's improv'd as well as is the Nation,</l>
            <l>Our Seas have after storms no Agitation,</l>
            <l>But smooth and eeven like your Royal mind</l>
            <l>They keep their Bounds by God and you assign'd.</l>
            <l>No Libellers can tax such times as these,</l>
            <l>Those men that kill in Vizards whom they please;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94772:5"/>Nor giddy Tumults to your Palace swarm,</l>
            <l>Leaping, like Porposes, before a storm.</l>
            <l>Your well-compos'd harmonious Actions keep</l>
            <l>Wonder awake, and Envy lay asleep;</l>
            <l>And though the Sea, our Guardian, us immure,</l>
            <l>Your inland Virtues make us more secure.</l>
            <l>Let men rejoyce at this mysterious hour,</l>
            <l>That Mercy can enslave them more than Power.</l>
            <l>Your Birth entitles you unto our Throne;</l>
            <l>But Hearts by Conquest, you have made your own.</l>
            <l>Live and improve in might, possessing still</l>
            <l>Unbridled Power, that ha's a bridled Will.</l>
            <l>Distinguish men, and make your Friends to feel</l>
            <l>Their spleens are Cur'd with Gold, your Foes with steel.</l>
            <l>A King that stoops to Subjects when they frown,</l>
            <l>Gives them th' advantage-ground to reach his Crown.</l>
            <l>Thus when the Humble Sun the Pole draws near,</l>
            <l>And creeps upon the earth for half a year,</l>
            <l>His low Familiar Beams, that warm not them,</l>
            <l>Make men the Glow-worm Planet to contemn;</l>
            <l>But when ascending both in height and power,</l>
            <l>He o're their heads does more directly Towre,</l>
            <l>And with his Rayes can warm, and scorch, and fire,</l>
            <l>Then men with pleasure, and with fear admire.</l>
