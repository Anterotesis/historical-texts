            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is in man a <hi>Corruptible will,</hi> an <hi>Earthly wisdom,</hi> and a <hi>Carnal mind</hi>; and where these bear rule, there is a strong Enmity against God, and all things that be good; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these Corruptible, Earthly, Carnal things, the Seed of God is in bondage, and groans under their burden; and in that state the understanding of all men is darkned and fast closed, that the things of God neither are nor can be perceived: And this is the ground of Error, when the understanding is so darkned, that the things of God cannot be perceived; and then not being known as they are in the ground, they are supposed to be what they are not, and so Opinions drawn concerning them, and Professions made of them, and a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Service set up in them, when they have no savour of God, nor agreement with the Scriptures of Truth; So, for <hi>Doctrine</hi> men set up <hi>Traditions,</hi> which rise from the many Inventions: And from this ground is risen all your Profession and Worship which in your Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Power is set up, and unto which you would compel a Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and impose it upon all Consciences, which is a thing of great weight, and needful to be truly tryed and examined, before it be so eagerly pursued, and so wilfully endeavoured to be imposed.</p>
            <p>Therefore admit in coolness of a true Examination and Tryal by the Spirit of Truth, and from the Scriptures of Truth, and if your Practice and Worship be found to agree in one, without adding or diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then you will be freely owned, without any Law to compel; but if your Practice and Worship be found contrary, then be not angry because it is denied and testified against; for in so doing, you will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest degeneration from reasonable men: therefore, hear your Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination cooly and quietly, and if Truth prevail, then own it and submit unto it, and cease from your Traditions; but if you have any thing against it, then bring forth your strong Reasons, and prove them from the Scriptures of Truth, that it may be manifest to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98213:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of people, what is Truth, and what is Error: And for the better understanding of it, here followeth a short <hi>Catechism,</hi> which is given forth in love to the Simple, and for you to reade and peruse, ye <hi>Bishops, Doctors, Vicars, Curats,</hi> and <hi>all Prelaticals,</hi> wherein you may see <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> moderately reasoning.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I have heard that there is a God, and that he is the maker of all things: and I have also heard that from Generation to Generation, this God hath been worshipped and served; and I think it but my reasonable duty to do as others have done before me.</hi>

               <p>One onely true wise God there is, who is the maker of all things, and is over all things; but if thou hast no more knowledge of him, than by what thou hearest, thou art yet without him, and a stranger to him, and art an ignorant worshipper, and dost not know what thou worshippest; and what others have done in Generations past, will not make thy service accepted, though thou mayest wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the observation, and do all things in the custom of it; for it is only the present manifestation of God's Spirit in every man, in which God is truly served and worshipped, and in which the Service and Worship is accepted.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But cannot I come to know God by hearing that which is reported of him? and, cannot I worship him and serve him, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving what others have done, and how they have worshipped in Ages past, and so following them for my Example</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>God is a Spirit, and makes himself manifest in Spirit; and that which is truly reported of him, is from the Spirit's manifestation, which all the holy men of God were inspired with, and made their Report from, and worshipped God in; and thou mayest hear this Report, and reade it, but being from the Spirit of God manifest in thee, thou canst neither know God, nor truly worship him; for God's Worship stands not in the observation, but in his living power, neither canst thou follow the Example of the holy men of God, but by the leadings of the same Spirit, which they were guided by, and lived in.</p>

               <speaker>Trad.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it is safe for me to minde the Scriptures, and that which therein is reported, and to endeavour to observe and do it, and then I question not but I shall know God, and be a true worshipper of him.</hi>

               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>That which all are to minde, is the manifestation of God's
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98213:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Spirit, for that is his own gift to every man that they might profit; and all that turn to it, and believe in it, their understandings are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the power of it, and then the Scriptures are truly known; and this is safe and will not deceive any, but will bring the assurance with it of Eternal Life: for, as thou standest in the Questioning, so also in Doubting and Condemnation, and all thy endeavours will not profit thee, or bring assurance of Eternal Life unto thee; for it is not in him that willeth, or in him that runneth, but, standing still in obedience to the present manifestation of God's Spirit, Salvation is seen and shewed in the Mercy of God: So thou must lay down thy life in thy obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which stands in thy Tradition, and come to Truths present ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But I cannot know the Truth but by the Scripture, for it is the Scripture that makes the Truth manifest, and from the Scripture do I set up my Worship, and there ought to be a Conformity yeelded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and such as will not, to compel them by a Law.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>The understanding of Truth, is by the Spirit of Truth, and the Light of Christ in every man's Conscience makes it manifest; and this is reported in the Scripture, and is the sure Foundation, upon which the true Worship stands; and all that come to the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit, they are truly subject to it, and bow before it, and yeeld all obedience to the manifestation of it: and this is the true Worship, and the true Worshippers; and they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that come into this Worship, are not brought into it, or made conformable to it, by any National Law, neither do they seek after any such Law to force or compel others that differ from them, but commit it to the Power of God: And who comes into subjection to God's Power, and are made conformable unto that, they are the true Worshippers, and their service is performed unfeignedly, without any deceit or hypocrisie; and they appear not so much in an outward Conformity, as in Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and godly Sincerity, in which they are approved in the sight of God: So, thy Worship is found out of the Truth, and contrary to the Scriptures; and thy Law of men, to compel into a Conformity unto thy Worship, is found to be Antichristian, and to stand only in thy own Tradition, and not in the Power of Christ; so thou must either prove it from the Scriptures, or all thou canst say of it will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for Truth.</p>

                  <hi>My Worship is that which hath been accustomed through many Generations, and from many antient Fathers I have good proof
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98213:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of it; and though some things may be practised in Worship, which I cannot positively prove from the Scriptures, yet the continuance of them, and the National Law upholding them, makes them warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and out of question.</hi>

               <p>That which is accustomed and not in the Power of God, is out of the Truth, and an evil custom, and is to be abolished and not maintained; for that is the subtil ground from which many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, who have nothing to say for their Religion and Worship, but what in thy bowels is generated; saying, It hath been good, and why is it not so now? and, our Fathers thus worshipped, and why may not we? and the Nations Law warrants and upholds it, and we must be subject to the Law. Thus do thy Children reason from thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable working, by which their minds are blinded, that they cannot see the things that are, but lye groping after things that have been, which now are not, and from the continuance draw conclusions of their lawfulness; And because Laws are made to uphold them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they subject to them; when the Nation's Law doth not reach, nor is not to meddle with things that pertain to God, or to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of any man: so that it doth not make the thing warrantable, or put it out of question, because it doth provide for the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, seeing it hath not any thing at all to do with it, but the Truth doth call it in question; And if it cannot be proved to be a practice which the Scriptures do allow, and warrant the lawfulness of it, Truth doth reprove it, and also the Nations Law that doth provide for the upholding of it.</p>

But as for my Church, Preaching, Praying, Singing, Bishops and Ministers, they must be duly observed, and every man by a Law compelled thereunto, who in himself is not made willingly subject; for all these are warrantable from the Scriptures, and I have their names from thence, and in these cannot be deceived.</hi>

                  <hi>My Church is that, which through many Generations hath been a place for my Worship to be performed in, and it is consecrated and set apart for that Service; and I have also looked many Ages past, and have found from antient Fathers that it hath been much set by and highly esteemed, therefore the Foundation cannot but be right, and I must uphold it and my Worship in it.</hi>

               <p>Now I shall try thy Church, and the Foundation of it, and see upon what it stands: for if the Foundation be not right, the whole Building must fall; and there is no man can lay another Foundation than that which is layed, which is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and that which is brought forth from his Power, that is of God; and this is the Church of the living God, <hi>the pillar and ground of Truth</hi>: And, if it be not in God, it is none of his, but an adulterated Harlot, covered over with the mystery of Iniquity. Therefore <hi>Tradition</hi> be silent a little, and <hi>Truth</hi> will shew thee thy Error, and let thee see the false Foundation thy Church stands upon, and also manifest the true Church, and thereby thou mayest see how far thou art degenerated from the Life and Truth which the Saints enjoyed and possessed, and upon which the Church of God hath ever been builded and stood. So, be cool, and hear what Truth saith, for now thy Church comes to tryal.</p>
               <p>Thou hast perverted the right way of the Lord by thy Tradition and hast been setting up thy visible things in the stead of that which is spiritual, and hast given them a name out of the nature, by which thou hast deceived the Nations, and thy things that do appear are not the things of God; though thou hast made them very beautiful to behold, yet a sandy foundation they stand upon, and will not abide the day of tryal; for the Foundation of thy Church is of thy own lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Building is thy own handy-work, and thy Church hath been set up in the midnight of Apostasie, since the true Church hath been driven into the Wilderness; and the Consecration of it hath been performed by men of polluted lips, and thy Eldest son hath been the promoter of it, who himself hath lost the key of knowledge, and so promotes and sets up what thou generates in thy bowels; and this is come to pass since the dayes of the Apostles, the Spirit of Truth being lost and ravined from, darkness hath overspred, and gross darkness hath covered, and peoples minds have been blinded, that thy Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98213:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Sorceries hath not been perceived, and so hast thou formed a false likeness, and given it a true name, by which thou hast deceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in drawing the minds of people to believe that thy work is that which it is not: But the Foundation of God is more sure, and the true Church is built upon it, and receives its name from the nature, and not from any false conception; for, the Church is in God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and this is the pillar and ground of Truth, and is laid upon <hi>Christ</hi> the living stone, in whom the building is fitly framed, and groweth up unto an holy Temple in the Lord, and it is presented without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; and there is the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of it, received in the Holiness of his life, and he becomes the Head of it, and it is truly his own Body, which he takes to himself in everlasting Righteousness, and espouseth it in his Life for ever and ever; and this doth not decay nor wax old, but is the same, without any variableness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> throughout all Generations. So is thy Church truly tryed, and the Foundation of it is found false, and the true Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nature it hath not; therefore is the name to be blotted out, that from henceforth none may be deceived with it.</p>

Who first brought up all these things, and from whence have they sprung? And who first ordained that the Tenth part of things increasing unto people, should be paid to thy Colledge-Ministers? and who first made that Law which forces and compells the payment of the Tenth part of things increased, unto such a Ministry? and whether are such the Ministers of Christ, who make use of that Law to force their Maintenance, contrary to the freedom of people; and to proceed against such as cannot give it them freely, by suing and imprisoning their bodies, and spoyling their goods?

and Ministers now, and they receive what they need, and no more: and whether it be the Tenth, or Twentieth, or Thirtieth part, If it supply their need, they are truly contented; and so they gather Flocks, and feed upon the Milk of those they have gathered; and plant Vineyards, and eat the Fruit of them; but do not compell by any outward Law, Milk to be given them out of another Flock, nor Fruit out of another Vineyard: So that thy decent Order which thou speakest of, is proved Confusion and Disorder, being out of the life and power of Truth; and all thy vain Tradition is seen with the pure Light of Christ, in which all things are made manifest, and with the Light and Truth thou art reproved.</p>

                  <hi>Certainly this thing which makes such discoveries of my practices, and with such boldness reproves me for them, it is of God; for it is not in any fear of me or my Power, which now is strong and in great authority, and unto which I had thought all would have bowed, without disputing or questioning; but I see there is that risen that appears against me, and makes such discoveries of me, that I cannot keep hid any longer; therefore I shall let it alone, and deal with others that I can cause to be subject; for, the more I deal with this Manifestation of Truth, the more is my Tradition discovered and opened unto all People; so that it is safest for me to be quiet and let it alone, lest by striving to uphold all, I come to lose all, and so be rejected and disesteemed; and all my Honour and Dignity, wherein I now stand, be laid in the dust, and trodden upon: And if I had thought that there had been such a thing made manifest in this Age, as the Truth, I should have been more reserved and retired, but I had thought I might have boasted and gloryed in my own handy-work, and that it would have passed without being questioned, as heretofore it hath done; but now I see it is otherwise, therefore I shall be silent.</hi>

               <p>That which doth discover thee and thy deceitfull practice, that is a Manifestation of God, and is the Truth of God, which was before thou hadst a name, and will abide when thy name is lost; and it doth boldly reprove thee, and is without any fear of thee or thy power, and hath opened thee, and ript up thy bowels, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered thy adulterous womb, and all the false conceptions that have been conceived therein; and it hath made manifest thy first-born and eldest son, unto whom thou hast given a name, and calls him

            <p>Now, behold ye <hi>Arch-Bishops, Lord-Bishops, Deans, Prebends, Doctors, Vicars, Curates,</hi> and all <hi>Prelaticals,</hi> here is the womb of your conception opened, and that made manifest from which you draw your breath, and prolong the length of your dayes, with all your Service and Worship, which you so much esteem and promote, and labour to compel a Conformity to; It is here discovered in the Power of Truth, and you may see, by perusing this <hi>Catechism</hi> in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, your great degeneration from the Life of the <hi>Prophets, Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and how the Names invented, and the Worship by you practised, differ in the ground from the Practice and Worship that the Saints performed in the Power of God's Spirit. Where have you from the Scriptures, or the Saints Practice, any Precept or President for your builded Church of Wood and Stone, your Bells hanging in the end of it, and to toul and ring them when you would have people come together to your Worship; your set-time before mid-day, and your set-time after mid-day to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and perform your Worship, your Common-Prayer-Book and your Letany, and your Prayers, divided and appointed when and how to be said; your Preaching in your methods and forms, your Text taking, and your Doctrines raising, with your Uses, Reasons, Helps, Motives, Arguments and Applications; your Singing in the riming and tuning; your Bishopricks and Diocesses; your Deanries and Prebendries; your Doctors, Vicars and Curates; your Tithes and set Maintenance; your great Livings and lesser Livings; your Parishes, and places of Settlement; your Mattens and Evensong; your Organs, Rails, Altars, Fonts, Sacraments, Crossing Children in their foreheads, and sprinkling Water in their faces, and calling it Baptism; your Anthems, and your Singing-men and Boyes to sing them; your Hoods, Surplices and Tipits; with many other things which by you are observed in your Service and Worship, that the Lord never commanded, nor the Saints ever practised, nor any Scripture to prove the lawfulness of them? Therefore consider the rise of them, and the truth of them, before you pursue so eagerly to impose them, or compel a Conformity to them; for tender people, who are come to the least manifestation of Truth, they cannot bear such
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98213:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Imposition upon their Consciences; though by Laws and Statutes you may strive to impose them, and proceed against them as trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors, if they deny submission to them, yet will not your Cruelty bring tender People into a Conformity to your Traditions; and if you will but consider coolly, and pursue this <hi>Catechism</hi> soberly, you will see that it is not reasonable, to compel a Conformity unto those things that you are setting up and practising in your Devotion and Worship, or to impose them upon the Consciences of any people, but rather leave all to stand in their own liberty, and to chuse or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse as they are perswaded in their own Conscience; which is but a reasonable thing to be granted: for, if you see no further in your selves than that which Tradition hath brought in, and set up, and you in your Conscience be perswaded of its lawfulness, and perform it as a matter of Conscience; would you think it reasonable to be compelled from that unto another thing, and have another thing imposed upon your Consciences by any outward power, which you do not feel a perswasion in your minds unto? And if this seem hard unto you if it should be so done, Then is it not the same unto another, And will you not do unto others, as you would have others do unto you? And why cannot you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in your own perswasion, and your own liberty in it, without imposing it upon the Consciences of others who are otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded? And this is not reasonable in the sight of moderate men; therefore leave off exercising Lordship, that all people may stand in their Liberty, and walk as they are perswaded in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and impose not your Observations and your Traditions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any, who are not in themselves perswaded of their lawfulness; for that makes many Hypocrites, but can never make one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. So, there must be first a perswasion wrought in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a belief in the Truth and Lawfulness of what is to be observed, or the heart can never stand right unto it, though it be in great strictness imposed: And this brings people but into an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and to make a shew of the thing outwardly, when the heart is not after the thing which is imposed upon them; and when a Conformity is not yeelded, as by your Law is required, then to proceed in your Cruelty to imprison and persecute the tender-hearted, who cannot for Conscience-sake bow to your Traditions; This is not reasonable before moderate men, nor approved in the sight of the living God. Therefore, hear and consider, ye Bishops,

               </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, and let your moderation appear, for the Lord is at hand, and in his Eternal Power your way he is trying, and you must come up to the Bar of his Judgment-Seat, and give an account; and think it not strange to be catechised, for you have need to be taught what the first principle of the pure Religion is; and if you will but soberly peruse this <hi>Catechism,</hi> you may know and learn that which your Universities could never give you the knowledge of, nor all your Learning and Wisdom could ever teach you; And in love to the Simple hath Truth opened it self plainly and simply, that you might come to know that which in the darkness hath from your eyes been hid, and that you might no longer oppose it, and persecute those that walk in it, but leave Truth to its operation, which brings forth true and perfect Freedom; and if you did but know the Truth, and the Freedom that is begotten in it, you would not be so envious against it, and set up your Tradition in opposition to it: But this is done that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>they hated me without a cause.</hi> And this is your honour and worldly glory, which lifts you up in pride, which God is staining. And now, do you believe that your Foundation is right, and your Building safe? I tell you, Nay; for, God will destroy both it and you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you do not speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cease from it, and repent of it, and do not busie and throng your selves so much to promote it, and to finish it; for God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to overthrow it for ever. Oh ye deceived men, who have no strength but in your Tradition, nor no comfort but from the milk of her breast; you have been long drawing and sucking, and yet are dry and lean, and your immortal Souls receive no refreshing nor satisfaction. Why are ye so blinded, and so much deceived, and cannot otherwise be perswaded but that Tradition is the right way, and from that Conclusion, endeavour an Imposition upon every Conscience, when their Faith stands not in the same thing, nor are not so perswaded of it as you are? and what have you to do to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Tradition upon the Consciences of others, more than others to impose their Opinions and Judgments upon your Consciences? And, would you judge it reasonable that any should so do unto you? And if it belong unto you to do it on your parts, more than others to do it on their parts, then make it manifest how, and from whom you have received that power? For moderate men are now satisfied, that Schools and Colledges cannot give it you; and they are also satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98213:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Christ doth not give it you, and also that there is no Scripture to warrant you; therefore Truth enquires moderately of you, from whence, and from whom this Imposing Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the Consciences of others you receive, seeing it is made manifest that you walk by Tradition and not after Christ: For Imposition and Persecution are an evident Testimony against you, and fully open and make you manifest to be of a contrary spirit unto the Apostles, who were hated and persecuted, yet they loved and blessed; and here they manifested their love unto Him, who commanded that they should love their Enemies, and do good to those that hated them; and they were his Disciples, and kept his Commandments. And all that truly follow him in this day, he begets in them the same mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they keep his Commandments with joy, and dare not persecute any people upon the Earth for their Opinion and Judgment in matters of Religion; nor dare they impose any thing upon the Consciences of others by any outward Law, but leave it to Him that judgeth righteously, who hath the Ruling Power over the Conscience; and as he is believed in, he works a perswasion in the Conscience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Truth, as he makes it manifest; and then the Truth is joyned unto, from a true Perswasion, and not from an outward Imposition; and you are not to judge in these things, for in so doing you take his Right from Him, and set up that which is not his; and when you have done it, then you labour to impose it upon every Conscience: And this is a quite contrary thing to the Saints practice, who durst not set up any thing that did not stand in the Power of God: and when the Power had brought any thing forth, they did not impose it upon the Conscience of any by an outward Law, that they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by might compel a Conformity to it, but they preached it in the Power, and so commended themselves unto every man's Conscience in the sight of God. Therefore, behold your degeneration, and what hath happened unto you in this apostatizing night of darkness, in which you have erred from the right way, and gone astray from the leadings of God, and from the Power of his living Spirit, and so have brought forth your own dead works, and are serving the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God in them: And what you have sought out in your Tradition, that you have set up for Doctrine and Worship, and would bring all people to bow unto it; but now the day declares you, and in the Land of Tradition the Light hath found you, and the habitation of your dwelling-places is seen under the Groves and green Trees of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98213:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your own planting, and moderate people cannot come unto you, nor inhabite with you; for your Rest is polluted, and sudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction is coming upon it.</p>
            <p>Now all <hi>Bishops, Deans, Prebends, Doctors, Vicars, Curates,</hi> and all <hi>Prelaticals,</hi> turn to the Truth, and lay hold upon it, and let Tradition go; for Truth was before Tradition, and the Truth will bring Tradition to an end. So your Foundation is not safe, nor your Building steadfast, but stands in the unstable waters of your own humane Inventions, and not upon Christ the Rock of Ages. And now Truth hath moderately enquired after you, and having found you out of the Life of the Prophets, Christ and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, it warns you all to Repentance, that the Judgment may be diverted, and the hand of Severity stayed, which certainly is haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down upon you, without speedy Repentance. So escape for your lives, that the stroak may not fall upon you, and smite you down into the Death for ever.</p>
            <p>Now all you High and Mighty, Wise and Learned Ones, give ear and hear <hi>Truth's Testimony,</hi> and see if you can reade the Parable, and learn what it means.</p>
