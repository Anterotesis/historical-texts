         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HAving felt the <hi>Cormorants</hi> Pulse, I find it to beat violently after gain. He were a skilfull <hi>Physitian,</hi> that could pick out the <hi>greedy <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107263:2"/>
the issue to him, to whom nothing is hard. And that I may (if it be possible) pluck up Covetousnesse by the roots; I will (as near as I can) imitate our <hi>Anatomists,</hi> who in desecting of a <hi>Corpse,</hi> passe not by the least <hi>vein,</hi> or <hi>artery,</hi> without a discovery, and paraphrase upon the same. And so, that the profit (as I hope) shall recompence the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity.</p>
                  <p>True, he is such a deep, that one may better tell the haires of his head, then the wickednesse of his heart. And whereas <hi>Many sinners</hi> (which in my former Characters I have pointed out,) <hi>have done wickedly; this</hi> wretch <hi>surpasseth them all.</hi> Yea the springs and wards of his deceitful heart, are so divers and intricate; that it would be an impossible enterprise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher them all. Neverthelesse, I will (<hi>God</hi> assisting me) acquaint you with such words, actions, and cunning devices of his, as are most worth my discovery, and the <hi>Worlds</hi> notice: that being known and stigmatized, you may the better beware of him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Covetous Cormorant, Miserly Muckworm, Greedy Griper,</hi> or <hi>Cunning Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian</hi>; is one that affects no life or quality for it self, but for gain; all his reaches, are at riches. His <hi>Summum bonum</hi> is commodity: and gold is the <hi>goddesse</hi> he adores in every thing. Nor cares he how he gets, but what he gets. For he not only betters his estate, by making himself worse; and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verisheth his soul, to inrich his body: But to purchase a great estate, he will sell both soul, and body. Nor could he otherwise call his wealth his own: if he did not thus buy or purchase it with himself. Like <hi>Silvester</hi> the second, who to get the <hi>Popedome,</hi> gave himself to the devil.</p>
                  <p>If he be a Trades-man, he takes one and the same oath; to be the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Freeman, and moneyes bondslave. He shuts the fear of <hi>God</hi> out of his heart, the same day he begins the world: and marries his Wife, and the World at once: to save the Charge of a double Wedding. He bids a good conscience farewel for thirty years: charging it to meet him again, when he is <hi>Alderman.</hi> For his hopes, and desires are as great; as his deserts are mean.</p>
                  <p>Nor is he any niggard of his labour, or neglecter of time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Its ever <hi>Term</hi> with him; his businesse admits of no <hi>vacation,</hi> no holiday; scarse of nights, or meal times. For he is so eager on his worldly occasions; that he seldom feeles himself either sleepy, or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: nor will they once give him leave, to think of his conscience. He takes paynes, and parboyles himself in sweat unreasonably: and because all servants (as he thinks) are Theeves: it much grieves him, he hath not an hundreth hands with <hi>Briarius</hi>; and as many Eyes with <hi>Argus</hi>: for he could and would imploy them all. Nor is there any end, or limit to be found in Covetousnesse. <hi>Balaam</hi> was so inflamed with the hope of <hi>Balacks</hi> gold: that he thought his <hi>Asse</hi> never went half fast enough to it. <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. whence it is, that such an one plots, studies, contrives, breaks his peace, his sleep, his brains to compasse his desires. Neither will he spare, to plow furrowes on the backs of the Poor: Or run through the blood of Orphans to effect the same. For though he ventures
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107263:2"/>
his <hi>eares,</hi> his <hi>neck,</hi> his soul; he dares not deny his <hi>slave,</hi> his <hi>dog,</hi> his <hi>devil avarice.</hi> Wind, tyde, nor time; but it shall bring him in profit. Yea he will grow wealthy by <hi>Plague, Famine,</hi> or <hi>War,</hi> (like those fowles that fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with frosty weather,) And as for these <hi>Civil wars</hi>: we know to our cost, that many of them are swollen in their estates, and minds: from a <hi>toade,</hi> to an <hi>Ox,</hi> as in the Fable. What are his several wayes to effect the same, in such times: I dare not tell ye; for fear of teaching them: and my aym is to profit your soules, not to increase your estates. Neither will this Discourse permit me, to be prolix. Only this, for matter of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he is like <hi>Dorio</hi> the Bawde in <hi>Terence</hi>: that was not ashamed of the basest actions, that brought her in benefit. Or <hi>Caligula</hi>: who could smell no difference, between gold got by oppression; and that which was honestly come by. And indeed: how should not that Eye be blind? which the <hi>Devil</hi> hath dawbed up, with the dirt of this <hi>world. The gift blindeth the eyes of the wise, saith God; and perverteth the words of the just. Exod.</hi> 23.8. <hi>Deut,</hi> 16.19.</p>

                  <p>I Need not tell you of his procuring <hi>Monopolies,</hi> to rob the <hi>Common wealth</hi>: a wicked way to inrich one man, by beggering, or defrauding a multitude. Nor how politick he is, to ingrosse a Commodity in the plenty, and neglect of it: that he may inrich himself when a time of <hi>dearth</hi> shall come. Nor of his hoording up Corn in a dear year: which is to make a private gain, of <hi>Gods Iudgments,</hi> and to starve the Poor. For he does what he can to starve them. He curses the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in times of scarcity: wishes that <hi>Danske</hi> were as far as the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockoes.</hi> And had rather have the frame of the World fall, then the price of his Corn. And the like in whatsoever this <hi>Cormorant</hi> deales; For he will be sure to make the most of it. And not only in the price, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For, for the emptying of other mens purses, and filling of his own: he buyes by one ballance, and sells by another. hath false <hi>weights,</hi> false <hi>measures,</hi> false <hi>wares,</hi> false <hi>lights,</hi> a false <hi>finger,</hi> a false <hi>tongue,</hi> a false <hi>heart,</hi> &amp;c. Nor can you well make any bargain with him, without being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached by him. As a bargain may sometimes be as unmercifull, as a robbery: and hasty selling (which many poor men are oft put unto,) is commonly more disadvantagious, then interest.</p>
                  <p>Let him be put in trust; as <hi>Ioseph</hi> was by <hi>Potiphar:</hi> who <hi>committed all he had to him, Gen.</hi> 39.6 to 10. he is so far from dealing faithfully as he did: Or those mentioned, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. <hi>whom Iosiah found so honest, that he would take no reckoning of them,</hi> verse 4. to 8. That he falls short of the <hi>unjust steward,</hi> Luke 16. who cheated his <hi>Master,</hi> but of fifty, in an hundred. vers. 6. For whatsoever he catcheth in his clawes, he will be sure to hold: like the <hi>Fish Polipus,</hi> Or <hi>a drowning man</hi>; that holds all he can take hold on. And not onely so, but he will laugh in his sleeve, and esteem it a good jest; to see how his subtilty, hath cousened your simplicity in earnest. But he is a <hi>fool,</hi> in thus playing the <hi>knave:</hi> for honesty though it gain but little at once, yet it gains that little oft, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107263:3"/>
long. whereas nothing but mere necessity, will bring a man into a <hi>Trap</hi>; wherein he hath once been taken. Nor make him joyn with a known <hi>theef,</hi> in his own <hi>robbing.</hi> I have known some, that by wronging, and cousening a Customer of a few shillings: have hindered themselves the taking, of half so many thousand pounds. And others that by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and square dealing: have gained such credit; that the mere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof, hath procured them customars from all parts of the Land. And certainly a wise man would be honest: if it were but for his own ends. But <hi>God</hi> hath justly ordained, that he who will be a <hi>knave</hi> in one thing: should be <hi>a fool</hi> in another. But to go on,</p>
                  <p>Suppose he shall be brought upon his <hi>Oath,</hi> when his cousening can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved: as in <hi>Israel, when any thing was delivered to a Neighbour in trust; and he refused to restore the same; pretending it was stolne, Exod.</hi> 22.7, 8, 10, 11. he will absolutely forswear himself; rather then acknowledg it, or make satisfaction. And the like is his dealing with <hi>Orphanes</hi>; if any shall be so simple, or unhappy; as to put him in trust with their estates; and leave the care of their children to him: (though the greatest obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a good mind, is anothers trust: which to disappoint, is match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse perfidiousnesse,) he will discharge his trust with a witnesse. Much like that Taylor: who like a Knave as he was shrunk a Freeze Gown, to three dozen of Buttons. For he hath a Conscience like a Barn Door: and can disgest gold, and silver, as the <hi>Ostridge</hi> doth Iron. Yea so vast is the gorge of his Conscience: that he can swallow the greatest crimes, and find no strain in the passage. Yea he can carry them as lightly away, as <hi>Sampson</hi> did the <hi>Gates of the City</hi>; and his back never complain of the burthen. Not can you expect he should be faithful to men: that is so unfaithful to <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p>If he be a great dealer, and growes not rich that way: he will effect it another way. he will study tricks to uphold the credit of his wealth: and still the nearer he comes to poverty; the more shew he will make of sufficiency, untill he hath got twenty mens estates, perhaps <hi>ten thousand pounds</hi> into his hands; And then in knavery he breaks, and gets more by this one trick, then if he had thrived never so well in his calling. For he will, if it be possible, so conceal his estate; that his <hi>Creditors</hi> shall be glad of <hi>two shillings,</hi> or <hi>ten groats</hi> in the pound.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the unworthy, study more to be advanced, and grow rich; then to be worthy of that advancement, or wealth; by doing good in their places. Whence they are as industrious in climing; as <hi>Briarius</hi>: who even clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered to reach at the <hi>Heavens:</hi> and speed thereafter. <hi>Haman</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes aspiring, and lifting up his head: till it was lifted up <hi>fifty cubits</hi> higher, then he would have had it, <hi>Ester</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And <hi>Saul</hi> you know in <hi>seeking Asses, found a Kingdome</hi>: But <hi>Absalom</hi> in <hi>seeking a Kingdom, found a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes</hi>: And indeed how many have we known, like the <hi>Frog</hi> in <hi>AEsop</hi>? who thinking to swell till he was as big as an <hi>Ox</hi>; burst before he came half way to it.

                  <p>Secondly; the worst men get the best places, and offices; because they are better verst in the way that leads thereto: And have liberty to use such means; (viz. <hi>flattery, bribery</hi> and <hi>bloodshed</hi>: the usual stayers of the covetous, and ambitious,) as the deserving dare not. Of the first, <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> may serve for an example, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.5, 6. Of the second, that <hi>Chief Captain, Acts</hi> 22.28.

                  <p>Offices should be given freely, to the most fit and deserving; (As the <hi>Stern</hi> is committed to him, that is most expert, and skilful in <hi>Navigation,</hi>) that is, to <hi>men of courage, fearing God, dealing truly, and hating Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Exod.</hi> 18.21. who will neither grow great by <hi>buying offices</hi>; nor rich by <hi>selling them</hi>: Neither grow rich by others bribes, nor honourable by their own.

And <hi>Offices</hi> have usually been sold, to such as would give most for them: whereby all gainfull places throughout the Land; were sold to such, as made prey of the people. And from hence springs all our miseries: For whereas that <hi>Common Wealth</hi> is most happy, and best governed; in which wicked men may bear no sway, nor have any authority; as <hi>Pittacus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves. So on the contrary, that <hi>Common wealth</hi> is most unhappy; and worst governed; in which wicked men do bear all the sway, and have the chief authority.</p>
                  <p>I might heap up instances from the <hi>Word, Histories,</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of all Ages of such, as have attained great places; by means of cruelty, and intrusion.

And what <hi>Court</hi> was there almost, in the Land? where <hi>Iustice</hi> was not bought and sold. Might not the worst cause?

                     <hi>great Lord,</hi> be procured to deliver him? so that the <hi>Law</hi> might put up his dagger: For by this means a lewd person needed not fear to offend; that had a great man to his friend; or had not a great man to his enemy.

Thus the poor traveller is robbed doubly; both of his money, and all relief of the <hi>Law</hi>; and the protector of the lewd person is become the greater thief. A poor sheep-stealer is hanged, for stealing of victuals; compelled peradventure by necessity of that intollerable cold, hunger, and thirst, to save himself from starving. But a great man in office, may securely rob whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, undo thousands, pill and poll, oppresse, flea, grind, tyrannize, inrich himself by spoyles of the Commons; be uncontroleable in all his actions, and after all be recompensed with turgent Titles, honoured for his good service, and no man dare find fault with him, or mutter at the matter. much like the justice of <hi>Domitius,</hi> who alwayes punished the poor, and those that were of no power: but the rich and mighty he pardoned. These are theeves, not for taking purses by the high way, but bribes in their chambers. <hi>Hosea</hi> 4.18.

This made <hi>Socrates</hi> laugh to see, a <hi>Iudge</hi> severely to punish others; and do worse himself: to see little theeves, riding in Carts to the Gallowes; and great theeves in Coaches to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them. <hi>Minuta puniuntur, magna in triumphis feruntur.</hi>

But the <hi>King of kings</hi> will one day, condemn you both: him for commanding, and thee for yeelding: And recompence your obedience with Fire, and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. And not seldom have such, their deserved recompence; sooner then they expect it. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the fourth, adjudged two <hi>Knights</hi> to death; more through malice, then out of justice: but one of them cryed out, O unjust <hi>King!</hi> we cite thee to appear within thirty dayes, before the Tribunal feat of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; to receive recompense for thine inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: upon the last of which dayes; he dyed, as <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies. <hi>Demetrius</hi> having received many requests, and supplications of his subjects; threw them all into the water, as he went over the Bridge: whereupon, his subjects conceived such an hatred against him; that his Army forsook him, and yeelded to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>: who drave him out of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> as <hi>Diodorus</hi> sets it down. I confesse it is a miserable thing, to fall into such times: in which men must both speak what they think not, and do what they approve not. As <hi>Tacitus</hi> that great States-man speaks. Yea as wise <hi>Plato</hi> could say, that <hi>Common wealth</hi> is like to go to wrack: where <hi>Magistrates</hi> rule the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and not the <hi>Lawes</hi> rule <hi>Magistrates.</hi> To which accords that of the <hi>Oracle</hi>: The <hi>Sibarites</hi> desirous to know from <hi>Apollo,</hi> how long their prosperity should last? were answered; that so soon as they began to prefer men, before <hi>God</hi>; their state should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. And to speak the truth in plain English: (as now we may do blessed be <hi>God.</hi>) He is not a <hi>King,</hi> but a <hi>Tyrant</hi>: whose <hi>will</hi> swayes, and not the <hi>Law.</hi> as wise <hi>States men</hi> have been bold to affirm. But what of all this? An honest man will do nothing to please any, whereby he shall displease <hi>God.</hi> He will answer the <hi>King,</hi> you bound me by oath at my first entrance; that I should in all cases give judgment, according to law. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> being requested by his <hi>Father,</hi> to give a sentence against equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: gratiously denyed him, saying: You have taught me, O Father, from my youth, to obey the Lawes: and therefore I will now obey you therein, in judging nothing against the <hi>Lawes.</hi> And <hi>Benevolus,</hi> when <hi>Iustina</hi> the <hi>Arian Empresse</hi> proffered him great preferments, to have him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107263:6"/>
instrumental in a service; which could not be done with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, answered: What do you promising mean higher degree of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for a reward of impiety; yea even take this from me, which alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I have; so I may keep a good conscience; And forthwith gave her his <hi>Girdle,</hi> the <hi>Ensign of his Honour.</hi> And of such a spirit, was <hi>Sir Thomas Moor</hi>: who made great suit to the <hi>King,</hi> to be discharged his <hi>Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celorship</hi>; that so he might not against his conscience; speak, nor act any thing, about the <hi>Kings</hi> marriage with <hi>Queen Anne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Iudge</hi> truly fearing <hi>God,</hi> is in Justice and piety, as immoveable as a <hi>Rock</hi>: Like <hi>Fabricius,</hi> of whom <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> (though his enemy) gave this praise, that a man might as soon turn the <hi>Sun</hi> out of his <hi>course</hi>; as him from truth and honesty. as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Eutropius</hi> report. Or like <hi>Aristides,</hi> who <hi>feared not the King,</hi> nor would <hi>favour his own Father</hi>; and for his impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial dealing in all matters: was sirnamed the Just. Or <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> whom all the riches of the world, could not withdraw from the least duty to his <hi>Countrey.</hi> as <hi>AElian</hi> reports. Or the <hi>Midwives,</hi> who (though weak Women) would not do as the <hi>King of Egypt</hi> commanded them: but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served alive the men Children, Exod.</hi> 1.17, 20, 21. Or the <hi>wise men, Matth.</hi> 2. 1. to 13. who turned their backs upon <hi>Herod</hi>; when in his command he intended mischief. Or the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who would <hi>burn,</hi> rather then <hi>turn.</hi> Vertue, and piety is such a thing: that neither power can force her, nor wealth win her, nor any thing in the whole World corrupt her. One that feares <hi>God,</hi> and hath a good <hi>conscience</hi>; is like <hi>Fire,</hi> that cannot be forced downwards. When <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> tempted <hi>Fabricius,</hi> with money and promises of honour: And seeing that would not do, threatned him with <hi>Elephants</hi> and strange things, he answered: I <hi>fear</hi> not thy <hi>force,</hi> and I am too <hi>wise</hi> for thy <hi>fraud.</hi> The <hi>Prince of Conde</hi> being taken prisoner, by <hi>Charles the ninth of France</hi>: and put to his choyce, whether he would go to <hi>Masse,</hi> or be put to <hi>death,</hi> or suffer perpetual <hi>imprisonment?</hi> answered: the former I will never do by <hi>Gods grace</hi>; as for the two latter, let the <hi>King</hi> do with me what he pleaseth; For <hi>God</hi> I assure my self <hi>will turn all to the best.</hi> When <hi>Modestus</hi> the <hi>Emperours Lievtenant,</hi> threatned to kill <hi>Bazil,</hi> he answered: if that be all I fear not, yea your Master cannot more pleasure me, then in sending me unto my heavenly Father; to whom I now live, and to whom I desire to hasten. And another time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing threatned with bonds, banishment, Confiscation, cruel torture, death, &amp;c. he bad him fright <hi>babies</hi> with such <hi>bugb<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Yea quoth he, had I a thousand lives, I would lay them all down for my <hi>Saviours</hi> sake; who hath done abundantly more for me. And when they offered him money and preferments, to tempt him, he answered: can ye give me <hi>money</hi> that can last for ever, and <hi>glory</hi> that shall eternally flourish? <hi>Iohn Ardely</hi> profest to <hi>Bonner,</hi> when he told him of burning; and how ill he could indure it: that if he had as many lives, as he had haires on his head; he would lose them all in the fire, before he would lose his <hi>Christ.

Yea thou wouldest rather have more put in, that thou never yet heardest. If so, learn to be more wise, or at least more charitable: or rather confesse, that <hi>Sloth sits and censures, what the industrious teach: Foxes love to dispraise the Grapes, they cannot reach.</hi>

                  <p>SUch as fear <hi>God,</hi> if higher powers injoyn them things against him, who is highest of all: they will <hi>rather obey God then man. Acts</hi> 4.19. Yea in this they are like <hi>God</hi> himself: who <hi>accepteth not the persons of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and regardeth not the Rich, more then the poor. Iob</hi> 34.19.</p>
                  <p>And were <hi>Princes</hi> so wise as they should be: they would blesse <hi>God,</hi> that they had such <hi>impartial Iudges. Henry the fourth of England,</hi> when the <hi>Prince</hi> his eldest son; was by the <hi>Lord Chief Iustice</hi> for some great misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, <hi>committed to prison</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he thanked <hi>God</hi> that he had a Son so obedient, and a <hi>Iudge</hi> of such <hi>impartial, and undaunted courage.</hi> And when a <hi>Iudge</hi> is once found to be so impartial: no man will dare, once to sollicite him in any dishonest, or unjust cause. As <hi>Cicero</hi> writes of <hi>Cato Censorius, to his eternal praise.</hi> But for want of such <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Iudges: Iudgment is turned backward, and justice standeth afar off</hi>; For <hi>Truth is fallen in the Streets, and equity cannot enter.</hi> As <hi>God</hi> complaines. <hi>Isay</hi> 59.14. <hi>As a roaring Lyon, and an hungry Bear: so is a wicked Ruler, over the poor people.</hi> As wise <hi>King Solomon</hi> makes the resemblance. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.15, 16. And the <hi>Prophet Micha, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>They eat also the flesh of my people, and flea off their skins from their bones, vers.</hi> 3. But</p>
                  <p>Thirdly: as these covetous <hi>Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> will do any wicked act, for <hi>Great ones</hi> out of <hi>fear</hi>: so they will do the same for <hi>friends,</hi> or Allyes out of <hi>love,</hi> and to save their own purses: Or against <hi>Enemies</hi> out of malice. He that puts on a <hi>publick Gown,</hi> should put off a <hi>private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>: like <hi>Cleon the Lacedemonian</hi>; who when he undertook publick affairs; called all his friends together, and told them: that he now discharged himself of all friendship; in that it too often caused men to swarve. from Justice and equity. But how common is it with these <hi>corrupt Magistrates,</hi> to make a <hi>bad cause good,</hi> or a <hi>good bad</hi>; either to <hi>revenge a wrong,</hi> or to

                     <hi>do a pleasure.</hi> To speak, or act partially; according to the interest he hath in the Cause, or the patient. But what saith <hi>Solomon? It is not good, to have respect to any person in Iudgment: for that man will transgresse for a peece of bread. Prov.</hi> 24.23. &amp; 28.21. He that <hi>God</hi> hath deputed as <hi>Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peer,</hi> between party and party: should say to <hi>Fathers, Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>; whether <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Political</hi>; I know ye not. That is, neither <hi>nighnesse,</hi> nor <hi>Highnesse,</hi> shall make me play the Huckster, with <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> or my <hi>Conscience. Neighbourhood</hi> is my friend, <hi>Alliance</hi> is my friend, <hi>bounty</hi> is my friend; But <hi>Iustice</hi> is my friend, a <hi>good Conscience</hi> is my friend, and <hi>God</hi> is my friend above all. Wherefore without respecting the person, Or expecting the gifts of any: I will do what these friends, would have me. Like <hi>Papinian,</hi> who being commanded by the <hi>Emperour Caracalla</hi>; whose Steward and familiar he was; to defend him in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just cause, would not do it. Or like <hi>Phocion,</hi> who refused to help his son in law <hi>Carillus</hi> in judgment, being accused for bribery: saying, he had made him his friend and Ally; in all just, and reasonable matters, and in them onely. Or <hi>Sir Thomas Moor,</hi> who upon the like occasion told his son in Law: that were he to decide a cause, between his Father whom he loved dearly; and the <hi>Devil</hi> whom he hated extreamly: he would deal impartially, and do the <hi>Devil</hi> right if his cause were good. And when another of his sons in law, that had a cause depending before him in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi>; and presumed too much on his favour: when he would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by him, to agree to any indifferent composition; he made a flat decree against him. Or <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who when his son was taken in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; to satisfie Justice, and in some sort the people who intreated for him: caused one of his sons eyes, and another of his own to be puld out. The law requiring both, of the party's offending. Or <hi>Antonius Venerius Duke of Venice</hi>; who suffered his son to dye in prison, because he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished a maid. Or <hi>Mardus,</hi> who sate in judgment upon his son <hi>Cartanes</hi>; and would have put him to death: but that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> seeing his Justice, pardoned his son. Or lastly <hi>Noah</hi>; and <hi>Abraham: Abraham</hi> would <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his son,</hi> rather then displease <hi>God: Noah</hi> did curse his own sonne, rather then he would displease <hi>God.</hi> Shewing that we should not spare our own bowels, when God would have them punished. But do as the <hi>Fathers, and Mothers of Idolaters, Drunkards, and Blasphemers</hi> did in the <hi>Law</hi>: who <hi>brought the first stone to put their sons to death. Deut.</hi> 21.18, 19, 20, 21. And indeed he onely, whom neither <hi>Clamor,</hi> nor <hi>Rumour,</hi> nor <hi>Terrour</hi>; Neither furious <hi>passion,</hi> nor melting <hi>compassion,</hi> can divert from <hi>Iustice</hi>; is fit to be a <hi>Iudge.</hi> He who resembles <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> his son: who when any came to complain, stopped one of their eares; which they reserved for the <hi>defendant.</hi> As <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms. And such an one in good turnes, will not owe more then he must: in evil owe, and not pay. Yea he hates, and scorns to pay private wrongs; with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Office; and if ever he be partial, it is to his Enemy.

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> went to a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and told him <hi>Sir</hi>: And it shall please <hi>your Gentlemanship,</hi> I would have <hi>proces</hi> for one, that hath called me a <hi>Mechanick fellow</hi>: So you shall quoth the <hi>Lawyer,</hi> for that will bear a very good action. The <hi>Lawyer</hi> that careth not to deal unfaithfully: is like some <hi>Christall Glasse,</hi> which flatteringly sheweth every man a <hi>fair face,</hi> how <hi>ilfavoured</hi> soever it be. These are Abettors that set men on; their <hi>Cockpit</hi> is <hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> and while their Clyents peck out each others eyes, they pull their feathers. <hi>Absaloms</hi> tongue is in their heads; and as he <hi>stole away the peoples hearts,</hi> so these steal their estates. And no cause so bad, but they will undertake it either for gain, or glory: as he gets most fame, and the greatest practice; that can make a <hi>bad cause good,</hi> and a <hi>good bad.</hi> Whence it is <hi>they bend their tongues, like Bowes for lyes.</hi> As <hi>Ieremy</hi> hath it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.3. <hi>that they may overthrow the right of the poor in his suit.</hi> As <hi>Moses</hi> hath it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.6. see more <hi>Esay</hi> 32.7. For they <hi>will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise some wicked counsel</hi> or other: (if they be paid thereafter) <hi>to undo the</hi> adverse party, <hi>with lying words.</hi> And commonly, they are like <hi>Caelius</hi>: that could plead better against a man, then for him, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaks. Yea some of them fall not far short of <hi>Carneades</hi>; of whom wise <hi>Cato</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; that while he disputed; scarse any man could discern which was the truth. So <hi>they turn judgment into wormwood, Amos</hi> 5.7. <hi>and forge wrong for a Law,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.20. Have you not heard of a <hi>Lawyer?</hi> that <hi>pleaded</hi> a <hi>case</hi> very strongly on the one side; yet before the <hi>Tryal</hi> of it, being advanced to the <hi>Bench</hi>; he adjudged it on the other. But had he been like <hi>Ioseph the Counseller</hi>; whom the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> stiles <hi>a good man, and a just, Luke</hi> 23.50. he would neither refuse to plead a just
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107263:8"/>
cause, (as they will do, when great ones are concerned in it) nor prefer one that is unjust: Because <hi>he that justifies the guilty,</hi> or refuseth to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Innocent in this case; transfers the guilt to himself.</p>
                  <p>Or if this <hi>wretch,</hi> finds it more for his profit; he will see an end of the Clyents money, before the Client shall see an end of his cause. He will delay the Hearing; untill he hath inriched himself, and beggered his Clyent: perswading him his Title is good, till his patrimony be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; And he hath spent more in seeking, then the thing is worth, Or the other shall get by the recovery. One asking, how he should have a Suit last him seven years? was answered, You may have <hi>a Suit in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> that will last you twenty years: Another delivered in a <hi>Petition</hi> to <hi>King Iames:</hi> I was four years compassing the <hi>World</hi> with <hi>Sir Francis Drake,</hi> and there was an end of that: I was three years with <hi>my Lord of Essex</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> Wars, and there was an end of that: I have had a Suit in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> this seventeen years, but I fear I shall never have an end of that.

                  <p>He that goes to Law, hath a <hi>Wolf</hi> by the eares: if he prosecute his Cause, he is consumed; if he surcease his Suit, he loseth all: what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? There are not a few procrastinating, or rather proterminating <hi>Attorneyes,</hi> and <hi>Advocates</hi>; that like him <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.28. will say unto a Clyent every day, <hi>come again to morrow</hi>: and yet procure his <hi>strife</hi> from <hi>Term</hi> to <hi>Term</hi>; when this <hi>Term</hi> he might procure his <hi>peace.</hi> Because he hath an action to his Clyents purse, as his adversary hath to his Land: That can spin one Suit, throughout three generations; and lengthen the threed of a mans cause; till he shall want weft. Or if he weave the Web to day, he can by craft like <hi>Penelope</hi> unweave it as much to morrow. Dealing with his Clyent, as some <hi>Chirurgions</hi> do with their <hi>patients</hi>: who will keep the <hi>wound raw,</hi> and open; that they may <hi>draw</hi> out of it the more <hi>money.</hi> So that often the <hi>recovery</hi> of a mans right by <hi>Law,</hi> is as dear; as if he had <hi>bought</hi> it by <hi>purchase.</hi>

As a <hi>Fox,</hi> which goeth lank into the <hi>Henroost</hi> at a little hole: when he hath well fed, is forced to <hi>disgorge</hi> himself before he can come forth again.

                           <p>WEre there no other ground of my writing, this were enough: I have a publick spirit, and love to do good offices; though I should purchase ill will for my pains. But the lively resemblance of my self, which I once saw in you, your making choyce (as I supposed) of those true riches, that being once had, can never be lost. And your offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my view those lines of a rare <hi>Author</hi> (which did not a little pleasure me) propound themselves to me, as a great ingagement. Besides my love too, and hopes of you formerly were not greater, then is now my fear. And possible it is, I may prove another <hi>Photion</hi> unto you, who when a friend of his would have cast himself away, suffered him not, saying; I was made thy friend to this purpose. So you have my Apology; or if you shall further ask why I take this pains? turn to <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. Heb. 3.13. and you have there both my answer and warrant.</p>
                           <p>You cannot think much, that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> should acquaint me (of all others) with what Monies you have long ought him; and how little conscience you make of paying thereof.</p>
                           <p>But that you should so use so good a Master; to whom also you were once bound by Oath (if you remember) moves wonder in me to astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p>To <hi>do unto others, as you would have others do unto you,</hi> is a point agreed upon by all, even <hi>infidels</hi> that expect not another life; nor once dream that they have immortal soules. And I need not ask any more, then that you would ask your own conscience, whether you would be so dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? But here what I shall speak to you from the mouth of <hi>God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I grant the case is common with <hi>Atheists,</hi> who believe not that there is a <hi>God,</hi> a <hi>Heaven,</hi> a <hi>Hell,</hi> a <hi>day of judgment:</hi> nor that <hi>every man shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to his deeds, be they good or evil.</hi> But that you should ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest your self to be such an one, makes me to cry out, <hi>O the depth!</hi>

                           <p>Good sir, bethink your self, for there is not a more infallible Character of a wicked man, in all the Book of <hi>God. The wicked borroweth, but payeth not again,</hi> Psal. 37.21. As for <hi>a good man, he breaks not his promise, though he be damnified by the performance,</hi> Psal. 15.4. You cannot be ignorant, that <hi>with what measure ye mete to others here, God will measure it to you again hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

Matth. 7.2. That the <hi>Law of God,</hi> under the penalty of his curse, <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to restore whatsoever hath been committed to you in trust,</hi> Levit. 6.2, 3. Numb. 5.6, 7, 8. Nor that <hi>there is a flying Roll, a winged curse for him that gets riches by robbery, and oppression: that shall</hi> not only <hi>pursue him,</hi> but even <hi>enter into his house, and consume it with the timber thereof, and the stones there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> Zach. 5.3, 4. of which I might heap up instances. As O the multitude of examples of those, that have miserably perished for their falshood, and perfidiousnesse, in betraying the trust that they have undertaken. And this you may boldly build upon; There is no fruit, but shame and death to be gathered from the forbidden Tree, whatsoever <hi>Satan</hi> may seem to promise.</p>
                           <p>Nor is it alwayes the lot of those, that care not how they get wealth, to become rich, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.11. For get men never so much, <hi>without Gods blessing,</hi> even <hi>all their getting of great wages, is but putting money into a bag with holes,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet Haggai</hi> speaks, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.6. much more, <hi>he that get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth riches, and not by right,</hi> Jer. 17.11. <hi>Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. It is in vain to rise early, and lye down late, and eat the bread of carefulnesse,</hi> Psal. 127.1, 2. <hi>'Tis onely the blessing of the Lord, that maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10.22. Yea, have not you found it so? I dare say, reckon from that very hour, wherein you first resolved to cozen, (if ever you so resolved) and you will find, that you never since prospered.</p>
                           <p>Or in case he that resolves to be evill, making no conscience how he comes by his riches, so he have them; have his hearts desire: his riches prove but the aggravations of his sin, and additions to judgment. For <hi>God</hi> doth not onely withdraw his blessing from, but even send his curse with the riches he bestowes; so that it becomes their bane. <hi>He gives it them in wrath, and for their hurt: as he did a King, and Quailes to the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>; for which see <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.13. &amp; 8.11, 12. I pray turn to the places, for I cannot stand to amplifie it.</p>
                           <p>Nor shall he alone fare the worse; for <hi>God</hi> hath threatned to <hi>bring plagues upon the Children, and childrens children of such an one; unto the fourth generation,</hi> Exod. 25. and more pa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ticularly, that <hi>they shall be vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, and beg their bread; so that none shall extend mercy, or favour unto them,</hi> Psal. 109.7. to 17. <hi>God</hi> will make those Children beggers, for whose sakes the Father hath made many beggers.</p>
                           <p>Nor is this all, in any degree: For <hi>there is no end of plagues to the wicked man,</hi> Prov. 24.20. Without paying, or restoring (so far as a man is able) there is no being saved: for as humility is the repentance of pride, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence of surfeit, almes of covetousnesse, love of malice: so onely resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, is the repentance of injustice. And he that dyes before restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, dyes in his sin; and he that dyes in his sin, cannot be saved. And indeed repentance, without restitution; is as if a Theef should take away your purse, ask your pardon, say hee's sorry for it; but keeps it still: in which case you would say, he did but mock you.</p>
                           <p>Now <hi>what shall it profit a man, to gain the whole world,</hi> if he gain Hell
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107263:10"/>
with it; <hi>and lose</hi> both Heaven, and <hi>his own soul,</hi> Matth. 16.26. What is it to flourish for a time, and perish for ever?</p>
                           <p>A man would think, that <hi>Achan</hi> paid dear enough for his goodly <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish garment,</hi> the <hi>two hundred shekels of silver,</hi> and his <hi>wedge of gold</hi> which he coveted, and took away: when <hi>He, his Sons, and Daughters, his Oxen, and Asses; his Sheep, and Tent; and all that he had, were stoned with stones, and burnt with fire</hi>: if that was all he suffered, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7.18. to 26. But to be cast into <hi>Hell,</hi> to lye for ever in a bed of quenchlesse <hi>flames,</hi> is a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter punishment. For the soul of all sufferings, is the sufferings of the soul; and in reason, if <hi>Dives</hi> be <hi>tormented in endlesse flames,</hi> for not giving his own goods to them that needed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.21, 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41, to 43. What shall become of him, that takes away other mens? If that <hi>servant in the Gospel, was bound to an everlasting prison,</hi> that onely challenged his own debt; <hi>for that he had no pity on his fellow, as his Master had pity on him</hi>: whither shall they be cast, that unjustly vex their Neighbours, quarrel for that which is none of theirs, and lay title to another mans propreity? If he <hi>shall have judgment without mercy, that shewes not mercy,</hi> Jam. 2.13. What shall become of subtraction, and Rapine, <hi>Psal.</hi> 109.11. Oh the madnesse of men! that cannot be hired to hold their finger for one minute, in the weak flame of a farthing <hi>Candle</hi>; knowing it so intolerable: and yet for trifles, will plunge themselves body and soul, into those endlesse and everlasting <hi>flames of hell</hi> fire.</p>
                           <p>If a <hi>King</hi> threatens a <hi>Malefactor</hi> to the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> to the <hi>Rack,</hi> to the <hi>wheel,</hi> his bones tremble, a terrible palsie runs through all his joynts: But let God threaten the unsufferable tortures of burning <hi>Topheth</hi>; we stand unmoved, undaunted. But <hi>be not deceived, God is not mocked,</hi> Gal. 6.7. <hi>And it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; who is a consuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12.29.</p>
                           <p>True, <hi>He that maketh gain, blesseth himself,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.3. Yea, if he can, (I mean the cunning <hi>Machevilian,</hi> whom the <hi>Devil</hi> and covetousnesse hath blinded) any way advantage himself, by anothers ruine; and do it politickly: how will he hug himself, and applaud his own wisdome! <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. to the end. But by his leave, he mistakes the greatest folly, for the greatest wisdome: For while he cozens other men of their Estates; <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> cozens him of his soul, see <hi>Iob</hi> 20.15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8, 10. And woful gain it is, that comes with the soules losse. And how can we think those men to have reasonable soules, that esteem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney above themselves! That prefer a little base pelf; before <hi>God,</hi> and their own <hi>salvation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Nor are there any such fooles, as these crafty knaves: For as <hi>Austine</hi> speaks; If the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> term <hi>that rich churl in the Gospel a fool,</hi> that only <hi>laid up his</hi> own <hi>Goods,</hi> Luk. 12.18, 20. find out a name for him that takes away other mens?</p>
                           <p>These things considered, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the curse of <hi>God</hi> here, both upon the party, and his posterity: and the eternal wrath of <hi>God</hi> hereafter; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107263:11"/>
with the folly and madnesse of preferring <hi>Earth,</hi> yea <hi>Hell,</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi>; time to <hi>eternity,</hi> the <hi>body</hi> before the <hi>soul</hi>; yea, the <hi>outward estate,</hi> before either <hi>soul</hi> or <hi>body</hi>) exempt your self out of the number of those fooles, as little <hi>Zacheus</hi> did: what you owe, pay it; if you have wronged any man of ought, restore it; though you part with a great part of your Estate. Yea, admit you shall leave your self a begger, do it: for (as you see) there is a necessity of it: Yea, there is wisdom, and gain in it; for when all is done, <hi>how to be saved is the best plot:</hi> And better it is to cast your evil gotten Goods over-boord, then make shipwrack of Faith, and a good Conscience, read <hi>Iob</hi> 20. from vers. 5. The <hi>Merchant</hi> will cast even his <hi>Bulloyn</hi> into the <hi>Sea,</hi> to save himself. And he that is troubled with an <hi>aking tooth,</hi> finds it the best way to pluck it quite out.</p>
                           <p>Here I might shew you, both from the Word, and a world of instances, that restoring and giving rather then sinning, is the way to grow rich; I mean in pecuniary riches, see <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.24 &amp; 28.27. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.29, 30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6, 9, 10, 11. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9. &amp; 27.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.13. to 16. &amp; 28.1. to 14. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6 25. to <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.9, 10. &amp; 37.26, 28. &amp; 112.3. &amp; 37.3, 4, 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.29, 30. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Chapters, Mal.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12.</p>
                           <p>But I fear least addition in this case, should bring forth substraction: Yea, if this weary you not, its well; for I may conjecture, that time, and the deceitfulnesse of riches have wrought in you a change, since we were first acquainted. Wherefore before I go any further, a question would be asked.</p>
                           <p>Doth Covetousnesse reign in you? Are you yet bewitcht with the love of money? Is your heart riveted to the Earth? Are you already insla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to this sin? Do you make Gold your God? and Commodity the stern of your Conscience. For if so, all labour hitherto is lost; and all that can more be said, will be to no purpose: Yea, it is to no more end to admonish you, then to knock at a deaf mans door, or a dead mans grave; and that for sundry reasons.</p>
                           <p>First, Because, as there is no colours so contrary, as white and black. No elements so disagreeing, as fire and water: so there is nothing so opposite to grace, and conversion, as covetousnesse. And as nothing so alienates a mans love from his vertuous Spouse, as his inordinate affection, to a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy strumpet: so nothing does so far separate, and dimiuish a mans love to <hi>God,</hi> and heavenly things: as our inordinate affection to the World, and earthly things. Yea, there is an absolute contrariety, and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility between the love of God, and the love of Money: <hi>Ye cannot serve</hi> God <hi>and Riches,</hi> Luk. 16.13. All those that doted upon <hi>Purchases,</hi> and <hi>Farmes,</hi> and <hi>Oxen; with one consent, made light of it, when they were bid to the Lords Supper,</hi> Luk. 14.16. to 21. The <hi>Gaderens,</hi> that so highly prised their <hi>Hogs</hi>: would not admit <hi>Christ</hi> within their <hi>borders,</hi> Luk. 8.37. <hi>Iudas</hi> that was covetous and loved money, could not love his Master: and therefore sold him. When <hi>Demas began to imbrace this present world: he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107263:11"/>
soon forsook Paul,</hi> and his soul-saving Sermons, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                           <p>If a mans affections be downward, his hope and inheritance cannot be above. And they that expect no life after this, will make as much of this as they can.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, If a covetous man do repent, he must restore what he hath wrongfully gotten, which perhaps may amount to half, or it may be three parts of his Estate at a clap: which to him is as hard, and harsh an injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as that of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Sacrifice thy Son, thine onely Son Isaac.</hi> Or as that of <hi>our Saviours to the young man,</hi> Luk. 18.22. <hi>Sell all that ever thou hast, and distribute unto the poor:</hi> And is there any hope of his yeelding? No, <hi>Covetousnesse is idolatry,</hi> Ephes. 5.5. Col. 3.5.</p>
                           <p>And Gold is the covetous mans God: and will he part with his God, a certainty for an uncertainty? No. A godly man, is content to be poor in outward things, because his purchase is all inward: but nothing except the assurance of heavenly things, can make us willing to part with earthly things. Neither can he contemn this life, that knowes not the other: and so long as he <hi>keeps the weapon</hi> (evil gotten goods) <hi>in his wound,</hi> and resolves <hi>not to pluck it out</hi> by restoring: how is it possible he should ever be cured? Whence it is that we shall sooner hear of an hundred <hi>Malefactors</hi> contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the <hi>Gallowes</hi>; then of one <hi>covetous Mizers</hi> in his <hi>bed.</hi> To other sins, <hi>Satan</hi> tempts a man often: but covetousnesse is a <hi>fine,</hi> and <hi>recovery</hi> upon the <hi>purchase.</hi> Then he is sure of him; as when a <hi>Iaylor</hi> hath lockt up his <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner</hi> safe in a <hi>Dungeon,</hi> he may go play.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Covetous men, are blind to all dangers; deaf to all good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions: they are besotted with the love of money, as Birds are with their bane. Yea they resolve against their own conversion: The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees who were covetous: shut their eyes, stopt their ears, and barrocadoed their hearts</hi> against all our <hi>Saviour</hi> did, or said. Yea, they <hi>scoft at his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</hi> And of all sorts of sinners, that <hi>Christ</hi> preached unto: he was never scorned nor mockt but by them; <hi>when he preached against Covetousnesse,</hi> Luk. 16.14. And well may rich worldlings, scoffe at <hi>Christs</hi> poor <hi>Ministers</hi>: when they think themselves as much wiser, as they are richer. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, the <hi>cunning Polititian</hi> is wiser then his <hi>Pastor</hi>; or indeed any of his <hi>plain dealing Neighbours</hi>; by five hundred, if not by five thousand pounds.</p>
                           <p>These things considered, no wonder that our <hi>Saviour</hi> expresly affirmeth, that <hi>it is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man</hi> (that is, a covetous rich man) <hi>to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Luk. 18. 25. and the <hi>Apostle, That no covetous man can look for any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ, and of God,</hi> Ephes. 5.5. 1 Cor. 6.9, 10.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Hence it is, that in all the Word of <hi>God,</hi> we read <hi>not</hi> of <hi>one</hi> that was <hi>covetous, but Hypocrites</hi>: as <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Nabal,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the <hi>rich Fool</hi>
                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> For though <hi>Zacheus</hi> (before he met with <hi>Christ</hi>) knew nothing but to scrape: yet so soon as <hi>Christ</hi> had changed his heart, all his mind was set upon restoring, and giving, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.8. which also was a miracle, like his curing of him that was <hi>sick of the dead Palsie,</hi> Matth. 9.2.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107263:12"/>
to 7. And <hi>Christ</hi> did some miracles which none of his <hi>Apostles</hi> were able to do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.16.</p>
                           <p>And indeed, it is a sin so damnable, and inconsistent with grace: that of all sins, the <hi>children of God</hi> have <hi>cleared themselves from Covetousnesse,</hi> when they would approve their integrity before <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> Thus did <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.3. and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Chap. 15.10. and <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20.33. and <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 31.24, 28. and <hi>Agar,</hi> Prov. 30.8. and <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 4.6, 7. and <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.5, 9. and <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and in fine all that fear <hi>God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30, 31, 32. Their expressions are very remarkable: but I may not stand to repeat them.</p>
                           <p>We find many acts of deception in the <hi>Saints</hi> infirmity in those acts: But covetousnesse, that idolatrous sin we find not. Once <hi>Noah</hi> was drunk with wine, never drunk with the <hi>World. Lot</hi> was twice incestuous, never covetous. <hi>Peter</hi> denyed his Master thrice; it was not the love of the World, but rather the fear of the World that brought him to it: for he had denyed the World, before he denyed his Master. Once <hi>David</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the flesh, never with the World. Grace may stand with some transient acts of naughtinesse, but never with covetousnesse: those were acts, avarice is an habite.</p>
                           <p>Covetousnesse is flat idolatry, which makes it out of measure sinful, and more hainous then any other sin, as appears, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Iob</hi> 31.24, 28. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. Fornication is a foul sin; but nothing to this: that pollutes the body, but covetousnesse defileth the soul: and the like of other sins. Yea, it is such a sordid, and damnable sin; that it ought <hi>not once to be named among Christians,</hi> but with detestation, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.3. Nor ought covetous persons to be admitted into Christian society, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, From hence it is; that the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> all the <hi>Sermons</hi> men hear; yea, the <hi>checks</hi> of their own <hi>consciences,</hi> and the <hi>motions of</hi> Gods <hi>Spirit, judgments, mercies,</hi> and what else can be named, prove altogether <hi>ineffectual.</hi> And that there is so small a part of the world, scarce one of an hundred, that runs not a whoring after this Idol: and is not in too great a degree covetous. That <hi>from the least, even unto the greatest, every one is given unto covetousnesse, and to deal falsly,</hi> Jer. 6.13 &amp; 8.10. (For I may speak it with fear and trembling) where shall we find a just <hi>Cato, Rom.</hi> 13.7. Where can we meet with a sincere single hearted <hi>Nathaniel, in whose spirit there is no guile,</hi> Joh. 1.47. where with a <hi>Iob, an upright and just man,</hi> Job 1.1. Where with a <hi>Samuel,</hi> that can be acquitted by himself in private, by others in publick, by <hi>God</hi> in both, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3. where with a <hi>Paul,</hi> that can say, <hi>I have coveted no mans silver nor gold,</hi> Acts 20.33. &amp; 24.16. where with one that <hi>does unto all others, as he would have others do unto him,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> requires, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12.

good man. For as the <hi>Touch-stone tryes Gold,</hi> so Gold tryes men: and there is little or no danger of that soul, which will not bite at a golden hook.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ministers</hi> wonder that their <hi>Sermons</hi> take no better; That among so many <hi>Arrowes, none</hi> should <hi>hit the mark:</hi> but <hi>God</hi> tells us the reason, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>They sit before thee, and hear thy words: but their heart goes after their covetousnesse,</hi> vers. 31. O this golden Devil, this <hi>Diana</hi> hath a world of worshippers: For how to gain, is every mans dream from sun to sun, so long as they have one foot out of the grave. Yea, it destroyes more soules, then all other sins put together, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> intimates, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. But were men so wise, as they think themselves: Yea, did they but truly love themselves, and covet to be rich indeed, and not in conceit onely: they would both know and believe, that <hi>better is a little with righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, then great Revenues without equity,</hi> Prov. 16.8. And (to omit all that hath been formerly said) that ill gotten goods, lye upon the conscience; as raw meat upon a sick stomack; which will never let a man be well, untill he hath cast it up again by restitution. That sin armes a man against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and our peace ever ends with our innocency: That guilt occasions the conscience, many a secret wring; and gives the heart many a sore lash. Or if <hi>Satan</hi> finds it advantagious, to lull us asleep for a time; yet when <hi>death besiegeth the body, he will</hi> not fail to <hi>beleaguer the soul</hi>: and that then there will be <hi>more ease in a nest of Hornets,</hi> then under the <hi>sting</hi> of such a <hi>tormenting conscience.</hi> And certainly, did you know what a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and <hi>the peace of God which passeth all understanding</hi> is; you would think it more worth, then all the worlds wealth, multiplyed as many times, as there be <hi>sands on the Sea shore,</hi> that any thing, that every thing were too small a price for it. That things themselves, are in the invisible world: in the world visible, but their shadowes onely. And that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever wicked men enjoy, it is but as in a dream: that their plenty is but like <hi>a drop of pleasure</hi>; before a <hi>river of sorrow,</hi> and displeasure: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the godly feel, but as <hi>a drop of misery,</hi> before <hi>a river of mercy and glory.</hi> And lastly, That shallow honesty will prove more profitable in the end, then the profound quicksands of craft and policy.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore <hi>let your conversation be without covetousnesse, and be content with that you have</hi> (I mean remaining, after you have faithfully, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially given to every man his own.) <hi>For God hath promised, never to leave nor forsake you,</hi> if you will relye upon him, in the use of lawful means onely, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. And (with which I will conclude,) <hi>bethink your self now</hi> I beseech you, rather then when <hi>it will be too late</hi>; when the <hi>Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> is takn up, and when <hi>it will vex every vein of your heart; that you had no more care of your soul.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. 13.</head>
                  <p>IN the former part I have shewn, how the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> hath been <hi>robbed, defrauded,</hi> and <hi>abused</hi> by <hi>Monopolists, Ingrossers, Lawyers,</hi> and all kindes of corrupt <hi>Officers:</hi> and how the <hi>Supream Magistrate,</hi> hath been the sole cause of all. Whereby they have <hi>gulled</hi> and <hi>cheated</hi> the <hi>People</hi> without controule, or once being ashamed of it. I have likewise declared, what every of them in their several places ought to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>suffer,</hi> and be served for their baseness. Which was as much, as I could at first afford <hi>in forma pauperis.</hi> And now finding that it hath bin as <hi>acceptable</hi> to the <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> as <hi>distastful</hi> to the <hi>galled</hi> and <hi>guilty:</hi> (nor did I ever expect by carrying my <hi>saddle</hi> to shame my <hi>horse</hi>) I am willing at the same rate, to add the like scantling about <hi>corrupt Iudges:</hi> and to hint a way, how this <hi>Nation</hi> may become more <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>flourishing</hi> then ever. The <hi>former Part</hi> conteined twelve Chapters, the thirteenth begins and goes on thus.</p>
                  <p>Nor would <hi>Delinquent Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> be dispens'd withall: but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punished according to their several demerits. His <hi>Highness</hi> should do well to serve them, as <hi>Combyses</hi> served <hi>Sisamnes</hi> a <hi>corrupt Iudge:</hi> who caused his <hi>skin</hi> to be <hi>flayed off,</hi> (though his very friend) and <hi>nailed over the Iudgement-Seat</hi>; for example to those that should succeed in his place. And this would make others afraid, and that <hi>fear</hi> would keep them <hi>honest.</hi> Which neither the <hi>Oath</hi> they take, nor their <hi>consciences</hi> will do. For every <hi>Iudge</hi> as he hath a conscience, so he is <hi>sworn</hi> to judg uprightly, to <hi>take no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107263:14"/>
bribe,</hi> &amp;c. O that this <hi>conscience</hi> might ever give the <hi>Iudgement!</hi> But wo is me, how often are the <hi>Laws altered, misconstrued,</hi> interpreted <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi>; made as a Nose of wax; A Cause good to day, bad to morrow; yet still the same case; His opinion firm, yet sentence prolonged, changed, reversed, as the <hi>Iudge</hi> is made by <hi>friends, bribed,</hi> or otherwise <hi>stands affected.</hi> As O the <hi>wicked hearts,</hi> and <hi>wide consciences</hi> of some <hi>Iudges</hi>; as well as of <hi>Atturneys,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers:</hi> Who like <hi>Burs</hi> hang together, and like <hi>Andirons,</hi> hold up their <hi>Clients,</hi> till they <hi>burn each other</hi> to Ashes. They receive warmth by these, these by them their destruction. They are <hi>Bawds</hi> that live by other mens loss: And become rich by making others poor; whose felicity is in bringing others to misery, <hi>and making merchandize of the poor.</hi> These be <hi>Gowned Vultures, Harpies, Devils</hi> in the shape of <hi>men.</hi> These are far from being <hi>Peace-makers; to whom the Kingdom of Heaven is promised.</hi> And should they not be all served alike? and in the same manner before specified?</p>
                  <p>Nor can his <hi>Highness,</hi> as I conceive (I mean when other affairs will give leave, if he seeks the <hi>publick good,</hi> and not his own <hi>private gain:</hi> If he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not by receiving gifts, to sell his own liberty (which I do not in the least fear:) for those <hi>Governours</hi> that are plain-hearted themselves, are the bitterest enemies to deceit in others,) do less then compel them to restore, what they have unjustly gotten. Like <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> who caused <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made; that if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of what place, estate, or dignity whatsoever, <hi>Iudges, Earls, Friends,</hi> or <hi>Palatines</hi>; that had not dealt uprightly and justly, every man should be freely admitted to appeal to him; and upon proof they should make satisfaction, and further suffer as the case deserved. Yea, and I hope, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done this, he will discard them all; after the example of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who in the beginning of his Reign, <hi>discharged all them</hi> that were known to be vicious <hi>persons</hi> from their <hi>Offices,</hi> and forced them to make <hi>restitution</hi> of all that they had taken <hi>bribes</hi> of, or <hi>defrauded</hi>; and from thence-forth to live of their own proper labour. Nor would he ever keep in his <hi>Court,</hi> any ill disposed person; or suffer any though never so neer to him in blood, once found faulty, to escape unpunished; as <hi>Lampri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> delivers it. And this is of great concernment, for, <hi>take away the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked from the King,</hi> (or those that govern in chief) <hi>and his Throne shall be established in righteousness, Prov.</hi> 25.5. whereas let them remain, they will but prove like the <hi>Canaanites</hi> (not cast out by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) who <hi>became</hi> by his just judgement, for their neglect a <hi>snare, and destruction unto them; a whip on their sides, and a thorn in their eyes,</hi> Judg. 2.3. Joshua 23.13.</p>
                  <p>And full well they deserve it, for they ought to be <hi>indicted,</hi> not onely for <hi>Bribery,</hi> but for <hi>Perjury</hi> also. As most basely perjured they are; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things in their Oath, when they are made <hi>Iudges,</hi> one is,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107263:14"/>
that they shall <hi>take no bribes,</hi> or <hi>gifts.</hi> Which Oath, if they had the like care to keep, would cause them to imitate Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi>; who, when two great <hi>silver Flaggons</hi> were sent him by a Knight, that had a <hi>Suit</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending in his <hi>Court</hi> (though gilded with the specious pretence of gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) sent them back again, filled with his best Wine: saying, <hi>If your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster liketh it, let him send for more.</hi> And when his Lady at another time, offered him a great <hi>bribe,</hi> in behalf of a Suppliant, he turned away with these words; <hi>Gentle</hi> Eve, <hi>I will none of your Apple.</hi> It will be long enough, e're you hear the like of these <hi>Cormorants</hi> I am speaking of; whom I may liken to that <hi>Lord Chief Baron,</hi> who when one offered him fourscore <hi>Pieces,</hi> protesting, That no living soul should know it, answered; Make it up <hi>an hundred,</hi> and then let all the <hi>Town</hi> know of it.</p>
                  <p>Yea, this would also keep them from such <hi>vast estates</hi> as usually they leave behinde them: We read of Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> that having been of the <hi>Kings Counsel,</hi> and gone through many <hi>Offices,</hi> besides his <hi>Lord Chancellorship</hi> for almost twenty yeers together: after his debts were paid, he had not (his <hi>Chain</hi> excepted) left, the worth of <hi>an hundred pounds</hi> in moveables; and his Land before his Mother-in-law died (who survived him many yeers) did not amount to above fifty pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> Nor was he ever a prodigal spender.</p>

                  <head>CHAP, 14.</head>
                  <p>THese being cast out, provision would be made (if I may be worthy to advise) that none come in their places, but such as <hi>fear God, hate covetousness, love godliness, and deal uprightly. Alexander Severus, Adrian,</hi> and other <hi>Emperours of Rome,</hi> would call to their <hi>Counsel,</hi> and put in places of <hi>Iudicature</hi> not their Favourites; but men learned, grave, experienced, of good conscience and known integrity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelianus</hi> the Emperour, was so fearful of placing an unworthy man in the Seat of <hi>Iudicature,</hi> that he never admitted any to the dignity of <hi>Senator,</hi> but such as none could justly except against, and then with the consent of the whole <hi>Senate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then that they may continue so, and discharge the trust they are put in; <hi>His Highness</hi> may please to follow the example of these ensuing presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: (I am bold, though much unworthy to advize) <hi>Antiochus</hi> had that care, to have <hi>justice administred,</hi> that he writ to all the <hi>Cities</hi> in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that they should not execute any thing he commanded, if it were contrary to Law. And the <hi>Emperonr Iustinian,</hi> commanded the <hi>Lawyers</hi> to <hi>swear</hi>; they should not plead in an evil or unjust cause. That <hi>Law,</hi> which was made in the ninth <hi>Parliament of</hi> James <hi>the First, King of Scotland</hi>; did enjoyn all <hi>Counsellours</hi> and <hi>Advocates,</hi> before they <hi>pleaded</hi> any temporal cause; to take oath and swear, that they thought the <hi>Cause</hi> to be <hi>good</hi> they <hi>pleaded. Antoninus,</hi> never sent any <hi>Praetor</hi> or other <hi>Officer of State,</hi> to <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> any <hi>Province,</hi> but who were free from <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>covetousness.</hi> And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107263:15"/>
withall caused them first, to give up an <hi>Inventory of their own proper goods</hi>; to the end, that when their charge was finished, the increase of their wealth should be considered: telling them, that he sent them to <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister justice,</hi> and not by fraud to <hi>rob his people.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi>; made all <hi>Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Govenours of Provinces</hi> at their entring upon their charg, to <hi>swear</hi> that they had not <hi>given,</hi> nor <hi>promised</hi> any thing to procure their <hi>places.</hi> And also that they would take nothing, but their <hi>just fee:</hi> And if it were proved that they had taken any thing (it being lawful for every man to accuse them) they should <hi>pay four times as much</hi>; besides the infamy of their <hi>Perjury.</hi> And lastly, <hi>Moses,</hi> (who is a president beyond all exceptions) charged the <hi>Iudges</hi> to <hi>hear all Controversies between their Brethren, and to judge righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously between every man and his Brother, and also the stranger that was with them.</hi> Further charging them, that they should <hi>have no respect of persons in judgement; but hear the small as well as the great, not fearing the fac<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.16, 17. Briefly, let not sin be connived at, but see that <hi>justice be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted impartially</hi>; for <hi>good Laws without execution,</hi> are like the <hi>Picture of George on horsback</hi>; with his hand alwayes up, but never striking. Let no mans greatness protect him; It is the impartial execution of noble Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, that wins credit to Government. And the want of it cuts the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of any <hi>State.</hi> If there sins have made them base, let there be no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in their penalty: Or else the wickedness that is done by them, shal be reckoned unto you, the permitter, for your own; for Governours make themselves guilty of those sins they punish not. So that to be merciful to offenders in this case; is to be unmerciful to your self: yea, to the party offending, and the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> as I could easily demonstrate, could I stand upon it.</p>
                  <p>The best friends to a <hi>State,</hi> are the impartial <hi>Ministers of judgement:</hi> Nor do the prayers of them that sit still and do nothing: so much pacifie <hi>Gods</hi> wrath against us: as their just retribution, be the delinquent never so mighty. <hi>Obedience is better then sacrifice,</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Saul,</hi> for spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of King <hi>Agag.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Prophet</hi> compares that pity and mercie of his; to <hi>witchcraft and idolatry.</hi> And tells him that for his so doing, <hi>God had cast him off from being King,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22, 23. So that the summe of all is, Let them that sit at the <hi>Helm</hi> discharge their parts; and all will soon be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Let them that <hi>govern in chief be men of courage, fearing God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting covetousness, Exod.</hi> 18.21. <hi>A King by judgement, maintaineth the Countrey: bnt a man receiving gifts, destroyeth it.</hi> Prou. 29.4.</p>
                  <p>And now, blessed be <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Highness</hi> hath leave and opportunity to redress all: let our earnest and incessant prayers be, that he may well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the same; to Gods glory, the <hi>Nations</hi> good, and his own eternal renown and comfort: that so his Government may be found like the reign

                  <p>Now the way for his <hi>Highness</hi> to effect it, will be, not to imitate our former <hi>Governours,</hi> who measured their <hi>right</hi> by their <hi>power</hi>; and that would therefore <hi>do injury,</hi> because they <hi>could do it.</hi> Yea, if I may be so bold, were they not <hi>Heads</hi> under which <hi>the whole body groaned?</hi> and most of the <hi>members</hi> were <hi>ill affected.</hi> Did they not make their <hi>greatness?</hi> a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to <hi>sin,</hi> and a <hi>Protection</hi> against the <hi>arrest of judgement?</hi> Did they not think, that because they were <hi>great on earth</hi>; they might be <hi>bold with heaven?</hi> Did they not make it lawful to prophane the <hi>Lords Day?</hi> and justle out <hi>Gods honour</hi> (which should be more deer to Princes then their Crowns and lives) with <hi>their own?</hi> and chink to bear off the judgements of <hi>God,</hi> by vertue of their <hi>high places?</hi> Was not <hi>vice coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, aud vertue discouraged?</hi> until <hi>God</hi> resisted their pride, and made them to know; that be they never so great, even <hi>Kings, Monarchs, Emperours</hi>; though they are gods among men, and many made gods of them; yet they are but men with <hi>God:</hi> who is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Psal.</hi> 82.6, 7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.16.

                  <p>Do nothing of moment without <hi>counsel,</hi> for <hi>without it purposes are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed: but in the multitude of Counsellours there is stedfastness, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> 15.22. and let them be such <hi>Counsellours,</hi> as will <hi>counsel</hi> you for the <hi>peoples good,</hi> as well as <hi>your own,</hi> should you be never so unwilling to hear it.

Yea, <hi>Alexander's Flatterers,</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him, that he was a <hi>God.

And indeed <hi>dead men are the best Counsellors: Books</hi> will <hi>speak,</hi> when <hi>Counsellors blanch,</hi> as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath well noted.

                  <p>In the last place, as your <hi>Highness</hi> would have <hi>Christ</hi> to maintain and continue, bless and prosper you in all your undertakings, as hitherto he hath, even to the astonishment of all both <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>enemies:</hi> so let it be your principal care, to maintain the purity of his <hi>worship,</hi> and the true <hi>Religion</hi>; together with a <hi>godly, able, orthodox Ministery:</hi> without which the former cannot possibly subsist.

                  <p>Proceed therefore, thrice <hi>Noble Sir,</hi> until you have compleated a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Reformation,</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> Many <hi>high Cedars,</hi> and <hi>huge Mountains</hi> have bin thrown down, &amp; removed to level the way; sundry <hi>Bulwarks</hi> and <hi>Fortifications</hi> built up, to shelter and defend the friends of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> It will be to your eternal praise and comfort; if you both erect and finish the whole <hi>Fabrick.</hi> This is the way, and the only way to make you truly happy and comfortable; to make your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement a blessing to you, and the Nations; and to establish your <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>posterity</hi>: when your conscience shall be able to testifie, that out of a <hi>publicke spirit,</hi> and for the love you bear to <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>; you can make your self a servant unto all that need your aid.</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the contrary, if you shall out of any private, or self-ends, or interest; neglect or hinder this great work of the <hi>Lord,</hi> whereunto he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107263:18"/>
hath called you: if you should not <hi>hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to do his Commandements:</hi> your greatness will yield your <hi>Highness</hi> but a little solace.</p>
                  <p>As what will all your Honour and Greatness do you good? I need not tell you, how the ods that is between the <hi>high</hi> and <hi>low, rich</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> in respect of true happiness is such; that the wise and good have never desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>dignity</hi> barely for it self; but even sought to shun, and avoid <hi>great Places</hi>; except it hath been more to <hi>do good,</hi> then to <hi>grow rich,</hi> or <hi>great</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>Good men that have clarified understandings; have many solid and weighty reasons, to disswade them from great <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>high places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First (not to nominate what hath been already said in the former divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) in regard of the great <hi>cares,</hi> and <hi>pains,</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> and <hi>dangers,</hi> which usually they are subject unto, and attended withall: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the peoples <hi>envy, malice,</hi> and <hi>evil speaking,</hi> deal they never so <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>uprightly.</hi> We read that when <hi>Isocrates</hi> was demanded, if he would be a <hi>King</hi>; his answer was he would not: and being asked wherefore, he said, If <hi>I judge rightly,</hi> I cannot eschew hatred, and evil speaking on the one side; and again, if <hi>I judge wrongfully,</hi> I can no less escape it on the other: yea, I cannot eschue the pain of eternall <hi>damnation</hi>; Wherefore it shall better content me, to remain as I am. But this of mens evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital, and hating them; is least to be stood upon.</p>
                  <p>For to speak really and impartially, what is the <hi>Iustice,</hi> the <hi>Iudge,</hi> yea, the <hi>King</hi> himself? but a <hi>great servant to the Common-wealth</hi>: (as <hi>Statesmen</hi> are wont to call them.) Yea, <hi>Antiochus</hi> thus told his son <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> that <hi>Kingly rule,</hi> was but <hi>noble slavery.</hi> Whence good <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> spake it openly in the <hi>Parliament House,:</hi> that she had rather be a <hi>Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid</hi> then a <hi>Queen,</hi> were it not more for her <hi>Subjects</hi> sake, then her own. Whence <hi>Ptolomy</hi> seeing certain <hi>Fishers,</hi> sporting themselves upon the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore</hi>; wished he were like on of them; adding moreover that <hi>Monarchies</hi> are full of <hi>cares, fears, mistrusts,</hi> and <hi>disguised miseries.</hi> Which also <hi>Charls</hi> the Fourth and Fifth <hi>Emperors</hi> were wont to alledge, even desiring to lead a private life. And <hi>Seleucus</hi> before them did the like; adding, that if he should cast his <hi>Crown</hi> into the <hi>high way,</hi> there would be none found, that would take it up, knowing the <hi>cares, charges and griefs,</hi> that ever did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it. And <hi>Pope Adrian</hi> said, he conceived, no estate so miserable, nor dangerous as his own: and that he never enjoyed a better, nor more pleasant time; then when he was but a simple <hi>Monk. Trajan</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, wrote unto the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that having now tasted the cares and pains which the <hi>Imperial State</hi> brought with it: he did a thousand times repent, that ever he took it upon him. I have read also of another <hi>Romane,</hi> (whose name hath slipt my memory) that long aspiring to be <hi>Emperour</hi>; he was not so forward formerly to have it; as now feeling the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107263:19"/>
burthen, he was willing to cast it off; even bemoaning himself, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, how heavy and burthensome he had found it. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, after a long Government at his pleasure, in the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> (upon what consideration himself knew best, and <hi>Statesmen</hi> may easily guess at) is reported to have confest to his friends, who came to visit him: that if at the beginning, two wayes had been proposed before him; the one leading to the <hi>Tribunal of Authority,</hi> the other to his <hi>grave</hi>; if he could by inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration have foreknown the <hi>evils,</hi> the <hi>terrours,</hi> the <hi>calumnies,</hi> the <hi>envies,</hi> the <hi>contentions</hi> and the <hi>dangers,</hi> that men in such places must accustoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily meet with, that he would much rather with alacrity, and cheerfulness; have posted on to his <hi>Sepulchre</hi>; then to his <hi>greatness.</hi> And lastly, when some egged <hi>Dioclesian</hi> forward, to re-enter again into the <hi>Empire,</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them: that having once escaped the <hi>Plague,</hi> he would no more drink <hi>Poyson</hi>; and was contented to become a <hi>Gardiner.</hi> To couclude this reason, besides all this a <hi>Prince</hi> is alwayes in great danger, and fear of his <hi>life</hi> by <hi>treason:</hi> especially a good one, as the Life of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> may inform us. To omit many examples of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi>; as being well known', as also a cloud of examples out of other <hi>Histories:</hi> we read that in the <hi>Imperial Seat</hi>; in the space of <hi>an hundred yeers</hi> (in vvhich vvere <hi>threescore Emperours</hi>) there were but <hi>three</hi> that <hi>died in their beds</hi> by sickness; all the rest suffering <hi>violent deaths.</hi> So that how great and glorious soever, they may seem to men of the World; they are but in a sad condition. As suppose a man arrayed and apparelled in <hi>Tissue,</hi> or <hi>Cloth of gold</hi>; set in a <hi>Chair of State,</hi> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him a <hi>Table</hi> furnished, with all dainty delicates; his servants <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi>; his riches the very choicest and chiefest treasures and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the <hi>World:</hi> but withall that there were one standing by, with a <hi>naked sword</hi> to cut his throat; or a <hi>wilde Beast,</hi> ready to pull him in pieces: we cannot otherwise say, but his condition is rather to be <hi>pitied</hi> then <hi>envied.</hi> Now it fares not so with other men, the <hi>mean Cottage</hi> of a <hi>Swain</hi> stands in more safety, then the <hi>Palace</hi> of a <hi>Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the greatest <hi>Princes</hi> cannot so <hi>clip</hi> the <hi>wings</hi> of <hi>prosperity</hi> or <hi>victory</hi>; but she may <hi>flie away</hi> before they dream of it. <hi>Riches, honours, pleasures,</hi> are so transitory; that the same day hath seen the <hi>knee</hi> bowing to the <hi>head,</hi> and again the <hi>head</hi> stooping and doing reverence to the <hi>knee.</hi> Yea, as in <hi>fairest weather,</hi> a <hi>storm</hi> may suddenly <hi>arise:</hi> so one houre may change the <hi>greatest King,</hi> into the most <hi>miserable captive,</hi> as every age gives instance. For men are both more sensible of their <hi>present misery,</hi> by remembring their <hi>former happiness</hi>; and also more tender and delicate, and so less able to bear it. The memory of former happiness, makes the present misery more deplorable, which like <hi>dead Beer,</hi> is never more <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastful</hi> then after a <hi>Banquet of Sweet-meats.</hi> For <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to change his <hi>Seraglio</hi> for a <hi>Cage:</hi> for <hi>Valerian,</hi> to become a <hi>footstool</hi> to his <hi>proud soc:</hi>

are calamities able to sink a soul deep in sorrow. Yea commonly, their change is not more <hi>sudden,</hi> then it is <hi>doleful.</hi> Who but <hi>Adrianus, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the East,</hi> for many yeers? but at length he was set upon a <hi>scabbed Camel,</hi> with a <hi>Crown of Onions</hi> platted on his <hi>head</hi>; and in great mockery, carried in triumph thorough the <hi>City.</hi> And the like of <hi>Polycrates King</hi> of the <hi>Samians. Dionysius, Henry the Fourth</hi> that victorious <hi>Emperour, Geli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> that potent King of the <hi>Vandals, Adonibezeck,</hi> and many others: of whom I might muster up a multitude. And no fewer of them, whose life and happiness have ended together, as it fared with <hi>Pharaoh, Herod,</hi> and <hi>Belshazzer:</hi> who was sitting at a <hi>Feast</hi> merry, while on a sudden <hi>death</hi> came like a <hi>Voider,</hi> to <hi>take</hi> him <hi>away:</hi> with many the like, though that one example of <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Mordecay</hi> might serve in stead of all; to shew that as men honour and obey <hi>God</hi> in their places: so <hi>God</hi> will bless or curse them. We see how <hi>Haman,</hi> whose comand ere-while almost reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Heaven</hi>; was iustantly adjudged to the <hi>Gibbet:</hi> while <hi>Mordecay,</hi> who was condemned to the <hi>halter,</hi> was all of a sudden made second in the <hi>Kingdome. What stability</hi> is there then, in <hi>earthly greatness?</hi> when he who in the morning, all knees bowed unto; as more then a man: now hangs up like a despised <hi>vermine,</hi> fot a prey to the <hi>Ravens:</hi> and when he who this morning, was destined to the <hi>Gallows,</hi> now rules over <hi>Princes, Ester</hi> 6 and 7 Chapters.

and as we grow <hi>rich in temporals,</hi> we grow <hi>poor in spirituals.</hi> We use <hi>Gods</hi> blessings as <hi>Iehu</hi> did <hi>Iehorams messengers; David, Goliahs sword:</hi> we turn them against their owner and giver; and fight against <hi>Heaven</hi> with that <hi>health, wealth, honour, friends, means, mercies</hi>; that we received thence, and commonly so much the more <hi>proud, secure, wanton, scornful, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>; by how much the more we are <hi>enriched, advanced,</hi> and <hi>blessed.

They spend their dayes in wealth, therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes.

                  <p>It is the misery of the poor, to be neglected of men: it is the misery of the rich and great men of the World to neglect their <hi>God.

All the life of <hi>Solomon</hi> was delicious, resplendent, and contentful: and therefore we finde, that he did even sink in the midst of delights: but <hi>David</hi> among so many publick and private calamities and disasters, kept his <hi>head above water,</hi> and stood upright in his heart to <hi>God.</hi>

These men <hi>have their portion in this life,</hi> Psal. 17.14 and <hi>receive their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation here,</hi> Luke 6.24. all here, nothing hereafter.

                  <p>Fourthly, However <hi>death</hi> will dissolve them, and all their imaginary felicities into nothing: will cut thee wholly from them, and them from thee. And then as at a <hi>game at Chess,</hi> the <hi>highest now upon Board,</hi> may presently be <hi>lowest under board:</hi> so it may fare with the greatest of them <hi>here,</hi> and the like when they <hi>go hence.</hi> For although in the <hi>Theatre of this World,</hi> like <hi>Actors upon a Stage</hi>; the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> and the <hi>Clown</hi> have <hi>differing respect:</hi> yet after the <hi>play is done</hi>; it may be that he who was the <hi>Clown,</hi> is a <hi>better man,</hi> then the <hi>King.</hi> So it is with men after death. Nor will a <hi>poor Lazarus</hi> then, <hi>change places</hi> with a <hi>Rich Dives,</hi> nor an <hi>Eliah</hi> with <hi>Ahab.</hi> Yea, then <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> will wish that he had been <hi>Daniel, Haman</hi> will wish that he had been <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> will wish that he had been <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> And therefore if men were wise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and loved themselves as they think they are and do: they would not be so greedy after great places, as after grace, and <hi>Gods</hi> favour.</p>
                  <p>Nor is <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>greatness</hi> in it self a <hi>blessing</hi>; or to be desired. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement is not ever a sign of love, either to the <hi>man</hi> or the <hi>place.</hi> Yea, oft times instead of a <hi>blessing,</hi> it proves a <hi>judgement</hi>; both to the <hi>party,</hi> and to the <hi>people,</hi> as in the case of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, there are no men so <hi>miserable,</hi> as those that are <hi>great</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi> For as it is the manner of <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>cast down</hi> that he may <hi>raise up</hi>; to <hi>abase</hi> that he may <hi>exalt,</hi> as in the cases of <hi>Ioseph, Daniel,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> so contrarily, <hi>Satan raises up,</hi> that he may <hi>throw down,</hi> and intends nothing but our <hi>dejection,</hi> in our <hi>advancement,</hi> as in the cases of <hi>Haman, Absalom,</hi> and that <hi>Rich Fool</hi> in the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, as the <hi>errours of eminent persons,</hi> are <hi>eminent errours</hi>; and the <hi>more noble the person,</hi> the <hi>more notorious the corruption:</hi> so <hi>great offenders,</hi> shall meet with <hi>great punishments.</hi> And as their fault is, according to the condition of their place; so shall the nature and proportion of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution be: yea, and the more enjoyments they have had, or pleasure they have lived in here; <hi>so much more shall their torment</hi> and sorrow be hereafter, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.7.</p>
                  <p>Now these things being so, let them be but seriously considered, and then say, wherein the great gain lies, that should make men desire great

places? except it be to <hi>do good,</hi> and <hi>glorifie God</hi> in them. I cannot think of any thing therein, that will make good men <hi>gainers.</hi> But <hi>lose</hi> they are sure to do; I mean of their peace and spiritual enjoyments. For in my judgement, there is nothing in the world worth envy, save or besides the condition of a true <hi>Christian,</hi> and a retired life spent in <hi>study</hi> and <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, men are apt to think it a brave thing, to be alwayes conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with great ones: but sure I am, the <hi>priviledges</hi> can never counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the <hi>inconveniences.</hi> Whence <hi>Henry the Eighth</hi> professed, that he knew none in his <hi>Kingdom</hi> so happy; as that Subject who never was <hi>so low,</hi> as to be a <hi>Constable,</hi> nor <hi>so high,</hi> as to be a <hi>Iustice of the Peace</hi>; and the same was <hi>King Iames</hi> his judgement. And you know what that <hi>Heathen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> said, Whom the <hi>whole World</hi> could not <hi>content: Were I not</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>I would be</hi> Diogenes. What then will a godly consciencious <hi>Christian</hi> say? For the <hi>state of grace,</hi> is <hi>Heaven upon earth:</hi> and he that knowes the sweetness of <hi>Gods presence,</hi> will deem it more tolerable to be ever alone, then never able to be so. And indeed, that soul can never enjoy <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>it self,</hi> that is not sometimes <hi>retired,</hi> which is seldome the lot of men in high places; which made <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> (being led onely with the love of vertue) leave the <hi>Kingdome of Scythia,</hi> to his younger brother; betaking himself to the study of wisdom, and many others: but of this I have spoken enough upon another occasion, only I will add a word touching a studious life: which many (not for want of ignorance) take to be the most melancholy life of all others, though a <hi>Scholar</hi> findes such beneficial variety of joyes &amp; delights therein, as any other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling shall promise in vain. Yea, I dare say, this my very <hi>Work</hi> (which yet requires swetting of the brain) is more <hi>sweet</hi> to me, then most mens <hi>wages</hi> is to them, nor were the profits and places inconsiderable; that I have refused, the better to enjoy my self and <hi>Books.</hi> The which I tell you, to draw on others to taste of this <hi>Manna,</hi> who hitherto (like so many <hi>blinde Moles</hi>) have placed all their <hi>felicity</hi> &amp; <hi>delight,</hi> to dig in the earth, &amp; are so eager to get, and heap up silver, that they have no leasure to think of their <hi>souls:</hi> whom I the most pity, of any men alive.</p>

                  <p>I Seldome heare any man speak of <hi>Taxes</hi> or <hi>Governours</hi>; but I perceive in them a kinde of enmity against both: which to me is not a little strange, at least it makes me suspect, that they do not wisely consider of things and circumstances. Yea (if I shall speak my conscience, as it is informed from <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and <hi>common reason</hi>) when I consider how mad many men are about what they pay to their <hi>Governours:</hi> as parting with it like so much <hi>bloud</hi> from their <hi>hearts:</hi> which makes them so far as they dare, flie in the face of <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>grumble</hi> out no less then <hi>treason</hi>; though in such a deformed silence, <hi>as Witches raise their spirits,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> takes as done to himself; though they want eyes to see it.
