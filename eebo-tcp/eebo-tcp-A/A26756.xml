            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Baſton's Caſe, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Was a Clerk to the Commiſſioners for Sick and Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Exchanging Priſoners at War, about 4 Years; towards the end of which time I came to underſtand the following Miſcarriages; particularly that of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at War, which I happened to know after this manner: I being part Owner of a Veſſel imploy'd in Tranſporting Priſoners at War, between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Callais,</hi> the Capt. of the ſaid Veſſel was obſtructed in getting his money for the Freight of the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners, which by the general<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Or Agreement between the Two Courts for a General Exchange of Priſoners.</note> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was to be paid by the Commiſſary of that Port in <hi>France</hi> where they ſhould be landed. But at length the Capt. pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily demanding the ſaid money of the Commiſſary at <hi>Callais,</hi> according to the Cartel; the Commiſſary told him to this effect, That he own'd the Authority of the Cartel, but had never paid any money on that account ſince the War; and that he could not do it without Orders from <hi>Paris:</hi> for that <note n="(b)" place="bottom">A <hi>French</hi> Popiſh Merchant, that formerly liv'd in <hi>London,</hi> but fled to <hi>France</hi> at the Revolution, there being Warrants out againſt him.</note> Monſieur <hi>Joſeph Dulivier,</hi> was the Man concerned in that Affair, and had a part in all the Exchange Veſſels;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103268:4"/>
after which the ſaid Capt. going to <hi>France,</hi> did write to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> to <hi>Joſeph Dulivier,</hi> demanding by what power he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſtopt his money, contrary to the general Cartel; in anſwer to which the ſaid <hi>Joſeph Dulivier,</hi> and <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Alſo a Popiſh Merchant, who being obnoxious to the Government, was then newly baniſh'd by Order of the Queen and Council; but had a part in all the Tranſport Veſſels.</note> 
               <hi>Peter Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livier,</hi> his Couſin, wrote the ſaid Capt. ſeveral Letters. But ſoon after this the Capt. was turned out, for a pretended Crime; and afterwards the Ship was alſo ſhuffled out of the Service. But the Capt. giving me theſe Letters he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Mr. <hi>Dalivier,</hi> and after I had got thoſe tranſlated that were written in <hi>French</hi>; and ſeeing they contain'd mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of dangerous conſequence, to my great ſurprize, I forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with acquainted the Commiſſioners therewith; and on the 27th of <hi>October,</hi> 1693. I laid all the ſaid <hi>Dulivier</hi>'s Letters before them, at a full Board; as alſo a Paper of <hi>Queries</hi> relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Miſcarriages of the Tranſport Ships, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them to enquire into; Upon reading of which, together with the <hi>French</hi> Letters, ſome of them (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>) <note n="*" place="margin">From the Teeth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note> commended my Care and Zeal for the publick good, giving it their Opinion, That there was an unlawful Correſpondence held with the <hi>French</hi>; Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Dr. <hi>Welwood</hi> ſaid, <hi>Dulivier</hi> muſt be Lunatick when he writ them Letters; and Mr. <hi>Kirkby</hi> ſaid, That if <hi>Duli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier</hi> had a part in the Tranſport Ships, Mr. <hi>Churchil,</hi> whom they had intruſted in that Affair, was a great Villain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Commiſſioners did ſend for Mr. <hi>Churchil,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> whom <hi>Dulivier</hi> had ſaid in one of his Letters, was Partner with him; which ſaid <hi>Maſters</hi> had been turn'd out by the Queens Order, ſignified to the Commiſſioners by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103268:4"/>
the Secretary of State, for Actions againſt the Government, and had afterwards gone ſeveral Voyages to <hi>France, incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> in contempt of her Majeſties Order; and when Mr. <hi>Churchil</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> attended the Board, and had been in with the Commiſſioners a little time, I was alſo called in; and Dr. <hi>Wellwood</hi> taking up the Queries which related to Mr. <hi>Churchil,</hi> ask'd him to this Effect, Whether he was the <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> When any miſcarriage happen'd to be committed in the Tranſport Ships, Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> us'd to pretend to be Owner, that by a pretended Check from the Commiſſioners, he might remove all Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour from them, for correſponding with <hi>Dulivier</hi>; and at other times I have heard him ſay, He had not a Stick in any of the Ships, but was paid for ſoliciting.</note> True Owner of the Ships he ſolicited for, or whether he ſolicited for a gratuity? To which Mr. <hi>Churchil</hi> anſwered, He had as good ask him, Whether he had lain with another man's Wife? Upon which Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> took the Queries out of the Doctor's hand, and ſaid, They were not fair que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. And Mr. <hi>Kirkby</hi> ſaid, 'Twas no matter who were Owners, ſo the King's buſineſs was done; bidding me keep a Copy of what I had laid before them, hinting, that I might be fued at Law for Scandal. Some of the Commiſſioners alſo mov'd, that I might leave my <hi>French</hi> Letters in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of <note n="*" place="margin">Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to be burn'd.</note> Mr. <hi>Garrard,</hi> their Secretary; which I Refus'd to do; anſwering, That if they truſted me to keep the King's Papers, I thought they might eaſily truſt me to keep my own. Then they proceeded to examine Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> (who was preſent asking him, How he durſt go privately ſeveral Voyages to <hi>France,</hi> after he had been turned out by the Queens Order, for Actions againſt the Government? who did not only own the Fact, but very confidently anſwered, That he did the Nation no wrong, but good ſervice by it:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103268:5"/>
And Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> (who was ſeated at the Board with the Commiſſioners) looking over the back of his Chair, told Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> Thar he went to <hi>France</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">What Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> denies here, he confeſs'd at the Admiralty; and to extenuate the Crime, pretended he ſent Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> to <hi>France</hi> upon ſecret Service, which was known to Mr. <hi>Secretary Trenchard:</hi> But when the Examination came before the Council, Secretary <hi>Trenchard</hi> ſtood up, and declar'd to this Effect, That he did not know Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> nor of his going; but found his Name had been made uſe of very unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly and ſcandalouſly</note> without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that if he was puniſh'd for it, he could not help it; and the Commiſſioners ſaid, they would lay his Crime before the Council (though I believe 'twas the leaſt of their Thoughts:) And Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> turning about, as if he was Angry, and asking Mr. <hi>Garrard,</hi> their preſent Secretary, how theſe matters came to paſs; Mr. <hi>Garrard</hi> Anſwer'd in a paſſion, that they muſt not lay the fault upon him, for ſome of them knew of <hi>Maſters</hi>'s going as well as he: This unexpected Anſwer drove the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to a full point, for they look'd one upon another, and made no Reply. But now the Tables are turn'd upon me, and I (it ſeems) am the chief offender; for Mr. <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> takes up the Diſeourſe, and tells the Commiſſioners, That the Cauſe of his being turn'd out was by a malicious Information, That I had carry'd to my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s Office; and Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> back'd him, and ſaid, He had Witneſs that wou'd ſwear it, and mention'd one Mr. <hi>Armſtrong</hi> in my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s Office (a Gentleman that I know not) upon which, ſome of the Commiſſioners were angry, and Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> ſaid, They would keep no Clerks that were Informers; I confeſs I was ſurpris'd at this ſhamming Accuſation, and offer'd the Commiſſioners to make Oath, That neither directly, or indirectly, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carry'd any ſuch Information, or knew any thing of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103268:5"/>
the doing thereof, challenging Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> to prove it, if he was able; but this ſilenc'd all the other matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Correſpondence with Mr. <hi>Dulivier</hi>; for moſt of the Commiſſioners roſe from the Board in a great paſſion; and Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> being come out of the Office, into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-Yard,</hi> threatned me, That if I would not deſiſt, he would make me run my Country; and Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> thought fit to challenge me to meet him out of the Verge of the Court, and the Secretary Mr. <hi>Garrard</hi> bid me have a care what I did, for Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> was a Man of great Intereſt at Court: and I happening, upon this, to meet Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> coming down ſtairs from the Office; I acquainted him of the ill Treatment I had had from Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> who, walking away in haſt, very ſcornfully Anſwer'd, That he could not help me, if I would not rule my Tongue; So I finding much diſcouragement, and ſeeing the ſaid miſcarriages, and thoſe that acted in them, incourag'd by the Commiſſioners, I reſolv'd to lay down my Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make a diſcovery thereof; and accordingly, about the beginning of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1693/4, I acquainted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, at a full Board, That I deſigned to leave my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and deſir'd their Diſcharge, at which they ſeem'd extreamly ſtartled, and contrary to their former method of Threats, fell now to good words, uſeing all manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and Arguments with me to ſtay, telling me, I was only in a Paſſion, and deſired me to conſider of it till the next morning, when I would be in a better humour, which was all the Anſwer I could then get of them. But coming again the next day to the Boatd, and perſiſting in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to leave their Office, they all fell to make Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations each Man for himſelf, That he had not Cheated the King, and ask'd me, if I believed e'er a Man at that Board had Cheated the King? I told them it was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring

queſtion for me to anſwer while I was their Clerk; but if they would give me my Diſcharge, I would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that, or any other queſtion they ſhould ask me; at which Mr. <hi>Elder,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners, lifted up his hands, as it were, in a frighted poſture, and ſaid, O, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I was ever againſt that <note n="(a)" place="bottom">The ſame Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> before ſpoken of; and theſe words of Mr. <hi>Elder's,</hi> confirm the Truth of what their Secretary ſpoke, that ſome of the Commiſſioners know of <hi>Maſters</hi>'s going as well as he.</note> 
               <hi>Maſters</hi>'s going<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which words none of the Commiſſioners made any Anſwer. But I ſtill preſs'd for my diſcharge, and the Commiſſioners continued to offer more Arguments for me to ſtay; one of them declaring he would go an hundred Miles to ſerve me, ſaying, That if I would ſtay till my Father in Law came to Town, they would prevail with him to lay out a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Sum of Mony, and purchaſe me a Place, which I might hold by a Deputy, and yet continue in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> alſo ſaid, Mr. <hi>Baſton,</hi> ſuppoſe we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with all your demands, what then? To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That I could not continue in their Office; the Commiſſioners alſo ask'd me how I deſign'd to diſpoſe of my ſelf? and that if I would ſeek any Employment, and let them know what it was, they would go in a Body and Recommend me; telling me alſo, That they would never conſent to my leaving the Office, without the Approbation of my Father in Law, becauſe if it ſhould prove my Ruin, they believ'd my Father would blame them as acceſſory to it: But perceiving they would not give me my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, I acquainted them from that day forward, I was no more their Clerk; to which they anſwer'd, That ſince no perſwaſions would preval with me to ſtay, they could not help it; and that thay hop'd I was not going to bring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103268:6"/>
any Complaint againſt them, as Mr. <hi>Gibſon</hi> had formerly done: Theſe and ſeveral other Arguments of like nature the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded did make uſe of publickly at their Board to prevail with me to ſtay in their Office; and I have been a little more large in reciting theſe Diſcourſes, becauſe theſe Gentlemen were ſo ſhameleſs as to inſert in their Anſwer to my Complaint, which they gave in Writing under four of their Hands, to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Board, That they turn'd me out of their Office for Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour, hoping by the help of that monſtrous untruth to have blacken'd my Reputation, and extenuated their own miſcarriages.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, finding they would not give me my diſcharge, I left their Office in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1693/4, with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum of Mony due to me, for Travelling Charges and Sallary, which I am not paid to this day; and about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> following, did lay the miſcarriages of theſe Commiſſioners in Writing before the Secretary of State, which met with ſuddain diſpatch, being within three days after ſent to the Lords of the Admiralty with the King's Order thereupon, to examin into it, and make their Report to his Majeſty; whereupon their Lordſhips forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſummon'd the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded, with my ſelf, and ſeveral others concern'd, to attend their Honourable Board; and after the Examination was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their Lordſhips made a Report to His Majeſty, a Copy of which I obtain'd about <hi>April,</hi> 1694. by an Order of their Lordſhips, (the better to enable me to prove the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint a ſecond time before the Council) which Copy I have inſerted as followeth.</p>

Dr. <hi>Welwood</hi> acquainted the Board, That <hi>Maſters</hi> was Commander of the Veſſel bound for <hi>France</hi> in their Service; but the Board did not revoke their Order, and he went Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander that Voyage.</p>
                     <p>It further appear'd, That when Dr. <hi>Welwood</hi> complain'd to the Board, that <hi>Maſters</hi> had been two Voyages in the Ship to <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding he was diſcharg'd by their Order, and ask'd the Secretary, Mr. <hi>Garrard,</hi> how it came to paſs. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> anſwer'd in a paſſion, That ſome of the Commiſſioners knew of it as well as he.</p>

                     <p>And ſince this, Dr. <hi>Welwood</hi> has acquainted this Board by Letter, That Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> was Examin'd by him, in preſence of the reſt of the Commiſſioners, and voluntarily confeſs'd, That about <hi>October 1691.</hi> he came up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> near the Bridg, with a Lading of Wine in a Tranſport Ship, having Landed his Priſoners at <hi>Dover</hi> by the way, that the ſaid Ship and Lading was ſeiz'd upon by the Cuſtom-houſe Officers; and as he was told afterwards, were both made Prizes, or the Wine ſtav'd: That immediately after the ſeizing the Ship, <hi>Maſters</hi> was ſent <hi>Maſter of another Tranſport Ship</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> in which he has hitherto continued: and becauſe there was not a New Paſs in the Office, the Old Paſs for the former Ship was made uſe of, by changing the Name of the laſt Ship into that of the firſt: That <hi>Dulivier,</hi> before he went away, carry'd him to <hi>Mr. Churchill,</hi> and after they had been together a while alone, he was call'd in and employed by <hi>Churchil</hi> ever afterwards.</p>

he and I did deſpair of ever being call'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Accounts.

Not long after, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, I received an Order from the Commiſſioners of Accounts, requiring my attendance on them the third Inſtant, and I was alſo order'd to acquaint Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> that he ſhou'd likewiſe attend at the ſame time. According to this Order I did attend the Commiſſioners of Accounts at their Office in <hi>York</hi>-Buildings, where, after I had acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> was gone to Sea, they told me the Board had come to a Reſolution to examine my Complaint, and that if I was willing to juſtifie it, they would appoint a day for the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded, and I to attend: They alſo told me, that the Complaint conſiſting of Seven Articles, the firſt Three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which chiefly related to a Correſpondence with the <hi>French,</hi> did not properly lie before them; ſo that they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to begin at the Fourth Article: To which I anſwer'd, That the Fourth Article conſiſted chiefly of the Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Plymouth:</hi> to the Truth of which Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> had made Oath before them when the Complaint was firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and that his Name was written in the Margin, as the principle Witneſs thereto; and that <hi>I</hi> could ſay little to it, having never been at <hi>Plymouth</hi> in my Life. And <hi>I</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquainted them, That the Correſpondence with the <hi>French</hi> was the chief Reaſon <hi>I</hi> laid down my Employment in order to detect it, which <hi>I</hi> lookt upon as <hi>my duty</hi> to do; and that <hi>I</hi> conceiv'd, as their Honours were Members of Parliament, it might not be improper for their cognizance to lay before the Houſe of Commons at their next meeting; a Correſpondence with the <hi>Enemy</hi> being a matter that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103268:15"/>
ſo much concern'd the Safety of their Country: <hi>I</hi> alſo acquainted them that the Fourth Article had been twice ſufficiently prov'd already by Mr. <hi>Leckie,</hi> before the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty and Council, as would appear by each of their Reports, which I thought their Honours might receive as Evidence of the truth thereof, and that ſeeing they thought fit to reject the moſt material part of the Complaint, and the principal Evidence to the reſt being abſent; I prayed to be excus'd any further Attendance in regard there could be no full hearing, and that I had been much fatigued already, and pray'd now to have a little reſt, deſigning to lay all theſe matters before the King, at his Majeſty's arrival from <hi>Flanders.</hi>

in the behalf of Mr. <hi>Dickinſon,</hi> and that the Board was reſolv'd to hear what he could ſay to that matter; at which being ſurprized, I anſwer'd, that I thought he was not a proper Evidence, and laid down ſeveral reaſons for it, to the Effect following,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> himſelf ſtands accuſed as a Criminal in diſcharge of his Duty, while he was Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s Clerk, and his Name is mention'd as ſuch in the third Article of this Complaint; and it appears he is a Criminal, and has abuſed the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners by the third Article of the Lords of the Admiraltie's <note n="*" place="margin">A Copy of which I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Board.</note> Report; therefore to admit him a Witneſs upon Oath, againſt that Complaint in which he not only ſtands charged as a Criminal, but has been proved ſo, is to ſwear him in his own behalf, which I told their Honours I thought was contrary to Law.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That if their Honours ſhou'd believe what Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> was about to ſwear, they muſt of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence make Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> Perjured, which I thought wou'd appear to be very hard dealings with a Man that is abſent at Sea, who ſtaid ſo long in <hi>London</hi> waiting their Honours Commands, and who ſo fairly proved theſe very mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters twice before at the Admiralty and Council, where this Mr. <hi>Saarrack</hi> durſt not appear to confront him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> being accuſed (I conceiv'd) ought to come up and anſwer for himſelf; for ſeeing I was forc'd againſt my Will by their Honours Precept, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a matter I knew little of, I thought it was too much Favour for Mr. <hi>Dickinſon,</hi> who had been before proved a Criminal, to ſpare him the trouble, and ſuffer him thus to anſwer by Proxy to matters of ſuch moment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103268:16"/>To which the Chairman made anſwer to this Effect, That all theſe matters in the End ſhould be duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Board. But becauſe Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo long a Journey on purpoſe, they were <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Having from my unwillingneſs good grounds to believe I was not able to contradict him.</note> reſolved to hear what he could ſay. To which I replied, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt their Proceedings, believing it illegal, and that, if they thought fit, I would ſubmit my ſelf therein to the Opinion of the Attorney General. At which they were angry, ſaying, I arraigned the Juſtice of their Boord, and ſtood in Contempt of the Authority of their Board, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwered, That their Honours could not reaſonably blame me, if they conſidered what I had gone through already, and how much my Reputation lay at ſtake, for that the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I, could not be all in the right, but Puniſhment muſt of neceſſity be due to one ſide or the other. But notwithſtanding the Commiſſioners of Accounts would proceed to examine Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi>; and firſt he produc'd an Affidavit, ſworn by himſelf, which was read at the Board, the purport of which was to teſtifie how long he had ſerv'd under Mr. <hi>Dickinſon,</hi> and that he had manag'd all affairs for his Maſter, both relating to the Sick Wounded Seamen, and Priſoners at War; and that he believed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was acted by his Maſter, but he was privy to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Affidavit I ſuppoſe was produced to make whatever he ſhould ſwear, carry the greater face of truth, in reference to his knowledge of matters and things, and as a foundation whereon Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> was to build the following depoſition, the ſum and ſubſtance of which I ſhall relate as ſhort as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:103268:16"/>The Commiſſioners of Accounts having given Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> his Oath, they read the fourth Article of the Complaint; the firſt Particular of which contained theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Commiſſioners</hi>

               <hi>for their own private Intereſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at, and permit thoſe employ'd under them to wrong their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, appears by their paſſing by and ſtifling all Complaints made againſt Mr.</hi> Dickinſon, <hi>their Agent at</hi> Plymouth; <hi>all which have been laid before them ſeveral times: Firſt, his hard uſage to the</hi> French <hi>Priſoners, in allowing them only Two Pence</hi> per diem <hi>a man, for the ſpace of Fourteen Months, with a Loaf of Bread, which he gave them for a Penny, and had himſelf ſixteen of ſaid Penny Loaves for a Shilling; and upon Complaint made he afterwards allowed an Half Penny</hi> per <hi>Day more: That he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated an Half Penny</hi> per diem <hi>from each Priſoners Allowance, under pretence of finding them Water; which they are ſupplied with</hi> gratis <hi>at all other ports; neither did it cost him any thing here, he obliging one</hi> Pike <hi>a Victualler to ſupply them with Water for the liberty of ſelling them Ale. Yet the poor men had not a Pint of water a day</hi> per <hi>man; and thoſe that went not upon the water's firſt coming to the Priſon, had none at all, there being ſeveral Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners who periſh'd for want of water</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">The Seat of War being moſt to the Weſtward, caus'd great Numbers of <hi>French</hi> Priſoners to be brought into <hi>Plymouth</hi> more than other Ports, whoſe barbarous uſage was from time to time repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Commiſſioners, not only by the poor Priſoners themſelves, but alſo by Monſieur <hi>Delagnii,</hi> Intendant General of the Marine at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> in ſeveral Letters, ſetting forth the inhumane uſage the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners had from Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> and his Servants, in defrauding them of their Allowance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by reaſon whereof many of them died, with repeated Threats to uſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners with the like Cruelty, if it was not redreſs'd; which never being done by the Commiſſioners, but rather encouraged, was certainly the true Cauſe of all the miſery that the <hi>Engliſh Priſoners</hi> ſuffered in <hi>France,</hi> in which Hundreds periſhed: And theſe Letters of <hi>Monſieur Delagnii</hi>'s, I mov'd ſeveral times to have produc'd, but could never obtain the ſame.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:103268:17"/>Thus it appears Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> ſwore there was about three Farthings <hi>per diem</hi> deducted from the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners, whoſe whole allowance was but Four Pence each man a day, except Commiſſion'd Officers, whoſe Number was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconſiderable; but where any ſuch were taken (that could not handſomly be ſuffered to Run, or elſe Exchang'd for common Seamen) they were not kept to this miſerable Pittance; but on the contrary, permitted to Ride up and down the Countrey, under pretence of Recovery of their Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now comes Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> to counter-ſwear what was before ſworn by Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi>; and in order thereunto poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively depones to this Effect, That he was the perſon that conſtantly paid the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners their allowance, and that Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> never deducted above a Farthing a day from the Priſoners, which was for ſupplying them with Water and Straw.</p>
            <p>And the Chairman demanding of me, what I had to object againſt Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi>'s Oath, I anſwered, That tho I knew little of the Affairs of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> yet I was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at what he had ſworn; and therefore I pray'd their Honours to ſend for the Commiſſioners Letter-book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I would ſhew them the Entry of a Letter that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Sick and Wounded writ to Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> concerning a Complaint they received againſt him about abuſing the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners. And that the Commiſſioners in that Letter writ to <hi>Mr. Dickinſon</hi> thus: <hi>We hear you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct Three Farthings a day from the Priſoners: pray let us know how it comes to be</hi> ¾. <hi>We know you deducted ½ according to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103268:17"/>
former Direction.</hi> By which, and Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s Anſwer, I told their Honours they would ſurely find that Mr. <hi>Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack</hi> had not ſworn right. But the Chairman ſaid, 'twould put them out of their method; and that they would ſend for the Book to morrow. I anſwered, That I conceiv'd it would not hurt their method, to detect a man in a falſe Oath; the End of all methods in theſe Caſes, being to find out the Truth; and therefore I inſiſted ſeveral times, and pray'd, That in Juſtice to Mr. <hi>Leckie,</hi> who was abſent, the Book might be ſent for, and produc'd while the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for Sick and Wounded, and Mr. <hi>Sharrack,</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to prevent all Tricks in altering the Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe might be done before the morrow: At which one of the Commiſſioners of Accounts was pleas'd to ſay, That if I inſiſted to have the Book ſent for, 'twas his Opinion they ought to do it; notwithſtanding which I could not <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Tho Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> was to be diſcharg'd any further attendance that Night; and it would not have taken up above a quarter of an hour to have ſent for the Book, being no further than from <hi>York-Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to <hi>Scotland-Yard.</hi>
               </note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to the next part of Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi>'s Depoſition, I ſhall paſs to the following day when the Book was ſent for, and ſo relate what became of this part of his Oath.</p>
            <p>On the morrow the Commiſſioners for Sick and Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and my ſelf, being again before the Commiſſioners of Accounts, according to Order, they produc'd their Letter-Book; (But here 'tis to be noted Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, being diſcharg'd any further attendance the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) And the Letter that I mentioned being read, they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103268:18"/>
found in it the words before-mentioned, <hi>viz. We hear you deduct ¾ a day from the Priſoners: pray let us know how it comes to be ¾; we know you deducted ½ according to former direction.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded, ſtanding up, told the Chairman, he was under a little miſtake in reading that part of the Letter: for them Figures which he read for Three Farthings and an Half Penny, were not ſo, but Three Fourths of a Farthing and half a Farthing: At which it was demanded, how they made up their Accounts with ſuch odd Money. Very eaſily, May it pleaſe your honour, replied Mr. <hi>Addiſon.</hi> Then to trace the matter further, I mov'd that Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Letter might be produc'd, which he writ in anſwer to the Commiſſioner's Letter, which being read, <hi>Mr. Dickinſon</hi> ſaid in it in his own defence, That he never deducted but a Farthing a day from the Priſoners, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſee the Letter, I found the word Farthing was interlined, and the word under it blotted out; and urging to the Chairman that the Letter had been altered; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it could not be, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Dickinſon,</hi> that wrote the Letter, had not been in Town for ſeveral Months; to which I replied, that Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> his Clerk wrote the Body of the Letter, and was laſt night in Town to alter it; but that he was either infatuated, or in haſte when he did it, for he had not done it right, ſo as to bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny coherence with the Commiſſioner's Letter: With that Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> alledg'd, That Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s ſaying he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted but a farthing a day from the Priſoners was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what <hi>Mr. Sharrack</hi> had ſworn; but one of the Commiſſioners of Accounts was pleas'd to ſpeak to the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded in this manner, Gentlemen, here is no agreement between your Letter and <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s anſwer; for you write to <hi>Mr. Dickinſon</hi> to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103268:18"/>
know why he deducted three fourths of a Farthing from the Priſoners, and he writes you word in his anſwer, that he never deducted but a Farthing, which is four Fourths; ſo that this won't hang together at all, to which <hi>Mr. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon</hi> anſwer'd; may it pleaſe your Honour, we writ to <hi>Mr. Dickinſon</hi> to know why he deducted three farthings a day from the Priſoners, and he writes us word again in this Letter, that he never deducted but a Farthing, which is according to what <hi>Mr. Sharrack</hi> has ſworn. The ſame Gentlemen replied, But Sir, you ſaid juſt now it was three fourths of a Farthing. May it pleaſe your Honour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> I could not ſay ſo, there's no ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney goes in <hi>England,</hi> I beg your Honour not to miſtake me, I'm ſure 'tis all very right, God forbid we ſhould do an ill thing, may it pleaſe your Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay Sir, ſays he, either you or I are in a falſe Story, I'll refer it to the whole Board; I'll be judg'd by your own Brethren if you did not ſay juſt now, it was three fourths of a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Yes, ſays Mr. <note n="*" place="margin">One of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Sick and wounded</note> 
               <hi>Shepherd,</hi> Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> you did ſay 'twas three fourths of a Farthing, I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict you though I did think you were miſtaken. Well, ſays the Chairman, which is it three fourths of a Farthing, or three Farthings? It is three Farthings, may it pleaſe your Honour, ſays <hi>Mr. Addiſon.</hi> Why then, ſays the ſame Gentleman again, If you take it that way, there's ſtill no agreement between your Letter and <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, for you write to Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> to know why he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted three Farthings a Day from the Priſoners, and further you ſay, you know he deducted a half-penny ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former direction; and he writes you word in his Anſwer, that he never deducted but a Farthing. Now no Man in his Wits can ſuppoſe that <hi>Dickinſon</hi> deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſs than you all allow'd him to deduct. May it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103268:19"/>
pleaſe your Honour, ſays Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> we never allow'd him to deduct any thing; nay, ſays he, your own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Book is a Witneſs to the contrary, wherein you do not only approve of his deducting a half-penny a day, but quote your former Order for it, or elſe what do you mean by them words; we know you deducted a half-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a day, according to former Direction? at which Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> was quite gravell'd. And then I mov'd the Board to give the Commiſſioner's Secretary his Oath, to ſhew more plainly that the three fourths of a Farthing was only a prevaricating Evaſion of Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Crime; but they were pleas'd to anſwer there was no need of it; for the matter was plain enough, and they were very well ſatisfied how it ſtood. So they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd their Clerks to take a Copy of the Commiſſioner's, and <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s Letter, and now I ſhall humbly ſubmit it to better Judgment, Whether Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s Letter was not alter'd in reference to the Words Farthing, a Day, and alſo how true Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi>'s Oath has been in this part: But here follows more of the ſame ſtamp.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall go back to the day before, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi>'s depoſition. The Commiſſioners of Accounts having refus'd to ſend for the Letter-Book, as is before-mention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:103268:19"/>In oppoſition to to which, Mr. <hi>Sharrack,</hi> upon his Oath, poſitively affirm'd to the Effect following: <note n="(a)" place="bottom">A Very unchriſtian Act to encourage Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> to proceed upon his Oath, when what he had ſworn be fore ſinel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sir <hi>Cloudſly Shovell</hi> (ſays he) coming a Shoar one morning, the Seamen in the Hoſpital made complaint to him, that they had not full allowance, and that their Proviſions was not good, upon which Sir <hi>Cloudſley</hi> came to the Hoſpital, and order'd me to take ſome pieces of the Beef out of the Copper, which were found to be full Weight; with that Sir <hi>Cloudſley</hi> call'd for ſome Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaying he would taſte this Beef, of which there was ſuch Complaints, which he liked ſo well, that he eat the beſt part of two pieces, and blamed the men for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, telling them they were well uſed, and that the Beef was as good as any he had at his own Table. And Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> going to proceed, I interrupted, asking him, were they four Pound pieces that you ſwear Sir <hi>Cloudſley Shovell</hi> taſted of? He anſwer'd, yes; but the Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told me, I muſt not interrupt him and that he ſwore cautiouſly. Yes Gentlemen, replied I, he ſwears very cautiouſly, he ſwears Sir <hi>Cloudſley Shovell</hi> eat above four pound of Beef by way of a taſte; and after Mr. <hi>Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack</hi> had made ſeveral Speeches, that perhaps he might be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103268:20"/>
miſtaken in the quantity of Beef, and he was ſure there was all imaginable Care taken, and that 'twas malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Naſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Chairman ask'd me, what had I to object?</p>
            <p>I anſwer'd, That when this Particular was Examined before the Admiralty, Doctor <hi>Welwood</hi> acknowledged that he was the Commiſſioner that Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> mentions in the Complaint before whom the meat was weighed in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Hoſpital, that prov'd ſo much ſhort of Weight, and that ſeeing Doctor <hi>Welwood</hi> did not now attend with the reſt of the Commiſſioners, I prayed he might be ſent for Face to Face, with Mr. <hi>Sharrack,</hi> to be asked ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about this matter, the Chairman anſwer'd, that he was order'd to attend with the reſt of the Commiſſioners, but that he pretended ſome earneſt Buſineſs, and prayed their excuſe, ſo they would ſend for him to morrow. But I continued to pray their Honours to ſend for him Face to Faee with Mr. <hi>Sharrack,</hi> becauſe he was to be diſcharg'd any further Attendance that Night, otherwiſe their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours could not ſo eaſily diſcover the Truth, but I could not prevail, for the Chairman anſwer'd, that the next day would do as well, and that they would conſider of all theſe matters in the End. So now I muſt paſs to the next day (when Doctor <hi>VVelwood</hi> was preſent, and Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> gone) and give an account what became of this part of Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi>'s Depoſition.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103268:20"/>
Peices, he found upon weighing them, that none of them was <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Theſe Proceedings were ſo notorious, that <hi>Nicholas Sharrack</hi> was generally known in the Fleet to be the Man that cheated the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their Allowance in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Hoſpital; and when he was in <hi>London,</hi> has confeſſed he durſt not go to the <hi>Navy-Office</hi> by day-light for fear of being beaten, or kill'd by the Seamen: And I have ſeen a Letter to the Commiſſioners, under his own hand, wherein he gives them an Account of a Mutiny at <hi>Plymouth</hi> by the Seamen, and how they threatned to burn the Hoſpital; and that they aſſaulted his houſe, threatning to kill him; ſo that he was forc'd to withdraw into the Countrey; and all becauſe of theſe Cheats, which were never redreſs'd by the Commiſſioners, but his Maſter <hi>Dickinſon</hi> and he ſtill protected by them.</note> half that weight: Upon which he ſaid, he Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> and <hi>Sharrack</hi>; and that he hoped it was afterwards mended. Upon which I mov'd, that the Doctor might be ask'd, upon his Oath, who it was that took the Beef out of the Copper, and weighed it before him? He anſwered, it was Mr. <hi>Sharrack,</hi> who managed the Hoſpital under Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>: And then I referred it to their Honours to conſider what an Oath Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> had yeſterday made, who ſwore, That the men had always full Weight of Proviſions in the Hoſpital; againſt whom there is firſt Mr. <hi>Leckies</hi> Oath, who was Surgeon upon the place, and an Eye witneſs; and now alſo Dr. <hi>Welwood</hi> ſwears, that <hi>Sharrack</hi> himſelf weighed thoſe very Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were ſhort of Weight, as aforeſaid.</p>

And the Commiſſioners of Accounts,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103268:21"/>
as I have before related, not thinking fit to ſend for Dr. <hi>Welwood,</hi> they proceeded upon the next particular of the Fourth Article in the Complaint, which being read, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd theſe Words, <hi>viz. Thirdly, That Mr.</hi> Dickenſon <hi>Paid the People that Quarter the Seamen, at Five Shillings Six Pence</hi> per <hi>Week, the King's Allowance being Seven Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi> To this alſo Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> had Sworn.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to which, Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> poſitively Swears, That he was the Perſon that made up his Maſter's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, gave out the Tickets for the Sick and Wounded, and paid the Money to the People that Quarter'd them; and that there was never deducted above Six Pence in the Pound, which was for Returns of Money from <hi>London.</hi> And the Chairman demanding of me what I had to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I anſwer'd to this Effect:</p>
            <p>When this Article was Examin'd before the Admiralty, Mr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi> was there to juſtifie himſelf, and <note n="(a)" place="bottom">He being the Tool to do all the Executive Part of theſe Cheats, durſt not then appear Face to Face with Mr. <hi>Leckie,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi> was thought fitter to come up, that whatever Crimes were prov'd, he might pretend Ignorance, and ſhift them off to his Clerk. But ſo ſoon as Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> was gone to Sea, up comes <hi>Sharrack,</hi> and couragiouſly Swears a direct Negative to all that Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> had ſworn believing none was able to contradict him.</note> Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> was left at <hi>Plymouth</hi>; and one of the Lords of the Admiralty, in my hearing, did Examine Mr. <hi>Dicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> ſpeaking to him in this manner.</p>

Returns of Money. Upon which his Honour turning to my Lord <hi>Faulkland</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (who was Chairman) ſaid, my Lord, This Matter looks with a very ill Face; for I remember ſome time ago, when one <hi>Ben. Berry,</hi> now Surgeon at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> brought a complaint againſt Mr. <hi>Dickenſon,</hi> he alſo accus'd him of the ſame Crime that Mr. <hi>Leckie</hi> now do's, of making unreaſonable Deductions from the People; and then we would have had Mr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi> come up to anſwer for himſelf; but he pretending much of the King's Buſineſs, we excus'd him, and he ſent up his Man, one <hi>Nicholas Sharrack,</hi> to juſtifie his Proceedings: And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Sharrack,</hi> in his Maſter's Juſtification, Swore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, That his Maſter never deducted above Eighteen Pence in the Pound; and now Mr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi> declares upon his Honour, he never deducted but Twelve Pence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (added I) I pray your Honours to ſend to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty for the <hi>Minuits</hi> of Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi>'s Depoſition before their Lordſhips; for you will find that in Mr. <hi>Berry</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint (which was about <hi>February,</hi> 1691/2) Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> then Swore, That Mr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi> never deducted above Eighteen Pence in the Pound. And afterwards, before the Admiralty, Mr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi> himſelf, about <hi>April</hi> 1694. ſays, he never deducted but Twelve Pence. And now Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> Swears again poſitively, before your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, he never deducted but Six Pence. To which the Commiſſioners anſwer'd, That there muſt be Perjury ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on one ſide or the other; and the Chairman ſaid, they would take care to ſend for the <hi>Minuits</hi> of the Admiralty that I had deſir'd, and conſider of all theſe matters in the end: And accordingly I leſt in Writing, how they ſhould deſcribe the ſaid <hi>Minuits</hi> in their Letter or Precept to the Lords of the Admiralty; but whether they have got it, or not, I don't know. Thus in the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:103268:22"/>
1694. in one Day, Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi> finiſhed his Depoſition, which he came from <hi>Plymouth</hi> to make, and was the ſame Night diſcharg'd any further Attendance, and hurry'd out of Town again down to his Poſt, as an honeſt Man fit to ſerve the King.</p>
            <p>About this time I had notice that one Capt. <hi>White</hi> was come for <hi>England,</hi> who is the Perſon mention'd in the Lords of the Admiralty's Report, that in the beginning of the War made a Propoſal in Writing, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Sick and Wounded, to Tranſport the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at War, for Ten Shillings <hi>per</hi> Head, and afterwards made a verbal Propoſal to do it for Eight Shillings a Head; but he being at Sea when this Complaint was Examin'd before the Admiralty, the verbal Propoſal of Eight Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a Head could not be fully prov'd: But now, hearing he was come for <hi>England,</hi> I acquainted the Commiſſioners of Accounts, who at my inſtance were pleas'd to ſend for him: And the ſaid Capt. <hi>VVhite</hi> prov'd before their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, That the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded, refus'd to employ him for Eight Shillings a Head, Mr <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon</hi> telling him at the Board, he could not undertake it at ſo low a rate; and that he did it to prejudice other Men; raiſing many other Difficulties and Objections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and bid him go and talk with Mr. <hi>Peter Dulivier,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Holder</hi>; and that going to them, each of them told him the ſaid Capt. <hi>VVhite,</hi> he had <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

            <p>According to the Requeſt in this Memorial, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Sick and Wounded, with Capt. <hi>White,</hi> and my Self, were ſent for by the Commiſſioners of Accounts, and being all preſent, the Memorial was read, and one of the Commiſſioners of Accounts, who was Chairman, told the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded to this effect, That this was the buſineſs they had ſent for them upon, and that the Requeſt was ſo reaſonable, they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it; and therefore deſired them, if they had any thing to object againſt Capt. <hi>VVhite,</hi> either to what he had ſaid againſt them, or to his Reputation in general, that they would now declare it. To which Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> anſwer'd, We did not come to accuſe Capt. <hi>VVhite,</hi> but thought he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103268:24"/>
had come to accuſe us. But the Chairman reply'd, That is not the matter, Gentlemen, you have heard the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial read, Capt. <hi>White</hi> is going to Sea, and deſires that you would now ſpeak what you have to object againſt him, before he goes, and he is here ready to make anſwer to it, to prevent all Scandals that may be caſt upon him in his abſence. To which Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> anſwer'd to this effect; We have nothing to ſay againſt Capt. <hi>White</hi>; we always believed him to be an honeſt Man; and if he has been hardly us'd, we could not help it; for what we did in turning him out, was by Order. Then the Chairman was pleas'd to ſay, Captain, you hear that the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners have nothing to ſay againſt you; and as for us, I do aſſure you, there is not the leaſt Imputation upon you at this Board, but we believe you to be a very honeſt Man, and that you have been greatly abus'd.</p>
            <p>Now this Buſineſs being ended before the Commiſſioners of Accounts, it ſlept all the time of the Parliament, in the Year 1694. till the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> 1694/5. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being then ſitting, one Mr. <hi>Crosfield</hi> came to me, and told me, he deſign'd to bring a Petition into the Houſe of Peers, againſt ſeveral Corruptions in the Government, and among the reſt, he deſign'd to inſert the Buſineſs of the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded; asking me, if I was willing to appear before the Parliament. I told him I was very willing: and thereupon I drew up a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Matter, and he plac'd it the firſt Article in his Petition, which was Preſented to the Houſe of Peers, the Ninth of <hi>March,</hi> 1694/5. And being called in before the Houſe, among other things, I pray'd, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings before the Commiſſioners of Accounts, might be laid before the Houſe; which their Lordſhips were pleas'd to order accordingly. Then was I in great Expectation
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103268:25"/>
to end this troubleſome Buſineſs, that had lain ſo long and ſo heavy upon my Shoulders, while the Commiſſioners were ſupported. For I, and ſeveral others, fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That the afore-mentioned Depoſitions of Mr. <hi>Sharrack,</hi> and many other miſcarriages of Forgery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all Capt. <hi>White</hi>'s Depoſitions, would have come open and bare-fac'd before the Houſe: but we were all miſtaken. For about eleven Days after the Order, <hi>viz.</hi> the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the Commiſſioners of Accounts had gotten the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination referred to them, alleadging to the Houſe (as I was inform'd) That it was ſtill depending before them and not finiſh'd; and produc'd a great bundle of Papers, ſaying, That was not half the Examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it was re-committed to them by an Order of the Houſe; and for the better diſcerning how their Lordſhips Order was obſerv'd, I ſhall inſert it, as followeth,</p>

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:103268:25"/>'Twas ſurprizing to me when I heard the Commiſſioners of Accounts had Repreſented, that the Complaint was ſtill depending before them, and not perfected: When (as I have before related) it had from time to time lain ſo long dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant in their Office, both before and after Examination; which was all gone through long before in the manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, except the firſt Three Articles, which their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours totally rejected; ſaying, them Articles did not lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Board, they being only concern'd for the King's Revenue.</p>
            <p>The getting it thus Recommitted towards the End of a Seſſion of Parliament, procur'd about Eight Months further delay, to the great Encouragement of thoſe accus'd, who well know that Old Crimes are ſeldom puniſh'd.</p>
            <p>However; I hop'd for the beſt; and Mr. <hi>Crosfield</hi> and I, ſoon after this Order, waited upon one of the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Accounts, at his Houſe, praying him to ſpeed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, that a Report might be made to the Houſe of Peers before the breaking up of the Parliament; deſiring him alſo to think of Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi>'s Depoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that was paſt. To which he anſwered, (ſpeaking to me) <hi>Say you nothing, but keep your Tongue within your Teeth; there's a great difference now; we have an Order of the Houſe of Lords; we know where the Shooe pinches better than you; don't trouble your ſelf; for we'll lay our fingers upon the right place,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus I went away with great ſatisfaction, thinking all things went well; and having on the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>March</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Commiſſioners of Accounts, we received their Order to atend them the 29<hi>th</hi> following, with the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for Sick and Wounded; but nothing material was done that day, or the 30<hi>th,</hi> till the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>April.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 2<hi>d</hi> had another Hearing, when the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded had brought their Anſwer in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103268:26"/>
to the firſt Article, about the Correſpondence; which I pray'd to hear read; but the Commiſſioners of Accounts would not grant it.</p>
            <p>I alſo pray'd to have the Letter of Mr. <hi>William Churchil</hi> and Mr. <hi>Samuel Alſton,</hi> produc'd and read, which is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd in the firſt Article of the Admiralty's Report; and which I offer'd, as an Evidence of the Correſpondence; but I receiv'd Anſwer, that it could not be found.</p>
            <p>Then the Commiſſioners of Accounts receiv'd an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt me from Mr. <hi>William Churchil,</hi> who affirm'd, that I had carried an <note n="(a)" place="bottom">The Old Accuſation ſpoken of in page 4. reviv'd.</note> Information to my Lord <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Office, by which <hi>Robert Maſters</hi> (mentioned in the 2<hi>d</hi> Article of the Admiralty's Report) was turn'd out; and produc'd a Letter under my Hand, as a Teſtimony thereof; which being Read, the Commiſſioners of Accounts Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd me upon it. I anſwered. That the Crime was not great, if true: But if their Honours would receive Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt me that was forreign to the matter before them, I pray'd that Mr. <hi>Churchil</hi> might make Oath to the Truth of his Accuſation (it being the cuſtom of their Board to receive nothing but upon Oath), but it was not granted me: Yet the next day a diſcourſe of this matter ariſing, the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers adminiſtred an Oath to me to ſwear a Negative, wherein the Affirmative was not ſworn, and all about a matter that whoever did it, ought certainly to be commended, and not condemned.</p>
            <p>But now they came cloſer upon me, for they made an offer at my Life by an Accuſation, wherein Mr. <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> pretended to make out, That I was the Criminal, and had held the Criminal Correſpondence with <hi>Dulivier,</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103268:26"/>
produced a Paper, which the Commiſſioners of Accounts took and read, obliging me to anſwer for my ſelf. I told their Honours, I conceiv'd it was not Legal to ſuffer the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded, to interfere with ſuch pretended Accuſations againſt me, before they had anſwer'd to what was Exhibited againſt them, and when they had done that, then I would anſwer to any thing they had to alleadge againſt me; for that proceeding in this method, tended only to ſtifle the Truth, and diſcourage all ſuch as appear'd for the ſame. But all I could ſay, avail'd nothing, though one of the Commiſſioners of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts ſaid, they ought to receive no ſuch Accuſations. But another was of a contrary mind, ſaying, 'Twas a Criminal Correſpondence, and that they ought to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. So then the Tables were turn'd upon me, and I was oblig'd to clear my ſelf, leſt they ſhould <hi>Minuit</hi> againſt me <hi>pro Confeſſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 3. Had another Hearing, when <hi>Robert Maſters</hi> charg'd as a Criminal in the Complaint, and adjudg'd ſo by the Admiralty, as <hi>per</hi> Second Article of their Lordſhips Report, was admitted a Witneſs upon Oath, in his own behalf, relating to the Correſpondence with <hi>Dulivier,</hi> in which he himſelf was concern'd.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall give an Account of a foul Piece of Fraud, acted in a parcel of Rhubarb, and how it was this Day Sworn off before the Commiſſioners of Accounts.</p>
            <p>It was Sworn at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords by two Drug Merchants, who were Summon'd, That in <hi>January,</hi> 1693/4. they Sold to Mr. <hi>Jonathan Leigh,</hi> Apothecary, at publick Sale, about one Hundred and a half of Rhubarb,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103268:27"/>
at <note n="*" place="margin">which is about nine Pence 3 Farthings <hi>per</hi> Pound.</note> Four Pounds Eleven Shillings <hi>per</hi> Hundred; and that the ſaid Rhubarb was damag'd, and none of it good, or fit for Medicine.</p>
            <p>An Apothecary alſo being Summon'd, Depos'd, That he was Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Apprentice, at the time the ſaid Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb was bought; and that a conſiderable quantity of it, by Order of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> was beaten into Powder, and deliver'd into the <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> and Three Apothecaries more, are appointed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Medicines for the Army, and ſick and wounded Seamen; and they keep their Elaboratory in the <hi>Savoy, London</hi>; from whence all ſuch Medicines iſſue.</note> Elaboratory in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> for Their Majeſties uſe. And being ask'd, He alſo declar'd upon Oath, That his Conſcience would not give him leave to diſpenſe ſuch Rhubarb into Medicine: That the ſaid Rhubarb coſt but after the Rate of about Nine Pence Three Farthings <hi>per</hi> Pound; and that good Rhubarb, fit for Apothecaries uſe, was at that time worth at leaſt, Three or Four and Twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Pound <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Concerning this Rhubarb, it was the Opinion of the Preſident, and ſeveral of the Colledge of Phyſicians (whom I waited upon about this matter), that whoever took it for any Diſtemper where Rhubarb was the proper Medicine, muſt needs die for want thereof, it having no more Vertue than ſo much Powder of Rotten Poſt. Neither is this the only miſcarriage of this nature that has come to light. And if ſuch groſs Errors as theſe could paſs the inſpection of all thoſe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Apothecaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Commiſſioners for ſick and wounded pretend do conſtantly view all their Medicines, then God and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of thoſe concern'd, only knows what other bad medicines have been iſſued in like manner, for the lucre of Gain, and how many poor men have periſh'd thereby.</note>. This is the Subſtance of what was Sworn at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords, which was tranſmitted in Writing, Sign'd by each Perſon, to the Commiſſioners of Accounts, purſuant to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103268:27"/>
their Lordſhips Order of Reference; and this Day, <hi>viz.</hi> the Third of <hi>April,</hi> the Apothecary and Drug-Merchants, being Summon'd to attend the Commiſſioners of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and being ſent for up, the Four Apothecaries were alſo call'd up; and after the former had again declar'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, according to what has been before related, then the Commiſſioners of Accounts admitted the Four Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries upon Oath, to Swear a Negative in their own behalf; neither were they examin'd ſeparate, but all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be in the Room at a time, and when one was upon his Oath, the others ſtood by, and did ſometimes direct and help his Memory, as they ſaw occaſion. Thus they Swore off the Matter, only one of them made a ſmall Trip, which was this.</p>
            <p>One of the Apothecaries (among other things) upon his Oath declar'd, That not one Grain of the Rhubarb ſent in Powder to the <hi>Savoy,</hi> went for the uſe of the ſick and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Seamen.</p>
            <p>Then I pray'd liberty to ask him ſome Queſtions, which were theſe.</p>
            <p>Sir, If that damag'd Rhubarb ſent into the <hi>Savoy</hi> was not employ'd for the uſe of the ſick and wounded Seamen, where then did it go? was it diſpers'd among the Army? But here I was interrupted, and told, I had nothing to do with the Army: 'twas ſufficient he had Sworn, that none of it went to the uſe of the ſick and wounded Seamen.</p>
            <p>Then I proceeded to ask him,</p>
            <p>Sir, Upon your Oath, Do you keep the Medicines for the Army, and ſick and wounded Seamen together? Or, do you diſtinguiſh which is for the Army, and which for the Sick and Wounded?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:103268:28"/>He anſwer'd no; there's no need of it, we keep them all together.</p>
            <p>Then I demanded:</p>
            <p>Sir, Upon your Oath, Are you conſtantly at the Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> when the Invoices of Medicines ſent from the ſick and wounded Office, are made up to be ſent to the Sea-Ports? or, who is it that attends that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?</p>
            <p>He anſwer'd, 'Tis Mr. <hi>Anderſon</hi>'s Buſineſs to look after that, for I am never there.</p>
            <p>Then, reply'd I, How can you ſo poſitively Swear, That not one Grain of this Rhubarb went for the uſe of the ſick and wounded Seamen, when the Medicines are kept together without diſtinction, and you are never there at the making up of the Invoices?</p>
            <p>Thus the dark miſcarriage of the Rhubarb was Sworn off by the Criminals themſelves, and look'd upon as a ſlight and trivial matter.</p>
            <p>This Part being over, I mov'd to have produc'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of one <hi>Ben. Cooke,</hi> and about 20 other Maſters of Ships; and alſo a Letter of Mounſieur <hi>Delagny</hi>'s, which were both Inſerted in the Liſt of Witneſſes given in by me the 27<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> but I could not obtain the ſame.</p>
            <p>I mov'd alſo, that the Minuits of the Admiralty might be produc'd, concerning what <hi>Nich. Sharrack</hi> Swore againſt <hi>Ben. Berry</hi>'s Complaint, which I had pray'd might be ſent for in the Liſt of Witneſſes, of the 27<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> but could not obtain it, though it was to ſhew the falſity of <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> the laſt part of his Depoſition.</note> Mr. <hi>Sharrack</hi>'s Depoſition afore-mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:103268:28"/>
               <hi>Saturday, April</hi> 6<hi>th</hi> had another hearing, and Mr. <hi>Richard Gibſon</hi> attending according to Order, to be a Witneſs about the Propoſal of Capt. <hi>White,</hi> the Commiſſioners of Accounts receiv'd an Information upon Oath, againſt him and me (which was forreign to the matter before them) by Three clamorous Women, brought up on purpoſe from <hi>Deptford.</hi> Neither were they examined ſeparate, but called up all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and being upon Oath, one was ſuffered to tell her Story, and the reſt only ask'd, if what ſhe ſaid was true? And Mr. <hi>Gibſon</hi> going to juſtifie himſelf, the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were not willing to hear him: To which one of the Commiſſioners of Accounts ſaid, That ſince they had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Dirt to be thrown in his Face, they ought in Honour to give him liberty to wipe it off again: So at laſt the Board was prevail'd with to conſent to hear Mr. <hi>Gibſon</hi>'s Defence the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following <note n="(a)" place="bottom">The whole buſineſs which occaſion'd all this diſpute, was an Accuſation for receiving two ſhillings (a Fee allowed by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners) about the latter end of the year 1689. when <hi>Mr. Gibſon</hi> was their Secretary; which now they were not only ſo ſhameleſs to deny the allowing, but alſo to bring up theſe Women to arraign <hi>Mr. Gibſon</hi> for receiving it; and One of the Commiſſioners of Accounts was ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eager as to give it the Term of <hi>Levying money upon the Subject</hi>; which ſhews how ready ſome perſons are to lay hold on all little Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to defame and blacken the Reputations of thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to detect publick Frauds.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 11<hi>th, Thurſday,</hi> had another Hearing, when the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded brought one of their Clerks, their Meſſenger, and their Door-keeper, to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for them. I mov'd that they might be ask'd, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any one had offer'd to tamper with them? Which was Refus'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:103268:29"/>I mov'd, that Mr. <hi>Gibſon,</hi> or my ſelf, might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ask the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded ſome Queſtions, in Order to clear Mr. <hi>Gibſon</hi> of the Information ſo unjuſtly charg'd upon him; but it was refus'd.</p>
            <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Gibſon</hi> being Summon'd as an Evidence for the King, met with very ſcurvy Treatment; againſt which the ſame Commiſſioner of Accounts, laſt ſpoken of, did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times object, declaring they ought not to have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any ſuch Information.</p>
            <p>Then I mov'd, That that part of the Complaint might be Examin'd which ſets forth, That the Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded, keep their Accounts in a Clandeſtine Manner, contrary to the Practice of the Navy, whereby they give themſelves Opportunity to Cheat the <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the Note to the 5th Article of the Admiralties Report.</note> King — Receiv'd Anſwer from the Chairman, That they nor I had nothing to do, how the Commiſſioners for Sick and Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded keep their Accounts.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the laſt Examination before the Commiſſioners of Accounts.</p>
            <p>But here it may not be improper to obſerve, That Sir <hi>Samuel Bernadiſton</hi> left the Commiſſioners of Accounts, and Sir <hi>Peter Colliton</hi> died before this Complaint came under Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination: Neither do I remember that the Honourable <hi>Paul Foley</hi> was at any of the aforementioned Debates, the greateſt part of which happen'd in the Sitting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And this Treatment being added to all the hard uſage I had before undergone, and ſeeing my Enemies multiply up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, I was very deſirous that a final end might be put to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103268:29"/>
this Tedious Buſineſs, and that the Commiſſioners of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts might Repreſent me to the Houſe of Lords either for a Knave or an Honeſt Man, as they in their Conſciences thought I deſerv'd; and to move their Honours thereto, I wrote them the following Letter.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                     <salute>Honoured Gentlemen,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>HOping you will ſuddenly give in a Report to the Houſe of Lords concerning my Complaint againſt the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for Sick and Wounded, purſuant to their Lordſhips Order of Reference, of the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> laſt; but before the ſaid <hi>Report</hi> be given in, I ſhall humbly beg leave to offer to your Conſideration the following <hi>Particulars:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That I laid down my Employment to bring this Complaint, out of a love to Juſtice, and Zeal for the King's Service (tho directly contrary to my own private Intereſt at that time:) And tho there has been a Report made to the King by the Lords of the Admiralty, and alſo a Report by the Lords of the Council to the late Queen, of bleſſed Memory; both which Reports do (I conceive) ſet forth, That the Matter of Fact in my Complaint, is true; all which are publick Evidences, that what I did, was the Duty of a good Subject: Yet, notwithſtanding, my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries have been ſupported, and I, as though I were a Criminal, have been to this Day, not only kept out of Employment, but alſo left openly exposed, as a Sacrifice, to the Malice of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Train of the Corrupt and Difaffected Party, to the hazard of my Life, and damage ſome hundreds of Pounds; ſo that my Caſe is become a publick Example to deter and affright all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects from <hi>ever daring to do their Duty,</hi> in diſcovering any Crimes againſt the King or Kingdom for the future; and of what evil Conſequence ſuch publick Proceedings may be, to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103268:30"/>
the diſcouraginging Vertue and Fidelity, and Supporting, und Eſtabliſhing Vice and Treachery, I ſhall humbly leave your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to Judge; becauſe your Power, Wiſdom, and Duty, to promote the Honour and Intereſt of your King and Country, is ſo far Superiour to mine.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> That the Complaint Exhibited by me againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Sick and Wounded, does, I conceive, contain matters of great Conſequence to the Publick Good, which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint muſt of neceſſity be either true or falſe; and conſequently I do deſerve either to be Incourag'd, or ſeverely Puniſh'd.</p>
                  <p>Therefore my humble Requeſt to your Honours is, That you will inſert your Opinions of me in your Report to the Houſe of Lords; and if you believe my Complaint is true, and that I had a deſign to promote the Intereſt of my King and Country therein, that then you will recommend me to their Lordſhips for Incouragement. But becauſe I will be wholly Impartial to my ſelf, I alſo pray, That if your Honours can find any juſt grounds to believe that my Complaint is falſe, That then you will not ſpare me, but in Juſtice to the Commiſſioners accus'd, Repreſent me in your Report, as an Impoſtor, that deſerves Corporal Puniſhment, in ſuch manner, as to the Wiſdom of your Board, ſhall ſeem agreeable to the Rules of Juſtice. For, I humbly ſuppoſe, any Man that brings a falſe and malicious Complaint, ought to be ſeverely puniſh'd for the ſame, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no Gentleman is ſafe in his Reputation, or in any Office, or Grant he ſhall receive from the Crown.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Honoured Gentleman,</hi> I moſt humbly pray you to ſpeed your Report, and to Conſider of, and Anſwer, theſe my Just Requests; In doing which, I aſſure my ſelf, that you will throughly conſult the Merits of the Cauſe, for the good of your Country, according to the Rules of down-right Juſtice (without
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103268:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
regard to Perſons or Factions) ſo as not to ſpill innocent Blood on either ſide. For, I conceive, it is morally impoſſible, That the Commiſſioners Accus'd, and I their Accuſer, can all be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Men. I am</p>
