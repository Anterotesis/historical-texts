            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Dear friends, the Lord doth much manifeſt his love and power in theſe parts. Upon Munday laſt ſo called, my brother <hi>George</hi> and I were at <hi>Lancaſter</hi>; there were abundance of friends from all parts, and a great ſort which ſided with the Prieſts, giving out they now hoped to ſee a ſtop put to that great work which had gone on ſo faſt, and with ſuch power, that their kingdom is much ſhaken. We were called before Judge <hi>Fell,</hi> Colonel <hi>Weſt,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Sawer,</hi> there to anſwer what was charged againſt <hi>George.</hi> There were three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to eight particulars; but they were much confuſed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which gave much light to the truth, whereby the Juſtices did plainly ſee that it was envie; and they divers times told them ſo. One
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46882:9"/>
Witneſs was a young Prieſt, who confeſt he had not medled, had not another Prieſt ſent for him, and ſet him awork. The other were two Prieſts ſons. It was proved there by many, that heard one of them ſay, that if he had power, he would make <hi>George</hi> deny his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and that he had the Spirit, and that he would take away his life; and this was a ſingle Witneſs to one of the greateſt untruths that was charged againſt <hi>George.</hi> And the Juſtices told him, that they ſaw, becauſe he could not take away his life, he went about to take away his liberty. There was one Prieſt made out of the whole number, as an Orator to plead againſt us; who ſpared no pains to ſhew forth his envie againſt the truth: and when he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, he went down in a rage, and there came up a pack of them into the room, amongſt whom was one <hi>Iacus. George</hi> being ſpeaking in the room, one of the Juſtices having wiſhed him, if he had any thing to ſay, he would ſpeak: at which the ſaid <hi>Iacus</hi> was in ſuch a rage, that he broke forth into many high expreſſions againſt the truth ſpoken by my dear brother <hi>George</hi>; amongſt which, this was one, <hi>That the letter and the ſpirit were unſeparable:</hi> at which, the Juſtices ſtood up, and bid him prove that, before he went any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but he ſeeing himſelf faſt, would have denied it; and the reſt of the Prieſts would have been giving the meaning of his words: but the Juſtices would have no meaning, but told him he had laid down a Poſition, and it was fit he ſhould prove it: whereat, the Prieſts were ſilenced, and went down in a greater rage then before. And ſome of them were asked at night, What they had done? And they lyed and ſaid, They could not get into the room; thereby to hide their ſhame, and keep the people in blindneſs. The Juſtices, Judge <hi>Fell</hi> and Colonel <hi>Weſt,</hi> are much convinced of the truth, and do much ſet up juſtice and equity, and have ſilenced the rage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Many bitter ſpirits were at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to ſee the event, but went home and cryed the Prieſts had loſt the day. Everlaſting praiſes be to him who fought the battel for us who is our King for ever. There were friends called, who the Witneſſes confeſſed were in the room when the things charged upon <hi>George</hi> were ſpoken: But they all as one man denied that any ſuch words were ſpoken: which gave much light to the Juſtices: for they knew many of them (as they ſaid) to be honeſt men, and they durſt truſt what they witneſſed. There was a Warrant granted out againſt us at <hi>Appleby</hi>; but Juſtice <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:46882:9"/>
told them it was not according to Law, and ſo it ceaſed: as I hear he is a faithful man to the truth.</p>
            <p>The Prieſts began to preach againſt the Juſtices, and ſay they were not to meddle in theſe things; but to end controverſie betwixt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and neighbour; and are not pleaſed with the Law, becauſe it is not in the Stature to impriſon us, as the Prieſt that pleaded againſt us ſaid; and the Juſtices bad him go put it into the Satute, if he could: he ſaid it ſhould want no will of his. They are much afraid that they ſhall loſe all; they are much diſcontent in theſe parts, and ſome of them cry all is gone. Dear friends, dwell in patience, and wait upon the Lord who will do his owne work, look not at man in the work, nor at man who oppoſeth the work, but reſt in the will of the Lord, that ſo ye may be furniſhed with patience, both to do and to ſuffer what you ſhall be called unto, that your end in all things may be his praiſe, and take up his croſs freely, which keeps low the fleſhly man, that Chriſt may be ſet up and honoured in all things, and ſo the light advanced in you, and the judgement ſet up, which muſt give ſentence againſt all that oppoſeth the truth in ye, that the Captivity may be led Captive, and the Priſoners ſet free to ſeek the Lord, that righteouſneſs may rule in you, and patience and joy may dwel with you, wherein conſiſteth the Kingdome of the Father, to whom be all praiſe for ever.</p>
            <p>Dear, friends meet often together, and take heed of what exalteth it ſelf above its brother; but keep low, and ſerve one another in love; for the Lords ſake let all friends know how it is with us, that God may have the praiſe of all.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>That he did diſſwade men from reading the Scriptures, teaching them that they were carnal.</hi>
