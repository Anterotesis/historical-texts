            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Parliament, Intituled, an
Act for the relief of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
taken by Turkiſh, Moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and other Pirats, and to
prevent the taking of others in time to
come, a Subſidy of one <hi>per Cent.</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on all goods and Merchandize ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
out of, or imported into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi>
which was to be one firſt part more then
the Cuſtomes and Subſidy of Tonnage
and Poundage, according to the Book
of Rates: Since the Paſſing of which
Act, the Houſe of Commons by Order of
the tenth of <hi>March</hi> 1641. for divers reaſons
did Order, That Bonds ſhould be taken
by the Collectors of that duty to ſtand to
the Order of Parliament: And whereas
both Houſes of Parliament intending to
carry on that good work, did on the 24. of
<hi>October</hi> 1644. Order, that only one fourth
part of the moneys due by the ſaid Bonds
<pb facs="tcp:171311:2"/>
being one ſhilling in every twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
Cuſtome, ſhould be paid by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Merchants of the City of <hi>London,</hi>
having by their Petition ſet forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great
inconveniency that might happen, as well
in relation to the Advancement of the
work, as to the unequall burthen that
might reſt upon the wel-affected Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,

ſaid Act, make ill uſe of the favour of the
Parliament; and did fraudulently make
entry of their goods in the names of inſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

Bonds were likewiſe ſealed. And the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being now required, no ſuch perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
nor moneys can be collected for the
carrying on of that work; yet the ſaid wel-affected
Merchants being deſirous that

by way of Advance forthwith to pay in
all ſuch monyes as they themſelves owe
