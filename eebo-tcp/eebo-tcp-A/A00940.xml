            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and offence; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
the more a man hath, the
more he coueteth: ≈øo that he hath
no mea≈øure in his de≈øires, whiles
he maketh ha≈øte to become a verie
≈øeruant or ≈ølaue to innumerable
cares of this life. For as the
Scripture verifieth: A couetous
man is neuer ≈øati≈øfied with monie.
And what a dete≈øtable thing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetou≈ønes
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2431:87"/>
is, S. Paule declareth
in the≈øe wordes: Couetou≈ønes,
which is the wor≈øhipping of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or idolatrie. The ≈øame Apo≈øtle
≈øhewing what a mi≈øch√©efous thing
it is, ≈øaith: They that will be rich,
fall into temptations, and ≈ønares
of the diuell, and manie noi≈øome
lu≈øts, which drowne men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction
and perdition. The wi≈øe
man al≈øo noteth, how hurtfull the
vice of couetou≈ønes is to them
that be infected therewith, ≈øaieng:
There is nothing more wicked,
than a couetous man. And Saint
Iames to the ≈øame purpo≈øe, v≈øeth
this ≈øp√©ech: Go to now ye rich
men, w√©epe and howle in the mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which ≈øhall come vpon you:
your riches are corrupt, your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are moth-eaten, your gold
and ≈øiluer is cankerd, and the ru≈øt
thereof ≈øhall be a witnes again≈øt
you, &amp; ≈øhall eate your fle≈øh like fire.</p>
                     <p>Our Sauiour Chri≈øt al≈øo, ≈ø√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what mi≈øch√©efe it is, would not
in anie ca≈øe ≈øcale vp ≈øuch a ≈øinne in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2431:87"/>
≈øilence. For the≈øe are his words
written by the Euangeli≈øt: It is
hard for a richman to enter into
the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                     <p>Againe, It is ea≈øier for a camel
to pa≈ø≈øe through the eie of a n√©edle,
than for a richman to enter into the
kingdome of heauen. If therefore
couetou≈ønes in the harts of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
be ≈øuch a plaguie and pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
infection: what ≈øhall we think
thereof, if it be found in them that
haue taken their fare-well of the
world, and bequeathed them≈øelues
wholie to the Lord? To ≈øuch ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
are the words of our red√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chri≈øt directed in the Go≈øpell,
whereby the ≈øicknes of couetou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
might be cured. Be y√©e not
carefull (≈øaith our Sauiour) what
ye ≈øhall eate, or what ye ≈øhall drink,
or what ye ≈øhall weare. For after
all the≈øe things doo the Gentiles
≈ø√©eke. But fir≈øt ≈ø√©eke the kingdome
of God, and the righteou≈ønes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and all the≈øe things ≈øhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
you. O ble≈ø≈øed lsaeing, void of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2431:88"/>
care, and woorthie to be imbraced!
For there is none liuing ≈øo fr√©e
from care, as he which de≈øireth to
po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe nothing be≈øide Chri≈øt. For
vnder the condition of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe,
he is allowed to haue all ≈øuch
nece≈ø≈øaries as he dooth lacke. As
S. Paule the poore, and yet rich
Apo≈øtle ≈øaith: As hauing nothing,
and yet po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing all things. All
things, not for ≈øuperfluitie; but for
nece≈ø≈øitie, as he prooueth in the≈øe
words: Hauing food and raiment,
let vs be therewith content. But
thou wilt ≈øaie peraduenture, O
man, It is requi≈øite that religious
and godlie men ≈øhould haue more
in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion (riches I meane, and

common people, in rel√©euing the
poore &amp; n√©edie members of Chri≈øt
Ie≈øu, and ≈øuch like works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
I allow thy ≈øaieng, O man:
but yet to pull vp couetou≈ønes by
the hard rootes, as well out of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2431:88"/>

                     <p>Wherevpon Chri≈øt giuing a
watch-word to beware of the like,
≈øaith: No man putting his hand to
the plough, and looking behind him
is fit for the kingdome of heauen.
To the ≈øame effect S. Peter v≈øeth
the≈øe words: Better were it for

the knowledge thereof, to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                     <p>THREE rea≈øons there be, which may
restraine thee, √¥ man, from fooli≈øh
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2431:118"/>
and exce≈ø≈øiue reioicing. The first, becau≈øe
it is vaine, and as Salomon ≈øaith, ≈øuch
mirth ≈øhall be mingled with moorning,
and the end of ≈øuch ioie ≈øhall be lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore it is vaine. Secondlie,
becau≈øe it is wicked, and therefore the wi≈øe
man ≈øaith, It is better to go into a hou≈øe
of moorning, than into a hou≈øe of banket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and merrie-making. For in the one
thou art put in mind of the end of all
fle≈øh; and being aliue, bethinkest what is
to come: be≈øides that, where exce≈ø≈øiue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioicing
is, there is the hart of fooles, in ≈øo
much that, euen in laughter, he worketh
wickednes. Thirdlie, bicau≈øe it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and as the Euangeli≈øt ≈øaith, Wo be
to them that laugh now; for they ≈øhall
weepe and wring their hands, their laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
≈øhall be turned into lamenting, and
their ioie into heauines. Let thy reioicing
therefore haue the≈øe two properties; first,
that it be honest, which God alloweth,
≈øaieng, Go thy waies, and eate thy bread
with gladnes, and drinke thy wine with
ioie, for thy works plea≈øe the Lord; ≈øecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that it be fruitfull, which God, approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
likewi≈øe by the ≈øcripture in the≈øe

                     <p>AN honest and cleane life is that,
which we commonlie call continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
By this cha≈øt continencie, or continent
cha≈øtitie, all the defilings of lecherous di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honestie
are clean≈øed, and quite wa≈øhed
awaie. By this vertue, honest and cleane
continencie, the bodie is brideled, and kept
≈øhort from gadding after the deadlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of the fle≈øh. He that committeth
carnall filthines, offendeth against his
owne bodie, ≈øpoiling it of a ≈øpeciall honour;
&amp; di≈øgracing it with reprochfull ≈øhame;
in that he taketh the member of Christ,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2431:134"/>

≈øhould forbeare from a ≈øinne ≈øo abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;

not tarrie there, where anie vncleannes
resteth. Furthermore, that honestie or
continencie of life, which hunteth after the
prai≈øe of men, hath no reward at Gods
hands. And therefore it is needfull for vs
to haue a pure and vndefiled intent or

                     <p>It is certaine, that God denied
not that delight vnto th√©e, becau≈øe
he gaue no expre≈ø≈øe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

it, becau≈øe he ≈øuffered the ≈øame to

it not, but rather thought it

verie needfull and conuenient, that

For, ≈øaith thine Apo≈øtle, all that is

which is to liue in plea≈øure; the lu≈øt
of the eies, which is wantonnes; and
the pride of life, which is ambition,

but of the world, and therefore wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

whereof, √¥ almightie God, breed in

                     <p>Now therefore, mo≈øt mercifull
