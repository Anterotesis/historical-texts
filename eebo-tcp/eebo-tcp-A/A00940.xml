            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>It is contrariwiſe thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by S. Iohn, againſt ſuch as

and ye knowe that no man-ſlear

                     <p>How thinke we of the ſaieng of

The words following doo ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie

that thy brother hath ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

except thou haue firſt made ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
to thy neighbour, whom thou haſt
miſvſed, and brought him to quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and contentation of mind. For
praier is the gift, which we bring,
and our hart is the altar. He that
endeuoureth thus to doo, as often
as he ſhall perceiue a couple at
ſtrife and variance, by wrath and
anger, dooth not incur the danger
of damnation.</p>
                     <p>But manie there be, which will
not forgiue their offenders, albeit
they ſubmit themſelues, and ſéeke

thoſe is the ſword of our Sauiour

                     <p>The ſhortnes of the world is certaine;

                        </hi> Man, theſe things
are not brought to
paſſe of worldlings,
without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and offence; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the more a man hath, the
more he coueteth: ſo that he hath
no meaſure in his deſires, whiles
he maketh haſte to become a verie
ſeruant or ſlaue to innumerable
cares of this life. For as the
Scripture verifieth: A couetous
man is neuer ſatiſfied with monie.
And what a deteſtable thing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2431:87"/>
is, S. Paule declareth
in theſe wordes: Couetouſnes,
which is the worſhipping of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or idolatrie. The ſame Apoſtle
ſhewing what a miſchéefous thing
it is, ſaith: They that will be rich,
fall into temptations, and ſnares
of the diuell, and manie noiſome
luſts, which drowne men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and perdition. The wiſe
man alſo noteth, how hurtfull the
vice of couetouſnes is to them
that be infected therewith, ſaieng:
There is nothing more wicked,
than a couetous man. And Saint
Iames to the ſame purpoſe, vſeth
this ſpéech: Go to now ye rich
men, wéepe and howle in the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which ſhall come vpon you:
your riches are corrupt, your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are moth-eaten, your gold
and ſiluer is cankerd, and the ruſt
thereof ſhall be a witnes againſt
you, &amp; ſhall eate your fleſh like fire.</p>
                     <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt alſo, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what miſchéefe it is, would not
in anie caſe ſcale vp ſuch a ſinne in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2431:87"/>
ſilence. For theſe are his words
written by the Euangeliſt: It is
hard for a richman to enter into
the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                     <p>Againe, It is eaſier for a camel
to paſſe through the eie of a néedle,
than for a richman to enter into the
kingdome of heauen. If therefore
couetouſnes in the harts of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
be ſuch a plaguie and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
infection: what ſhall we think
thereof, if it be found in them that
haue taken their fare-well of the
world, and bequeathed themſelues
wholie to the Lord? To ſuch ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
are the words of our redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chriſt directed in the Goſpell,
whereby the ſicknes of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
might be cured. Be yée not
carefull (ſaith our Sauiour) what
ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drink,
or what ye ſhall weare. For after
all theſe things doo the Gentiles
ſéeke. But firſt ſéeke the kingdome
of God, and the righteouſnes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and all theſe things ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
you. O bleſſed lsaeing, void of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2431:88"/>
care, and woorthie to be imbraced!
For there is none liuing ſo frée
from care, as he which deſireth to
poſſeſſe nothing beſide Chriſt. For
vnder the condition of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
he is allowed to haue all ſuch
neceſſaries as he dooth lacke. As
S. Paule the poore, and yet rich
Apoſtle ſaith: As hauing nothing,
and yet poſſeſſing all things. All
things, not for ſuperfluitie; but for
neceſſitie, as he prooueth in theſe
words: Hauing food and raiment,
let vs be therewith content. But
thou wilt ſaie peraduenture, O
man, It is requiſite that religious
and godlie men ſhould haue more
in poſſeſſion (riches I meane, and
other vtenſiles) than other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
houſholders, conſidering that
they beſtowe them better, than the
common people, in reléeuing the
poore &amp; néedie members of Chriſt
Ieſu, and ſuch like works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
I allow thy ſaieng, O man:
but yet to pull vp couetouſnes by
the hard rootes, as well out of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2431:88"/>
harts of the one as the other, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all eſtates to the example of
Lots wife, to terrifie them from
ſetting their minds vpon ſuch a
vile ſinne. Shée departing from
among the Sodamites, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to looke backe, was turned
into a piller of ſalt; and ſo gaue vp
the ghoſt, bicauſe ſhe did not as ſhe
was inioined by commandement.</p>
                     <p>Wherevpon Chriſt giuing a
watch-word to beware of the like,
ſaith: No man putting his hand to
the plough, and looking behind him
is fit for the kingdome of heauen.
To the ſame effect S. Peter vſeth
theſe words: Better were it for
ſuch neuer to haue knowne the
waie of righteouſnes, than after
the knowledge thereof, to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from that which was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them by an holie commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Vnto theſe men agréeth
the old, and not ſo old as true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe:
A dog returning to his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
&amp; a ſow to walowe in the mire.</p>
                     <p>The nature of this diſeaſe of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couetouſnes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2431:89"/>
is ſuch, that the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and ſpéedieſt waie to ouercome
and killir, is continuallie to thinke
vpon death, and euerie minute of
an houre to conſider, what ſhall be
the ſtate of a man verie ſhortlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he is laid in his graue. This
was alwaies fixed faſt, and déeplie
grauen in his memorie, that vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this ſentence: Man is but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and the ſonne of man but a
woorme.</p>
                     <p>This was neuer out of his mind
who ſaid: whatſoeuer thou takeſt
in hand, remember the end, &amp; thou
ſhalt neuer doo amiſſe. To what
purpoſe then dooth the couetous
worldling gather goodes? They
will ſtand him in no ſtead in the
daie of wrath. Harken, O man, to
the voice of Iob: Naked came I
out of my mothers wombe, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſhall I go thither againe. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
alſo to the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle:

                     <p>Was he not tormented in hell,
and forced there to make euen verie

obtaine them; bicauſe whiles he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in this life, he denied trifles to
the ſuccouries? He denied the little
crums falling from his table, and
therefore it was not granted vnto
him to haue the tip of his tongue
cooled with cold water. He would
not ſend his ſeruants with a little
refreſhing to the poore beggar; and
therefore he could not get ſo much
grace, as to let his brethren vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

                     <p>Christ the truth it ſelfe, being diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

that this praiſe-woorthie plaine dealing,
commended of Chriſt, is not without theſe
two good properties: namelie, well willing,

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2431:118"/>

it is vaine, and as Salomon ſaith, ſuch
mirth ſhall be mingled with moorning,
and the end of ſuch ioie ſhall be lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore it is vaine. Secondlie,
becauſe it is wicked, and therefore the wiſe
man ſaith, It is better to go into a houſe
of moorning, than into a houſe of banket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and merrie-making. For in the one
thou art put in mind of the end of all
fleſh; and being aliue, bethinkest what is
to come: beſides that, where exceſſiue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioicing
is, there is the hart of fooles, in ſo
much that, euen in laughter, he worketh
wickednes. Thirdlie, bicauſe it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and as the Euangeliſt ſaith, Wo be
to them that laugh now; for they ſhall
weepe and wring their hands, their laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhall be turned into lamenting, and
their ioie into heauines. Let thy reioicing
therefore haue theſe two properties; first,
that it be honest, which God alloweth,

God ſhewed himſelfe too too ſeueare
and vniuſt, in giuing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
For, is it poſſible to
liue in ſuch chaſtitie, as is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

                     <p>Art thou more innocent than

offended in adulterie. Art thou wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer

ſtronger than Samſon? He was
too féeble to encounter with his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramour.
So then, thou ſéeſt, O

of the world, for the rarenes of

ſo is it among birds, ſo is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

then ſhouldeſt not thou, O man,
which haſt all things in ſubiection

                     <p>As I giue thée counſell to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
and content the luſts of thine

vſe thy weapon like a man, that if

that thou maiſt not take ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance
in thine owne cauſe, procure not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
one or other to doo
that, which thou deſireſt to haue

                     <p>For, no lawe is ſo ſtreight, but
it may be mitigated with a gift: no

appeaſed with a bribe: no penaltie
ſo great, but there may be meanes
found to paie it. And therefore, the
fulfilling of thy mind vpon thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie,
is a felicitie aboue all felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſuch a thing, as thou

odious in the ſight of God, and flatlie. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden:
harken, ô man, to the wiſedome of
the holie Ghost, &amp; learne how dangerous
an infection it is. S. Iames ſaith, that God

tempteth no man to wickednes, but it is
the worke of concupiſcence, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
foorth ſinne, and ſinne when it is ripe,
ingendereth death. So that in reſpect of
Gods iustice and righteouſnes, betweene

no difference touching the puniſhment;

Euen an vncleane hart, a corrupt hart, a

of Chriſt. In ſuch a hart reaſon is ſo far

For mans will loueth ſuch a reaſon, and
ſuch a reaſon mans will. Let thy will be

                     <p>Cleannes of hart cauſeth quietnes of

but what is befallen them now?</p>
                     <p>Are they not gone to their long home,
euen their graue, in the verie twinkling

much more terrible by a thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

worldlie pompe warrant, fleſhlie pleaſure,

coms lamenting; after pleaſure, paine; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proſperitie, miſerie, after delights, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:

                     <p>The counſell of bleſſed Paule of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
it ſelfe in conuenient place
to be imbraced, who no doubt had a

perfect view of the vanities reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in this world; vanitie in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

and thinking, vanitie in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and inuenting, vanitie in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell

vanitie abroade, vanitie on ſea, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie

in poore, vanitie in wiſe, vanitie
in fooles, vanitie in ſtrong, vanitie

in foule; finallie, nothing but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vanitie, which way ſoeuer a

                     <p>And therefore S. Paule (I ſaie)
willeth vs (whoſe aduiſe I wiſh

To conclude, when thou art

                     <p>O man, this buſie diuell, who ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

Chriſt and thy ſoule, whome hée

this world, which is his prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

whatſoeuer is at ſtrife with God,
who is the father of light, the ſame
is darkeneſ; but ſuch is the world,
therefore the ſequeale is prooued,
and ſtandeth iumpe with truth.</p>
                     <p>Now, O man, buckle thy ſelfe to

thereof. Let faith, Dauids chiefe

                     <p>Thus prepared, O man, feare

Looke about thée, beſtir thée.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue

                     <p>Go to then in Gods name, ſet

Thy life on earth, O man, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

                     <p>So fight therefore, O man, not

                     <p>O Eternall God, father of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which by
the mouth of thine Apoſtle bleſſed
Iohn, haſt giuen vs this wholeſome
counſell and admonition; that we
ſhould not loue this corruptible
world, neither yet the things that
are in the ſame. And why? euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the loue of God the father is
not in him that loueth this world.
For, ſaith thine Apoſtle, all that is
in the world; as the luſt of the fleſh,
which is to liue in pleaſure; the luſt
of the eies, which is wantonnes; and
the pride of life, which is ambition,
and haughtines, is not of the father,
but of the world, and therefore wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and damnable. In conſideration
whereof, ô almightie God, breed in
vs we beſeech thee, by the vertue of
regeneration, a hatred of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

to come; that by how much we are
ſeparate and diſtant from the one,
by ſo much we may be knit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
in neerenes to the other; wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
rather by triall of manie tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations
in this life, to arriue in

peace, and endles tranquilitie, than
by enioieng all this preſent worldes
goods, and the variable pleaſures of
the ſame, which are but momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
to receiue eternall torments in
the lake of reſtles paine, and vnceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
miſerie.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, moſt mercifull
father; for that we haue heere in
this world no continuing citie, but
looke for one to come; not of dutie
by deſerts in our ſelues, but of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
by the merits of thy ſonne: we
beſeech thee moſt earneſtlie to
weane vs from the loue of this

may be like children weaned from

as they growe in yeares: ſo we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing

which are the ioies of worldlings,
may betake ourſelues to the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

I meane this fleſh
ingendered and bred of ſinne, nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

none other deſire, none other

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:2431:169"/>
ſpurreth forward to the luſt of the

ceaſeth not to tempt mens harts
with a thouſand miſchieuous wiles,
and dangerous deuiſes.</p>
            <p>This is hee, which bindeth our
hands with our owne girdles; that
the fleſh, which is giuen vnto vs for
an helpe and ſuccour, might be made
a ſnare to intrap vs, and a downefall
to breake our necks. But in vs it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
if we will be vanquiſhed, if we
will be ouercome: and neuer a one
of vs ſhall be ouerthrowne in this
combat againſt our will. Thine own
concupiſcence, O man; thine owne
luſt, I ſaie, is ſubiect vnto thee, and
thou maiſt, if thou wilt, ouer-rule it
with reaſon. Thine aduerſarie may
kindle the fire of temptation, but it
is in thine owne choice to blowe the
cole of conſent; that is, either to yeeld
therevnto or to withſtand it.</p>
            <p>It is in thine owne power, &amp; thou
maiſt, if thou wilt, make thine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie

luſt: onelie giue not thy conſent to

            <p>I do beleeue all this verelie, if we

rage, and extreame heate of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
afflict and trouble the ſtate of
our outward and inward man: let vs
rather chooſe to burne than to turne,
to ſmart than to yeeld.</p>
            <p>The diuell is well knowne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
at the temporall and ſpirituall
proſperitie of mankind; he doth what
he can to defraud him of both felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;

much wee ſee our ſelues mooued

laie on loade, when all the weight of
warre preſſeth vpon vs, when the

whereby the conquered get ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
captiuitie, and the conquerours
gain triumphant glorie and victorie.</p>
            <p>For the diuell is knowne to grudge
at our good eſtate, &amp; pininglie to haue
ſpite at our heauenlie happines;
howbeit, not for his owne ſake, that

he loſt it without recouerie: but for

            <p>And if peraduenture he go about to

this wreſtling and fighting againſt

            <p>It is the diuels drift to aſſault vs

not to conſent therevnto, not to

For how often as wee gaine-ſtand
the diuell, ſo often we ouercome him,
ſo often we make the angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
