            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Late High Sheriff of Flintſhire.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THo the Stars are plac'd at ſo great a diſtance
from us, yet we behold their Light; and
thoſe that ſhine moſt bright are moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd.
So Merit and Virtue dart their Influence
from afar: You ſeem one of the firſt Magnitude.
<hi>Shrewsbury</hi> is the Orb in which you are fixt; yet
tho your Perſon is circumſcrib'd there, your Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are diffuſive thro all Counties: There they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
your Perſon, and here we admire your Virtues.
Fame repreſents you to us ſo qualify'd with all the
Ornaments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a Gentleman, that you ſeem a new
addition of Honour to your Family, and rather give
Credit to the Name, than receive a Luſtre from it:
And yet it is ſo Ancient, that when <hi>William</hi> the
Conqueror came into <hi>England,</hi> one of his Nobles
Marry'd a <hi>Ravenſcroft:</hi> He Marry'd, 'tis ſaid, (<hi>Ex
perantiquiſſima Ravenſcroftorum Familia</hi>) out of the
moſt, or very ancient Family of the <hi>Ravenſcroft</hi>'s.
From thence, Sir, you are deſcended. I boaſt the
ſame; but wiſh I cou'd boaſt the ſame Virtues too,
that make you Eminent, and a Glory to the Name,
your prudent government of your ſelf your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
<pb facs="tcp:62324:3"/>
your Bounty, your Affability, and above all,
your Principles of Honour and Loyalty. Intereſt
ſways you not, nor gives a Byas to your Actions:
They all aim at Virtue, and there you nobly win
the Game. Diſtreſs makes you not ſlight your Friend
nor ſwerve from being Juſt.</p>
            <p>But while I am ſpeaking truth of you, I may ſeem
to flatter my ſelf, that bear your Name; therefore
I will not proceed to enumerate your Praiſes, leſt it
ſhould be thought I arrogate to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>This humble piece, which I dedicate to you, is
the moſt trivial of any that have paſt my hands:
Yet it has ſtood the Teſt of the Stage, with great
ſucceſs: But now it launches into the world in Print,
it wants the ſupport of ſome eminent perſon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
it. Therefore, Sir, I prefix your name, to be
its Refuge and Defence. If your Cand our will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
its faults and imperfections, the world will
then by your example favourably receive and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
it, if not for its own merits, at leaſt for yours,
which command all Tongues to praiſe you, and all,
Hearts to Love you. With this, I dedicate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
my ſelf to your Friendſhip and Service, hoping
that a future Intimacy and farther Acquaintance,
may eſtabliſh me in your favour, and give me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opportunities to ſhow how much, and how en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I eſteem a perſon of your Worth and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>

            <l>To day expect no Pageant Decoration,</l>
            <l>This Lord May'rs Show began the Reformation:</l>
            <l>Yet is our Entertainment odd and new;</l>
            <l>We've in our Show the Firſt of Cuckolds too:</l>
            <l>And what we call a Maſque ſome will allow</l>
            <l>To be an Op'ra, as the World goes now.</l>
            <l>So is your poyſoning Quack miſcall'd a Doctor,</l>
            <l>And your worſt Mimick calls himſelf an Actor.</l>
            <l>So your dull Scribbler (to our Coſt we know it)</l>
            <l>Writes a damn'd Play, and is miſnam'd a Poet.</l>
            <l>Once Song and Dance cou'd buoy up want of Thinking,</l>
            <l>But now thoſe Bladders can't prevent its Sinking:</l>
            <l>Plays grow ſo heavy, that thoſe helps are vain;</l>
            <l>Three times they ſink, and never riſe again.</l>
            <l>Well, if our Neighbours the Precedence claim,</l>
            <l>For good dull Stuff we'll not diſpute with them.</l>
            <l>Our Medley is perhaps as much too light,</l>
            <l>But let it paſs—We don't take Money yet by weight.</l>
            <l>By Sympathy, 't ſhou'd pleaſe the Beaux, I know,</l>
            <l>For in all things an Op'ra's like a Beau.</l>

            <l>Both odd in Dreſs, and ſhifting ſtill the Scene;</l>
            <l>Each dances, ſings, and moves like a Machine.</l>
            <l>To be admir'd, 'tis at a vaſt Expence;</l>
            <l>It loves ſoft words, but cares not much for ſence;</l>
            <l>For by its Nature 'twas deſign'd' for ſhow;</l>
            <l>Why, 'tis an Op'ra but to dreſs a Beau.</l>

                  <p>No matter for that; he is in diſguiſe, and ſits

                  <p>Yes Madam; and upon ſuch terms as few Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are diſpleas'd with. You may ſcruple my age, but
when you know, I will take her without a Portion, and
mean to ſettle a good joynture on her, allow her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
for Pin-Money, keep her a Coach, a Chariot, and
two Footmen; and give her every New-years-day, a
hundred Guineas in an Embroidered Purſe, to fool away;
I hope, that ſcruple will be remov'd. Beſides, Mr. Doctor

                  <p>Hold there, good Mr. <hi>Gerald;</hi> theſe things require
conſideration; your Ages are moſt unſutable. Many
young Women have been ruin'd by ſuch unequal Matches.
Youth and Age cannot agree: An old Man may be
fond of a young Woman, but a young Woman of an old
Man never. But to avoid all inconveniencies, and fatal
accidents, that may happen to our Family, by ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion'd

then I made him an eloquent Oration, to let him ſee how
I had profited: This melted his hard heart, made his old
