            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The firme hope of your wonted gentlenes, not any good ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of myne owne labour, made me thus presumptuously to craue your worships patronage for my poore booke. A pretty
<pb facs="tcp:11915:3"/>
aunswere is reported by some to be made by <hi>Apelles</hi> to King <hi>Alexander,</hi> who (in disport) taking vp one of his pensilles to drawe a line, &amp; asking the Paynters iudgment of his draught, <hi>It is doone</hi> (quoth Apelles) <hi>like a King:</hi> meaning indeede it was drawen as he pleased, but was nothing lesse then good workmanshippe. My selfe in like sort, taking vppon me, to make a draught of <hi>English Poetry,</hi> and requesting your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyps censure of the same, you wyll perhaps gyue me thys ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, <hi>It was doone like a Scholler,</hi> meaning, as I could, but indeede more like to a learner, then one through grounded in Poeticall workmanship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> in drawing his lyne, leaned sometime too hard, otherwhyle too soft, as neuer hauing beene apprentice to the Arte: I in drawing this Poeticall discourse, make it some where to straight (leauing out the cheefe colloures and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Poetry) in an other place to wyde (stuffing in peeces little pertinent to true Poetry) as one neuer acquainted wyth the learned Muses. VVhat then? as he being a king, myght meddle in what Scyence him listed, though therein hee had no skyll: so I beeing a learner, wyll trye my cunning in some parts of Learning, though neuer so simple.</p>
            <p>Nowe, as for my saucie pressing vppon your expected fauor in crauing your iudgment, I beseech you let me make thys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse: that whereas true Gentilitie did neuer withdrawe her louing affection from louely Lady Learning, so I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that your worshyppe cannot chuse, but continue your wonted fauourable benignitie towardes all the indeuourers to learning, of which corporation I doo indeede professe my selfe one sillie member.</p>
            <p>For sith the wryters of all ages, haue sought as an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bulwarke and stedfast sauegarde the patronage of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, (a shielde as sure as can be to learning) wherin to shrowde

and safelye place their seuerall inuentions: why should not I seeke some harbour for my poore trauell to reste and staye vppon, beeing of it selfe vnable to shyft the carping cauilles and byting scornes of lewde controllers?</p>
            <p>And in trueth, where myght I rather choose a sure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and readye refuge for the same, then where I see per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte Gentilitye, and noblenesse of minde, to be faste lyncked with excellencie of learning and affable courtesye? Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, adde thys to the ende of myne excuse: that I sende it into your sight, not as anie wyttie peece of worke that may delight you: but being a sleight somewhat compyled for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, in the intermyssions of my daylie businesse, euen thys Summer Eueninges) as a token of that earnest and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable desyre I haue to shewe my selfe duetifull and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wylling towardes you. VVherevnto I am continually enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more and more, when I consider eyther your fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble freendshyppe vsed towardes my selfe, or your gentle coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce shewed to my simple trauelles. The one I haue tryed in that homely translation I presented vnto you: the other I finde true in your curteous putting to my trust, and dooing me so great honesty and credite, with the charge of these toward young Gentlemen your sonnes.</p>
            <p>To which pregnant ympes of right excellent hope, I would I were able, or you myght haue occasion to make triall of my louing minde: who shoulde well perceyue my selfe to remayne vnto them a faythfull and trusty <hi>Achates,</hi> euen so farre as my wealth my woe, my power or perrill, my penne or witte, my health or lyfe may serue to serche myne ability.</p>

of that worthy fame which you haue euer deserued, then to runne in suspicion of fawning flattery which I euer abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

            <head>A Preface to the noble <hi>Poets of Englande.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the innumerable sortes of Englyshe Bookes, and infinite fardles of printed pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets; wherewith thys Countrey is peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all shoppes stuffed, and euery study fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: the greatest part I thinke in any one kinde, are such as are either meere Poeticall, or which tende in some respecte (as either in matter or forme) to Poetry. Of such Bookes therfore, sith I haue beene one, that haue had a desire to reade not the fewest, and because it is an argument, which men of great learning haue no leysure to handle, or at the least hauing to doo with more serious matters doo least regarde: If I write something, concerning what I thinke of our English Poets, or aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to sette downe my simple iudgement of English Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrie, I trust the learned Poets will giue me leaue, and vouchsafe my Booke passage, as beeing for the rudenesse thereof no preiudice to their noble studies, but euen (as my intent is) an <hi>instar cotis</hi> to stirre vppe some other of meete abilitie, to bestowe trauell in this matter: whereby I thinke wee may not onelie get the meanes which wee yet want, to discerne betweene good writers and badde, but perhappes also challenge from the rude multitude of rusticall Rymers, who will be called Poets, the right prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and orderly course of true Poetry.</p>
            <p>It is to be wondred at of all, and is lamented of manie, that where as all kinde of good learning, haue aspyred to royall dignitie and statelie grace in our English tongue, being not onelie founded, defended, maintained, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, but also purged from faultes, weeded of errours, &amp; pollished from barbarousnes, by men of great authoritie
<pb facs="tcp:11915:5"/>
and iudgement: onelie Poetrie hath founde fewest frends to amende it, those that can, reseruing theyr skyll to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, those that cannot, running headlong vppon it, thinking to garnish it with their deuises, but more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting it with fantasticall errours. VVhat shoulde be the cause, that our English speeche in some of the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest mens iudgements, hath neuer attained to anie suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ripenes, nay not ful auoided the reproch of barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Poetry? the rudenes of the Countrey, or basenesse of wytts: or the course <hi>Dialect</hi> of the speeche? experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vtterlie disproueth it to be anie of these: what then? surelie the canckred enmitie of curious custome: which as it neuer was great freend to any good learning, so in this hath it grounded in the most, such a negligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of an impossibilitie in matching the best, that the finest witts and most diuine heades, haue contented them selues with a base kinde of fingering: rather debasing theyr faculties, in setting forth theyr skyll in the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest manner, then for breaking custome, they would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to adorne their Countrey and aduaunce their style with the highest &amp; most learnedst toppe of true Poetry. The rudenes or vnaptnesse of our Countrey to be either none or no hinderaunce, if reformation were made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie, the exquisite excellency in all kindes of good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nowe flourishing among vs, inferiour to none other nation, may sufficiently declare.</p>
            <p>That there be as sharpe and quicke wittes in England, as euer were among the peerelesse Grecians, or renowmed Romaines, it were a note of no witte at all in me to deny. And is our speeche so course, or our phrase so harshe, that Poetry cannot therein finde a vayne whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare like it selfe? why should we think so basely of this? rather then of her sister, I meane Rethoricall <hi>Eloquution,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11915:5"/>
which as they were by byrth Twyns, by kinde the same, by originall of one descent: so no doubt, as Eloquence hath founde such fauourers, in the English tongue, as she frequenteth not any more gladly so would Poetrye if there were the like welcome and entertainment gyuen her by our English Poets, without question aspyre to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull perfection and appeare farre more gorgeous and delectable among vs. Thus much I am bolde to say in behalfe of Poetrie, not that I meane to call in question the reuerend and learned workes of Poetrie, written in our tongue by men of rare iudgement, and most excellent Poets: but euen as it were by way of supplication to the famous and learned Lawre<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Masters of Englande, that they would but consult one halfe howre with their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Muse, what credite they might winne to theyr na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue speeche, what enormities they might wipe out of English Poetry, what a fitte vaine they might frequent, wherein to shewe forth their worthie faculties: if Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Poetrie were truely reformed, and some perfect plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme or <hi>Prosodia</hi> of versifying were by them ratifyed and sette downe: eyther in immitation of Greekes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, or where it would skant abyde the touch of theyr Rules, the like obseruations selected and established by the naturall affectation of the speeche. Thus much I say, not to perswade you that are the fauourers of Englishe Poetry but to mooue it to you: beeing not the firste that haue thought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this matter, but one that by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of others, haue taken vppon me to lay it once again in your wayes, if perhaps you may stumble vppon it, and chance to looke so lowe from your diuine cogitations, when your Muse mounteth to the starres, and ransacketh the Spheres of heauen: whereby perhaps you may take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of noble Poetry, pittifullie mangled and defaced,
<pb facs="tcp:11915:6"/>
by rude smatterers and barbarous immitatours of your worthy studies. If the motion bee worthy your regard it is enough to mooue it, if not, my wordes woulde sim, ply preuaile in perswading you, and therefore I rest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thys onely request, that of your courtesies, you wyll graunt passage, vnder your fauourable corrections, for this my simple censure of English Poetry, wherein if you please to runne it ouer, you shall knowe breefely myne opinion of the most part of our accustomed Poets, and particularly in his place, the lyttle somewhat which I haue sifted out of my weake brayne concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thys reformed verfifying.</p>

               </gap>, which signifieth in Latine <hi>facere</hi> in English, to make, may properly be defined, the arte of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: which word as it hath alwaies beene especially vsed of the best of our English Poets, to expresse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> very faculty of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or wryting Poetically: so doth it in deede containe most fitly the whole grace and property of the same, ye more fullye and effectually then any other English Uerbe. That Poetry is an Arte, (or rather a more excellent thing then can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned wythin the compasse of Arte) though I neede not stande long to prooue, both the witnes of <hi>Horace,</hi> who wrote <hi>de arte Poetica,</hi> and of <hi>Terence,</hi> who calleth it <hi>Artem Musicam,</hi> and the very naturall property thereof may sufficiently declare: The beginning of it as appeareth by <hi>Plato,</hi> was of a vertuous and most deuout purpose, who witnesseth, that by occasion of méeting of a great company of young men, to solemnize y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feasts which were called <hi>Panegeryca,</hi> and were wont to be celebrated euery fift yeere, there, they that were most pregnant in wytt,

and indued with great gyfts of wysedome &amp; knowledge in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke aboue the rest did vse commonly to make goodly verses, measured according to the swéetest notes of Musicke, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the prayse of some noble vertue, or of immortalitie, or of some such thing of greatest estimation: which vnto them sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, so heauenly and ioyous a thing, that, thinking such men to be inspyrde with some diuine instinct from heauen, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them <hi>Vates.</hi> So when other among them of the finest wits and aptest capacities beganne in imitation of these to frame dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of lighter matters, and tuning them to the stroake of some of the pleasantest kind of Musicke, then began there to growe a distinction and great diuersity betwéene makers and makers. Whereby (I take it) beganne thys difference: that they which handled in the audience of the people, graue and necessary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were called wise men or eloquent men, which they meant by <hi>Uates:</hi> and the rest which sange of loue matters, or other lighter deuises alluring vnto pleasure and delight, were called <hi>Poetae</hi> or makers. Thus it appeareth, both Eloquence and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrie to haue had their beginning and originall from these exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, béeing framed in such swéete measure of sentences &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant harmonic called <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>This opinion shall you finde confirmed throughout the whole workes of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi> And that such was the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation of this Poetry at those times, that they supposed all wisedome and knowledge to be included mystically in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine instinction, wherewith they thought their <hi>Uates</hi> to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyred.

is of that minde, that a Poet cannot expresse verses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly, sufficiently, and fully, neither his eloquence can flowe pleasauntly, or his wordes sounde well and plenteously, without celestiall instinction: which Poets themselues doo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often and gladlie witnes of themselues, as namely <hi>Ouid</hi> in 6. <hi>Fasto: Est deus in nobis Agitante callescimus illo. &amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I doubt not equally to adioyne the authoritye of our late famous English Poet, who wrote the <hi>Sheepheards Calender,</hi> where lamenting the decay of Poetry, at these dayes, saith most swéetely to the same.

            <p>Whose fine poeticall witt, and most exquisite learning, as he shewed aboundantly in that péece of worke, in my iudgment inferiour to the workes neither of <hi>Theocritus</hi> in Gréeke, nor <hi>Virgill</hi> in Latine, whom hee narrowly immitateth: so I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubt, but if his other workes were common abroade, which are as I thinke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> close custodie of certaine his fréends, we should haue of our owne Poets, whom wee might matche in all respects with the best. And among all other his workes whatsoeuer, I would wysh to haue the sight of hys <hi>English Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,</hi> which his fréend <hi>E.

            <p>But to returne to the estimation of Poetry. Besides y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great and profitable fruites contained in Poetry, for the instruction of manners and precepts of good life (for that was chéefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected in the first age of Poetry) this is also added to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall commendations of that noble faculty: that Kinges and Princes, great and famous men, did euer encourage, mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and reward Poets in al ages: because they were thought onely to haue the whole power in their handes, of making men either immortally famous for their valiaunt exploytes and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous exercises, or perpetually infamous for their vicious liues. Wherevppon it is said of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that this onely van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb facs="tcp:11915:8"/>
he had of <hi>Hector,</hi> that it was his fortune to be extolled and remowned by the heauenly verse of <hi>Homer.</hi> And as <hi>Tully</hi> recordeth to be written of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that with natural teares he wept ouer <hi>Achilles</hi> Tombe, in ioy that he conceiued at the consideration, howe it was his happe to be honoured wyth so diuine a worke, as <hi>Homers</hi> was. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> a most prudent and learned Philosopher, béeing appointed Schoolemaster to the young Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> thought no worke so meete to be reade vnto a King, as the worke of <hi>Homer:</hi> wherein the young Prince being by him instructed throughly, sound such wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full delight in the same when hee came to maturity, that hee would not onely haue it with him in all his iourneyes, but in his bedde also vnder his pyllowe, to delight him and teache him both nights and dayes. The same is reported of noble <hi>Scipio,</hi> who finding the two Bookes of <hi>Homer</hi> in the spoyle of Kyng <hi>Darius,</hi> estéemed them as wonderfull precious Iewelles, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one of them his companion for the night, the other for the day. And not onely was he thus affected to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one péece or parte of Poetry, but so generally he loued the professors thereof, that in his most serious affayres, and hottest warres against <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> he could no whitte be without that olde Poet <hi>Ennius</hi> in his company. But to speake of all those noble and wyse Princes, who bare speciall fauour and countenaunce to Poets, were tedious, and would require a rehearsall of all such, in whose time there grewe any to credite and estimation in that faculty. Thus farre therefore may suffice for the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Poets. Nowe I thinke most méete, to speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, concerning what hath béene the vse of Poetry, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it rightly consisted, and whereof consequently it obteyned such estimation.</p>
            <p>To begin therefore with the first that was first worthelye memorable in the excellent gyft of Poetrye, the best wryters agrée that it was <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who by the swéete gyft of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Poetry, withdrew men from raungyng vncertainly, and wandring brutishly about, and made them gather together, and kéepe company, made houses, and kept fellowshippe together, who therefore is reported (as <hi>Horace</hi> sayth) to asswage the
<pb facs="tcp:11915:8"/>
fiercenesse of Tygers, and mooue the harde Flynts. After him was <hi>Amphion,</hi> who was the first that caused Citties to bee builded, and men therein to liue decently and orderly according to lawe and right. Next, was <hi>Tyrtaeus,</hi> who began to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise warlike defences, to kéepe backe enemies, and saue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from inuasion of foes. In thys place I thinke were most conuenient to rehearse that auncient Poet <hi>Pyndarus:</hi> but of the certaine time wherein he flourished, I am not very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: but of the place where he continued moste, it shoulde séeme to be the Citty of <hi>Thebes,</hi> by <hi>Plinie</hi> who reporteth, that <hi>Alexander</hi> in sacking the same Cittie, woulde not suffer the house wherein he dwelt to be spoyled as all the rest were. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these was <hi>Homer,</hi> who as it were in one summe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all knowledge, wisedome, learning, and pollicie, that was incident to the capacity of man. And who so liste to take viewe of hys two Bookes, one of his <hi>Iliades,</hi> the other his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissea,</hi> shall throughly perceiue what the right vse of Poetry is: which indeede is to mingle profite with pleasure, and so to delight the Reader with pleasantnes of hys Arte, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time, his mind may be well instructed with knowledge and wisedome. For so did that worthy Poet frame those his two workes, that in reading the first, that is his <hi>Iliads,</hi> by declaring and setting forth so liuely the Grecians assembly against Troy, together with their prowesse and fortitude against their foes, a Prince shall learne not onely courage, and valiantnesse, but discretion also and pollicie to encounter with his enemies, yea a perfect forme of wyse consultations, with his Captaines, and exhortations to the people, with other infinite commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Agayne, in the other part, wherein are described the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and daungerous aduentures of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> may a man learne many noble vertues: and also learne to escape and auoyde the subtyll practises, and perrilous entrappinges of naughty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: and not onely this, but in what sort also he may deale to knowe and perceiue the affections of those which be néere vnto him, and most familiar with him, the better to put them in trust with his matters of waight and importaunce. Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:11915:9"/>
I may boldly sette downe thys to be the truest, auncientest and best kinde of Poetry, to direct ones endeuour alwayes to that marke, that with delight they may euermore adioyne commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie to theyr Readers: which because I grounde vpon <hi>Homer</hi> the Prince of all Poets, therefore haue I alledged the order of his worke, as an authority sufficiently proouing this assertion.</p>
            <p>Nowe what other Poets which followed him, and béene of greatest fame, haue doone for the moste parte in their seuerall workes, I wyll briefely, and as my slender ability wyll serue me declare. But by my leaue, I must content my selfe to speake not of all, but of such as my selfe haue séene, and beene best acquainted withall, and those not all nor the moste part of the auncient Grecians, of whom I knowe not how many there were, but these of the Latinists, which are of greatest fame and most obuious among vs.</p>
            <p>Thus much I can say, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth none to haue greatly flourished in Gréece, at least wyse not left behynd them any notable memoriall, before the time of <hi>Homer.</hi> And <hi>Tully</hi> sayth as much, that there were none wrytt woorth the reading twyce in the Romaine tongue, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Poet <hi>Ennius.</hi> And surely as the very summe or chéefest essence of Poetry, dyd alwayes for the most part consist in delighting the readers or hearers wyth pleasure, so as the number of Poets increased, they styll inclyned thys way rather then the other, so that most of them had speciall regarde, to the pleasantnesse of theyr fine conceytes, whereby they might drawe mens mindes into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of theyr inuentions, more then they had to the profitte or commoditye that the Readers shoulde reape by their works. And thus as I suppose came it to passe among them, that for the most part of them, they would not write one worke contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing some serious matter: but for the same they wold likewise powre foorth as much of some wanton or laciuious inuention. Yet some of the auncientest sort of Grecians, as it séemeth were not so much disposed to vayne delectation: as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> that in hys iudgment he was onely a naturall Philosopher, no Poet at all, nor that he was like vnto <hi>Homer</hi> in any thing but hys méeter, or number of féete, that is, that hée
<pb facs="tcp:11915:9"/>
wrote in verse. After the time of <hi>Homer,</hi> there began the firste Comedy wryters, who compyled theyr workes in a better stile which continued not long, before it was erpelled by penalty, for scoffing too broade at mens manners, and the priuie reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Poets vsed against their ill wyllers. Among these was <hi>Eupolis, Cratinus,</hi> and <hi>Aristophenes,</hi> but afterward the order of thys wryting Comedies was reformed and made more plausible: then wrytte <hi>Plato, Comicus, Menander,</hi> and I knowe not who more.</p>
            <p>There be many most profitable workes, of like antiquity, or rather before them, of the Tragedy writers: as of <hi>Euripides,</hi> and <hi>Sophocles,</hi> then was there <hi>Phocitides</hi> and <hi>Theagines,</hi> with many other: which Tragedies had their inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by one <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis,</hi> and were pollished and amended by <hi>AEschitus.</hi> The profitte or discommoditie which aryseth by the vse of these Comedies and Tragedies, which is most, hath béene long in controuersie, and is sore vrged among vs at these dayes: what I thinke of the same, perhaps I shall bréefely declare anon.</p>
            <p>Nowe concerning the Poets which wrote in homely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as they pretended, but indéede, with great pythe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned iudgment, such as were the wryters of Shéepeheards talke and of husbandly precepts, who were among the Grecians that excelled, besides <hi>Theocritus</hi> and <hi>Hesiodus</hi> I know not, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first, what profitable workes he left to posterity, besides hys <hi>Idillia,</hi> or contentions of Goteheards, tending most to delight, and pretty inuentions, I can not tell. The other, no doubt for his Argument he tooke in hande, dealt very learnedly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, that is, in precepts of Husbandry, but yet so as he myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much wanton stuffe among the rest.</p>
            <p>The first wryters of Poetry among the Latines, shoulde séeme to be those, which excelled in the framing of Commedies, and that they continued a long time without any notable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of other Poets. Among whom, the chéefest that we may sée or heare tell of, were these. <hi>Ennins, Caecilius, Naeuius, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius, Attilius, Turpitius, Trabea, Luscius, Plautus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Terens,</hi> Of whom these two last named, haue béene euer since theyr time most famous, and to these dayes are estéemed, as greate
<pb facs="tcp:11915:10"/>
helpes and furtheraunces to the obtayning of good Letters. But héere cannot I stay to speake of the most famous, renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and excellent, that euer writte among the Latine Poets, <hi>P. Virgill,</hi> who performed the very same in that tongue, which <hi>Homer</hi> had doone in Gréeke: or rather better if better might as <hi>Sex. Propert.</hi> in his <hi>Elegies</hi> gallantly recordeth in his praise. <hi>Nescio quid magis nascitur Iliade.</hi> Under the person of <hi>AEneas</hi> he expresseth the valoure of a worthy Captaine and valiaunt Gouernour, together with the perrilous aduentures of warre, and polliticke deuises at all assayes. And as he immitateth <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> in that worke, so dooth he likewyse followe the very steps of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> in his most pythy inuentions of his <hi>AEglogues:</hi> and likewyse <hi>Hesiodus</hi> in hys <hi>Georgicks</hi> or bookes of Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, but yet more grauely, and in a more decent style. But not withstanding hys sage grauity and wonderfull wisedome, dyd he not altogether restrayne his vayne, but that he would haue a rast at some wanton and skant comely an Argument, if indéede such triflles as be fathered vppon him were his owne. There followed after him, very many rare and excellent Poets, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the most part writt light matters, as <hi>Epigrammes</hi> and <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> with much pleasant dalliance, among whom may be accoun ted <hi>Propertius, Tibullus, Catullus,</hi> with diuers whom <hi>Ouid</hi> speaketh of in diuers places of his workes. Then are there two Hystoricall Poets, no lesse profitable then delightsome to bee read: <hi>Silius</hi> and <hi>Lucanus:</hi> the one declaring the valiant prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse of two noble Captaines, one enemie to the other, that is, <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Hamball:</hi> the other likewise, the fortitude of two expert warriours (yet more lamentably then the other because these warres were ciuill) <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar.</hi> The next in tyme (but as most men doo account, and so did he himselfe) the second in dignity, we well adioyne <hi>Ouid,</hi> a most learned, and erquisite Poet. The worke of greatest profitte which he wrote, was his Booke of <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> which though it consisted of fayned Fables for the most part, and poeticall inuentions, yet béeing moralized according to his meaning, and the trueth of euery tale béeing discouered, it is a worke of excéeding wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and sounde iudgment. If one lyst in like manner, to
<pb facs="tcp:11915:10"/>
haue knowledge and perfect intelligence of those rytes and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which were obserued after the Religion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, no more profitable worke for that purpose, then his bookess <hi>De fastis.</hi> The rest of his dooinges, though they tende to the vayne delights of loue and dalliaunce (except his <hi>Tristibus,</hi> wherein he bewayleth hys exile) yet surely are mixed with much good counsayle and prositable lessons if they be wisely and narrowly read. After his time I know no worke of any great fame, till the time of <hi>Horace,</hi> a Poet not of the smoothest style, but in sharpnesse of wytt inferiour to none, and one to whom all the rest both before his time and since, are very much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. About the same time were <hi>Iuuenall</hi> and <hi>Persius,</hi> then <hi>Martial, Seneca</hi> a most excellent wryter of Tragedies, <hi>Boeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Lucretius, Statius, Val: Fiaccus, Manilius, Ausonius, Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and many other, whose iust times and seuerall workes to speake of in this place, were neither much néedefull, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather tollerable, because I purposed an other argument.

Though the manner of hys stile may séeme blunt &amp; course to many fine English eares at these dayes, yet in trueth, if it be equally pondered, and with good iudgment aduised, and confirmed with the time wherein he wrote, a man shall perceiue thereby euen a true picture or perfect shape of a right Poet. He by his delightsome vayne, so gulled the eares of men with his deuises, that, although corruption bare such sway in most matters, that learning and truth might skant bée admitted to shewe it selfe, yet without controllment, myght hée gyrde at the vices and abuses of all states, and gawle with very sharpe and eger inuentions, which he did so learnedly and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly, that none therefore would call him into question. For such was his bolde spyrit, that what enormities he saw in any, he would not spare to pay them home, eyther in playne words, or els in some prety and pleasaunt couert, that the simplest might espy him.</p>
            <p>Néere in time vnto him was <hi>Lydgate</hi> a Poet, surely for good proportion of his verse, and méetely currant style, as the time affoorded comparable with <hi>Chawcer,</hi> yet more occupyed in supersticious and odde matters, then was requesite in so good a wytte: which, though he handled them commendably, yet the matters themselues béeing not so commendable, hys estimation hath béene the lesse. The next of our auncient Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, that I can tell of, I suppose to be <hi>Pierce Ploughman,</hi> who in hys dooinges is somewhat harshe and obscure, but indéede a
<pb facs="tcp:11915:12"/>
very pithy wryter, and (to hys commendation I speake it) was the first that I haue séene, that obserued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quantity of our verse without the curiosity of Ryme.</p>
            <p>Since these I knowe none other tyll the time of <hi>Skelton,</hi> who writ in the time of kyng <hi>Henry</hi> the eyght, who as indéede he obtayned the Lawrell-Garland, so may I wyth good ryght yéelde him the title of a Poet: hée was doubtles a pleasant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyted fellowe, and of a very sharpe wytte, excéeding bolde, and would nyppe to the very quicke where he once sette holde. Next hym I thynke I may place master <hi>George Gaskoyne,</hi> as paine full a Souldier in the affayres of hys Prince and Country, as he was a wytty Poet in his wryting: whose commendations, because I found in one of better iudgment then my selfe, I wyl sette downe hys wordes, and suppresse myne owne, of hym thus wryteth <hi>E. K.</hi> vppon the ninth <hi>AEglogue</hi> of the new Poet.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>George Gaskoyne</hi> a wytty Gentleman, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chéefe of our late rymers, who and if some partes of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wanted not (albeit is well knowne he altogether wanted not learning) no doubt would haue attayned to the excellencye of those famous Poets. For gyfts of wytt, and naturall prompt nes appeare in him aboundantly. I might next speake of the dyuers workes of the olde Earle of <hi>Surrey:</hi> of the L. <hi>Vaus,</hi> of <hi>Norton,</hi> of <hi>Bristow, Edwardes, Tusser, Churchyard. VVyl: Hunnis: Haiwood: Sand: Hyll: S. Y. M. D.</hi> and many others, but to speake of their seuerall gyfts, and aboundant skyll shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth by them in many pretty and learned workes, woulde make my discourse much more tedious.</p>
            <p>I may not omitte the deserued commendations of many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and noble Lordes, and Gentlemen, in her Maiesties Courte, which in the rare deuises of Poetry, haue béene and yet are most excellent skylfull, among whom, the right honourable Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> may challenge to him selfe the tytle of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most excellent among the rest. I can no longer forget those learned Gentlemen which tooke such profitable paynes in translating the Latine Poets into our English tongue, whose desertes in that behalfe are more then I can vtter. Among these, I euer estéemed, and while I lyue, in my conceyt I shall account Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb facs="tcp:11915:12"/>
               <hi>D. Phaer:</hi> without doubt the best: who as indéede hee had the best péece of Poetry whereon to sette a most gallant verse, so performed he it accordingly, and in such sort, as in my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I thinke would scarcely be doone againe, if it were to doo again. Notwithstanding, I speak it but as myne own fancy, not preiudiciall to those that list to thinke otherwyse. Hys worke whereof I speake, is the englishing of <hi>AEneidos</hi> of <hi>Virgill,</hi> so farre foorth as it pleased God to spare him life, which was to the halfe part of the tenth Booke, the rest béeing since wyth no lesse commendations finished, by that worthy scholler and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Phisition Master <hi>Thomas Twyne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Equally with him may I well adioyne Master <hi>Arthur Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> for hys labour in englishing <hi>Ouids Metamorphosis,</hi> for which Gentleman, surely our Country hath for many respects greatly to gyue God thankes: as for him which hath taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite paynes without ceasing, trauelleth as yet indefatigably, and is addicted without society, by his continuall laboure, to profit this nation and spéeche in all kind of good learning. The next, very well deserueth Master <hi>Barnabe Googe</hi> to be placed, as a painefull furtherer of learning: hys helpe to Poetry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides hys owne deuises, as the translating of <hi>Pallengenius. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac. Abraham Flemming</hi> as in many prety Poesis of hys owne, so in translating hath doone to hys commendations. To whom I would heere adioyne one of hys name, whom I know to haue excelled, as well in all kinde of learning as in Poetry most especially, and would appeare so, if the dainty morselles, and fine poeticall inuentions of hys, were as common abroade as I knowe they be among some of hys fréendes. I wyl craue leaue of the laudable Authors of <hi>Seneca</hi> in English, of the other partes of <hi>Ouid,</hi> of <hi>Horace,</hi> of <hi>Mantuan,</hi> and diuers other, because I would hasten to ende thys rehearsall, perhappes offensyue to some, whom eyther by forgetfulnes, or want of knowledge, I must néedes ouer passe.</p>
            <p>And once againe, I am humbly to desire pardon of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned company of Gentlemen Schollers, and students of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersities, and Innes of Courte, yf I omitte theyr seuerall commendations in this place, which I knowe a great number
<pb facs="tcp:11915:13"/>
of them haue worthely deserued, in many rare deuises, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler inuentions of Poetrie: for neither hath it béene my good happe, to haue séene all which I haue hearde of, neyther is my abyding in such place, where I can with facility get knowledge of their workes.</p>
            <p>One Gentleman notwithstanding among them may I not ouer slyppe, so farre reacheth his fame, and so worthy is he, if hee haue not already, to weare the Lawrell wreathe, Master <hi>George VVhetstone,</hi> a man singularly well skyld in this facul ty of Poetrie: To him I will ioyne <hi>Anthony Munday,</hi> an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nost traueller in this arte, and in whose name I haue séene very excellent workes, among which surely, the most exquisite vaine of a witty poeticall heade is shewed in the swéete sobs of Shéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes and Nymphes: a worke well worthy to be viewed, and to bée estéemed as very rare Poetrie. With these I may place <hi>Iohn Graunge, Knyght, VVylmott, Darrell, F. C. F. K. G. B.</hi> and many other, whose names come not nowe to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce.</p>
            <p>This place haue I purposely reserued for one, who if not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet in my iudgement principally deserueth the tytle of the rightest English Poet, that euer I read: that is, the Author of the Shéepeheardes Kalender, intituled to the woorthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Master <hi>Phillip Sydney:</hi> whether it was Master <hi>Sp.</hi> or what rare Scholler in Pembrooke Hall soeuer, because himself and his fréendes, for what respect I knowe not, would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it, I force not greatly to sette downe: sorry I am that I can not find none other with whom I might couple him in this <hi>Catalogue,</hi> in his rare gyft of Poetry: although one there is, though nowe long since, seriously occupied in grauer studies, (Master <hi>Gabriell Haruey)</hi> yet, as he was once his most special fréende and fellow Poet, so because he hath taken such paynes, not onely in his Latin Poetry (for which he enioyed great com mendations of the best both in iudgment and dignity in thys Realme) but also to reforme our English verse, and to beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the same with braue deuises, o which I thinke the chéefe lye bidde in hatefull obscurity: therefore wyll I aduenture to sette them together, as two of the rarest witts, and learnedst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb facs="tcp:11915:13"/>
of Poetrie in England. Whose worthy and notable skyl in this faculty, I would wysh if their high dignities and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous businesses would permit, they would styll graunt to bee a furtheraunce to that reformed kinde of Poetry, which Master <hi>Haruey</hi> did once beginne to ratify: and surely in mine opinion, if hée had chosen some grauer matter, and handled but with halfe that skyll, which I knowe he could haue doone, and not powred it foorth at a venture, as a thinge betwéene iest and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, it had taken greater effect then it did.</p>
            <p>As for the other Gentleman, if it would please him or hys fréendes to let those excellent <hi>Poemes,</hi> whereof I know he hath plenty, come abroad, as his Dreames, his Legends, his Court of <hi>Cupid,</hi> his English Poet with other: he shoulde not onely stay the rude pens of my selfe and others, but-also satisfye the thirsty desires of many which desire nothing more, then to see more of hys rare inuentions. If I ioyne to Master <hi>Haruey</hi> hys two Brethren, I am assured, though they be both busied with great and waighty callinges (the one a godly and learned Diuine, the other a famous and skylfull Phisition) yet if they lysted to sette to their helping handes to Poetry, they would as much beautify and adorne it as any others.</p>
            <p>If I let passe the vncountable rabble of ryming Ballet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and compylers of sencelesse sonets, who be most busy, to stuffe euery stall full of grosse deuises and vnlearned Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets: I trust I shall with the best sort be held excused. For though many such can frame an Alehouse song of fiue or sixe score verses, hobbling vppon some tune of a Northen Iygge, or Robyn hoode, or La lubber &amp;c. And perhappes obserue iust nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of sillables, eyght in one line, sixe in an other, and there withall an A to make a iercke in the ende: yet if these might be accounted Poets (as it is sayde some of them make meanes to be promoted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lawrell) surely we shall shortly haue whole swarmes of Poets: and euery one that can frame a Booke in Ryme, though for want of matter, it be but in commendations of Copper noses or Bottle Ale, wyll catch at the Garlande due to Poets: whose potticall poeticall (I should say) heades, I would wyshe, at their worshipfull comencements might in
<pb facs="tcp:11915:14"/>
steede of Lawrell; be gorgiously garnished with fayre greene Barley, in token of their good affection to our Englishe Malt. One speaketh thus homely of them, with whose words I wyll content my selfe for thys time, because I woulde not bee too broade wyth them in myne owne speeche.</p>
            <p>In regarde (he meaneth of the learned framing the newe Poets workes which writt the Sheepheardes Calender.) I scorne and spue out the rakehelly rout of our ragged Kymers, (for so themselues vse to hunt the Letter) which without lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning boaste, without iudgment iangle, without reason rage and fume, as if some instinct of poeticall spyrite had newlie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished them, aboue the meanesse of common capacity. And bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midst of all their brauery, suddainly for want of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or of Kyme, or hauing forgotten their former conceyt, they seeme to be so payned and trauelled in theyr remembraunce, as it were a woman in Chyldbyrth, or as that same <hi>Pythia</hi> when the traunce came vpon her. <hi>Os rabidum fera corda domans &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THus farre foorth haue I aduentured to sette downe part of my simple iudgement concerning those Poets, with whom for the most part I haue beene acquainted through myne owne reading: which though it may seeme something impertinent to the tytle of my Booke, yet I trust the courteous Keaders wyll pardon me, considering that poetry is not of that grounde and antiquity in our English tongue, but that speaking thereof on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it is English, would seeme like vnto the drawing of ones pycture without a heade.</p>
            <p>Nowe therefore by your gentle patience, wyll I wyth like breuity make tryall, what I can say concerning our Englishe Poetry, first in the matter thereof, then in the forme, that is, the manner of our verse: yet so as I must euermore haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to those times and wryters, whereon the English poetry taketh as it were the discent and proprietye.
<pb facs="tcp:11915:14"/>
English Poetry therefore béeing considered according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon custome and auncient vse, is, where any worke is learned ly compiled in measurable spéeche, and framed in wordes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning number or proportion of iust syllables, delighting the readers or hearers as well by the apt and decent framing of wordes in equall resemblance of quantity, commonly called verse, as by the skyllfull handling of the matter whereof it is intreated. I spake somewhat of the beginning of thys mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of wordes in iust number, taken out of <hi>Plato:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the regarde of true quantity in Letters and syllables, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to haue been much vrged before the time of <hi>Homer in</hi> Gréece, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> witnesseth.</p>
            <p>The matters whereof verses were first made, were eyther erhortations to vertue, dehortations from vices, or the prayses of some laudable thing. From thence they beganne to vse them in erercises of immitating some vertuous and wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their feastes: where as some one shoulde be appointed to represent an other mans person of high estimation, and he sang fine dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and wittie sentences, tunably to their Musick notes. Of thys sprang the first kinde of Comedyes, when they beganne to bring into these ercercises, more persons then one, whose spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were deuised Dyalogue wise, in aunswering one another. And of such like erercises, or as some wyll néedes haue it, long before the other, began the first Tragedies, and were so called of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, because the Ador when he began to play his part, slewe and offered a Goate to their Goddesse: but Commedies tooke their name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>comessatum ire;</hi> to goe a feasting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they vsed to goe in procession with their sport about the Citties and Villages, mingling much pleasaunt myrth wyth theyr graue Religion, and feasting cheerefully together wyth as great ioy as might be deuised. But not long after (as one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light draweth another) they began to inuent new persons and newe matters for their Comedies, such as the deuisers thought méetest to please the peoples vaine: And from these, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to present in shapes of men, the natures of vertues and vices, and affections and quallities incident to men, as Justice, Temperance, Pouerty, Wrathe, Uengeaunce, Sloth, Uali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antnes
<pb facs="tcp:11915:15"/>
and such like; as may appeare by the auncient workes of <hi>Aristophanes.</hi> There grewe at last to be a greater diuersitye betwéene Tragedy wryters and Comedy wryters, the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing onely sorrowfull and lamentable Hystories, bringing in the persons of Gods and Goddesses, Kynges and Quéenes, and great states, whose partes were chéefely to expresse most miserable calamities, and dreadfull chaunces, which increased worse and worse, tyll they came to the most wofull plight that might be deuised.</p>
            <p>The Comedies on the other side, were directed to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ende, which beginning doubtfully, drewe to some trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or turmoyle, and by some lucky chaunce alwayes ended to the ioy and appeasement of all parties. Thys distinction grewe as some holde opinion, by immitation of the workes of <hi>Homer:</hi> for out of hys <hi>Iliads,</hi> the Tragedy wryters founde dreadfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, whereon to frame their matters, and the other out of hys <hi>Odyssea</hi> tooke arguments of delight, and pleasant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nding after dangerous and troublesome doubtes. So that, though there be many sortes of poeticall wrytings, and Poetry is not debarred from any matter, which may be expressed by penne or spéeche, yet for the better vnderstanding, and bréefer method of thys discourse, I may comprehende the same in thrée sortes, which are, Comicall, Tragicall, Historicall. Under the first, may be contained all such <hi>Epigrammes, Elegies</hi> and delectable ditties, which Poets haue deuised respecting onely the delight thereof: in the seconde, all dolefull complaynts, lamentable chaunces, and what soeuer is poetically expressed in sorrow and heauines. In the third, we may comprise, the reste of all such matters, which as indifferent betwéene the other two, doo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly occupy the pennes of Poets: such, are the poeticall com pyling of Chronicles, the fréendly gréetings betwéene fréendes, and very many sortes besides, which for the better destinction may be referred to one of these thrée kindes of Poetry. But once againe, least my discourse runne too farre awry, wyll I buckle my selfe more neerer to English Poetry: the vse wherof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is nothing different from any other, I thinke best to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by the testimony of <hi>Horace,</hi> a man worthy to beare autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:11915:15"/>
this matter: whose very opinion is this, that the perfect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of poetrie is this, to mingle delight with profitt in such wyse, that a Reader might by his reading be pertaker of bothe, which though I touched in the beginning, yet I thought good to alledge in this place for more confirmation thereof some of hys owne wordes. In his treatise <hi>de arte Poetica,</hi> thus hee sayth.
<q>
                  <l>Aut prodesse volunt aut delectare poetae,</l>
                  <l>Aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere vitae.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As much to saie: All Poets desire either by their works to profitt or delight men, or els to ioyne both profitable &amp; pleasant lessons together for the instruction of life. And againe.
<q>
                  <l>Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit vtile dulci,</l>
                  <l>Lectorum delectando pariterque monendo.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That is. He misseth nothing of his marke which ioyneth profitt with delight, as well delighting his Readers, as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with counsell. And that whole Epistle which hee wryt of his Arte of Poetrie, among all the parts thereof, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth chéefelie vppon this, that whether the argument which the Poet handleth, be of thinges doone, or fained inuentions, yet that they should beare such an Image of trueth, that as they delight they may likewise profitt. For these are his wordes. <hi>Ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veris.</hi> Let thinges that are faigned for pleasures sake, haue a néere resemblance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth. This precept may you perceiue to bee most duelie obserued of <hi>Chawcer:</hi> for who could with more delight, prescribe such whol some counsaile and sage aduise, where he séemeth onelie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the profitte of his lessons and instructions? or who coulde with greater wisedome, or more pithie skill, vnfold such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and delightsome matters of mirth, as though they respected nothing, but the telling of a merry tale? so that this is the very grounde of right poetrie, to giue profitable counsaile, yet so as it must be mingled with delight. For among all the auncient
<pb facs="tcp:11915:16"/>
works of poetrie, though the most of them incline much to that part of delighting men with pleasant matters of small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannce, yet euen in the vainest trifles among them, there is not forgotten some profitable counsaile, which a man may learne, either by flatte precepts which therein are prescribed, or by loathing such vile vices, the enormities whereof they largelie discouer. For surelie, I am of this opinion, that the wanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Poets of all, in their mest laciuious workes wherein they busied themselues, sought rather by that meanes to withdraw mens mindes (especiallie the best natures) from such foule vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then to allure them to imbrace such beastly follies as they detected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horace</hi> speaking of the generall dueties of Poets, sayth, <hi>Os tenerum pueri balbumque poeta fugitat,</hi> and manie more wordes concerning the profitte to be hadde out of Poets, which because I haue some of them comprised into an English translation of that learned and famous Knight, Sir <hi>Thomas Elyot,</hi> I wyll set downe his wordes.
<q>
                  <l>The Poet fashioneth by some pleasant meane,</l>
                  <l>The speeche of children stable and vnsure:</l>
                  <l>Gulling their eares from wordes and thinges vncleane,</l>
                  <l>Giuing to them precepts that are pure:</l>
                  <l>Rebuking enuy and wrath if it dure:</l>
                  <l>Thinges well donne he can by example commend,</l>
                  <l>To needy and sicke he doth also his cure</l>
                  <l>To recomfort if ought he can amende.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And manie other like wordes are in that place of <hi>Horace</hi> to like effect. Therefore poetrie, as it is of it selfe, without abuse is not onely not vnprofitable to the liues and studies of menne, but wonderfull commendable and of great excellencie. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more acceptable to men, or rather to be wished, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> swéete allurements to vertues, and commodious caucates from vices? of which Poetrie is excéeding plentifull, powring into gentle witts, not roughly and tirannicallie, but as it were with a louing authoritie. Nowe if the ill and vndecent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations,
<pb facs="tcp:11915:16"/>
whereof some vnbridled witts take occasion by the reading of laciuious Poemes, bee obiected: such as are <hi>Ouids</hi> loue Bookes, and <hi>Elegies, Tibullus, Catullus,</hi> and <hi>Martials</hi> workes, with the Comedies for the most part of <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence:</hi> I thinke it easily aunswered. For though it may not iustlie be denied, that these workes are indéede very Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, yet that Poetrie in them is not the essentiall or formall matter or cause of the hurt therein might be affirmed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that reason should come short, yet this might be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that the workes themselues doo not corrupt, but the abuse of the vsers, who vndamaging their owne dispositions, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the discoueries of vices, resemble foolish folke, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into a Garden without anie choise or circumspectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tread downe the fairest flowres, and wilfullie thrust their fingers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nettles.</p>
            <p>And surelie to speake what I verelie thinke, this is mine opinion: that one hauing sufficient skyll, to reade and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those workes, and yet no staie of himselfe to auoyde incon ueniences, which the remembraunce of vnlawfull things may stirre vppe in his minde, he, in my iudgement, is wholy to bée reputed a laciuious disposed personne, whom the recitall of sins whether it be in a good worke or a badde, or vppon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion soeuer, wyll not staie him but prouoke him further vnto them. Contrariwise, what good lessons the warie and skylful Readers shall picke out of the very worst of them, if they list to take anie heede, and reade them not of an intent to bee made the worse by them, you may sée by these fewe sentences, which the foresayd Sir <hi>Thomas Elyott</hi> gathered as hee sayth at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures, intreating of the like argument. First <hi>Plautus</hi> in commendations of vertue, hath such like wordes.

            <p>For as it is sayd of that impudent worke of <hi>Luciane,</hi> a man were better to reade none of it then all of it, so thinke I that these workes are rather to be kept altogether from children, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they should haue frée liberty to reade them, before they be méete either of their owne discretion or by héedefull instruction, to make choyse of the good from the badde.

And in trueth the like comparisons, may you choose out through the whole translations of the <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> by Master <hi>Golding</hi> who (conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring both their Coppyes) hath equally deserued commendations for the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the English spéeche. It would be tedious to stay to rehearse any places out of him nowe: let the other suffice to prooue, that the English tongue lacketh ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther variety nor currantnesse of phrase for any matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11915:20"/>
I Wyll nowe spaake a little of an other kinde of poetical wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which might notwithstanding for the variablenesse of the argument therein vsually handled, bee comprehended in those kindes before declared: that is, the compyling of <hi>Eglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,</hi> as much to say as Goteheardes tales, because they bee commonly Dialogues or spéeches framed or supposed betwéene Shéepeheardes, Neteheardes, Goteheardes, or such like simple men: in which kind of writing, many haue obtained as immor tall prayse and commendation, as in any other.</p>
            <p>The chéefest of these is <hi>Theocritus</hi> in Gréeke: next him, and almost the very same, is <hi>Virgill</hi> in Latin. After <hi>Virgyl</hi> in like sort writ <hi>Titus Calphurnius</hi> and <hi>Baptista Mantuan,</hi> wyth many other both in Latine and other languages very learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. Although the matter they take in hand séemeth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in appearaunce rude and homely, as the vsuall talke of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple clownes: yet doo they indéede vtter in the same much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt and profitable delight. For vnder these personnes, as it were in a cloake of simplicitie, they would eyther sette foorth the prayses of theyr fréendes, without the note of flattery, or enueigh grieuously against abusess, without any token of byt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse.</p>
            <p>Somwhat like vnto these works, are many péeces of <hi>Chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> but yet not altogether so poeticall. But nowe yet at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last hath England hatched vppe one Poet of this sorte, in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science comparable with the best in any respect: euen Master <hi>Sp:</hi> Author of the <hi>Sheepeheardes Calender,</hi> whose trauell in that péece of English Poetrie, I thinke verely is so commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, as none of equall iudgment can yéelde him lesse prayse for hys excellent skyll, and skylfull excellency shewed foorth in the same, then they would to eyther <hi>Theocritus</hi> or <hi>Virgill,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mine opinion, if the coursenes of our spéeche (I meane the course of custome which he woulde not infringe) had béene no
<pb facs="tcp:11915:21"/>
more let vnto him, then theyr pure natiue tongues were vnto them, he would haue (if it might be) surpassed them. What one thing is there in them so worthy admiration, whereunto we may not adioyne some thing of his, of equall desert? Take <hi>Virgil</hi> and make some little comparison betwéene them, and iudge as ye shall sée cause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virgill</hi> hath a gallant report of <hi>Augustus</hi> couertly comprysed in the first <hi>AEglogue:</hi> the like is in him, of her Maiestie, vnder the name of <hi>Eliza. Virgill</hi> maketh a braue coloured complaint of vnstedfast fréendshyppe in the person of <hi>Corydon:</hi> the lyke is him in his 5. <hi>AEglogue.</hi> Agayne behold the pretty Pastorall contentions of <hi>Virgill</hi> in the third <hi>AEglogue:</hi> of him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eight <hi>Eglogue.</hi> Finally, either in comparison with them, or respect of hys owne great learning, he may well were the Garlande, and steppe before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best of all English Poets that I haue séene or hearde: for I thinke no lesse deserueth (thus sayth <hi>E, K.</hi> in hys commendations) hys wittinesse in deuising, his pithinesse in vttering, his complaintes of loue so louely, his discourses of pleasure so pleasantly, his Pastrall rudenes, his Morrall wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, his due obseruing of <hi>decorum</hi> euery where, in persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in season, in matter, in spéeche, and generally in all sé<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The occasion of his worke is a warning to other young men, who being intangled in loue and youthful vanities, may learne to looke to themselues in time, and to auoyde inconueniences which may bréede if they be not in time preuented. Many good Morrall lessons are therein contained, as the reuerence which young men owe to the aged in the second <hi>Eglogue:</hi> the caueate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, (which say they) is skant allowable to English eares, and might well haue béene left for the Italian defenders of loathsome beastlines, of whom perhappes he learned it: to thys obiection I haue often aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and (I thinke truely) that theyr nyce opinion ouer shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Poets meaning, who though hee in that as in other thinges, immitateth the auncient Poets, yet doth not meane, no more did they before hym, any disordered loue, or the filthy lust of the deuillish <hi>Pederastice</hi> take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the worse sence, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shewe howe the dissolute life of young men intangled in loue of women, doo neglect the fréendshyp and league with their olde fréendes and familiers. Why (say they) yet he shold gyue no occasion of suspition, nor offer to the viewe of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, any token of such filthinesse, howe good soeuer hys mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were: wherevnto I oppose the simple conceyte they haue of matters which concerne learning or wytt, wylling them to gyue Poets leaue to vse theyr vayne as they sée good: it is their foolysh construction, not hys wryting that is blameable. Wée must prescrybe to no wryters, (much lesse to Poets) in what sorte they should vtter theyr conceyts. But thys wyll be better discussed by some I hope of better abillity.</p>
            <p>One other sorte of Poeticall wryters remayneth yet to bee remembred, that is, The precepts of Husbandry, learnedly compiled in Heroycall verse. Such were the workes of <hi>Hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus in Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Virgils Georgickes</hi> in Latine. What me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable worke hath beene handled in immitation of these by any English Poet, I know not, (saue onely one worke of M. <hi>Tusser,</hi> a péece surely of great wytt and experience, and wythal
<pb facs="tcp:11915:22"/>
very prettilye handled) And I thinke the cause why our Poets haue not trauayled in that behalfe, is especially, for that there haue béene alwayes plenty of other wryters that haue handled the same argument very largely. Among whom Master <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabe Googe,</hi> in translating and enlarging the most profitable worke of <hi>Heresbachius,</hi> hath deserued much commendation, as well for hys faythfull compyling and learned increasing the noble worke, as for hys wytty translation of a good part of the <hi>Georgickes</hi> of <hi>Virgill</hi> into English verse.</p>
            <p>Among all the translations, which hath béene my fortune to sée, I could neuer yet finde that worke of the <hi>Georgicks</hi> wholly performed. I remember once <hi>Abraham Flemming</hi> in hys conuersion of the <hi>Eglogues,</hi> promised to translate and publishe it: whether he dyd or not I knowe not, but as yet I heard not of it. I my selfe wott well I bestowed some time in it two or thrée yeeres since, turning it to that same English verse, which other such workes were in, though it were rudely: howe beit, I did it onely for mine owne vse, and vppon certayne respectes towardes a Gentleman mine especiall fréende, to whom I was desirous to shewe some token of duetifull good wyll, and not minding it should goe farre abroade, considering howe slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ranne it ouer: yet since then, hath one gott it in kéeping, who as it is told me, eyther hath or wyll vnaduisedly publishe it: which iniury though he meanes to doo me in myrth, yet I hope he wyll make me some suffycient recompence, or els I shall goe néere to watch hym the like or a worse turne.</p>
            <p>But concerning the matter of our Englysh wryters, lett thys suffice: nowe shall ye heare my simple skyl in what I am able to say concerning the forme and manner of our Englyshe verse.</p>
            <p>The most vsuall and frequented kind of our English Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry hath alwayes runne vpon, and to this day is obserued in such equall number of syllables, and likenes of wordes, that in all places one verse either immediatly, or by mutuall interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tion, may be aunswerable to an other both in proportion of length, and ending of lynes in the same Letters. Which rude kinde of verse, though (as I touched before) it rather discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb facs="tcp:11915:22"/>
our spéeche, as borrowed from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> then furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the same with any comely ornament: yet béeing so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed by custome, and frequented by the most parte, I may not vtterly dissalowe it, least I should séeme to call in question the iudgement of all our famous wryters, which haue wonne eternall prayse by their memorable workes compyled in that verse.</p>
            <p>For my part therefore, I can be content to estéeme it as a thing, the perfection whereof is very commendable, yet so as wyth others I could wysh it were by men of learning and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity bettered, and made more artificiall, according to the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of our spéeche.</p>
            <p>The falling out of verses together in one like sounde, is commonly called in English, Kyme, taken from the Greeke worde <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which surely in my iudgment is verye abusiuelye applyed to such a sence: and by thys, the vnworthinesse of the thing may well appeare, in that wanting a proper name, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be called, it borroweth a word farre exéeding the dignitye of it, and not appropriate to so rude and base a thing. For Ryme is properly, the iust proportion of a clause or sentence, whether it be in prose or méeter, aptly comprised together: wherof there is both an naturall and an artificiall composition, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or kynde of spéeche, eyther French, Italian, Spanish, or English: and is propper not onely to Poets, but also to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Oratours, Pleaders, or any which are to pronounce or speake any thing in publike audience.</p>
            <p>The first begynning of Ryme (as we nowe terme it) though it be some what auncient, yet nothing famous. In Greece (they say) one <hi>Symias Rhodias,</hi> because he would be singuler in som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wryt poetically of the Fable, contayning howe <hi>Iupiter</hi> béeing in shape of a Swanne, begatte the Egge on <hi>Leda,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of came <hi>Castor, Pollux,</hi> and <hi>Helena,</hi> whereof euery verse ended in thys Ryme, and was called therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: but thys foolyshe attempt was so contemned and dispysed, that the people would neither admitte the Author nor Booke any place in memory of learning. Since that it was not hearde of, till y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gothians</hi> renued it agayne, and brought it into Italie. But
<pb facs="tcp:11915:23"/>
howsoeuer or wheresoeuér it beganne, certayne it is, that in our English tongue it beareth as good grace, or rather better, then in any other: and is a faculty whereby many may and doo deserue great prayse and commendation, though our spéeche be capable of a farre more learned manner of versifying, as I wyl partly declare héereafter.</p>
            <p>There be thrée speciall notes necessary to be obserued in the framing of our accustomed English Ryme: the first is, that one méeter or verse be aunswerable to an other, in equall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of féete or syllables, or proportionable to the tune whereby it is to be reade or measured. The seconde, to place the words in such sorte, as none of them be wrested contrary to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination or affectation of the same, or more truely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true quantity thereof. The thyrd, to make them fall together mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in Ryme, that is, in wordes of like sounde, but so as the wordes be not disordered for the Rymes sake, nor the sence hin dered. These be the most pryncipall obseruations, which I thinke requisite in an English verse: for as for the other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which belong thereto, they be more properly belonging to the seuerall gyfts of skylfull Poets, then common notes to be prescribed by me: but somewhat perhaps I shall haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to speake héereafter.</p>
            <p>Of the kyndes of English verses which differ in number of syllables, there are almost infinite: which euery way alter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to hys fancy, or to the measure of that méeter, wherein it pleaseth hym to frame hys ditty. Of the best and most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented I wyll rehearse some. The longest verse in length, which I haue séene vsed in English consisteth of sixtéene sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, eache two verses ryming together, thus.
<q>
                  <l>Wher vertue wants &amp; vice abounds, there wealth is but a bayted hooke,</l>
                  <l>To make men swallow down their bane, before on da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger deepe they looke.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thys kynde is not very much vsed at length thus, but is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deuided, eche verse into two, whereof eche shal containe eyght syllables, and ryme crosse wyse, the first to the thyrd, and the second to the fourth, in thys manner.
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11915:23"/>
                  <l>Great wealth is but a bayted hooke,</l>
                  <l>VVhere vertue wants, and vice aboundes:</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>An other kynd next in length to thys, is, where eche verse hath fourtéene syllables, which is the most accustomed of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and especially vsed of all the translatours of the Latine Poets for the most part thus.

            </p>
            <p>There are nowe wythin this compasse, as many sortes of verses as may be deuised differences of numbers: wherof some consist of equall proportions, some of long and short together, some of many rymes in one staffe (as they call it) some of crosse ryme, some of counter ryme, some ryming wyth one worde farre distant from another, some ryming euery thyrd or fourth word, and so likewyse all manner of dytties applyable to euery tune that may be sung or sayd, distinct from prose or continued spéeche. To auoyde therefore tediousnesse and confusion, I wyll repeate onely the different sortes of verses out of the <hi>Sheepeheardes Calender,</hi> which may well serue to beare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in thys matter.</p>
            <p>There are in that worke twelue or thirtéene sundry sorts of
<pb facs="tcp:11915:24"/>
verses, which differ eyther in length, or ryme, of destinction of the staues: but of them which differ in length or number of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables not past sixe or seauen. The first of them is of tenne sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, or rather fiue féete in one verse, thus.
<q>
                  <l>A Shéepheards boy no better doo him call,</l>
                  <l>When Winters wastfull spight was almost spent.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thys verse he vseth commonly in hys swéete complayntes, and mornefull ditties, as very agréeable to such affections.</p>
            <p>The second sort hath naturally but nine syllables, and is a more rough or clownish manner of verse, vsed most commonly of him if your mark him in hys satyricall reprehensions, thys Shéepeheardes homelyest talke, such as the second <hi>AEglogue</hi> is.
<q>
                  <l>Ah for pitty wyll rancke Winters rage,</l>
                  <l>These bytter blasts neuer gynne to asswage.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The number of nine sillables in thys verse is very often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and so it may without any disgrace to the same, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the spéeche should be most clownish and simple, which is much obserued of hym.</p>
            <p>The third kynd is a pretty rounde verse, running currantly together, commonly seauen sillables or sometime eyght in one verse, as many in the next, both ryming together: euery two hauing one the like verse after them, but of rounder wordes, and two of them likewyse ryming mutually. That verse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth notably, light and youthfull talke, such as is the thyrde <hi>AEglogue</hi> betwéene two Shéepheardes boyes concerning loue.

            <p>These sortes of verses for breuities sake haue I chosen foorth of him, whereby I shall auoide the tedious rehearsall of all the kindes which are vsed: which I thinke would haue béene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, seeing they may be altered to as manie formes as the Poets please: neither is there anie tune or stroke which may be sung or plaide on instruments, which hath not some poetical ditties framed according to the numbers thereof: some to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gero, some to Trenchmore, to downe right Squire, to Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, to Pauines, to Iygges, to Brawles, to all manner of tunes which euerie Fidler knowes better then my selfe, and therefore I will let them passe.</p>
            <p>Againe, the diuersities of the staues (which are the number of verses contained with the diuisions or partitions of a ditty) doo often times make great differences in these verses. As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one staffe containeth but two verses, or (if they bee deuided) foure: the first or the first couple hauing twelue sillables, the other fourteene, which versifyers call Powlters measure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so they talle their wares by dosens. Also, when one staffe hath manie verses, whereof eche one rimeth to the next, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie crosse, or distant by thrée, or by foure, or ended contrarye to the beginning, and a hundred sortes, whereof to shewe seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall examples, would bée too troublesome: nowe for the second point.</p>
            <p>The naturall course of most English verses séemeth to run vppon the olde Iambicke stroake, and I may well thinke by al likelihoode, it had the beginning thereof. For if you marke the right quantitie of our vsuall verses, ye shall perceiue them to containe in sound y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very propertie of Iambick féete, as thus.

For transpose anie of those féete in pronouncing, and make short either the two, foure, sixe, eight, tenne, twelue sillable, and it will (doo what you can) fall out very absurdly.</p>
            <p>Againe, though our wordes can not well bee forced to abyde the touch of <hi>Position</hi> and other rules of <hi>Prosodia,</hi> yet is there such a naturall force or quantity in eche worde, that it will not abide anie place but one, without some foule disgrace: as for example try anie verse. as thys.

            <p>So that this is one especiall thing to be taken héede of in making a good English verse, that by displacing no worde bee wrested against his naturall propriety, wherevnto you shal per ceyue eche worde to be affected, and may easilie discerne it in wordes of two sillables or aboue, though some there be of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie, that wyll stand in any place. Againe, in chouching the whole sentence, the like regarde is to be had, that wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede not too boldly in placing the verbe out of his order, and too farre behinde the nowne: which the necessitie of Ryme may oftentimes vrge. For though it be tollerable in a verse to sette wordes so extraordinarily as other spéeche will not admitt, yet héede is to be taken, least by too much affecting that manner, we make both the verse vnpleasant and the sence obscure. And sure it is a wonder to sée the folly of manie in this respect, that vse not onely too much of thys ouerthwart placing, or rather displacing of wordes, in theyr Poemes and verses, but also in theyr prose or continued writings: where they thinke to rolle
<pb facs="tcp:11915:26"/>
most smoothlie, and flow most eloquently, there by this means, come foorth theyr sentences dragging at one Authors tayle as they were tyde together with poynts, where often you shall tarrie (scratching your heade) a good space before you shall heare hys principall verbe or speciall word, leaste hys singing grace, which in his sentence is contained should be lesse, and his spéeche séeme nothing poeticall.</p>
            <p>The thyrd obseruation is, the Ryme or like ending of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: which though it is of least importance, yet hath won such credite among vs, that of all other it is most regarded of the greatest part of Readers. And surely as I am perswaded, the regarde of wryters to this, hath béene the greatest decay of that good order of versifying, which might ere this haue béene esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in our spéeche. In my iudgment, if there be any orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the same, it is rather to be attributed to the plentifull fulnesse of our spéeche, which can affoorde ryming words suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the handling of any matter, then to the thing it selfe for any beautifying it bringeth to a worke: which might bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with farre more excellent collours then ryming is. Not withstanding I cannot but yéelde vnto it (as custome requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) the deserued prayses, especially where it is with good indgement ordered. And I thinke them right worthy of admi ration, for their readines and plenty of wytt and capacity, who can with facility intreate at large, and as we call it <hi>extempore,</hi> in good and sencible ryme, vppon some vnacquainted matter.</p>
            <p>The ready skyll of framing anie thing in verse, besides the naturall promptnesse which many haue therevnto, is much helped by Arte, and erercise of the memory: for as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I reade once among <hi>Gaskoynes</hi> workes, a little instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to versifying, where is prescribed as I thinke thys course of learning to versifye in Ryme.</p>
            <p>When ye haue one verse well setled, and decently ordered which you may dispose at your pleasure, to ende it with what word you wyll: then what soeuer the word is, you may spéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie runne ouer the other wordes which are aunswerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, (for more readines through all the letters Alphabetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) whereof ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> may choose that which wyll best fitte the sence
<pb facs="tcp:11915:26"/>
of your matter in that place: as for example: if your last worde ende in Booke, you may straightwayes in your minde runne them ouer thus. Brooke, Cooke, crooke, hooke, looke, nooke, pooke, rooke, forsooke, tooke, awooke. &amp;c. Nowe it is twenty to one, but alwayes one of these shall iumpe with your former worde and matter in good sence. If not, then alter the first.</p>
            <p>And indéede I thinke, that next to the Arte of memory, thys is the readyest way to attaine to the faculty of ryming well Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore, especially if it be helped with thus much paynes. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together all manner of wordes especially <hi>Monasillables,</hi> and place them Alphabetically in some note, and either haue them méetely perfectly by hart (which is no verye laboursome matter) or but looke them dilligently ouer at some time, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to ryme indifferent often, whereby I am perswaded it wil soone be learned, so as the party haue withall any reasonable gyft of knowledge and learning, whereby hee want not bothe matter and wordes altogether.</p>
            <p>What the other circumstaunces of Ryming are, as what wordes may tollerably be placed in Ryme, and what not: what words doo best become a Ryme, and what not, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sortes of Ryme there is: and such like I wyll not stay nowe to intreate. There be many more obseruations and notes to be prescribed, to the exacte knowledge of versifying, which I trust wilbe better and larger laide forth by others, to whom I deferre manie considerations in this treatise: hoping that some of greater skill will shortlie handle this matter in better sorte.</p>
            <p>Nowe the sundry kindes of rare deuises, and pretty inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which come from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fine poeticall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereof though I coulde sette downe manie: yet because I want bothe manie and the best kindes of them, I will ouerpasse: onelie pointing you to one or two which may suffice for example.</p>

               </gap>ne to procéede to the reformed kind of English verse which manie haue before this, attempted to put in practise, and to establish for an accustomed right among English Poets, you shall heare in like manner my simple iudgment concerning the same.</p>
            <p>I am fully and certainlie perswaded, that if the true kind of versifying in immitation of Gréekes and Latines, had béene practised in the English tongue, and put in vre from time to tyme by our Poets, who might haue continually béene men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and pollyshing the same, euery one according to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall gifts: it would long ere this haue aspyred to as full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as in anie other tongue whatsoeuer. For why may I not thinke so of our English, séeing that among the Romaines a long time, yea euen till the dayes of <hi>Tully,</hi> they estéemed not the Latine Poetrie almost worth any thing, in respecte of the Gréeke, as appeareth in the Oration <hi>pro Archia Poeta:</hi> yet afterwardes it increased in credite more and more, and that in short space: so that in <hi>Virgilles</hi> time, wherein were they not
<pb facs="tcp:11915:28"/>
comparable with the Gréekes? So likewise, now it séemeth not currant for an English verse to runne vpon true quantity, and those féete which the Latines vse, because it is straunge, and the other barbarous custome, béeing within compasse of euery base witt, hath worne it out of credite or estimation. But if our wry ters, béeing of learning and iudgment, would rather infringe thys curious custome, then omitte the occasion of inlarging the credite of their natiue spéeche, and theyr owne prayses, by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising that commendable kind of wryting in true verse: then no doubt, as in other partes of learning, so in Poetry, shoulde not stoupe to the best of them all in all maner of ornament and comlinesse. But some obiect that our wordes are nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblaunt in nature to theirs, and therefore not possible to bee framed with any good grace after their vse: but cannot we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as well as the Latines did, alter the cannon of the rule accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quallity of our worde, and where our wordes and theyrs wyll agrée, there to iumpe with them, where they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>l not agrée, there to establish a rule of our owne to be directed by? Likewise, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tenor of the verse might we not (as <hi>Horace</hi> dyd in the Latine) alter their proportions to what sortes w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

               </gap>ed, and to what we sawe wold best become the nature of the thing bandled, or the quallity of the words? Surely it is to be thought that if any one, of sound iudgment and learning, shoulde putt foorth some famous worke, contayning dyuers formes of true verses, fitting the measures, according to the matter: it would of it selfe be a sufficient authority without any prescription of rules, to the most part of Poets, for them to follow and by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome to ratify. For sure it is, that the rules and principles of Poetry, were not precisly followed and obserued of the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners and wryters of Poetry, but were selected and gathered seuerally out of theyr workes, for the direction and behoofe of their followers. And indéede, he that shall with héedefull iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make tryall of the English wordes, shall not finde them so grosse or vnapt, but that they wyll become any one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most accustomed sortes of Latine or Gréeke verses méetely, and run thereon somewhat currantly</p>

But before I sette them downe, I wyll speake somewhat of such abseruations as I could gather necessary to the knowledge of these kinde of verses, least I should séeme to runne vpon them rashly, without regarde either of example or authority.</p>
            <p>The speciall poyntes of a true verse, are the due obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the féete, and place of the féete.</p>
            <p>The foote of a verse, is a measure of two sillables, or of thrée, distinguished by time which is eyther long or short. A foote of two sillables, is eyther simple or mixt, that is, of like time or of diuers. A simple foote of two sillables is likewise twofolde, eyther of two long sillables called <hi>Spondaeus,</hi> as ¯ ¯ <hi>goodnesse,</hi> or of two short called <hi>Pyrrichius</hi> as ˘ ˘ <hi>hyther.</hi> A myxt foote of 2. sillables, is eyther of one short and one long called <hi>Iambus</hi> as ˘ ¯ <hi>dying:</hi> or of one long and one short, called <hi>Choreus</hi> as ¯ ˘ gladly. A foote of 3. sillables in like sorte is either simple or myxt. The simple is eyther <hi>Molossus,</hi> that is of thrée long, as ¯ ¯ ¯ <hi>forgiuenes:</hi> or <hi>Trochaeus,</hi> that is of 3. short, as ˘ ˘ ˘ <hi>mery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</hi> The mixt is of 6. diuers sortes, 1. <hi>Dactylus,</hi> of one long, and two short, as ¯ ˘ ˘ <hi>happily.</hi> 2. <hi>Anapaestus,</hi> of two shorte, and one long, as ˘ ˘ ¯ <hi>tauelers.</hi> 3. <hi>Bacchius,</hi> of one short, and two long, as ˘ ¯ ¯ <hi>remembrers.</hi> 4. <hi>Palimbachius,</hi> of two long, and one short, as ¯ ¯ ˘ <hi>accorded.</hi> 5. <hi>Creticus</hi> of a long, a short, and a long, as ¯ ˘ ¯ <hi>daungerous.</hi> 6. <hi>Amphibrachus,</hi> of a short, a long, and a short, as ˘ ¯ ˘ <hi>reioyced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many more deuisions of féete are vsed by some, but these doo more artificially comprehende all quantities necessary to the skannning of any verse, according to <hi>Tallaeus</hi> in hys Ketho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique. The place of the féete is the disposing of them in theyr propper roomes, whereby may be discerned the difference of eche verse which is the right numbring of the same. Now as for the quantity of our wordes, therein lyeth great difficultye, and the chéefest matter in this faculty. For in truth there being such diuersity betwixt our words &amp; the Latine, it cannot stande
<pb facs="tcp:11915:29"/>
indéede with great reason that they shoulde frame, wée béeing onelie directe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> by such rules as serue for onely Latine words, yet notwithstanding one may well perceiue by these fewe, that these kinde of verses would well become the spéeche, if so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ee there were such Rules prescribed, as woulde admitt the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of our aptest and fullest wordes together. For indéede ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a fewe, if our <hi>Monasyllables,</hi> which naturally shoulde most of them be long, we haue almost none, that wyll stande <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tlie in a short foote: and therfore if some exception were made against the precise obseruation of <hi>Position,</hi> and certaine other of the rules, then might we haue as great plenty and choyse of good woordes to furnish &amp; sette foorth a verse, as in any other tongue.</p>
            <p>Likewise if there were some derection in such wordes, as fall not within the compasse of Gréeke or Latine rules, it were a great helpe, and thereof I had great misse in these few which I made. Such as is the last sillable in these wordes, <hi>able, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> or <hi>possible</hi> and such like: againe for the nature and force of our <hi>W.</hi> of our <hi>th,</hi> of our <hi>oo,</hi> and <hi>ee,</hi> of our wordes which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte an <hi>e</hi> in the ende after one or two Consonantes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other. I for my part, though (I must néedes confesse) many faultes escaped me in these fewe, yet looke I as good héede as I coulde, and in trueth did rather alwaies omitt the best wordes and such as would naturally become the spéech best, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wolde committe any thing, which shoulde notoriously impugne the Latine rules, which herein I had onely for my direction. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede most of our <hi>Monasyllables</hi> I am forced to make short, to supply the want of many short wordes requisite in these verses. The Participle <hi>A,</hi> being but the English article adioyned to Nownes, I alway<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> make short, both alone &amp; in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>position, and like wise the wordes of one sillable ending in <hi>E.</hi> as <hi>the,</hi> when it is an article, <hi>he, she, ye,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we</hi> I thinke should néedes be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes long because we pronounce continually <hi>VVe. I,</hi> beeing alone standing for the Pronowne <hi>Ego,</hi> in my iudgment might well be vsed common: but because I neuer sawe it vsed but short I so obserued it. Words ending in <hi>y</hi> I make short with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, sauing that I haue marked in others one difference
<pb facs="tcp:11915:29"/>
which they vse in the same, that is to make it short in the ende ˘ of an Aduerb, as <hi>gladly,</hi> and long in the ende ˘ of an Adiectiue as <hi>goodly:</hi> but the reason is as I take it, because the Adiectiue is or should be most commonly written thus <hi>goodlie.</hi> O, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Aduerbe is naturally long: in the ende of wordes both <hi>Monasyllables</hi> and other I thinke it may be vsed common. The first of <hi>Pollisyllables</hi> I directed according to the nature of the worde, as I thought most aunswerable to Latine examples, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that somewhere I am constrayned to straine curtesy with the preposition of a worde compounded or such like, which brea keth no great square: as in <hi>defence</hi> or <hi>depart,</hi> &amp;c. The myddle sillables which are not very many, come for the most part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the precinct of <hi>Position,</hi> whereof some of them will not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly abide the touch, and therfore must néedes be a little wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted: such are commonly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Aduerbs of thrée sillables, as <hi>mourn fully, spyghtfully</hi> and such like words, deriued of this Adiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, <hi>full:</hi> and therfore if there be great occasion to vse them, they must be reformed by detracting onely <hi>(l)</hi> &amp; then they stand méetely currant, as <hi>mournfuly.</hi> The last sillables I wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected so néere as I could to the touch of common rules.</p>
            <p>The most famous verse of all the rest, is called <hi>Hexametrum Epicum,</hi> which consisteth of sixe féete, wherof the first foure are indifferently either <hi>Spondaei</hi> or <hi>Dactyli,</hi> the fift is euermore a <hi>dactyl,</hi> and the sixt a <hi>Spondae,</hi> as thus.
