            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Solemnization of the marriage was deferred for certaine dayes, for that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> determined to haue the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> being in the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, hearing what Gallants were likely to be at the wedding, prepared most rich Ornaments against that day, determining not to be the last in tryall of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour at the Tilt. The prefixed day being come, the King of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, Natolia, Thessalia, and many other Princes of great Estate, with them were arrived, and the City was filled with such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of knights and Gallants, that there was scarce roome therein to containe them. To recite every particular of their entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, gréetings, riches, and what gallant Ladies were with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would be overtedious: but in briefe, there was such royall entertainment as befitted such Personages, and such a multitude of rare shewes, and fine devices, as might every way please a curious beholder.</p>
               <p>The Marriage being past, the sumptuous Banquets ended,
<pb facs="tcp:20827:7"/>
and the Estates set to behold the Tilt: The first that entered the Lists, was a Persian Duke, named <hi>Osimus,</hi> gallantly mounted and a man of goodly proportion: After whom, followed the rest of the <hi>Persian</hi> Knights, who were all Challengers against all strangers that came to make tryall of their Valour. Next came the adverse part, the foremost of which was <hi>Persicles,</hi> who appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Richnesse, according to the dignity of his place, being King of so mighty a Country as Assyria: whose sight led the beholders in admiration of his evident perfection. After whom followed <hi>Nonlus</hi> Prince of Natolia, and after him a number of most gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Knights, so richly adorned, as would haue perswaded a coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miscreant to haue become valiant: whose particular description I omit.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Persicles</hi> was chiefe of the adverse part, and Duke <hi>Osimus</hi> of the Persians, so they two beganne the encounter, breaking of staues with excéeding valour: but <hi>Osimus</hi> intending to winne the chiefest honour, for that he was estéemed the best Knight in Persia, had provided staues of tough Wood, which would not start with an easie encounter: one of which hée tooke, and ranne the fourth time at <hi>Persicles,</hi> who vnprovided of such an vnexpected assault was overturned: and his Stéed tumbling, fell vpon him, that with the fall he for a time remained without sence. The King of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia and the rest, being excéedingly afraid that he was slaine, came running off the Scaffolds to take him vp, carrying him forth of the Lists, to be vnarmed: Amongst the rest, his sister <hi>Piera</hi> vsed her vttermost diligence to recover him with whom likewise, were a number of gallant Ladyes to assist her: but chiefly the Quéene of Persia, and her youngest Daughter <hi>Constantia,</hi> as more regarding him, by reason he was Brother to <hi>Piera,</hi> and most of all lamented his mishap.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> finding himselfe somewhat recovered, at the first ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eyes, fixt them on <hi>Constantia,</hi> which by reason hée was not fully reuiued, stood still fixt vpon the first object, as it were with affectionate earnestnesse, which caused an excéeding blush to rise in her chéekes.</p>
               <p>But now séeing such a number about him, he was amazed and halfe ashamed of his foyle, said: I beséech you leaue me to my selfe; and sée
<pb facs="tcp:20827:8"/>
the rest of the Turnaments, for I haue no harme. With that he star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon his féet, and fetching a déepe sigh departed. They were all excéeding glad of his safety: and so leauing him to be attended by his owne knights, they departed to the Scaffolds, and againe tooke their places to behold the rest of the Turnament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> was excéedingly vexed, that he had received such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and in the presence of such and honorable assembly: most of all for that he vnderstood <hi>Osimus</hi> intent: presently buckled on one of his Knights Armor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With that euery one began to wonder what he should be, and the people gaue an excéeding shout: with that the other <hi>Persian</hi> met with him, whose fortune was much like the former. For his Stéed trumbling with the strength of the Encounter, they both fell downe. A Knight of <hi>Persia</hi> who that day had wonne great honor by his valor, séeing that, would néeds be the next to méete him, thinking to revenge his Countrymans disgrace: but at the first race he could not performe it, for they past by without any other oddes, but brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their staues most gallantly. And running againe, the <hi>Persians</hi> Fortune was so bad, that he was overthrowne. By this time the day was ended, and the Iudges ready to depart: but <hi>Osimus</hi> intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he might break one staffe with the stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, which they gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Whom <hi>Persicles</hi> well knew, resolutely determined to giue or take the foyle, both of them méeting with such terror, that the Earth séemed to shake, and <hi>Osimus</hi> (notwithstanding all his strength) was by <hi>Persicles</hi> overthrowne to salue his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> being vnarmed, accompanied the King of <hi>Persia, Nato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and the rest, having that day wonne such honour as made him more highly estéemed: and comming to salute his sister <hi>Piera</hi> hée suddenly espyed <hi>Constan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

such a déepe study, that he almost forgat himselfe. After he had salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the rest he came to <hi>Constantia,</hi> to whom he said.

Sir (replyed <hi>Constantia</hi>) it may be, I am but an imperfect shadow of her you so perfectly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for vntill this day I never saw you, which maketh me suppose, you doe but take an occasion of course to commend me, that deserue no such matter, neither shall you offend me: nor I deny to shew my Birth, being Daughter to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> but for many yeares brought vp in <hi>Arabia.</hi> Pardon my boldnesse (quoth <hi>Persicles</hi>) for I would not offend you, neither doe I thinke you a shadow, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect substance, and not to resemble any but your selfe: for there can be no Beauty that excelleth yours, which mine eyes before this time haue beheld: or else Nature it selfe hath imprinted in my heart an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall distinct of deuotion thereto, which perswadeth me to this boldnesse: therefore I humbly desire you not to misconceiue me, nor estéeme me of so rude a disposition, as to speake otherwise then my heart thinketh: and to account of me as one that earnestly desireth to be better acquainted with you, and will endeavour to make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for any offence giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Earely the next morning he got vp, séeking all occasions to speake to her againe, but he was disappointed all the forenoone. For she by reason of her little rest in the night, kept her Chamber, and after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next morning likewise he arose, studying which way to come to her spéech, for his affection was so great, as no thought contented him but her remembrance; but before he could bring to passe what he most desired, there arriued Messengers from Assyria, certifying him that his Father was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceast, and that their ancient enemy the king of Armenia had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred his Land, and destroyed many of his Subiects, desiring him in all hast to returne; For in his absence the Assyrians seemed like men without courage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> hearing the vnexpected newes, was excéedingly asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht, both with desire to saue his Countrey, and also to prosecute his Loue: the one perswading him to stay, the other to hasten his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The one being as deare to him as his life, the other as deare, as both Life, Countrey, and all: for without obtaining of that, he thought he could not liue, being so much perplexed, that he could not resolue what to doe: At last the speciall regard of his Country ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his heart, and reuiued him with a manly courage to reuenge, that he Commanded all things to be prepared for his sudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and going to his Chamber, he got Pen and Inke, and wrote as followeth:</p>

               <p>Prince <hi>Helyon</hi> having his assurance, with a merry heart sought out <hi>Constantia,</hi> entending to reveale the same to her: and according

to his wonted kind of Familiarity, began to gréet her: In whom he found such an alteration, that he wondred thereat, saying: My deare <hi>Constantia,</hi> this vnexpected vnkindnesse in you, whom I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéeme as my most chosen Friend, maketh me admire, whereas I had thought to haue enjoyed your loue without interruption.

Prince <hi>Helyon,</hi> if that be true which you tell me, I cannot chuse but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at your folly, that would without assurance of my Loue, make such a motion: thinke you my affections are to be limitted according to your disposition? For my part, I disclayme such interest, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce such Affection: for I never intended any such matter, nor ever did you demand the same. Then my Lord be you satisfied for this, for I never yet did, nor will giue my consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helyon</hi> hearing her answere, was nipt on the head, being strooke with such griefe, that he could not tell what to say. But at last reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Constantia,</hi> I confesse I haue done you wrong, in adventuring so farre without your consent, but yet for that I haue not thereby either dishonoured your Name, or otherwise injured you, I humbly craue pardon, desiring you to ratifie that which I haue by your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courtesies assured my selfe of: and let not my overboldnesse alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any part of your good will. For you know my affections haue remained inviolable constant many yeares: and I haue attended your liking with such feruency, as you may be resolutely assured of my truth. Then I beséech you be not now displeased with mée, but according to your wonted kindnesse, accept me into your favour.</p>
               <p>My Lord (replyed she) I cannot deny but that your good will hath excéeded my deserts, for which I thanke you: and withall, that I haue alwayes estéemed you, which likewise I would haue done still: But now that opinion is altered, neither can I be induced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue well of him that would doe me such manifest injury as you haue

What contrarious disquiets are these possesse the center of my heart? what inconveniences am I like to run into? and how shall I avoyd blame for the one, and reape content by the other? How vnkindly hath Prince <hi>Helyon</hi> vsed me, to make this motion to my Father, whose disposition must not be crost, without hazard of much disquiet? My kindnesse to him, hath caused his over-fond conceit of himselfe, and brought me into much trouble: I could haue loved him before I came to the sight of <hi>Persicles,</hi> whose guifts are so farre excéeding his, that whereas my heart loved him, the thought of that Loue is now most grievous.

testifie the depth of his affection: which at my request vouchsafe to read, and withall credit: for I know his honourable heart endureth much care by his absence. <hi>Constantia</hi> without making reply received the letter, and read the same: which when she had done, she said: Deare Sister, I thanke you for taking this paines to come to me, and not rather to haue sent for me, that rest at your command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And also I thanke that worthy King <hi>Persicles,</hi> that he will vouchsafe mée such vndeserved favour, as to estéeme well of my vnworthinesse, to whom I am bound in all honorable respect, but how vnfit I am to entertain loue, your selfe would judge, if you knew my estate, which vpon assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your secrecy I will vnfold. Prince <hi>Helion</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> vainely presuming he was assured of my favour, hath asked my Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to a marriage betwixt him and me, which he hath granted vnto: which the heavens can testifie is vtterly disagréeing to my heart, and altogether without my consent, which he shall never attaine, what danger soever I incurre thereby. Which if <hi>Persicles</hi> should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, would soone alter his mind: Therefore it is best for his quiet not to place his affections on me so vnworthy, but let me alone to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the affliction that is likely to ensue.</p>
               <p>I know (<abbr>qd</abbr> 
                  <hi>Piera</hi>) my Brothers Loue is so constant, that nothing can alter the same which he related to me at large: which maketh me testifie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> assurance thereof. Which would you but accept of, or giue me some comfortable hope in his absence, I should think my selfe bound to you for ever, and to haue done him an excéeding pleasure: for nothing but the happy tidings of your favour, can comfort him. The King of <hi>Persia</hi> will not compell you to marry <hi>Helion,</hi> when he vnderstandeth that you are otherwise bent, for that were cruelty. And I think <hi>Helion</hi> himselfe beareth not so dishonourable a mind, as to séeke your Loue by constraint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that were inhumanity. But would you yéeld to like of my Brothers loue that is every way as good as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Prince of <hi>Arabia,</hi> the knowledge thereof would soon make him returne to aske your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers consent, which may peradenture stand as well affected to him as to Prince <hi>Helyon.</hi> Ay me go. <hi>Constantia</hi>: sister I néed not doubt to reveale my greatest secrets to you that I know for <hi>Persicles</hi> sake will conceale them, I confesse without further circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that I loue that worthy King <hi>Persicles,</hi> which is the cause of these disquiets: neither did my fancy ever yéeld the least
<pb facs="tcp:20827:12"/>
conceit of liking <hi>Helyons</hi> loue, which I tooke to be rather groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon common familiarity, then pretence of Marriage. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now that you are assured of that which you request, I beséech you not to conceiue amisse of my rash confession, nor estéeme my loue light, because of so short continuance, for it shall be immoueable: but rather comfort my poore disquieted heart, with your counsell how to avoyd these inconveniences. And if that worthy King be so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards me, as your spéeches and his Letter here affirmeth, I would wish his returne might be spéedy: otherwise my sorrowes will be endlesse. For I know my Fathers nature to be such, that whatsoever he will haue, must be performed, though equity would perswade the contrary.</p>
               <p>Grieue not so much (quoth <hi>Piera,</hi>) with premeditated conceit of feare, which peradventure shall never come to passe: I will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly send messengers vnto my Brother, which shall carry such newes as will comfort his heart, and cause spéedy returne: in the meane time I will make <hi>Deloratus</hi> acquainted with <hi>Helyons</hi> practise, not <hi>Persicles</hi> Loue, who shall perswade the King all that may be, not to consent to marry you against your minde. Be then of good comfort, and in assurance of <hi>Persicles</hi> Loyalty, let no feare disquiet your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or impaire your health: For things now at the worst may haue a good end. These spéeches ended, they parted.</p>
               <p>All this while Prince <hi>Helion</hi> was meditating how to hasten the Marriage, but most of all to find the cause of <hi>Constantias</hi> discontent: which he thought was aggravated against him, by some good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit we had lately entertained of some other then himselfe, which made him prosecute the same with more feruency: and dealt so effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with the King, that he swore <hi>Constantia</hi> should be ruled by him. And thereupon, the next day sent for her, to whom he said:</p>
               <p>Daughter, I thinke it is not vnknown to you that I haue promised you in Marriage to Prince <hi>Helyon</hi>; one that is every way worthy to match with you, both for Noblenesse of Birth, vertuous qualities, and comelinesse of person. Withall, I am given to vnderstand, that you like not our choice, nor estéeme our command: which if you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you shall not onely displease me, but also loose my favour for ever. For as you are mine, I purpose to dispose of you, but if you refuse my counsell, refuse me too; for I will not regard a disobedient child. The
<pb facs="tcp:20827:12"/>
manifold reasons I could alleadge, that perswade me to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Contract, are of such waight, as I might séeme carelesse of your welfare, and your selfe enuious of your owne good, to deny them: therefore let me know your answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi> well knew that if she denyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hée would be offended; and his froward nature to be so much disposed to wrath, that before she could speake she shooke with feare: yet resolution so hazard the worst, humbling her selfe vpon her knée, she made this answer. My reverend duty to you (most loving Father) perswadeth my consent to fulfill your command, though my Loue bindeth me to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: that I stand perplext twixt two extreames: the one, fearing to offend you, the other to procure my everlasting discontent: for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to doe according to your will, I shall incurre your indignation, and in performing the same, my everlasting sorrow. For as yet my heart could never yéeld to loue that worthy Prince, who farre too wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be matcht with me. Most humbly beséeching you to consider, that inforced Loue never bringeth content, but disquiet, which with <hi>Helyon,</hi> will be my portion: Therefore I beséech you reuoke your determination.</p>
               <p>Is it even so (quoth he) shall my command be countervaild by your péevish conceit? Is this the regard you giue to my good will? Are you wiser then I? Or are you willing to displease mée? Shall my will stand at your direction? Is this the duty you owe to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or feare you no more to offend me? Haue I so carefully brought you vp, and tenderly regarded you for this? Henceforth never come in my sight, for I will not estéeme thée as a Child, but as a bastard: and withall I vow, that if thou dost not yéeld to marry him, vse him kindly, and apply thy devotions to his liking, I will vse thée in such sort, that all <hi>Persia</hi> shall lament thy case. Having given her this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproofe, he departed: leaving her wéeping the fountaines of her precious eyes dry, wringing her hands, and like one in a dead trance, overcome with griefe, cast vpon the Earth. The first that entred the roome was <hi>Helyon,</hi> who séeing her in that agony, tooke her by the hand to haue raised her from the earth, but she refusing his help, vttered these spéeches. Vntill this time I alwayes estéemed honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of you, but now my good opinion is altered, for that you onely séeke my torment: my Father hath given me charge to Marry with
<pb facs="tcp:20827:13"/>
you, which I must against my heart fulfill: but be assured never to possesse my Loue, for that I haue bequeathed another: onely my outward parts may be yours, but my inward, affections shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually estéeme you as the onely occasioner of my endlesse miseries. With that shée rose vp from the ground, giving him neither better words, nor other kind behaviour, but left him standing still as one astonisht.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piera</hi> made <hi>Constantia's</hi> estate knowne to <hi>Deloratus,</hi> who so farre as he durst, perswaded her Father not to constraine her to marry the Prince: but such wilfulnesse possest him, that the more they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him the more contrarious he was, and therefore appointed the day for the Marriage to be within two moneths. And in the mean time doubting the King of <hi>Arabiaes</hi> consent, he sent his Ambassadors to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piera</hi> hearing this, presently sent messengers into <hi>Assyria</hi> to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>Persicles</hi> of all that had happened: and withall, wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which contained the whole summe of <hi>Constantia's</hi> consent to his Loue. Who with all diligence hasted vntill they arrived there, being presently conducted into his presence: After he had most kindly imbraced them, he demanded how <hi>Piera</hi> did, and what message they brought from her: whereupon they delivered him the Letters they had brought: which when he had read, commanding his Knights to giue the Messengers honourable entertainment, he departed to his Tent, one way so much comforted and another way so much troubled, that he sate him downe in a déepe study, not yet knowing what to resolue vpon.</p>
               <p>When hée had along space meditated with what contrarieties his Fortunes were crost, the danger his Country was in, how likely he was to loose <hi>Constantia,</hi> and how difficult to attempt her posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and many other, at last he thought his Life should be nothing without her Loue: and therefore he fully resolved to hazard the same to attaine it: but so vnpossible it séemed which way to accomplish the same: For first the <hi>Armenians</hi> warre hazarded his Kingdome, whom he could not suddenly expell: Next to attempt to winne her by force, that could not be, for the <hi>Persian</hi> was too mighty: and lastly, delay might bréed a greater mischiefe then all the rest: that calling vnto him two of his chiefest Nobles, the one named <hi>Parenus,</hi> a wise
<pb facs="tcp:20827:13"/>
Counsellour, the other <hi>Thrureus</hi> a Noble Warriour, he vttered his mind to them, saying: I haue sent for you, as the men that I most respect and trust: being determined to commit to your charge the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement of my Kingdome, for that weighty businesse, and such as concernes my everlasting welfare, must for a season withdraw me: and for that I am fully assured of your Loyalty, I will vse no exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to perswade you thereto, but to order the same in this sort. <hi>Thrureus</hi> resembling me much, both in proportion and countenance, shall in my absence possesse my roome, whom the people will assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take to be my selfe, and so governe them with more ease. And you <hi>Parenus,</hi> by your wisedome order all things according thereto: Thus you know my mind: which I doe not doubt, but you will accomplish in every respect according to my desire. They first intreated him, not to depart, but when they saw nothing could prevaile, they swore that they would faithfully execute what he had given them in charge. Hée likewise telling them that he would depart within thrée dayes, which he deferred so long, by reason that the second day the Armies of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> should méete. Having ended his conference with them he returned to the Messengers that came from <hi>Persia,</hi> giving Letters to <hi>Piera,</hi> which gaue her knowledge that hee would be there within few dayes.</p>

                  </gap>il was now come and both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies met, betwixt whom began so hot and deadly a Fight, that many thousands on both parts lost their lives, and the <hi>Armenians</hi> gréedy of their Enemies overthrow, followed them so eagerly, that they began to sound a retrait. <hi>Persicles</hi> séeing that, left the place of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with his Lance ready coucht, met an <hi>Armenian</hi> Duke so full, that hée pierced the same through his body, then drawing his sword, with the same he slew the next, &amp; after him wounded others: that within a while his valour made such a Massacre amongst them, that they avoyded the place of his Fight, and thought themselves best that were furthest of him. Thus valorously did he pursue them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he was vnawares in the midst of their Army: which advantage the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> espyed, thinking <hi>Persicles</hi> life within his power, ran at him with a lance poynted with a stéele, but it mist him: and <hi>Persicles</hi> séeing him, met him so full with the pommell of his sword against his breast, that had not his Stéed yéelded, he had broken his
<pb facs="tcp:20827:14"/>
backe; with that the <hi>Armenians</hi> assailed him round about, with such vnequall oddes, being a multitude to one, that sometimes they were thrust so néere vpon him by the throng, that they swayed him vp and downe: Those that came next him dyed by his sword, their dead trunkes falling downe betwixt his Stéeds legges, which made him spring about with such fury, that he soone made them giue way. In the meane time, while the most part of the Battell were bent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him, the <hi>Assyrians</hi> had made such a slaughter amongst the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wings of the Army, that most of them were slaine, and the rest fled. <hi>Thureus</hi> fearing <hi>Persicles</hi> harme, for that he mist him with his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, soone found him out, and by that meanes rescued him from amongst the multitude: who by this time had vnhorst him, and hée was constrained to fight on foote, being scarce able to withhold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from stumbling vpon the dead carkasses of those himselfe had slaine. <hi>Thureus</hi> soone got him remounted, and then both of them pursued their enemies so fiercely, that they began to fly; and had not the day béene ended, they had béene all destroyed: which caused <hi>Persicles</hi> to sound a retraite, and befake him to his Tent, having that day done such déeds of Armes, as made both his own subjects and the <hi>Armenians</hi> admire him.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning, word was brought him, his Enemies were all fled, and not any of them to be found in the Campe, having left all their Riches behind them, being glad they had escaped aliue which reioyced <hi>Persicles</hi> to heare, for that they should be no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to his journey, commanding his Souldiers to take the spoyle and to bury the dead: and for that he had received never a mortall wound, he determined the next day to depart, which he acquainted <hi>Parenus</hi> and <hi>Thureus</hi> withall, requesting them (if it were possible) not to discover his absence vntill his returne.</p>
               <p>Having ordered every thing according to his mind, the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he departed, attiring himselfe like a Palmer; with his staffe in his hand, which disguise shadowed him from knowledge, that he past his owne Court Gates, vndiscryed: which assured him, that if his owne subjects and servants knew him not, much lesse would stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that he passed without feare of being discovered. In this sort did he travell, thinking it no penance to take paines to find out his Loue, vntill he arrived in <hi>Persia,</hi> yet not knowing which way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish

The next day he heard that the King should goe foorth on Hunting, which made him presently suppose (for that the Parke was so néere the Court) the Ladies likewise would sée the pastime, hoping by some odde meanes or other, to giue one of them know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his arriuall, that he wrote a Letter, the contents whereof were these.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi> comming to <hi>Pieraes</hi> Chamber, with a heauy heart and watry eyes, demanded whether they had yet determined how she should escape? But hearing them make no answer, sayd thus: (My Lord) since the feare you haue I should be discouered, and so dishonoured, maketh you vnwilling to haue me hazard my selfe, the time of my pretended Wedding now drawing nigh, which I most abhorre, because I loue none but your selfe: Prouide but for your owne departure out of the Court, without being discouered, and stay for me in the Euening vnder the Myrtle trée, by the Pallace wall, and thither I will assuredly come to you: but by what meanes, as yet I know not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> was glad to heare her spéeches, but he was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in mind that his misfortune was such, that he could not carry her thence, without she her selfe should hazard her escape alone, but séeing her forwardnesse, which was an infallible token of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie, with many thankes and Farewels, vntill their happy mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againe they parted: with such carefull hearts, and outward signes of sorrow, as would haue made the hardest heart of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morselesse beholder relent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> soone departed, and without disturbance: for in that habite he was without controll, and soone got to the Myrtle-trée, whereunder bée sate him downe, vttering many hearty Inuocations for his Loues fortunate escape: thinking that she alone should endure
<pb facs="tcp:20827:16"/>
this hazard, but whatsoeuer extremity should follow, should be borne by him. <hi>Constantia</hi> being in her Chamber with <hi>Dela,</hi> many thoughts possest her fancies, and sundry Deuises were soone inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as soone out of content, that many she bethought her of, but none of them séemed currant. At last, leaning out of her Window, she espyed a Countrey damzell enter the outer Court of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, with a Basket on her arms, wherein were Grapes, which she came of purpose to present vnto <hi>Constantia,</hi> for their fairenesse: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a guift worthy acceptation. The Porter knowing her minde, sent her to the Princesse Chamber with a Gentleman. <hi>Constantia</hi> séeing that she came to her, caused her to come in, receiuing her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent most graciously: the Gentleman being departed, <hi>Dela</hi> by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiaes</hi> appointment, led the Maiden into a secret chamber, telling her, that it was her Mistresse pleasure, so much to grace her, that she should attend on her, and not returne to her Fathers house: the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell being glad of that preferment, gaue her many thankes. <hi>Dela</hi> then caused her to put off her owne Apparell, and put on other that was <hi>Constantiaes.</hi> Which done, she left her and carried her homely wéeds to <hi>Constantia,</hi> which she presently put on: disrobing her selfe of her rich ornaments, casting aside all other care, but only to attaine her Loue. And the Euening being now come, the happy time of her euerlasting weale or woe, she tooke the damzels Basket on her arme, and first with many farewels to <hi>Dela,</hi> commendations to <hi>Piera,</hi> and heauy sighes to leaue her Parents, not knowing what misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes might befall her: with the water standing in her eyes, which to her vttermost power she refrained, she went downe the stayres, and from thence into the Court, behauing her selfe so decently, that none that met her had any thought, but that she had béene a perfect Damzell: and so she past vntill she came to the Porter, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her comming in, denyed not to let her out. <hi>Constantia</hi> hauing past thus farre without escape, thought not to be long in going to the appointed place, but feare and hope hastening her steps, she some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ranne, and sometimes went: and then againe looking behind her, as if some had pursued her, ran vntill she gate a sight of the trée, where vnder like wise she espyed her Loue, who before that beheld her, but in that habite knew her not.

<pb facs="tcp:20827:17"/>
to travell, he espyed a Shepheards Cottage hard by, to which he with <hi>Constantia</hi> went, knocking at the doore, when presently the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards Wife came foorth, who espying such vnlooked for Ghests, started backe, saying; What would you haue?</p>
               <p>Mother (said <hi>Persicles</hi>) my Wife and I (for so he thought best to name her, to avoyd suspect) travailing towards <hi>Assyria,</hi> by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune yesternight lost our way, and haue wandred vp and downe all this night, that we are both weary, especially my Wife, that hath not béene vsed to such vnrest: our desire is to rest our selves, and get vs food (if it may be) in this place: Which kindnesse, if you will afford vs, we will both pay for our charge we put you too, and withall rest thankefull.</p>
               <p>The Shepheardesse noting them well, thought them other then their habit declared: with whom his kinde words and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances so much prevayled, that she desired them to come in, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that her house rested wholly at their disposition. So they both entred, and willingly sate them downe to rest themselves: but <hi>Persicles</hi> asking the old woman what meate she had, she told him she had none at all: but if it pleased him, she would be ready to fetch any thing he would send for, at a Village hard by.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the old Woman went forth to buy meate, leaving them in the house alone: In whose absence <hi>Persicles</hi> desired <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> not to be offended with him for saying she was his Wife; For (quoth he) should I name you my sister, or otherwise, it might bréed in them some suspition. Withall, they hearing of your escape, which may by some meanes or other come to their knowledge, will the sooner suspect you: but vnder that name, shall you be voyd of the least knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi> was contented to be ruled by him in any thing, whose heart would now haue conceited the height of content, had not feare to be disclosed darkened the same. In which place wée will leaue them, to speake of <hi>Helyon.</hi>

The Mayden being alone, was soone tempted to taste of those dainty meates, for that she was very hungry, thinking her selfe most happy to be so exalted, daintily fed, and séeing her soft Bed, her belly being full, and being not vsed at home to sit vp late, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curtaines close about her, went to Bed, where she was no sooner layd, but she fell fast asléepe.</p>

               <p>Then taking the Damzell by the hand, who slept so soundly, that he had much adoe to waken her, he said; <hi>Constantia,</hi> be not offended with me, it is your faithfull friend <hi>Helyon,</hi> that speaketh to you: I having mist you, thus boldly presumed into your Chamber, which I found but sleightly shut, and fearing that you had béen sick, I am come to visit you, desiring you to grant mée this favour, both to pardon my bold intrusion, and let me stay to be your Guardiant: Which said, very boldly he kist the Damzell twice or thrice. The Mayden hearing his spéeches, was so amazed, that she could not speake, reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many thoughts in her doubtfull braine, what he should be, and why the Princesse had appointed her to that place: but being vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the fashions of the Court, shée thought it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome there (as she had heard her Father report) for every one to haue a Lover, she laid still and said nothing: Which animated <hi>Hely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to such confidence, as that fastning the Doore extinguishing the light, and putting of his Apparell, he leapt into the Bed: and first asking pardon with many humble spéeches, repeating with what constancy he had deserued her and how faithfully he intended for ever to loue her, he folded her in his armes, vsing such behaviour, as soone tempted the Damzell to yéeld, whom hée bereft of her Virginity, to both their contents: He on the one side thinking hée had imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the faire <hi>Constantia,</hi> and she supposing she had gotten a rich and kinde Lover. When he had stayed with her so long as he could, for feare of being discovered: for that the day beganne to appeare, hée told her that now to his hearts griefe, he was inforced to leaue her, which she was vnwilling he should doe; that by her Embracings, kisses, and other kinde behaviours, hée stayed longer then he would

               <p>The Damozell likewise espying him, was ashamed to sée him stand gazing on her with such a wilde countenance, that she blusht excéedingly. At last, <hi>Helion</hi> fearing some deceit, said: Where is <hi>Constantia,</hi> that you are attyred with her Ornaments?

               <p>
                  <hi>Helyon</hi> then perceiued that he was deceiued, and the Damzell in stead of <hi>Constantia</hi> had béene his Paramour that night, whom he desired to tell him whether <hi>Constantia</hi> had of purpose perswaded her to doe that, and also if she knew where she was.

This said, he left the Damzell, and so secretly as might be, he went to his owne Lodging; so much grieued in minde, fretting with vexation, and desperate with anger, that he vowed to be revenged, were it by neuer so cruell meanes: In his heart now hating her, whom before he doted on. Which is a signe of an inconstant disposition; for true Loue could by no meanes be altered.</p>
               <p>It was not long before <hi>Constantia</hi> was mist, and the Newes thereof came to the King her Father, who with the Quéene, maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereat, causing all diligent enquiry to be made; but no other newes was heard of them, but that she was gone, and a strange Damzell left in her stead. Who being brought before the King, told them the cause of her comming, and how she was vsed after by a Gentlewoman that wayted on <hi>Constantia.</hi> Whereupon the King caused all the Ladyes and Gentle women in the Court to be brought before him, but amongst them all, she could not tell which was she; for <hi>Dela</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had altered her Apparell in such sort, that the Damzell was as ignorant of knowing her, as of any of the rest.</p>
               <p>The King was so excéedingly inraged, that he was ready to teare the haire from his head, commanding that the Damzell should be punished: but at the earnest intreaties of the Quéene, she was onely in disgracefull sort turned out at the Court gates. The King for that time in an excéeding rage, betaking himselfe to his solitary Chamber, to study which was the best way to find out his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Helyon</hi> pittying the Damzell, being now more in loue with her then euer he was with <hi>Constantia,</hi> called vnto him one of his most trustiest Servants, willing him in secret sort to follow the Damzell, and to deliuer her a Purse full fraught with Gold, telling her that Prince <hi>Helyon</hi> sent it her; and withall, to conduct her home to her Fathers house, that he might know where to finde her. Which done, he presently went to the King, desiring him spéedily to send foorth Messengers to finde <hi>Constantia.</hi> Who thinking <hi>Helyon</hi> had reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him thereunto, with his former pretence of Loue, caused twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Knights priuily to be brought before him, to whom hée

               </p>
               <p>All things being complotted according to his minde, the Knights having taken their Oathes of Fidelity and Secrecy, and departed, the King rested: calming his disquiet with so merry a countenance, as none supposed, but that he had remitted all regard of <hi>Constantia</hi>: Which was so closely effected, that the Knights were dispersed every way in the Countrey, before there was any question made of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiaes</hi> absence.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Day being farre spent, the old Shepheards Wife returned with Provision, which shée had brought, dressing the same very cleanly, though after her Country fashion, whereon <hi>Persicles</hi> and <hi>Constantia</hi> fedde heartily: spending the rest of the day in talke with the old Woman, vntill at Night the old Shepheard and his sonne returned, who wondred to sée such Guests in his House, and such cheare at the fire, that was woont to sup with a Crab put into sowre Wigge: and calling aside his Wife before hée would enter, demanded, What they were? Husband (<abbr>qd</abbr> she) they came hither in the morning, desiring me to let them haue but House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roome: For that loosing their way, they had wandred about all that
<pb facs="tcp:20827:20"/>
night, and were sore weary. They are the kindest people that euer I saw: Good Husband bid them welcome. The good old man wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so kind by his Wiues intreaties, that hée came in, telling them they were most heartily welcome: and that both himselfe and all that he had were at their command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> gaue him many thankes, being much comforted with their kindnesse, which he found disagréeing with the humours of Rusticke people. Supper time was come and ended, and then the old Woman called her Husband aside, asking him where they should lye? Marry (quoth he) in our owne Bed. And we for this time will make other prouision: and therefore, I pray make the same ready in the best sort you can.</p>
               <p>Which sayd, the old Woman went about the same, and the olde Man comming to them, said: Because I know you not, I know not what Title to giue vnto you, but lesse then borne of Gentle blood I am sure you are not: I am sorry my wealth affoordeth me no better entertainement to welcome you withall. But such as our homely Cottage yéeldeth, shall be at your disposition. Desiring you to accept this our disable good will, in stead of better performance: my wife is making ready your Bed, which though homely, yet it is cleanly, wée hauing no choyce but onely that, desire you to accept it as the best.</p>
               <p>I thanke you good Friend (quoth <hi>Persicles</hi>) but wée shall be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly to thrust you foorth of your owne Rest: therefore we will rather sit vp then disquiet you. Not so (quoth the old man (I haue all my life time béen brought vp to hardnesse, and can endure it well, which I am sure you cannot doe without the hazard of your healths. Then came the old Women bringing a light to conduct them vnto the Chamber, which she had drest so finely with gréene Rushes and swéet flowers, that it was most pleasant, though nothing costly. And leaving them there departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi> séeing them gone, began to blush, to thinke she must be <hi>Persicles</hi> his Bedfellow, which he perceiuing, folding her in his armes, said: Now <hi>Constantia,</hi> you must be a Wife before you are Married, which name you cannot now refuse, hauing giuen your con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, vnlesse you will haue me lye on the gréene Rushes: therefore I
<pb facs="tcp:20827:21"/>
pray tell me: Whether you are willing to fauour me so much, or no?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi> betwixt a modest bashfulnesse, and a modest desire, stood mate, not knowing whether to consent or deny. Sometimes thinking her denyall might disquiet him: and againe, that to yéeld might make him suspect her of lightnesse: So that betwixt Feare and Hope, she continued silent, as it were overcome with a déepe study.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> smiling thereat, sayd: My deare Loue, I know with what motiues your mind is now agitated: if you thinke it will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire your Honour to be my chast Bed-fellow, I will rather loose my life then perswade you thereto: but if you will vouchsafe me such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as to lye by you, in the most vertuous sort, I protest it shall be no dishonour to you, for that your Virgin purity shall not be spotted by the least thought of vnlawfull attempt in me: wherein if you will trust me: you shall finde that I will vse you both as beséemeth your Estate, agréeth with your Honour, and the vertuous meaning of a true Friend.</p>
               <p>My Lord (sayd <hi>Constantia,</hi>) doe not thinke me either so immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly scornefull to distrust you, or so curious to thinke it will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire my Name to be your Bedfellow: Onely this I would wish that the Rights of Marriage were performed, and then I were at your disposition.</p>
               <p>Lady (quoth he,) What néedeth such strict performance of the outward Ceremonies, which maketh, not the Marriage: but those are truely Married, that with vnited hearts haue plighted Promise of perpetuall friendship; electing one the other by true Loue, and not outward Ceremony; For where true Loue is not, there can be no perfect Marriage, though the outward Ceremony be neuer so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly performed. Therefore if my opinion can prevaile with you, we being without meanes to vse the outward Ceremony, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme as true and constant a Contract betwixt our selues (as though it were established by the rights of the Church.) This also maketh me vse these reasons, sithence the meanes of performance of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wanting, we may neuerthelesse still protract our happinesse; for who are more happier then those that liue in perfect Loue, though neuer so miserable: For my part, I estéeme your louing company
<pb facs="tcp:20827:21"/>
aboue all joyes; and the fruition of your Loue more deare to me, then a thousand liues without the same. Then I beséech you let my intreaties so much prevaile, that I may with your frée consent possesse your Loue; for I vow never to loue or chuse other then your selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi> hearing his spéeches, and many other reasons that he alledged: At last made this answer; My Lord, relying vpon your Vertues, true Loue, and honourable meaning, I yéeld to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, giuing my consent to be your Wife for euer; desiring you to dispose of me according to your minde; for you shall find me alwayes obedient at your command. Thus ending their spéeches, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny embracings, they adrest themselues to their Brydall bed, which resembled such a Bed indéed: For the old Woman had deckt the Bed with her best linnen and other furniture, stucke the same round about with swéet Roses, strowed the Chamber with gréene Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, filled the Windowes with gréene Boughes and Flowers so thicke in euery place, giuing such a swéet sauour, that it might well be tearmed a Shepheards Paradice.</p>
               <p>The two Louers being in Bed, vsed that behauiour such Loueres doe, thinking themselues Fortunate, the place pleasant, their mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings happy, and their Loue swéet, enjoying content without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll; Loue without lust; and Pleasure without pride; He thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his joyes without compare, and she thinking none to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with hers. The Birds without singing their swéet Ditties in stead of Musicke, and the swéet <hi>Philomela</hi> hard by the Wall, with a merry note rejoycing at their pleasure.</p>
               <p>Thus did they passe ouer this night with excéeding content; and the next day in communication with the Shepheard, who committed both the Flockes to the government of his Sonne, for that himselfe would stay to beare them company; to whom he bare such an inward Loue, wrought in him by a naturall motion, that he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe most happy to doe them any pleasure.</p>
               <p>Some thrée daies stayed they with the Shepheard, being past feare to be discouered, for that they heard not of any enquiry was made after them, At last, one of the Knights that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had priuily sent foorth in their search, chanced to come into the Plaines where the Shepheards sonne was kéeping his Shéepe, to whom he
<pb facs="tcp:20827:22"/>
said: Shepheard, didst thou not sée a Damzell lately passe by this way? Not I answered he: Why, what Damzell is it you aske for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Knight either by his countenance, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tuttering in his answer, supposing it might be he had seene her, said: It is a Friend of mine that I estéeme dearely; She promised me I should heare of her hereabout, but my fortune hath not yet béen so good, I cannot tell (said the Shepheard) it may be my father can tell you, who dwelleth hard by yonder thicket. The Knight with that left him, and rode to the Shepheards house, where he alighting, entred without calling, and found the Shepheard, his Wife, <hi>Persicles,</hi> and <hi>Constantia,</hi> all together: and presently knowing <hi>Constantia,</hi> he said; Lady <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia,</hi> the King your Father makes great lamentation for your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence at the Court. With that they knew they were betrayed, and she with feare and griefe, fell downe in a trance: Whom with much adoe they recoue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed. My Friend (quoth <hi>Persicles</hi>) thou art either very vnmannerly, or thy Authority is great, that thou intrudest thy selfe into our company. Doest thou know that this is <hi>Constantia</hi>? Then where is thy reuerence to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Were it not for disquieting her, that is already distempered with thy presence, thou shouldst find cold entertainment.</p>
               <p>The Knight being much grieued to sée <hi>Constantia</hi> so disquieted, said: I am sorry my presence hath troubled her, which was contrary to my mind; for be it farre from my thought to worke hec disquiet: the King of <hi>Persia</hi> missing her, hath sent out diuers besides my selfe to séeke her, with Commandement to bring her backe to the Court, and amongst the rest, you sée it is fallen to my lot to performe it; yet such regard doe I beare vnto her, that I will not doe any thing disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeing to her honourable mind. <hi>Constantia</hi> hearing his spéeches, said; What is your name? My name (said hée) is <hi>Pisor.</hi> Art thou of <hi>Assyria</hi> (quoth <hi>Persicles</hi>) and one of the Knights belonging to <hi>Piera</hi>? I am said he. Then I feare not but thou bearest a Knightly minde, and wilt rather conceale this Ladyes being here, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray her, by carrying her backe: If not (for her owne sake) yet for <hi>Persicles</hi> thy King, whom shée loueth; and thou shouldest obey. Were it (quoth he) to venture my life for my Prince, I would most willingly doe it, and if the Lady loueth him, and for that hath left the Court, I will hazard my life in her defence: and to my vttermost
<pb facs="tcp:20827:22"/>
power procure her hearts desire. Then know <hi>Pisor,</hi> that <hi>Persicles</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thy kind spéeches and hath not sailed in his kind opinion of thy vertues; For I am he, though thus disguised. With that <hi>Pisor</hi> knew him, and humbled himselfe with great reverence vnto him on his knée.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> rising vp embraced him, telling him that he came in a most fortunate houre to doe him pleasure. <hi>Constantia</hi> with this, was comforted againe, and forget her former passion and feare. The old Shepheard and his wife were halfe amazed, vntill <hi>Persicles</hi> said: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be not any way disquieted with my knowledge; for though I am King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> I am thy Ghest, and will for thy kindnesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thée liberally; desiring thée not to discover me to any; For if thou shouldest, it might hazard this Ladies life and mine, that are now in thy hands. With that, they both knéeled downe, vowing that nothing should make them so disloyall. Then he said to <hi>Pisor,</hi> of old experience I know thou louest me, and therefore I make no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Fidelity, or doubt that thou wilt vndertake any thing to pleasure me. Therefore I would haue thée (with as much hast as might be) to Post into <hi>Assyria</hi> vnto <hi>Parenus</hi> and <hi>Thrureus,</hi> whom I left my substitutes, and to them make my estate knowne, telling them that my desire is, that they come to me into this place, with a sufficient number of Horsmen to Guard me, and the Princesse <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia</hi> home; but to let none know their intent, which I take is the best course for our safety; For if we should séeke other meanes by trauell, <hi>Constantia</hi> is not able to endure it; which also might be a meanes to discover vs, so many being abroad in our search. <hi>Pisor</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently obeyed him, and taking his leaue, departed onwards on his Iourney, leauing <hi>Persicles</hi> and <hi>Constantia</hi> in the Shepheards cottage.</p>

               <p>Most of the Knights that went in search of <hi>Constantia</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, not one of them bringing newes of her: Which draue the King into such a rage, that he séemed quite bereft of sence, causing

them to make more open enquiry, and to promise great Reward to those that could tell of her.</p>
               <p>By this time likewise <hi>Pisor</hi> had béene in <hi>Assyria,</hi> and againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Shepheards house: Whom <hi>Persicles</hi> welcommed, as glad that he was so soone returned.

               <p>Noble Duke (said I) she is in good health, and in great prosperity. I rejoyce thereat (quoth he) though I haue otherwise euerlasting cause to sorrow. For our Soueraigne Lord the King, after he had put the <hi>Armenians</hi> to flight, was very desirous vpon some occasion (as yet vnknowne) to leaue the Court, in his absence committing the Government thereof to my vnhappy selfe, and that noble Knight <hi>Thrureus,</hi> which we performed with great quiet: vntill Duke <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> one that was neuer true to the State, hearing of the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, which we could by no meanes conceale, raised a false report, that we had murthered the King: Which rumour moued the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people to such disquiet, that they began to Rebell: Which he perceiuing (ayming thereby to winne the Crowne) gathered a great multitude of them together, with pretence of revenge against vs, which when we heard of, with all the hast wée could possible, we Mustered men for our defence; but so eager were the multitude to our destruction, together with <hi>Oretus</hi> his perswasions, that before we were any way able to resist them, they set vpon vs, and shed a great number of their owne Countrey mens blood, that stood in our defence, and draue vs to immure our selues within the City. The King of <hi>Armenia</hi> hearing of this Rebellion, with great spéed brought a mighty great Army into this Land, destroying all that came in his way, burning both Townes and Cities, and destroying the common people with an excéeding great Slaughter. Which came to <hi>Oretus</hi> hearing, with such terror, that he presently fled, and left his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Rebels to be destroyed by the Enemy: Which caused vs by a Herauld to demand whether they would submit themselues to vs or no? Or by their treason to sée their Countries ruine? With that they yeelded, and we gathered all the Forces we could to resist the enemies, with whom we fought thrée great Battels, and in the same lost aboue thirty thousand <hi>Assyrians,</hi> being driuen to flight: This day againe gathering head to resist them; but being too few in number, in respect of their strength and multitude, you sée how our bodies be scattered vpon the Earth, mangled and cut in pieces: My selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I thinke, the last that liueth to tell this newes. For the Noble <hi>Thrureus</hi> is already slaine, whose déeds of Valour would containe a
<pb facs="tcp:20827:24"/>
great volume: Which newes when our King shall heare, it will no doubt cut off his vertuous life with sorrow. My greatest griefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I cannot heare of his safety before my death. My Lord, said I, our gracious King is liuing, and in good health in <hi>Persia,</hi> who sent me vnto your Honour, and <hi>Thrureus,</hi> with a secret Message which I néed not now vnfold. Yes good <hi>Pisor,</hi> (quoth he) let me heare my Lords Message, that I may thereby know whether I were still in his fauour or no. With that I vnfolded the cause of my comming: Which heard, such a passion of discontent ouercame his vitall spirits, that with many bitter groanes he gaue vp the ghost.

She likewise at the very first sight knowing him, which amated her sences with deadly feare. To whom he said; My deare <hi>Constantia,</hi> what hath caused you thus discourteously to reject my Loue, and leaue the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, to endure this hard Fortune, so much disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeing to your estate?

               <p>Leaue off your dissembling speeches (quoth <hi>Constantia</hi>) and let me alone; for I had rather all my life lye on this cold Earth, then liue in all ease with you. With that she would haue left him, but he commanded his Seruants to take her by force into the Coach, and so carry her along with him into <hi>Arabia,</hi> not letting any know what she was but onely his <hi>Selia.</hi> When <hi>Constantia</hi> saw that of force she must néeds goe, she vttered such plaints and made such sorrowfull exclamations, that those which guarded her, thought she would haue fallen mad; though neither knowing her, nor her cause of sorrow, yet inwardly in their hearts pittying her.</p>

Alas (<abbr>qd</abbr> he) poore Lady, I feare she is deuoured by some mercilesse Beast: For I found <hi>Pisor</hi> lying dead in the Wood: Which affrighteth me with such feare of her mishap, that I know not what to doe, nor which way to goe in her search.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> was wonderfully comforted with the Shepheards spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet notwithstanding leaving him, and all that Night wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring vp and downe the Wood to finde her, but he spent his labour in vaine, neither that night nor the next day finding her, which draue him so farre beyond the compasse of naturall continency, that if hée remained long in that extreame perplexity, it would cut off his life. When hée saw himselfe voyd of all hope, without meanes how to finde her, and assurance that she was not within the Wood, he layde him downe vpon the earth, vttering these laments. How fortunate had I béene had I never set foote in the <hi>Persian</hi> soyle? then had I still bin King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> &amp; <hi>Constantia</hi> in quiet in her Fathers Court: whereas now, both I, but especially her selfe, are fallen into extreame misery. Had it onely fallen to my share to haue endured a thousand more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, I could with patience haue endured them: onely this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth mée, that my misfortune hath brought her from Weale to wee: from quiet to discontent: from pleasure, to paine: from hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to misery, and from life to death, I cannot tell how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent these evils, to sit here, and vtter sad words auaileth me not: to

For I feare me she is dead, and then may I sooner méete her Ghost in this place, then her Body in another. Well, since neither comfort nor counsell is left to further my hopes, I will for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ever dwell in this vnfortunate place, and fill the same with my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: neither shall my body rest in bed, nor my stomacke tast of other meate then wilde fruit, vntill I finde my Loue, or be assured of the place of her abode.</p>

                  <hi>Constantia</hi>) that I am Daughter to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brought vp in this Court: and your Quéene but the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Countrey-Swaine in <hi>Persia,</hi> that being exalted to dignity, though basely borne, behaueth her selfe thus proudly: I fearing my Father would haue married me to <hi>Helyon</hi> against my will, having betrothed my selfe to the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> with him stole from the Court in this Apparell of <hi>Selia,</hi> that is now your Quéene: much search was made for me, but they could neuer finde me: for I lived with my Lord in this disguise in a Shepheards house, vntill one day
<pb facs="tcp:20827:28"/>
I missing him strayed so farre from the House, that I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, but by misfortune was found by <hi>Helyon,</hi> and thus as you sée brought into this Countrey, either to my death or to a worser end. I am likewise great with Child, and within short space shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. My earnest desire is, that you would vse some meanes to preserue my Babe from death, which no doubt it is likely to endure by her malice and his cruelty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palia</hi> having heard her Spéeches, Reverenced her comforted her, and promised her with many Vowes and Protestations, to fulfill her desire thereby to worke some revenge against the Quéene. In her heart pittying the distresse of <hi>Constantia,</hi> of whose Vertues she had before times some knowledge. With this Promise did <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia</hi> somewhat comfort her selfe, hoping yet in the end to escape from that Bondage, being daily cherished by old <hi>Palia:</hi> who behaued her selfe towards <hi>Selia,</hi> with such duty and obedience, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her often vpbraydings, that she still kept her selfe in most place of credit about her.</p>
               <p>The day being now come that the Quéene was delivered of a goodly Boy, and <hi>Constantia</hi> the next Night of another, none being priuy thereto but <hi>Palia,</hi> who handled the matter with such cunning, that she conveyed <hi>Constantiaes</hi> Child to <hi>Selia,</hi> and hers to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia,</hi> making her acquainted with her intent therein. The next day declaring to <hi>Helyon,</hi> how that the Damzell in her custody was deliuered of a Boy. <hi>Helyon</hi> hearing that, willing her to kéepe the same secret from any, vpon paine of death: Not so much as once to reueale it to the Quéene, vowing ere many dayes to destroy it. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Order to haue his owne Christened, naming him <hi>Perus:</hi> And comming to the Quéene, told her it were best to be Nursed in the Countrey, who was contented to be ruled by him. Then calling to him <hi>Palia,</hi> he told her, that shée must needs provide a Nurse for his Sonne, who already hauing complotted what she intended, told him that she knew a kins-woman of hers, that was lately brought to Bed, some twenty miles off in the Countrey, to whom she would (if it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him) conuey the Infant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helyon</hi> was glad of her promise, appointing her all things fit for her departure, the next morning. Late in the Evening, when <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> was sure none could sée her, shée went to <hi>Constantia,</hi> telling her
<pb facs="tcp:20827:29"/>
what she had intended: Withall, asking her counsell what hée should doe.</p>
               <p>Aye me, (quoth <hi>Constantia</hi>) I know not in this extremity what to resolue vpon, fearing never to see my Sonne againe: and if thou goest I loose my greatest comfort. Then taking the Chiloc in her armes, and bestowing many Teare-wet kisses thereon, she said <hi>Palia,</hi> I pray thee let me know what thou intendest to doe with it? Lady (quoth she) if you perswade me not to the contrary, after I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this Court, I will never leaue trauelling vntill I arriue in <hi>Assyria:</hi> where I doe not doubt but to find <hi>Persicles,</hi> vnto whom I will declare your misfortunes: But if I finde him not there, I will then Trauell into <hi>Persia,</hi> to the place where you lost him, where I shall then assuredly find him: that he (knowing your estate) may seeke to release you. And wilt thou doe this for in (said <hi>Constantia</hi>) that am neuer likely to make thée amends? I will (<abbr>qd</abbr> 
                  <hi>Palia</hi>) and with such faithfulnesse execute the charge I vndertake, as shall turne to thy everlasting quiet.</p>
               <p>Many speeches past betwixt them before they parted, but yet in the end shee was constrained to leaue <hi>Constantia,</hi> almost dead with griefe, but afterwards somewhat comforted, with the good hope she had of her faithfull dealing: Of two evils thinking it the best to commit the Babe to her custody, who by all likelyhoods inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded well thereto. Early the next Morning <hi>Palia</hi> departed, hauing none in her Company, with all the hast she could trauelling towards <hi>Assyria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helyon</hi> now beganne to meditate on <hi>Constantiaes</hi> Fortune, and who should be the Father of her Childe: and whereas before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to penne her vp in that Cloyster, vntill she would yéeld to his desire, he now resolued to revenge the disdaine she had showne, in refusing his Loue, with all Cruelty: that finding occasion when none could interrupt his spéeches, being alone with her in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he thus sayd. Disdainefull and discourteous Lady, did you estéeme so basely of my Loue, in my contempt, to choose some base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne Peasant, to possesse that which I long sought with such deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted affection: and refusing my Honorable proffer, to chuse rather to become anothers Harlot. Who would euer haue thought thy come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly person shadowed with so faire a pretext, had inwardly nourished
<pb facs="tcp:20827:29"/>
such ignoble affections. Doe you thinke the King of <hi>Persia</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to heare that his faire Daughter <hi>Constantia,</hi> (that may well be termed Incontinency) hath so vildly stained her Princely blood and defamed her Royall stocke, with so infamous a fact, or not rather dye with griefe.</p>
               <p>Therefore to prevent so great a mischiefe as will come by his death, I will be the meane to kéep thy fact from comming to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in his behalfe, worke such Revenge as shall be agréeable to so great an offence. Yet let me know the cause of thy contempt against mée, and who is the Father of thy bastard? Which if thou refusest to doe by gentle meanes to vnfold, I will by force compell thée thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi> with Patience heard out his spéeches, and with as great Patience answered him. <hi>Helyon,</hi> I can well beare your Opprobrious spéeches, neyther will I impugne how scandalous they are: For the Father of this Infant is as good as your selfe, and him I Loue, farre more honourable and vertuous then <hi>Helyon,</hi> King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> who ensureth me according to the quality of his owne disposition. The reason I left my Fathers Court, was to avoyd your importunate suite, which was vnpleasing to me, in respect of the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Loue I imbraced: therefore beware you abuse not <hi>Constantia.</hi> For though the King of <hi>Persia</hi> will not revenge my wrongs, yet there is a King as mighty as hée, claymeth my possession, and will not suffer me to be injured.</p>
               <p>What? is a King the Father of that Bastard (<abbr>qd</abbr> he?) No thou shalt never perswade mée to that, for it looketh not like a King, but is the perfect Image of a Foole. Yea (said <hi>Constantia,</hi>) and yet a King as wise as thy selfe, and that ere long thou shalt know, for the Father thereof is priuy to all thy Actions, although thou thinkest me safely kept.</p>
               <p>And if thou doest murther it, I care not, for thy selfe will be the first that shall repent the déed. And for me, vse me well, for the Father of this Child loueth thée well, and yet thou wilt be thine owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in séeking his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helyon</hi> vnderstood not her meaning, maruelling who it should be she meant, that he sayd: I thinke thou art madde, or counterfey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test some deceyt by the ambiguity of thy spéeches: for how can the
<pb facs="tcp:20827:30"/>
Father of that Brat loue me? Or what cause should there be to make me repent any thing that I should doe to it: Which the rather shall suffer my wrath, because of thy derisions: Therefore resolue me, or be assured of my euerlasting hatred. I neither (said she) regard thée, nor thy hate: vtterly denying to fulfill thy request in any respect. Yet if thou hadst not demanded it, I would peraduenture haue told it thée: Doe the worst thou canst, I care not for misery, it selfe hath made me so resolute to endure the greatest extremity. And know, that I so much the more dislike this Babe, because it is like thée, that hath no sparke of honour or honesty in thée. Aske me no more questions, for I will not answer thereto, estéeming my selfe more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in thy hatred, then thy friendship: for the one is but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate motion of a Cowardly disposition, and the other, the inconstant falshood of a shallow-Wit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helyon</hi> was much vexed to sée how lightly she estéemed him that almost ready to teare his haire, he went raging and swearing from her, meditating which way to worke hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Revenge. <hi>Selia</hi> noting his distemperature, by his pale Countenance, asked him what had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted him? To whom he gaue no answer at all, casting a scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full looke towards her; which she tooke in such suspitious sort, that she presently supposed he did it in scorne of her, and her heart being puft vp full of Iealousie, could not detaine it selfe, from bursting forth into Teares, and then into these spéeches.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I now perceiue the Loue you protested to beare mée, is altered, and I like a poore Cast away, like to liue in misery: would to God I had still liued in my contented estate in <hi>Persia,</hi> then should I not haue béene subject to these misfortunes. <hi>Constantia</hi> whom you tol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doe not (said he) disquiet your selfe with the least suppose of such alteration in me: for by Heaven I vow, I love none but your selfe: the cause of my vexation is, how to revenge my selfe on <hi>Constantia,</hi> that euen now hath vsed me with approbrious termes. Besides, she is brought to Bed of a Bastard, begotten of some base-borne Peasant, which
<pb facs="tcp:20827:30"/>
shall not liue long to vexe me. I would I had left her in <hi>Persia,</hi> so haue béene deuoured by wilde beasts, rather then pittying her, for to worke my selfe this disquiet. Should I send word to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> he would compell me to marry her, or else bring open Warre against my Kingdome: or if I should séeke her death, the knowledge thereof would by some meanes come to his hearing, and then would he séeke revenge against me: that in this extremity, I know not which way to ridde my selfe from her. <hi>Selia,</hi> hearing him say she had a Bastard, presently beganne to suspect it was his: which she would then haue vttered, but that feare and premeditated hope of revenge against <hi>Constantia,</hi> withheld her, thinking first to learne the truth before she would offend him: perceiving his inconstant dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to be such, that the least thing altered his Loue: deferring the same vntill her Moneth was ended, by which meanes <hi>Constantia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted voyd of disturbance. The flame of envious suspition, burnt so furiously in her brest, that as soone as she had forsaken the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and had a while with all kindnesse behaued her selfe towards the Nobles and Ladyes of most estimation, thereby to insinuate into their good opinion, she came to <hi>Constantia</hi> fawning vpon her with an affable countenance, and vsing many spéeches of curtesie towards her, with intent to lift out the truth of her suspition. <hi>Helyon,</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that she was in the Monastery, fearing shée would haue done <hi>Constantia</hi> some violence, followed her, and found her in quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with her. <hi>Selia</hi> séeing him there, was halfe astonished, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing he had not knowne thereof: and withall, now of a truth sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that he came to visit <hi>Constantia</hi> of Loue, and not to séeke her: againe burst foorth into teares, whereon he tooke occasion to say, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> I perceiue suspition is the cause of your disquiet: Therefore so shew what little cause you haue to vse me so, doe but say what I shall doe to this dishonourable Lady, and I will performe it. <hi>Constantia</hi> then began to feare some mischiefe was neare her, which might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily haue béen perceiued by the oft change of her countenance: who made this reply. <hi>Helyon,</hi> if thy Quéene knew how much I disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee, such motions of suspect for me, would not disquiet her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For I contemne the base dispositions, which is ready to alter with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ridde thou shalt soone be (said <hi>Selia</hi>) notwithstanding thy counterfeit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation, thinking with disdainfull spéeches to colour thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: I am indéed come to be revenged on thée, that crossest my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and first shall that Bastard féele the smart of my wrath: then catching the Child out of the cradle where it lay, she held the same by the Héeles in the one hand, and the knife in the other, ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue it of life, vntill <hi>Helyon</hi> withheld her, and <hi>Constantia</hi> sayd, Nay, Let her murther it, and let herselfe be the first that will repent it: yet first view it well, and sée if it resemble not the Father that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by: I assure thée it is his, and that thou shalt soone know.</p>
               <p>Out vpon thée (said <hi>Helyon</hi>) I defie thée.

The Péers of this Land shall vnderstand the wrongs I sustaine, and if none else, mine owne hands shall worke revenge. <hi>Constantia,</hi> then said <hi>Selia,</hi> take vp the Infant, and cherish it, for it is thine owne: My child by this time is conveyed farre enough from thy power, by <hi>Palia,</hi> who pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my distresse, and scorning to be subject to the base Pride, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged one for the other, leaving thine with me, and carrying my Infant into <hi>Assyria,</hi> vnto the King <hi>Persicles,</hi> who is Father thereof, who I doe not doubt, will soone revenge the wrong is done to me: Neither doe thou jealously suspect me for that degenerate K. thy Husband: for she that is Daughter to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be thy Corriuall: if I had dealt vnfaithfully with him, then might he worthily haue inflicted this punishment vpon mée: but his owne Conscience knoweth I alwayes refused to yéeld to loue him, my Loue being before vowed to the King of <hi>Assyria.</hi> Both of them were amazed at her spéeches. <hi>Selia</hi> with haste taking vp her sonne,

After he had placed her there, he beganne to cast about for to Fortifie the same: And first by his Art, he found that there lived in the Desart of <hi>Arabia,</hi> two mighty Giants of vnwonted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and huge strength, whom hée found out, casting such a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched Charme vpon them, that they presently followed him vnto the Castle, which he afterwards named <hi>Penthrasus Pallace</hi>; by his Charmes and Spells binding them to kéepe the first entrance of the Bridge, and by his Sorceries guarding every entrance in such strong sort, as it was impossible to be overcome. When he had performed every thing according to his minde, hée brought thither his Wife, named <hi>Ila,</hi> determined to spend the rest of his life there. Within few yeares he fell sicke, and by his Art found the date of his life to be nigh an end. Whereupon he went vnto the Oracle of the <hi>Hesperian</hi> Nymphs in the Desart, which he was stricktly enjoyned vnto by a Vision, which he saw in his sléepe, to know what he should deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine as concerning those charme, she had set vpon the Castle? Whose answer was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Penthrasus,</hi> because by thine Art thou hast not attempted any wickes Action, and to disclose the Destinies, many a Knight of sundry strange Countries shall heare of the beauty of <hi>Constantia,</hi> and shall come to try their Adventures to set her at Liberty, but yet none shall performe it: neyther shall it be Revealed, that shée is Daughter to the King of <hi>Persia</hi>; vntill shée be released by the valour of her owne Sonne. The manner and meanes how, is as yet hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and vnrevealed: vntill which time. <hi>Ila</hi> shall liue, and by our Directions governe the Castle, vntill the Enchantments be ended. <hi>Penthrasus</hi> having received his Answer, returned home, and within few dayes dyed.</p>
               <p>Thus was <hi>Constantia</hi> enclosed, enjoying all the Delights her heart could desire, but nothing could comfort her, but the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Persicles,</hi> for whose absence she liued in continuall sorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helyon</hi> kept that which he had done concerning <hi>Constantia,</hi> from the knowledge of <hi>Selia,</hi> determining never to see her againe: but within short time, such discord beganne betwixt him and <hi>Selia,</hi> that by meanes thereof, the whole Court was in an vprore, and he found such disquiet with her, that then he began to hate her, abandon her company, and beganne excéedingly to dote with remembrance of
<pb facs="tcp:20827:33"/>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi>: repenting him of the evill he had done her; and resoluing againe to set her at Liberty, or else to obtaine of <hi>Penthrasus,</hi> to liue for ever with her in the Castle; and by extraordinary meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her Loue. And vpon a time he rode thither, determining to haue a sight of her: Where when he came, he found the Gate at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> entrance of the Bridge fast shut, and nothing but a horne hanging thereat, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Chaine, which he Winded; and with that one of the Giants came forth, with whose sight he stood affrighted till he asked him what he sought? I would (said <hi>Helyon</hi>) speake with <hi>Penthrasus.</hi> With that the Gyant had him come in, and shutting fast the Entrance, brought him before <hi>Ila,</hi> who presently knew him, saying: I know the cause of thy comming, which thou shalt never obtaine: For which disloyall thought, and other ignoble déeds, thou shalt never depart from hence, vntill the Lady thou causedst to be inclosed here, be set at Liberty: With that, not suffering him to reply, she caused him to be bound, and carryed into a darke Dungeon, where he was hardly Dyeted, and worse intreated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ila</hi> hauing him in her custody, knowing that none else was priuy to <hi>Constantiaes</hi> being there, caused these Verses to be written in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gold, and hung ouer the outtermost Gate, and by the same, <hi>Constantiaes</hi> Picture, whereon she had cast such a Spell, that all that beheld it, were in Loue with it.</p>

               <p>My Lord (quoth <hi>Pisor</hi>) I cannot be perswaded that she is dead, but by some misfortune wandred out of knowledge, or carried hence by some vnexpected meanes: Therefore I beséech you beare her losse with patience, and in the end I doe not doubt but you shall heare of her safety. Thou giuest me words full of comfort (said he) but thou hast no ground for them: Nor can I tell how by them to adde any hope of my restlesse passions: for that she is lost I am sure, but that I shall never sée her againe, I thinke it impossible: being driuen to so hard an exigent of extremity, that I neither know what to doe, nor whose ayde to implore. Thou séest another hath shut me from my Kingdome, and in my absence wonne my subjects heart from me. The King of <hi>Persia,</hi> hearing of the wrong done to him, will become mine Enemy, and then is there no place of refuge left for mée but in this place best be fitting my misery. My Lord (said <hi>Pisor,</hi>) yet if I may be so bolde as counsell you, let vs goe to the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, I as I am, and you in that disguise, for none but your sister <hi>Piera,</hi> being priuy to your escape with <hi>Constantia,</hi> you may safely and without feare goe thither, both to conferre with <hi>Piera,</hi> and to craue the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> assistance to establish you in your Kingdome.</p>

               <p>Whilest they continued in this conference, <hi>Deloratus</hi> came in, and espying one in such priuate with his Wife in that disguise, wondred who it should be. <hi>Piera</hi> soone espyed him, and leauing her Brother went to him, and told him who it was: Wherewith he embraced <hi>Persicles</hi> in his Armes, now perfectly remembring him, although griefe had much altered him. After many spéeches past, <hi>Deloratus,</hi> he, and <hi>Piera,</hi> went to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who knowing him, welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, with excéeding kindnesse. <hi>Persicles</hi> then vnfolded his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes vnto him, &amp; desired his assistance, in revenge of the wrongs the <hi>Armenians</hi> had done him. Which the King of <hi>Persia</hi> willingly yéelded vnto him: giuing authority vnto <hi>Deloratus</hi> to muster Souldiers and make provision for their expedition. The newes hereof was suddenly rumoured in the Court, and many thousands of Knights vnconstrained, prepared to ayde <hi>Persicles,</hi> whom they honoured for his excéeding valour and curtesie; purposing to spend their liues in his Defence, that of a sudden one part of the Country was vp in Armes, and a great Force was assembled, and conducted into <hi>Assyria,</hi> by <hi>Deloratus,</hi> and <hi>Persicles,</hi> and <hi>Pisor,</hi> and <hi>Osimus,</hi> and also many other Knights of excéeding valour: Of whose worthy Exployts, we will hereafter speake more at large.</p>

Soft quoth <hi>Montelyon,</hi> let me first know what you are? We are enemies vnto thée sayd <hi>Althesus,</hi> and therefore yéeld. Tell mée quoth hée, your names? <hi>Althesus</hi> knowing himselfe to be of great valour, and therefore not to be vnknowne of any. Besides, little thinking he would haue resisted them, told him his name was <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesus.</hi> Then I defie thée quoth <hi>Montelyon,</hi> for I am thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and will rather dye then yéeld to thée. With that <hi>Althesus</hi> drew his Sword, and strooke at him. <hi>Montelyon</hi> did the like to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb facs="tcp:20827:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himselfe: and afterwards they offended him so much, that both he and <hi>Mutellus</hi> had enough to doe to saue their owne stakes and liues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Althesus</hi> séeing his valour, desired to know his name, which <hi>Montelyon</hi> tolde him. <hi>Althesus</hi> was much disquieted therewith: and séeing his companion fallen and faint with effusion of bloud, hée thus sayd: Knight, at this time I cannot stay to end the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, for by hazarding my selfe, I should endanger the liues of many: therefore farewell vntill more conuenient time to meete thée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. With that he turned his backe, and <hi>Montelyon</hi> stouped to giue his conquered adversary breath: which reuiued <hi>Mutellus:</hi> but séeing <hi>Althesus</hi> gone, his heart was ready to dye with griefe. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telyon</hi> had him be of comfort, for his intent was to vse him hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; with that helping him vp, he ledde him to his Tent, calling vp his Squire to attend him, and disarme him, he went presently to <hi>Persicles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day <hi>Montelyon</hi> caused <hi>Mutellus</hi> to be carryed before the Generall, where hée declared the cause of their departure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Armenia,</hi> which <hi>Persicles</hi> was glad to heare off: that by this foreknowledge he might preuent the purposed intent of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: but most of all he rejoyced and commended <hi>Montelyon</hi> for this noble act. Which had they not béene discovered, might haue brought the whole Campe into great distresse: by this meanes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way growing into such loue, and admiration of his valour, vertue and curtesie, that they estéemed their onely defence and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity consisted in his safety: that wheresoever hée went, the eyes of multitudes awayted him, as being delighted to behold him. <hi>Mutel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> desired <hi>Persicles</hi> to appoint his ransome, but hée committed that to <hi>Montelyon,</hi> who after he had honourably feasted him, sent him ransomelesse to the City. <hi>Mutellus</hi> soone got entrance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what misfortune had befallen him and <hi>Althesus,</hi> which turned their conceived hope of comfort into despaire, which had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them with feare, had not some little hope of <hi>Althesus</hi> escape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued them.</p>
               <p>Thus remained they many dayes within the City, so hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, that they were out of all hope in getting Victuals, but were driuen to content themselves with spare dyet, scantling out
<pb facs="tcp:20827:42"/>
euery souldier and Inhabitant their allowance. Which they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued likewise so long, expecting to heare from <hi>Armenia,</hi> that being frustrated, they expected nothing but miserable famine: which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them late in the night, to assemble all their old, weake and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men, vnable to serue, and all Women and Children, except some few of account, and turned them out of the City, to the number of sixtéene thousand, whose distressed estate <hi>Persicles</hi> pittied, causing them to haue sufficient food, themselues building Cabbins to defend them from the weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> séeing the miserable estate his owne Countrey was in, and to what extremity his Subjects were brought; and by this also knowing that <hi>Palian</hi> was not able long to endure, but that both he and all those within the City, were ready to be famished, of whom many were <hi>Assyrians</hi>; that were constrained to that subjection, whose estate he pittyed, being vnwilling to be guilty of their destruction by the aduice and counsell of those he most estéemed, but principally of <hi>Deloratus</hi> and <hi>Montelyon,</hi> he sent a Herauld vnto <hi>Palian</hi> with this message; that although he did vnjustly vsurpe his Crowne and many other wayes done him intollerable injuries, yet pittying the miserable estate he was like to bring the Citizens into by his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he made h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

passions, one day amongst many that he passed ouer with pensiue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, he got himselfe into a solitary place, and there in sad silence meditated on his misfortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> by chance troubled with remembrance of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne estate, chose the very place for his private meditations, wherein <hi>Persicles</hi> was already shrowded, and suddenly espying him, began to withdraw himselfe, vntill <hi>Persicles</hi> desired him to stay, vttering these spéeches. Worthy Knight, I perceiue some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward care hath made you withdraw your selfe from mée, but impart your discontent to me: if not, yet heare mine, for I haue long desired to impart them vnto one, on whose fidelity I might repose my selfe, and you are the man I haue elected, hauing had so sufficient tryall of your courtesie and friendship, that without doubting I durst commit my selfe to your secresie, for your ayde may, as heretofore it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued me.</p>
               <p>My Lord, replyed <hi>Montelyon,</hi> I account my selfe onely fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, in your loue, and my heart acknowledgeth my euerlasting bounden duty to none so much as to your Majesty, which bindeth me in all duty to become your vassaile, being more ready to venture my life and vttermost endeauours in your service then you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: Therefore good my Lord, feare not to impose any taske vpon me, for by your imploring me I shall account my selfe onely blest.

<pb facs="tcp:20827:43"/>
troubled therewith, after I had refelled my old enemy the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> in a battell, I left the gouernment of my Kingdome to two of my Noble men, and departed in the habite of a Palmer into <hi>Persia,</hi> where within short space I found such meanes by my sisters friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that I was in that habite without suspition in <hi>Pieraes</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and thereby had conference with <hi>Constantia,</hi> and attained her consent, nothing remaining, but onely meanes how we should escape, which afterwards wée effected, and trauelled together vntill we came to a Shepheards house, where we were kindly welcommed, contracting a solemne, marriage betwixt our selues, because we durst not be knowne the contrary, where we liued some dayes in quiet: In the meane time the King of <hi>Persia</hi> caused diligent search to be made, and it was <hi>Pisors</hi> chance to finde vs, who kept our counsell, and was by me sent into <hi>Assyria,</hi> to fetch some of my owne Knights to attend me home, where he found my Nobles at strife: and the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> taking opportunity, with a mighty band of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, slew most of my part, the rest joyning with him, vntill he had ceazed my Crowne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pisor</hi> with this heauy newes returned to me, being vnwilling to giue me knowledge thereof, which ouercame my heart with such griefe, that séeking in a solitary place, I wandred so farre that I could not returne to the Shepheards house the same night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi> missing me, likewise stole from the Cottage to séeke me but directing her steps a contrary way, or méeting with some misfortune that slew her, I neuer heard of her since. <hi>Pisor,</hi> he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise went foorth to séeke vs, and vnwillingly tasted of an vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fruit, that infused a sléepinesse vpon him for foure and twenty houres: but notwithstanding his and my most earnest search, wee could neuer finde her, nor I feare neuer shall. But if I could recure this euill done me by my Foes, I would then spend the rest of my dayes in her search. Hauing ended her spéech, his heart was so much ouercome with griefe, that he had much adoe to with hold his eyes from teares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> was opprest with no lesse griefe then hée, whose heart felt more inward disquiet then a stranger could haue done, in silent sadnesse séeming to impart with his sorrowes: but not abide to counsell him which way to recure them. That at last by reason

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ontelyon</hi> that euening elected out of his own Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers twenty Knights, such as he estéemed most valiant, telling them he had a matter of great danger and secrecy to complet, which might be a meanes to establish <hi>Persicles</hi> in his Kingdome, if they would faithfully joyne with him, Which they stedfastly vowed to accomplish, and to follow him, although it were euen to their deaths. Arme you then, quoth he, in <hi>Armenian</hi> Armour, of which you haue choyce, and come to me at midnight.</p>
               <p>This being performed, and the Knights come, <hi>Montelyon</hi> with them departed through the Campe vnto the City Gates, where <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telyon</hi> knockt, but scarce so lowe that the Porter could heare him, who yet notwithstanding, comming to the Battlements, demanded who it was? I am said <hi>Montelyon, Althetus,</hi> and other <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as thou mayst know by our Armor, and bring good newes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore open the Gates lest by the delay we be betrayed for we are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued. The Porter being out of all doubt, and hasty to succour them, vnbolted the Gates. <hi>Montelyon</hi> was no sooner entred, but he flew the Porter, entring the Lodge, and apprehending the watch, who lay sléeping, and slaying most of them before they awaked: One of them submitting himselfe, thus sayd. I am an <hi>Assyrian</hi> spare my life, and if you be friends to <hi>Persicles,</hi> I will giue you such directions, as you may surprize the City, and subdue <hi>Palian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> sayd, in so doing thou shalt be honoure of thy King and purchase thy owne liberty. After that they had put the rest to the Sword, the <hi>Assyrian</hi> directed them to the Pallace, and by so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret away that he brought them euen within the compasse of the Castle, to the very place whereas the Guard was. <hi>Montelyon</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20827:44"/>
then thus said to his followers. My companions: let not feare now possesse your hearts, but by this exployt win honour for euer. Then by the <hi>Assyrians</hi> direction, they deuided themselues into two parts, the one to the foremost entrance, and the other by a By-way. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telyon</hi> like wise knockt, and one of the Guard misdoubting no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, opened the doore, whereinto <hi>Montelyon</hi> rusht with his swoord drawne, not speaking a word, sleying the first, the next, and all that came within his compasse: The Guardiants were so amazed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that they were confounded in their sences, their courages for lack of time to consider, abated and their hands wich feare-trembling not able to draw their Swords, and when they were drawne, not knowing whom to offend, for <hi>Montelyon</hi> and his Knights were so like them in Armour, and so intermingled amongst them, that they knew not whether they strooke their owne fellowes or no not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one from the other: by which meanes <hi>Montelyon</hi> and his Knights who by a priuy token knew each other, made such a slaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that all the floud swom with their bloud. Some of them made meanes to flye by the backe doore, but euen then, as they stept out, they met death, hée that followed, not knowing him that went before to be slaine, that had a thousand come that way, they had one by one met with destruction, that in the end, by <hi>Montelyons</hi> valour there was not one left aliue, nor any escaped. And this complet was performed with such expedition in the dead time of the night, that the rumor thereof came not to the hearing of any. That within short space and little labour, <hi>Montelyon</hi> surprized <hi>Palian</hi> euen in his Bed, who séeing one in Armour besmeared with bloud, with his sword rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy drawne, being excéedingly affrighted, asked what he was? I am <abbr>qd</abbr> 
                  <hi>Montelyon,</hi> thine enemy, and <hi>Persicles</hi> friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou art a villaine and a Traytor, <abbr>qd</abbr> he, and with that he called to his Guard, crying out treason, treason, I am betrayed helpe, helpe. Thou cryest in vaine <abbr>qd</abbr> 
                  <hi>Montelyon,</hi> for there is none here to helpe thée: for by this hand thy Guard are slaine, and thou shalt follow them the same way to death, vnlesse thou aske mercy; For my hands can hardly abstaine from working vengeance on thy trayterous head, thou hast deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be punished with inexorable torments. <hi>Montelyon</hi> had scarce ended those woords, but the rumoring Eccho of an excéeding out-cry, sollicited his eares, the occasion was this. After <hi>Montelyon</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb facs="tcp:20827:44"/>
his Tent, his Squire following him, and séeing him enter the City with so few in his Company, ranne backe with all spéed, and certified <hi>Persicles</hi> what hée had séene, who fearing least that valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attempt might endanger his life, and hearing that he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten entrance into the City, with all the haste he could armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and calling vp <hi>Deloratus, Pisor, Cothanes</hi> and <hi>Osimus,</hi> and all the rest of his chiefe Commanders of the Army, with the choyce of their severall Bands, to the number of ten thousand, they soone mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the City gates, which they found wide open, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and by seuerall companies disperst into euery corner of the Stréetes, on a suddaine on euery side they gaue the Alarum, which rung through the City and eares of the <hi>Armenians</hi> with such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that like men bereft of their Sences, they ranne vp and downe to their destruction. There did <hi>Deloratus</hi> fill his hands with slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Pisor</hi> with cruelty revenged his withholden liberty: There did <hi>Cothanes, Osimus,</hi> and many thousands, colour pale Death in purple Robes. There did <hi>Persicles</hi> tryumph ouer his Foes, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Sword working their deaths, that the City Channels ran with goare bloud, and their hasty steps were intercepted by the heaps of breathlesse foes: then began such an outcry, as would haue affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sences of the most valiant: Did men hiding their heads in secret places of their Houses, the women with their children crying, wringing their hands, and making excéeding lamentation: the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ready to destroy one another, not knowing whom to offend, being ignorant in the originall of the Stratagem. The Counsellors and such as sate in Seate of Iudgement, with spéedy steppes conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to the Castle, wherein <hi>Palian</hi> was, where at their Entrance they saw such sad Spectacles of horror, and dreadfull was already entred, laying open passage to death. Where <hi>Montelyons</hi> Followers though but few, soone layd hands on them, slaying those that resisted, and enclosing them that yéelded, within a strong Tower.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> by this time had haled <hi>Palian</hi> from forth his Chamber and bound him hand and foote, brought him out of the Castle, inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him in a strong Iayle, where many malefactors was impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, himselfe for safety becomming his Iaylor. And now hauing intelligence that <hi>Persicles</hi> was entred the City, hée bent his steppes
<pb facs="tcp:20827:45"/>
to finde him out: by the way destroying the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed tooke him to be one of their owne company by his Armour: at last he came to the Abbey, wherein the greatest part of the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Souldiers lay, in a large field, encompassed within the wall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into <hi>Persicles</hi> with some thrée thousand Souldiers were before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, making such slaughter as would haue terrified the heart of any beholder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> being alone, thought now or neuer to make tryall of his Valour: though being on foote, yet rushing amongst the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who séeing him in that Armor, rather thought he had béene of their Commanders, then an Enemy: who franticke with affright: slaughtered them, because they were slow to slay their enemies; which when he perceiued, he cryed vnto them, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, traytors, cowards, why shun you me? I am your Enemy, a <hi>Persian,</hi> and come to destroy you. Notwithstanding his spéeches, by reason they had no respite to consider what to doe, they still fled from him, not so much with thought of what he was, as with feare to come neare him: for none came within his compasse, but hée dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so that where he fought, their Death tryumphed: and by reason of their flight, his hasty blowes onely hurt the Wind, for sometimes, they were spent in vaine. <hi>Persicles</hi> and <hi>Deloratus</hi> being nigh, stood and beheld him with admiration, wondring who it was, that in their judgement with such fury fought against himselfe: vntill hée espyed them, by his spéeches giuing them knowledge what he was, hauing found him they desired to finde, after short salutations, they followed their enemies with cruell destruction: the bright day dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing that nights bloudy act, which appeared before them with such a grimme aspect, as that it made terror séeme most terrible, so that before many houres of the day were spent, the <hi>Armenians</hi> were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroyed, and amongst them many <hi>Assyrians</hi> vnknowne to be <hi>Affricans</hi> were also slaughtered. <hi>Persicles</hi> gaue strict commandement to his souldiers, so make diligent search the City throughout, and if they found an <hi>Armenian,</hi> to put him to the Sword, not suffering one to escape nor liue. Which done, he commanded the dead Carkas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in Carts to be carryed out of the City, which were so many that with much adoe they could performe in a dayes labour. Which done, hée gaue the spoyle of the <hi>Armenians</hi> Tents and Houses vnto
<pb facs="tcp:20827:45"/>
the <hi>Persian</hi> Souldiers, and also gaue commandement, that the women, children, olde men, had impotent people, should be brought into the City and euery one possesse his owne house, wherein hée dwelt before. This being performed for that day, order being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the wounded, the souldiers enriched with spoyle, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in quiet in their houses, diligent watch set at each gate, and a strong guard without in the Tents, for that it drew to night, and their labour required ease, after much joy, they betooke themselues to their rest.</p>
               <p>Earely the next morning they forsooke their Pauilions, first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing certaine scowtes to watch about the borders of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for the approach of the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> which as they suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted would be very shortly: for it was now two moneths since <hi>Althe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> departed.</p>
               <p>By that time the day was aged the space of thrée houres, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Assyria</hi> that had liued vnder the subjection and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> hearing of <hi>Palians</hi> ouerthrow, and being assured of <hi>Persicles</hi> safety, which before that, their doubtfull hearts would not beléeue, came by great multitudes to submit themselues vnto their lawfull King: who rejoycing thereat, commanded them in signe of their obedience, to arme themselues, and returne to their owne dwellings, and to destroy all the <hi>Armenians</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited the Land of <hi>Assyria,</hi> not suffering neither man, woman or child to liue. It was a wonder to beholde, with what gréedinesse the heady multitudes bent themselues to their Enemies destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euery one thinking to be foremost, and hée that was last, yet thinking himselfe happy that hée could graspe a Sword, to séeke his owne liberty. Which they effected within thrée dayes, that there was not any of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Progenie left: for if they chanced to finde an <hi>Assyrian</hi> woman married to an <hi>Armenian</hi> woman, both shée and all her Children dyed. And if they found a Woman with child, or hauing any children that shée could not shew an <hi>Assyrian</hi> was the Father of them, they had all of them dyed.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, all those that were Prisoners, were brought foorth. <hi>Persicles</hi> by the whole consent of all his Nobles, People and Counsell, appointing them to dye, onely <hi>Palian</hi>

               <p>I will not study sayd <hi>Persicles,</hi> what to say, but thus say to him. His sonne is my prisoner, and I will detaine him: as for his threats I feare them not, vtterly denying his false title to my Crowne, which in my absence hée seazed vpon, not by valour, but trecherie, And tell him moreouer, that I demand restitution for the wrong hée hath done mée and my Countrey, which if he deny, nothing shall make me satisfaction but his sonnes death. And tell him thus, let him with haste returne, least my fury ouertake him, and so he féele the mischiefe he intendeth to me, for I meane to méete him present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and worke such destruction among his Souldiers, as shall cause them to séeke his death for betraying them into his hands. <hi>Persicles</hi> spake these words with such fury, as made the Ambassadours assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly beléeue hée meant it, that with this answere they departed. The King of <hi>Armenia</hi> little thinking to receiue such an answere, but rather performance of his demand: was so enraged, that hée commanded his Souldiers to march towards the City, vowing to redéeme his sonne, or be taken prisoner himselfe. <hi>Persicles</hi> likewise had collected a mighty band of <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Assyrians</hi> to méete him, that it was likely this would proue the hottest battell that euer was fought in that part of the world.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Palian</hi> was brought before <hi>Persicles,</hi> who was seated vpon the Kingly throne in great Majesty, thus saying to <hi>Palian</hi>: what canst thou alledge to excuse thy selfe from death, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing rightly deserued the same?

                  <hi>Palian</hi> made this reply, I am a King as absolute as thy selfe: therefore I know thou darest not put me to death: which if thou shouldest presume to attempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> know that the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> is hard at thy elbow to reuenge the same, whose power thou canst not escape. Therefore I defie thée, and dare thée to doe the same: for
<pb facs="tcp:20827:47"/>
I know thée to be of so cowardly a disposition, that if thou once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest within my Fathers sight, thou wilt runne away. The people standing by, hearing him vtter such opprobrious words, cryed out, Let him dye, let him dye. It was long before the multitude could be appeased, but at last <hi>Persicles</hi> thus said, standing vp in a great rage: Traytor, darest thou vtter these words in my presence: Thou shalt dye the death, not all the world shall redéeme thée. With that he commanded his guard to hew him in pieces; with that they began to wound him, but <hi>Montelyon</hi> stepping betwixt them hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himselfe vpon his knée, thus said:</p>
               <p>Noble King, vouchsafe to heare me speake, and without offence, let me claime my right. This Knight is my prisoner, therefore to put him to death without my consent, were to do me wrong; yet although I speake this, pardon me, I challenge not any thing to contradict your will; but I humbly desire your Majesty to grant me this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, that as I tooke him, so I may dispose of him.</p>

Noble Prince of Armenia, not expecting reward, nor fearing threates, I here giue you liberty. Then did he desire him to make choise of his horse and armour, where with he armed himselfe, and so rode discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously away, his stout heart not suffering him to giue <hi>Montelyon</hi> thankes. And being come to the Campe, humbling himselfe vnto his Father, and he imbracing him, thus said: My deare Sonne, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, then strutting vp and downe, said: I thought that dastard <hi>Persicles</hi> durst not detaine thée; for if he had, his life had payed thy ransome, and shall doe yet for detayning thée: by <hi>Jupiter</hi> this night will I fire the City about his eares, because I know that the coward dares not come foorth to méet me.</p>

                  <hi>Palians</hi> heart hearing his Father thus boasting, and considering
<pb facs="tcp:20827:47"/>
how vnlikely it was he could performe it, with such a sudden passion of déepe consideration, changed with a sudden alteration, contrary to his former disposition, calling to remembrance how lately he was in danger of death, the great power <hi>Persicles</hi> had about him, the late slaughter he had committed against his Souldiers, the courtesie of <hi>Montelyon,</hi> but most of all his ingratitude to him, that had fréely giuen him his life, thus said:</p>
               <p>My most noble Father, not the feare of your forces, nor <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> his cowardice (for by his doome I had dyed) hath set me at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the courtesie of a noble Knight that tooke me prisoner: who when <hi>Persicles</hi> had appointed my death, and the Executioners were seizing vpon me, challenged me to be his Prisoner, honourably armed me, and courteously let me goe. Therefore I beséech you withdraw your Forces, and offer no more wrong to <hi>Persicles,</hi> who neuer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you, the Kingdome of <hi>Armenia</hi> is as good as the Kingdome <hi>Assyria,</hi> and better: and it is better to enjoy that with quiet, then both that and this with discontent. If not for that, yet for this, I humbly intreat you to conclude a Peace with <hi>Persicles,</hi> for your owne safety, for his power is too mighty to be subdued by the small For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces you haue brought. He is now allyed to the <hi>Persian,</hi> who is not yet your Enemy, but wholly your Friend; but if these Warres continue long, he will proue your mortall Foe; For if you goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I must stay behind; for it were a great dishonour for me to fight against him that hath so honourably, courteously, and liberally giuen me my life: If you should be ouercome, how much would it endanger your life, and if your life were in danger, doe you thinke you could escape? Besides, I will rather submit my selfe into the hands of your Enemies or shed my owne blood before your face, then liue to sée so dismall a day as that will proue; therefore I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desire you to conclude a Peace.</p>
               <p>The King heard out his Spéeches with silent vexation, being so inwardly inraged, and with such desire thirsting after revenge, that his heart was ready to burst with swelling ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20827:48"/>Then <hi>Palian</hi> thus sayd, My Noble Father, I know to conclude this peace will turne to our everlasting good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and your ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>With that he gaue his consent, willing him to conclude what he thought good, and hée would ratifie it. <hi>Palian</hi> then mounting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, presently departed towards the City, but ere he came there, he met with <hi>Persicles</hi> mighty band of Souldiers, and desiring to speake with <hi>Montelyon,</hi> he kindly embraced him, yéelding vnto him so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearty thankes with such courtesie, loue, affection, and earnest vowes for preseruing his life, as <hi>Montelyon</hi> wondred at that sudden alteration in him, that before was so rude and discourteous, most kindly welcomming him.

After many spéeches of both sides, <hi>Persicles</hi> accusing him of wrongs, and be alleadging the contrary, that notwithstanding <hi>Palian</hi> labouring earnestly to conclude the peace, yet the battell was like to joyn, and often by iterating hot spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they both grew to excéeding rage, which againe by <hi>Palians</hi> and <hi>Montelyons</hi> good perswasions was asswaged: Growing to this Conclusion, a Peace was ratified for two yeares, in which time Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours should be sent to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to entreat their royall assistance to make an end of this controuersie, <hi>Persicles</hi> heart could hardly endure to yéeld to his foe any further, or abstaine himselfe from present revenge, or appoint his rightfull E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state to be determined by the doubtfull case of arbitrement, in his heart scorning the <hi>Armenians</hi> should haue so much scope limited, as though he had any interest at all in his Kingdome, but rather, that he should then either absolutely winne all, or loose all: but regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:20827:48"/>
how much he had troubled <hi>Deloratus</hi> and the <hi>Persians,</hi> who now desired to returne home into their owne Countrey, but most of all, himselfe desirous to trauell in search of his deare <hi>Constantia,</hi> from whom hée had béene long absent: For whose sake hée would haue lost his life, Kingdome and Liberty: whose absence was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall griefe to his Conscience, and a restlesse torment to his heart: for whom he had endured many thousand broken steps, vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing of finding her, but that, nor length of time, nor other am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity could cause his heart beléeue, that he should finde her, and that she was liuing: therefore he constrained his royall heart to yéeld to any thing.</p>
               <p>And hauing taken the King of <hi>Armenia's</hi> Oath, not to interrupt him in his Kingdome, vntill the time prefixed, they parted, <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> to the City, and the King with his Army into <hi>Armenia. Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> heart was linckt in such louing admirations of <hi>Montelyons</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that he humbly intreated his Fathers leaue to stay in <hi>Assyria</hi> to beare him company, but he denyed him, reprouing him greatly, and with bitter tearmes checking him: but notwithstanding, within few dayes in disguise he departed.

                  <hi>Palian</hi> being kindly welcommed of <hi>Montelyon,</hi> disclosed the cause of his departure from his Father, onely with no other intent, but to enjoy his company, and by shew of duty to doe <hi>Persicles</hi> Seruice: which procéeded not of any coloured or imaginary dissimulation, but from the depth of a constant resolution.

But on a day it thus fell out. <hi>Praxentia</hi> desiring ease, sent a Damozell to an old Lady, named <hi>Lanula,</hi> willing her to come and speake with her, who instantly came, and being alone <hi>Praxentia,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this conference. <hi>Lanula</hi> (quoth she) I haue occasion to your assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in a matter of great secrests, which I haue refused to impart to any but your selfe, for the good opinion I haue of you, wherein you onely may doe me pleasure, and everlastingly bind me to requite the same.

For if he once go from hence I shall neuer sée him againe. As she had spoken that word she saw him walking alone towards the farther end of the Garden, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into a groue. Yonder he is, quoth <hi>Praxentia, Lanula</hi> told her, she would even then speake, and to that intent with hast she went downe the staires. <hi>Montelyon</hi> being come to the farther end of the garden, espyed <hi>Palian</hi> lying vpon a banke either sléeping, or in a déepe study, passing by him vnseene, for that he desired no company, entring the Groue. <hi>Lanula</hi> likewise seeking him, espyed <hi>Palian,</hi> not knowing either, saluted him in stead of <hi>Montelyon,</hi> saying, Sir Knight, to you I thinke I haue a matter of importance to discover if your name be <hi>Montelyon? Palian</hi> answered not, but with courtesie had her say on, There is a Lady of great renowne in this Court that beareth you déepe affection, who committed her counsels to me but with no intent I should disclose them, yet I pittying her griefe, whom I am bound in all duty to pleasure, and withall wishing your preferment, am thus bold to intercept your meditation: hoping that this newes cannot be but gratefully accepted, I heartily thanke you (<abbr>qd</abbr> he) assuring you that I am euery way as déepely in loue as any, but with one so farre my better, that feare to offend, maketh me silent: therefore I pray let me know her name. It is <hi>Praxentia</hi> 
                  <abbr>qd</abbr> she. And to her said he, I owe my life, loue, affections, and liberty. Sir (<abbr>qd</abbr> she) I am glad hereof, and if you will follow my directions, I will worke to effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that you shall enjoy her loue, whosoever saith the contrary.

My name is <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nula,</hi> quoth she, and you shall haue me in the Lodgings ouer the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne in the priuate Garden. With that she departed, leauing him in a déepe meditation, what to doe to enjoy her loue, and how to doe it without dishonour to himselfe, and iniury to <hi>Montelyon,</hi> but that he thought impossible: entring into these meditations, how contrary is my hap to all good successe, that maketh me hazard my honour and to adventure such a taske as may bring me to perpetuall infamy?

Reuoluing a thousand of these contrarious thoughts, at length he espyed <hi>Montelyon</hi> comming backe from the Groue, whom he salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this sort. Sir Knight, as I lay slumbring on this Banke, my sences were greatly troubled with your remembrance, &amp; me thought an ancient Lady taking me for you, told me, that a Lady of great Dignity did loue me excéedingly, &amp; that she of purpose came to know how I was affected.

                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> made this answer: What this should meane I know not, neither is it to be regarded. For dreames are but idle Fancies, procured by the conceit or imagination of the Dreamer: thinking that of another that he wished to himselfe, which is more likely: For the Princesse were ouer-fond to place her loue on so dejected a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as my selfe, and if she did so it were in vaine: for my Fancies being now at liberty, cannot become Bondslaues to affection, were it to the greatest Princesse in the World, I speake not this, as reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting her courtesie, but as one that estéemeth himselfe altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thereof.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving left <hi>Montelyon,</hi> hée got himselfe to his Chamber, excéedingly troubled in his thoughts, betwixt a striving to overmaster his Loue, and yet to loue, and attaine his loue without hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Honour: but his affection had the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and those sparkes of vertue which were but newly kindled in his thoughts vanished, and hée resolved to try the vttermost issue of that Stratageme, though it were in <hi>Montelyons</hi> name. Euening now drawing nigh, he remembred his promise, which was to repaire to <hi>Lanula,</hi> therefore thither he went, but so secretly as might be, where he likewise found her staying for him, of whom he demanded what good newes? <hi>Lanula</hi> shutting fast the doore, thus said to him. After I returned from you in the Orchard, I went to <hi>Praxentia,</hi> and told her what spéeches I had with you, which revived her heart with ioy, willing me to let you vnderstand, that it is not lew'd desire, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest loue, nor indiscréet intemperancy that hath procured her to this liking, but the report of your valour, regard of your vertues, and the worke that Nature never wrought in her before: therefore she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth you be constant, secret, and loyall: nor to regard her loue the lesse, for that it was easily wonne, but to impute the same to Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that had ordained him vnknowne to that honour, to be beloved of her, that hath ordained him vnknowne to that honour, to be beloved of her, that hath refused to match her selfe to the greatest Emperors in the world. By Heaven (<abbr>qd</abbr> 
                  <hi>Palian</hi>) my heart is tyed to her in such bonds of constant Loue, that should shee command mee to rip my heart from forth of my brest, I would doe it to fulfill her desire, and shew my duty.</p>
               <p>Few words (quoth <hi>Lanula</hi>) are sufficient, therefore know, that by reason of her Fathers displeasure, she dareth not openly converse with you, but she hath yéelded to be directed by mée, and therefore late this Night come to my Chamber, and I will get you the habite of a Gardner, in which disguise you may with safety through the
<pb facs="tcp:20827:52"/>
Garden enter her Chamber. <hi>Palian</hi> yéelding her many thankes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, whilest she went and certified <hi>Praxentia</hi> what we had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Whose loue being growne to a setled resolution, and desirous to ease her selfe disquiet, gladly consented thereto, thinking the time ouer-tedious, company troublesome, and her Supper vnsavory, to taste the swéetnesse of her stolne affection. <hi>Palian</hi> at the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted went to <hi>Lanula,</hi> who had already provided his disguise, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he apparelled himselfe, following her directions to find the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to her Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palian</hi> being entred the Garden, soone found the doore fast shut, but <hi>Praxentia</hi> having a sight of him out of her Window came downe her selfe to open the same. His heart was so ravisht with joy of her presence, that he could not instantly speake: but humbling himselfe vpon his knée, he said. Vertuous Lady, I humbly desire you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this my boldnesse, which I would never haue vndertaken, had not some formed hope animated me thereto: but since it is your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pleasure so much to honour my vnworthinesse, I humbly giue my poore heart to your disposition, which shall account it selfe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly happy to be imployed in your seruice.</p>
               <p>Good Knight (quoth <hi>Praxentia</hi>) had I not béene fully assured of your vertues, I would never haue admitted you this favour: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I accept your gift, and in exchange thereof will giue you mine: so that you promise me to vse it honourably.</p>
               <p>Else let me become the infamous reproach of all the World, let my ioyes be turned into sorrowes, my health into sickenesse, my pleasure into paine, and all that I wish to proue my good, to bée my everlasting misery.</p>
               <p>Your Protestations deare Knight, quoth she, are of sufficiency to overcome my yéelding heart, that harboureth no misdoubt of your disloyall meaning, but it is fully assured your vertues cannot harbour dissimulation, that is altogether different from vertue: therefore trusting you more then my selfe, I admit you that favour, I never before granted, which is to receiue you as my chosen Friend, trusting you will proue as faithfull as I desire, and will not reward my favour with disloyalty.</p>
               <p>Which said, taking him by the hand, shée led him vp into her Chamber, where many speeches past betwixt them, he with earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:20827:53"/>
entreating her consent to loue him, and she binding him by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vowes to be constant.</p>
               <p>He durst not vtter many spéeches, least it might bewray him: with all his conscience guilty of deceit, withheld him from boldnesse, and though peradventure she would haue taken any thing in good part, yet feare to be discovered himselfe, made him thinke no such matter, but his behaviour so neare as he could, framed himselfe to the estate of <hi>Montelyon.</hi> Which likewise pleased <hi>Praxentia</hi> well, who though she were very affectionate herselfe, yet she imputed his coloured modesty to vertue, and his dissimulation to pure hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, that by this conference he was fully assured of her loue, and she nothing doubting of his loyalty, being constrained by reason of the dayes approach, to breake off their communication, referring their next méeting to <hi>Lanulaes</hi> direction: for that time both parting with many courteous farewels, she fully contented, he somewhat discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that he had attained that fauour in anothermans name, which if he might haue claimed as proper to himselfe, he would haue déemed himselfe most happy. Clogged with these Cogitations, he gate to <hi>Lanulaes</hi> Chamber, to whom hée discovered his fortunate successe, telling her that in the evening he would repaire to her, to know <hi>Praxentiaes</hi> pleasure, and her direction, when and where to speak with her againe,</p>

All the dinner time <hi>Praxentiaes</hi> eyes were fixed on <hi>Montelyon, Palian</hi> on her, and his bending downeward with a heauy aspect. Which draue <hi>Praxentia</hi> into many cogitations: sometimes thinking he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to looke on her openly, who had showne her selfe so affable in priuate: then she thought it was care to discover her loue, which is easiliest discerned by the eyes; but when againe she saw he made no shew at all of regard to her, her colour often changed, sometimes with griefe, sometimes with anger, sometimes with feare, fixing her eyes stedfastly on him, and then glauncing about to sée if any noted her, <hi>Palian</hi> noted her; and well vnderstood her meaning, as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly noted her behaviour, as she did <hi>Montelyons:</hi> often changing his countenance, sometimes with feare to be séene, then with a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conceit: then againe, with an amorous thought, and againe with accusing of himselfe, for disloyall dealing towards her and him. <hi>Pieraes</hi> minde was most at leisure to note all, which shée performed with diligence, but séeing their eyes placed vpon contrary objects, she thought there was as contrary a Simpathy in their affections, both perceiving <hi>Palians</hi> double conceit, <hi>Praxentiaes</hi> disquiet, and <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyons</hi> carelesse regard of either. By a priuy token vnséene of any gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Persicles</hi> an instance thereof, who quickly conceited her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and jumpt with her in opinion, all the dinner time noting them. Which being past, and musicke filling the roome with pleasant har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>Persicles</hi> pulling <hi>Montelyon</hi> by the sléeve, whispered these words softly in his eare.</p>
               <p>Friend, rowse your selfe from this sad dumpe, doe you behold how you are noted? Vpon my life the Princesse <hi>Praxentia</hi> is in Loue with you: and if it be so, may you not then account your selfe mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20827:54"/>My Lord, said hée, you are disposed to jest, no such good fortune will fall to my lot: and yet if it did, I know I should never enioy it. Why (quoth <hi>Persicles</hi>) had you but séene so much as I, and noted her looks, you would thinke so much as I: follow my counsell, doe but try, and you shall find it so. What if she were the Empresse of the Vniversall World, would you not venture? and were she not the better to bée beloved? and you the lesse cause to despaire, if she would refuse your loue, all the doubt you haue, is her Fathers dislike: neither feare that, Time may bring things vnthought of, to good effect. Doe but follow my counsell for this time, and after I will tell you more.</p>
               <p>By this time the Musicke was ended, and even with that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telyon</hi> cast his eye vpon <hi>Praxentia,</hi> who stedfastly looked on him: her heart being so much grieved with contrariety of thoughts, that the water was ready to overflow her eye-lids. When <hi>Montelyon,</hi> saw that, he presently began to conceiue hope, and by little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and little, loue stole the possession of his heart. Withall he remembred what <hi>Palian</hi> had before said to him: all which séemed likelyhoods that it was so. Whilest he continued in these thoughts, and with more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse had viewed her well (whose eyes were never off him) the Musicke began to sound againe, and the old King of <hi>Persia,</hi> being pleasant and merry with feasting, tooke the Quéene by the hand to dance, <hi>Persicles</hi> séeing that tooke <hi>Piera.</hi> Then said the King is there none will make a third? With that <hi>Piera</hi> desirous to shew <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yon</hi> any favour, desired him to doe it: but hee with mildnesse and low courtesie made a refusall, in regard of his duty to the King of <hi>Persia</hi> but suddenly <hi>Palian</hi> stept vp, and tooke <hi>Praxentia</hi> to dance with him, who being of a mild behaviour, refused not, and the rather that none should note her affection to <hi>Montelyon,</hi> which she assured her selfe, he could not call in question. <hi>Montelyon</hi> was exceedingly vexed to be so prevented, yet smothering the same with a pleasant countenance, the musicke being ended, the King of <hi>Persia</hi> with the Quéene departed leaving them to their recreation.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Palian</hi> began to be disquieted with feare least <hi>Montelyon</hi> by conference with <hi>Praxentia</hi> would make knowne his last deceit, and he by that meanes be prevented of all future hope, that he vsed such meanes, that <hi>Montelyon</hi> could haue no conference with her

               <p>All this time <hi>Montelyon</hi> did but intangle himselfe faster in the snares of affection, still looking to like, and liking to loue, and the more he looked, the more he loved, being for that time onely conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to looke, for other hope he attayned not, by reason of <hi>Palians</hi> prevention, and his owne feare to be accounted over bold, which she thought she might well impute to his meane estate.

Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, <hi>Palyon</hi> got him to <hi>Lanula's</hi> Chamber, where he found her of purpose to méete him, declaring all that had hapned, appointing him that night to come thither. <hi>Lanula</hi> returning to <hi>Praxentia,</hi> would not make knowne his comming to her that night, with no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent but that <hi>Praxentia</hi> should not breake her sléepe.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:20827:55"/>At the time appointed, <hi>Palian</hi> was in the Garden, and <hi>Lanula</hi> ready to receiue him, conducting him vp the staires of <hi>Praxentiaes</hi> Chamber, who was in her bed and fast asléepe. <hi>Palian</hi> senting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe close by her, although the Lights were extinct, yet by the light of the Moone, which with her cléerest light shined vpon the Bed, hée might take a perfect view of her: who by reason of the heat, lay with all thy Curtaines folded, and the Covering that lay vpon her so thin that the full proportion of her delicate body might easily be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the same being turned downe beneath her wast, with her necke naked, and her Iuory brests passing description, laying forth their beauties, her armes spread the one aboue her head, the other downe by her side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palian</hi> beheld this pleasant sight, which was able to ravish the Sences of a most modest beholder, where with his heart was so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, that he had much a doe to abstaine from touching that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. After, he had not stood long, but <hi>Praxentia</hi> being distempered with some slumbring motion, awaked and espying one so neare her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, was ready to giue a shrike, but with more regard marking his habite, she knew him, shrowding her selfe from his sight, vntill hée entreated her to pardon his boldnesse. Protecting his intent was not to disquiet her. Neither am I disquieted quoth shée, how I know you, but I marvaile I was not acquainted with your comming, it is <hi>Lanulas</hi> doing hath thus immodestly vsed me. I humbly beséech you (quoth he) take no offence thereat, but pardon vs both, the greatest fault being mine, for which I am contented to bide any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Your punishment (quoth she) cannot be great, your offence being done to me, that loue you more then my selfe, having given my selfe to you, that if I haue discovered modesty will not permit, yet the offence being procured by you, you may pardon it. The sight <abbr>qd</abbr> be, can procure no offence, for that it hurteth not therefore in sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I committed not injury: but where there is mutuall loue, and consent in loue, there nothing can bréed offence but disloyalty, which is as farre from me, as impossibilities: therefore I trust I can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend no way but in that, and in that I will never offend. All this (quoth she) may be granted in you but not in me. For I account it a great offence to be immodest, and nothing more contrary to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20827:56"/>You cannot offend in that (quoth he) to mée, for having given your selfe mine, why should I not both sée, touch and enjoy you? the first being granted, the last cannot be denyed.

               <p>I deny not (quoth she) all that I haue is yours, by mine owne gift and frée consent, yet you must forbeare possession vntill the bargaine be confirmed by witnesses: otherwise your Title is not good.</p>
               <p>Yes (quoth he) my Title is better by your gift then by a thousand witnesse: for if you deny they cannot availe me: therefore since you cannot deny me interest, yéeld me possession. These words were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with many kisses and embracings, able to stirre affection in sencelesse creatures; so that <hi>Praxentia</hi> vnderstood his meaning more by his behaviour then by his words; that she said.</p>
               <p>Deare Knight, I vnderstand your meaning, which I will not, nor cannot grant, but in any thing else you shall command me, onely I desire and am resolved to preserue my Virginity without blemish: therefore good Knight request not that, having so much as you cannot desire more, my selfe, my company, my loue, my life, and all are at your disposition, onely I challenge you (as you are a Knight) not to blemish my vertue.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding he so much prevailed with her at the last, that she gaue her consent he should the next night be joyned to her in marriage, by such meanes as she would compasse, and then he should without deniall attaine his desire.</p>
               <p>This contented him not, but he grew to such importunate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, intermingled with such Oathes and Protestations, being such as no reasonable creature, but one of a shamelesse disposition would haue vttered or requested: withall framing in himselfe such a kind of desperate behaviour, that she could not tell well how to deny him: that at last she called <hi>Lanula</hi> vnto her, whispering a few words in her eare: whereupon wée presently drew the Curtaines, and went out of the Chamber. <hi>Palian</hi> séeing that, put off his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and laid himselfe downe by her, folding her delicate body in her armes, with swéet embracings, expressing both their loues, but <hi>Praxentia</hi> kept her word, for notwithstanding he did what else hée desired, yet she reserved her Virginity vndissolved.

She is Daughter to <hi>Amphiador</hi> Duke of <hi>Ila,</hi> her name is <hi>Philotheta,</hi> for beauty, vertue, modesty, shape, courtesie, humility, temperance, chastity and wisedome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to be equalled, therfore the more to be pittyed, &amp; succoured in distresse: we are posting backe to bring this heauy Newes to the Court, and whilest we stay héere, she runneth in farther danger. Which way went they (quoth he) directly by the way we came said they, whom we would haue followed further, but that we durst not venture over the River after them. With that <hi>Montelyon</hi> turned backe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to <hi>Persicles</hi> what he had heard. If report lye not said <hi>Persicles,</hi> the Damozels haue not flatteringly praised her, I haue before this heard of her. Then both of them hasted to follow her, passing the River with much danger of drowning, by reason of the depth: They had not rode aboue two houres, but after they met a Country Swaine, running forwards and looking backwards so fearefully, as if he had béene neerely pursued. Fellow, said <hi>Persicles,</hi> what aylest thou? O Sir, quoth he, I met with thrée the monstrous Creatures that ever I beheld, carrying a Lady that made wonderfull Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Hearing that, they posted downe the way which was beaten plaine: at last the same parted into two wayes, being doubtfull which of them to séeke, at last they concluded to part, embracing each other, as if they should not méet againe: <hi>Persicles</hi> on the right hand and <hi>Montelyon</hi> on the left. Of whose severall adventures, strange accidents befell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Persicles</hi> rode on with great swiftnesse, not once able to set eye on them, for that way they went not, therefore he spent much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vaine, vntill it drew to night, and then he thought it vain to séeke them wandring along to séeke some convenient place to rest in which he could not doe, for those Desarts were vninhabited.

Which when they had done, the Hermite thus began.</p>
               <p>Sir, I shall first discover what I am, and the cause of my living in this desolate obscure place: and withall discover those things that (you may suppose) are beyond my knowledge: For no want of misfortune, nor feare of being discovered, hath made me choose this kind of life, but mine owne voluntary fancy, which perswadeth I can no other way liue, so well agréeing with my vnfortunate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: neither would I haue you thinke I intend to fill your eares with idle prattle or repitition of toyes, but as I intend to ease your heart with some of the care it possesseth: So I desire you by hearing my misfortune, and ayding my estate, to ease me, or at least, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me with some hope of your favourable assistance: for I know your name, your Countrey, your cause of travell, your meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and your successe hereafter: which I will declare vnto you, after your patience hath heard out my tragick History, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose but vtter first. <hi>Persicles</hi> wondred to heare his spéech, little thinking he could performe what he promised, but yet determining to try him, and desirous of comfort, he intreated him to procéed, for he was desirous to heare his Discourse. Sir, said the Hermite,
<pb facs="tcp:20827:60"/>
my name in my flourishing estate was called <hi>Delatus,</hi> my dignity the Dukedome of <hi>Ila,</hi> which I enjoyed many yeares in great quiet being both enriched in the gifts of Fortune, and of Nature: for in my youth I chanced to set my affection on the beauty of <hi>Alsala,</hi> Daughter vnto a Gentleman of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> not for her possessions, but for her beauty, which surpassed all the Ladies of the South parts of this Continent. I sued long and at last attained her consent, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed her, and brought her into <hi>Ila,</hi> where I lived with her a yeare in great quiet and content: being within that space enriched with a Daughter, naming her <hi>Pilotheta,</hi> in her Infancy shewing that more yeares would performe in her more exquisite beauty, which is the Virgin that you now travell in search of. Living in his blisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full content, there chanced a Knight named <hi>Amphiador</hi> to take a view of my faire <hi>Alsalaes</hi> beauty, which at the first sigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ierced so déepe that he was entangled therewith, and laboured by all means to grow into Familiarity, thereby to enjoy more fully her sight, and company: Fortune and my selfe so favouring him, that I estéemed so well of his company, that I thought my selfe not well when hée was from mée: Hée on the other side séeming so much to affect mée that I admired at his kindnesse. All this time did he insinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into <hi>Alsalaes</hi> company, she likewise estéeming so honourably of him, that by reason of the loue betwixt him and me, and her owne little suspect of his disloyall dealing, she at all times admitted him her company, and vsed him so kindly and familiarly, that she made him privie to most of her secret counsels. Notwithstanding, all this hée durst not manifest his loue to her, séeing indéed her vertues to be such, that he thought it impossible to attaine it, thinking it better rather to liue in silence and enjoy her company, then by vttering his affection to be deprived of all comfort. Vpon a time likewise, as he did, there arrived at my Castle another Knight, named <hi>Pallesus,</hi> whom in the same manner that he had done, surfeited on my <hi>Alsalaes</hi> beauty, and was both admitted mine and <hi>Amphiadors</hi> company: both of vs estéeming well of him for many honourable qualities, that he was endued withall. He as little suspecting <hi>Amphiadors</hi> loue as he did his, nor I my selfe, nor <hi>Alsala</hi> once thinking any such matter, for that one kindnesse bred in vs such familiarity, that many passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and amorous actions might be acted: and yet on no side suspected.
<pb facs="tcp:20827:60"/>
Thus did I liue in great content some two years, spending the time in Hawking, Hunting, and other pastimes, as voyd of disquiet as heart could wish, thinking my selfe happy in their kindnesse, but most in my faire <hi>Alsalaes</hi> loue. They with coloured courtesie séeming to liue by enjoying my good company and familiarity, and she as much as I estéeming them for their loue. But at last this pleasant Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer began to turne to Winter, and our swéet content to discontent, for <hi>Pallesus</hi> loue burst into a flame, which he was vnable to restrain, that in secret sort he gaue my <hi>Alsala</hi> knowledge thereof, which was as delightfull for her to heare, as it is for one to heare that he hath drunke poyson: but notwithstanding, her mind being endued with courtesie, and herSoule with Vertue, in kind sort she reprooved him, wishing him not to prosecute any such matter, for she would never yéeld thereto. Notwithstanding her courteous deniall bred in him no remorce, but rather a hope of comfort, that continually he followed his sute, which bred an excéeding trouble and disquiet in her heart, that whereas she was before delightfully pleasant, she became often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so Melancholly and sad that I wondred thereat, but could not learne the cause thereof, thinking it had béene rather some Sicknesse then passion of mind. Being long in this sort troubled with his loue, she began to devise how to be rid of it, but so as it might not come to my knowledge: for vertuous loue made her loth to disquiet mée, relying vpon <hi>Amphiadors</hi> vertues, she thought by his assistance to rid her selfe of <hi>Pallesus</hi>: and therefore on a time, being with him alone in secret, she declared the whole circumstance of all to him, declaring his counsell and disswade <hi>Pallesus</hi> from intending me such dishonour. <hi>Amphiadors</hi> heart was suddainly possest with a jealous conceit against the said <hi>Pallesus</hi>: but withall he meant by that means to attaine his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>re, therefore comming to <hi>Pallesus,</hi> he told him what <hi>Alsala</hi> had made him privie vnto, not disswading him, but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling him to persist therein, promising he would by all the meanes he could further the same. <hi>Pallesus</hi> was somewhat comforted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and <hi>Alsala</hi> was more chéerefull, as hoping by <hi>Amphiadors</hi> meanes to be rid of her Lover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amphiador</hi> one day, being alone with me in my Forrest, first vsing many intreaties to me to be secret, and binding me by many Oathes, without his advice, not to declare it to any: he told me that
<pb facs="tcp:20827:61"/>
                  <hi>Pallesus</hi> did make loue to <hi>Alsala,</hi> and that it was likely she would yéeld thereto, giving me knowledge that oftentimes they met in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and withall counselling me but to note their glances and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, and I should find that to be true which I then least thought of: Protesting that méere loue to me, in regard of mine Honour, and his owne duty, bound him to discover that, which otherwise he would never haue revealed. With this my mind was much disquieted, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse I would not too rashly giue credit to his spéeches, before I had observed their behaviour some time, which I found to be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what familiar, on déepe affection on his part, but on hers, with a contrary intent, left her countenance should bewray his loue to me, which she knew would bréed my disquiet: by reason of <hi>Amphiadors</hi> perswasions, who continually augmented my suspition, I verily began to suspect them, and grew to extreame jealousie, assuring my selfe they dealt disloyally with me, purposing to worke revenge against them, but then he began to perswade me to be well advised, and not to condemne them without manifest proofe: as much perswading me from thinking so, as he had before done to perswade me thereto: but then nothing could alter my mind, my vehement suspect neither suffering me to be quiet, nor yet to find his deceit: So that one day being alone, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> complained against my hard Fortune, and her disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty: in the midst of which complaints he found me out, intending by my overthrow to worke his owne desire. I séeking him so neare me, after much conference desired him as a Friend to counsell mée the best way to salue these evils, to be assured of the truth, and yet to doe it without mine owne reproach, or her scandall: for that I was loth to accuse her without just proofe.</p>
               <p>If I may quoth he, presume to counsell you, thus would I advise you to doe: the King is now sicke, and hath sent for many of his Nobles to come to him: say you likewise that you haue received Letters from him, and that you must thrée dayes hence depart towards the Court: By this you shal easily find out the truth hereof, &amp; at the time of your departure, desire <hi>Pallesus</hi> to beare you company: which if he refuse you may then judge of him accordingly: My selfe will then accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you vnto my Castle, wherein you shall remaine in secret some certaine dayes, and I in a disguise, vnknowne of any, will returne and by my faithfull diligence, will from time to time note their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb facs="tcp:20827:61"/>
and so find the truth thereof. I liked well of his counsell, and followed the same, making my departure knowne to <hi>Alsala,</hi> who with a heauy heart lamented to heare of my absence, which then by reason of my suspect I estéemed to be dissimulation. <hi>Amphiador</hi> in the meane time went to <hi>Pallesus,</hi> and told him that I intended by reason of some conceit or suspition, I had lately conceived, to carry him with me vnto the Court: and therefore he willed him to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at that instant. The time of my departure being come, I thought to try <hi>Pallesus,</hi> but he was gone, which augmented my suspition to a resolution: but intending to try the vttermost of all, and trusting to <hi>Amphiadors</hi> faithfull dealing, I went with him vnto his Castle, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there some thrée dayes: in the meane time (I thinking he had béene returned to my Castle) he went to an Enchanter named <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrasus,</hi> and brought him to my Castle, shewing him <hi>Pilotheta,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising him, that if he would but worke meanes to rid me away, that I might never returne, when she came to yeares, to procure her to consent to his loue. <hi>Penthrasus</hi> at the first sight liked the proffer, and promising to vndertake the same, taking a solemne Oath never to discover the same. Now fearing least some other should prevent him, and to avoid his Wiues suspition, who had great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Negromancy, and often by her skill, crost his practises, and withall vnwilling to be any way guilty of blood, after I was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, he brought me into this place, casting such charmes and incantations vpon me, that I shall never be released: which when he had done, he told me the cause why he had done it, and withall <hi>Amphiadors</hi> practice against me, I then intreated him to release me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> promising him to fulfill whatsoever <hi>Amphiador</hi> had promised him: but no perswasion could prevaile, for he told me he had bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by a solemne Vow to performe it, which he could not breake, for if he did, with that he should loose the vertue of his Art. Then did I lament my Misfortune with bitter exclaimes: but he told me it was in vaine, and so departed. Here did I liue many yeares, vntill I was quite past all hope of comfort, thinking to end my dayes in this place, without euer hearing of them againe: but at last <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrasus</hi> came to me againe, rehearsing the sequell of this History as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amphiador</hi> being sure enough of me, returned to my Castle,
<pb facs="tcp:20827:62"/>
and comming to <hi>Alsala,</hi> after long circumstance and protestations, told<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the day that I went from thence, <hi>Pallesus</hi> having before complotted such a Stratagem, had set vpon me with an ambush of men, and slaine me, telling the same with such protestations and probabilities of truth, that <hi>Alsala</hi> could not choose but beléeue him, counselling her in secret to apprehend him, and cast him in Prison. <hi>Alsala</hi> had much adoe to kéepe life within her body, having scarce breath enough to command her Servants to apprehend him, whilest <hi>Amphiador</hi> laboured with such as were about her to kéepe life in her.</p>
               <p>The rumour of my death was soone spread abroad, and my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants beléeving the same, some posted to the Court, some searched for my body, neither finding me aliue nor dead, for which <hi>Amphia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> still had an accusation: ready to satisfie any doubt, <hi>Pallesus</hi> hearing that it was <hi>Amphiador</hi> accused him, and for no lesse mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then my death, according as he well might, denyed the same, by often intreaties desiring <hi>Alsala,</hi> to let him be admitted to his tryall: but shée overswayed by <hi>Amphiadors</hi> perswasions, being before troubled with <hi>Pallesus</hi> Loue, whereby he fought to dishonour me that was his friend, which bred a perswasion in her, that to attaine that, he sought my life, would giue no credit to him: but resolved he would dye. And within few dayes apparelling her selfe, her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and all her attendants in mournefull wéedes, she departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Court, craving Iustice of the King against <hi>Pallesus</hi> for murdering me: the King told her she should haue justice, <hi>Pallesus</hi> was brought before the King, and there accused by <hi>Amphiador,</hi> he alleadging what false accusations he could, and the other still plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his innocency, that in the end <hi>Amphiador</hi> desired the King to grant him the Combate against <hi>Pallesus,</hi> which should end the doubt of this Controversie. The King granted it, and appointed a day for the tryall. In which cruell Fortune so ordered the issue, that <hi>Pallesus</hi> was slaine, and all men accounted him guilty, and me dead, yéelding much honour to <hi>Amphiador,</hi> and the King in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his supposed loyalty to me, and for that I dyed without an Heyre, created him Duke of it, yet reserving the living to <hi>Alsala,</hi> during her life. This being done, <hi>Alsala</hi> returned towards <hi>Ila</hi> and <hi>Amphiador</hi> with her, but very sore wounded: of whom he
<pb facs="tcp:20827:62"/>
had a most speciall care, tendring him as her selfe, for the Loue he had showne her in becomming her Champion for revenge of my Death.</p>
               <p>After he had recovered his Wounds, he continued many dayes with her, not once mentioning any Loue to her, séeming with her to mourne for my losse: But as all things by Time weare out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, so did her Sorrow of me, and she began to conceiue well of him: Which he perceiving, prosecuted his Loue with such successe, that in the end he married her, and ever since hath lived with her: Which when <hi>Penthrasus</hi> declared vnto me, it attained my heart with deadly griefe. Then I desired him to release me from that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. Neither doe I intend to claime the performance of <hi>Amphiadors</hi> promise, for that <hi>Philotheta</hi> was Faire, Chaste, and Vertuous: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I reveale this secret to any but your selfe, nor shall you depart from hence, vntill the adventure of the Enchanted Tower be ended, built by <hi>Helyon,</hi> wherein he hath shut <hi>Constantia,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and betroathed Wife to <hi>Persicles</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who shall be the first Knight that shall arriue in this place: Neither shall that Enchantment be ended by any but <hi>Persicles</hi> Sonne, begotten of <hi>Constantia:</hi> For (quoth he) the date of my Life is neare an end: and at such time as <hi>Persicles</hi> arriveth here (Will him, when he hath heard this report) to returne into <hi>Assyria,</hi> to establish his Kingdome in Peace; For it will be in vaine for him to spend his Dayes in travell to Redéeme her, the finishing thereof must be by his owne Sonne. When he had spoken these words he vanished, appointing me to a certaine Bound which I cannot passe, nor any yet came into but onely your selfe, which assureth me that you are <hi>Persicles,</hi> and travell in search of <hi>Constantia.</hi> You haue (said <hi>Persicles</hi>) filled my heart with Feare, Hope, and Comfort, the one striving to over-master the other feare, that the Enchanter dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: For that I haue as yet no Sonne, nor never shall haue by <hi>Constantia</hi>: for she being still Enchanted, how shall I attaine her company? Yet againe I am somewhat comforted, that he could as well tell who should finish the Enchantment he had made, as of my comming to this place: For I am the most forlorne King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> that shall never enjoy comfort vntill she be released, which doubt perswadeth me will never be; For if I must now returne into <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syria</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20827:63"/>
how shall I hope to find comfort? Yet hée of good comfort, quoth <hi>Delatus:</hi> for hope hath preserved my life many yeares: assuring my selfe that <hi>Penthrasus</hi> told me nothing but what was true, and shall assuredly come to passe, both your comfort, and my long looked for Releasement, being appointed both to one houre: Why should you then despaire more then I, since both our comforts resteth on our release? But according to his Counsell, travell no further, for it were faine to doe that which can yéeld no hope of comfort.</p>
               <p>In doing that (quoth <hi>Persicles</hi>) I shall both dishonour my selfe, and leaue my Friend vnkindly, whose Deserts hath bound my life to requite his Loue: he hath onely for my sake vndertaken to travell in <hi>Constantiaes</hi> search: the cause of whose departure from me, was in search of your Daughter <hi>Philotheta,</hi> that is reputed Daughter to <hi>Amphiador,</hi> who was this day stolne from <hi>Ila,</hi> by certaine Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants: Then he declared how they came to knowledge thereof. It did him good to heare that she was living, insomuch that he rejoyced ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedingly thereat: Withall, enquiring of him what knight that was, that was gone in her rescue. <hi>Persicles</hi> then said, it were too tedious to make Recitall of him: for then I should rehearse the discourse of my misfortunes. Were it not (quoth <hi>Delatus</hi>) troublesome to you, I would earnestly require your favour to heare it. To requite your kindnesse (quoth he) I will rehearse the same, which yet I haue concealed from all men but <hi>Montelyon.</hi> With that he declared the whole History, from the beginning of his first Loue to <hi>Constantia,</hi> vntill that houre. Which when he had heard, his heart was filled with Admiration, who that Knight <hi>Montelyon</hi> should be, his Fancy perswading him he should end the Enchantment, had not the doubt that he was <hi>Persicles</hi> Sonne given likelyhood of the contrary. The night was spent in these Discourses, and bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> lightned the darknesse of that Desart, <hi>Persicles</hi> neither willing to depart nor stay: Sometimes minding to find out <hi>Montelyon,</hi> and to bid him Farewell: but at last perswaded by <hi>Delatus,</hi> taking his leaue of him with many Farewels, he mounted his Stéed, and so departed directly towards <hi>Assyria.</hi>

Were he once revived, I would not care what became of my selfe, nor néeded I not to care for his vertuous Valour would shrowd me from injuries, and be as safe a harbour as security can affoord.

Aye me (said she) what shall now become of me? How shall I escape further misery?

With that he knéeled downe by <hi>Montelyon</hi> rubbing his chéekes, and laying his hand vpon his brest, felt some signe of life in him, and séeking for an hearbe which presently he found, he bruised the same, letting the juyce fall into his Nostrels, with the vertue whereof his vitall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces returned to their former operations, and his eyes received their sight: With that raising himselfe vp vpon his arme, hée said: I perceiue I haue troubled you, and as it were halfe ashamed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he desired her not to be disquieted with his misfortune. <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetaes</hi>

               <p>The old Hermit perceived some strange accident had brought them thither, desired them, for that <hi>Montelyon</hi> was sore bruised, and she much affrighted and disquieted, to accept of his Cell to rest them in, vntill they could take better order for their safety. <hi>Montelyon</hi> thanked him (saying, he was pleased, so it liked the Lady.) With that they began to goe, but <hi>Montelyon,</hi> by reason of his sore bruise, with much adoe could stand: The Hermit taking him by the arme, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him, whilest he with griefe, that his misfortunes had brought him to such a low estate, said: It ill beséemeth Youth to be suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Age: but no man can prevent Destiny. <hi>Philotheta</hi> offered to lend him her arme, but he desired her not to trouble her selfe.

With that she lent him her arme, but he tooke her hand, and that he thought too much boldnesse, as the other trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, striving against the weaknes he had received by his bruise, to go vpright: she like wise wondred that Nature had wrought such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar regard in her, towards him she knew not; often accusing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of Lightnesse, and blushing when he grasped her tender hand, that with fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and yet me thinkes I should not be too Familiar, and yet I know he hath deserved much more courtesie then I can proffer.

<pb facs="tcp:20827:66"/>
lest he should séeme more courteous then modesty would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or more coy then vertue required. Sir, said the Hermit, I know those Gyants, and the manner of their life to be most inhumane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wicked, whose Habitation is not farre off in the Desart of <hi>Arabia,</hi> by whose Death, this Countrey is fréed from much outrage, which they haue, and would daily haue committed. Sir (quoth <hi>Montelyon</hi>) I pray what Countrey is this? It is (said he) <hi>Arabia.</hi> Doth not <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon</hi> said he, raigne as King? Sir (quoth he) he did raigne as King, but whether he be now living or no, it is doubtfull: for some suppose he is dead, others say, he is Enchanted in a Tower he built himselfe, scituate not farre hence, from which he cannot be released, vntill the Enchantment be ended, which many Knights of strange Countryes haue adventured, but none could finish: the cause of building there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as yet no man can tell. <hi>Philotheta</hi> having before heard thereof, weary with that dayes travell, whilest they were in communication, fell asléepe, which <hi>Montelyon</hi> perceiving, remitted their communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till the Morning, being vnwilling to awake her with their noyse.</p>
               <p>The first that awaked was the Hermit, that went out to gather certaine hearbes, leaving them both sléeping, who both at once awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, at the first blushing at each others sight, hée wondring at her excéeding beauty, and she at his exquisite person, he comparing the Damzels report to her beauty, and her other gifts thereto, which he supposed beyond conceit. And she comparing his valor with his youth, and his courtesie with both, thought her eye never beheld her equall: standing as it were both Enchanted with the other, neither being able long to withhold their eyes from each others sight, both noting each others behaviour, till <hi>Montelyon</hi> arose, and she did the like, hée first breaking silence, vttering these spéeches.</p>
               <p>Faire Lady, now that the Sun hath vanished the misty Cloudes of night, you néed not feare any mishap, for your enemies being dead; I think there is none living of so inhumane a disposition, that would disquiet you For my selfe, my life, and all that I haue, resteth at your command.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, replyed she, I thanke you for your kindnesse past, and now proffered, which hath rid me from that I was in, and out of feare of other mishaps to come, for your Vertues haue

authority against wicked actions, and your valour a sufficient defence against your enemies. Before any further spéeches past, the Hermit came, bringing in his hand the hearbes he had gathered, some of which he stamped into juyce, and strained, giuing <hi>Montelyon</hi> to drink, others he boyled on the fire, making thereof a most dainty Dish, which when they had tasted, the Hermit said: though I know you find your selfe of sufficient strength, yet by my counsell travell not this day, for that therby you may much impaire your health. My selfe if pleaseth this Lady, will send a Messenger to <hi>Ila,</hi> to report her safety in this place. Not so (replyed <hi>Montelyon</hi>) my selfe (if please her to accept of my Service) will attend her thither: which if it please her I will presently doe.</p>
               <p>Sir (said she) I would not haue you endanger your health for my sake that am in safety, vntill such time as you are perfectly recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Then said the Hermit, you shall not in this place want any thing, nor feare disquiet, for héere hath security dwelt many dayes, being my selfe glad, my poore Cell can yéeld you any content. The Hermit went forth to get Provision, leaving them together in his Cell, whose eyes were drunke with a surfetting survay of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perfections, her beauty being such, as might not bée equalled by any: And his proportion besides his youths beauty, and other comelinesse of such forme, as would please any Ladies eye, which superficiall view of the eye, conducted an instant of Loue into each others part, which setled it selfe in that vertuous harbour with such constancy, that it was impossible to be removed: neither déeming each others so fortunate, to agrée in such a Sympathy of Loue, hée thinking she would not loue, and she perswading her selfe he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready setled his Loue on that Lady he went in search of.

This Knight directed by good fortune, alighted on the place where they lay, and by his Valour and pollicie slue them both, yet so sore hurt himselfe, that he lay breathlesse vpon the earth, which afflicted my heart with Sorrow, fearing his death, that I could not comfort him in ought by my teares and laments, accounting it more misfortune for mée to be the cause of so worthy a Knights Death, then I my selfe had béene still Prisoner to those Monsters: the Heavens favouring my sorrowes and his mishaps, directed an old Hermit to the place, who with the juyce of certaine hearbs recovered him, and with my weake assistance brought him to his Cell, within short space curing him. In which time I noted every part of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and found them such as I want skill to decipher comparing thereto his behaviour, which bred a perswasion in me, that as he was valiant, so he was vertuous, and as he excelled all that ever I beheld in person, so he did in courtesie.

The worthy Knights spéeches (said she) wrought so effectually with me, that I could haue béene contented to haue lived there with him for ever. In the end the Hermit brought in newes that <hi>Amphiador</hi> was hard by in my search, at which newes I was very glad, yet also displeased, with knowing his rude behaviour would not suffer him to vse the strange Knight kindly.

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. How <hi>Montelyon Knight of the Oracle</hi> arrived at the Enchanted Tower, called <hi>Penthrasus Pallace.</hi> And of the controversie that fell betweene him and the Knights that were come to try the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> as it is aforesaid, having lodged all night in the Wood, earely the next Morning before Golden <hi>Phaebus</hi> had beautified the Earth with his brightnesse, mounted his Stéed with an earnest desire to know whose Tents those were, and what Tower it was they had encompassed, he had not rode halfe an houre, but he approached néere vnto them, passing amongst them without stay, because he met none to conferre withall, he drew towards the entrance of the Bridge, where <hi>Constantiaes</hi> Picture hung, which when he had well viewed, he judged by the outward shew thereof, what perfections were adherent to the Lady, that was owner thereof, thereby calling to remembrance his <hi>Philothetaes</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which in his conceit farre surpassed that, but yet the Spell that <hi>Ila</hi> had cast thereon, wrought so with him, that had not the Vertue of his Armour, and other gifts the Nymphes had bestowed on him, which had power against all Enchantments prevailed, hée had surely doted thereon: when he had read the Verses, an earnest desire possest his heart to redéeme that Lady, that neither regarding Danger, nor omitting Opportunity, he tooke the Horne and winded the same, the Sound thereof made many Knights start from forth of their Tents, being but even then vp, and newly Armed: the first, that was mounted, and came to the Bridge: was a noble Knight of <hi>Parthia,</hi> named <hi>Menon,</hi> who calling to the <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> said, Knight enter no farther before thou know whom thou hast of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by thy bold intrusion. He hearing his words turned his Stéed saying, if I haue offended any it is more then I know but yet I am resolved to try the adventure who so ever sayes no. <hi>Menon</hi> said thy strangenesse doth priviledge thée, because thou knowest not what is concluded among the Knights that are héere assembled. Sir (said he) whatsoever agréeth with the Law of Armes I yéeld vnto, and whatsoever courtesie bindeth me to I will performe: therefore
<pb facs="tcp:20827:74"/>
let me know what it is I must performe before I passe further? By this time he was incompassed with Armed Knights: and one of them named <hi>Linseus,</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> that thought himselfe too good for all, and vanquished many that had Combated with him, said. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou passe further, thou must Combat with vs: For the meanest of many that are here assembled, thinketh himselfe able to performe as much as thée. The <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> wondring at their rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and moved with his discourteous words, said: I am not to be controlled by any, but stand frée in mine owne choise, to doe what I thinke good: therefore if thou or any here be offended with that I haue said or done, Challenge me. I doe Challenge thée said <hi>Linseus,</hi> and I, said <hi>Menon:</hi> and after them many other, every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to deale with him first. The Prince of <hi>Parthia,</hi> (named <hi>Nessus</hi>) stept forth and said. Fellow Knights, wée being all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessours of Armes, and every one a Partner in this Quarrell, let vs cast Lots, and to his share that the Lot, first falleth, let him begin and the rest fellow: With that they all agréed. The <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> thought he should not be Idle, rejoycing that he had so good occasion to make tryall of his Valour, The Lot fell to <hi>Arnon</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> to begin. The place, a goodly Plaine, in the full view of the Tower: and the time, was within an houre. This being agréed vpon, the <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> in the meane time rode about the Tower to behold the beauty and Scituation thereof, which he admired, and casting his Eye vp, he beheld on the Battlement a farre off, thrée Ladies walking together, whom he could scarcely discerne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> much lesse if he had béene acquainted with them, know. These La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were <hi>Constantia, Philotheta,</hi> and <hi>Ila,</hi> that came to behold the Tilts and Turneys that were daily acted betwéen many and divers Knights before the Tower. <hi>Constantia</hi> hearing of <hi>Persicles</hi> safety, and of his being in that Countrey, hoping thereby in time to bée released, desired to behold the Combatants, which before she had alwayes refused to doe. The <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> little thinking <hi>Philotheta</hi> had béene one of the thrée, after he had a while stood to behold them, returned to the appointed place of Combate, where <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> was then but newly entred with great Pride and the Sound of Trumpets, and a number of followers. Whom the <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> (notwithstanding all his bravery) overthrew at the first
<pb facs="tcp:20827:74"/>
Encounter, to <hi>Arnons</hi> amazement, and his owne glory. That done, the next that encountred him, was <hi>Linseus,</hi> who held out two courses, but at the third, both he and his Stéed lay on the earth. The Knights that beheld this, commended his Valour, yet enuyed his Fortune. After that he encountred thrée Knights of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Then came <hi>Nessus</hi> Prince of <hi>Parthia,</hi> thinking to recover that his Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents had lost, but his Fortune proved so bad that he lost both his Styrrops, and had he not hung on the Saddle. Bow, hée had laine on the Ground. The Day by this time drew to an end, which caused them to remit their further tryall till the next Morning. <hi>Constantia</hi> and <hi>Philotheta</hi> beholding the Valour of this one Knight, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her desire, déemed it was <hi>Persicles,</hi> the other <hi>Montelyon:</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring <hi>Ila,</hi> to send a Messenger to know his Name: Who returning, told them he was called the <hi>Knight of the Oracle.</hi> Then it is not <hi>Persicles</hi> (said <hi>Constantia.</hi>) No, nor <hi>Montelyon</hi> (said <hi>Philotheta.</hi>) Their Hearts now fainting with care, that before were revived with hope. The <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> that Night Lodged with a Knight of <hi>Persia,</hi> named <hi>Thymus,</hi> in his Tent, who in courteous sort intreated him thereto. Earely the next Morning, he againe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Field, ready for him that should next Encounter him, who came gallantly mounted, having likewise travailed many Miles to try his Fortune in the Adventure: but before he came to try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therein, he received so great a Discharge, by Encountring the <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> that in a desperate moode, and ashamed of his Foyle, he departed. The <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> being endued with an extraordinary Wit, as receiving the Essence thereof from two such goodly Princes as he was sprung of, began in his thoughts to condemne the fondnesse of those Knights, that comming to make tryall of the Adventure, spent their time in private Quarrels, still omitting that which principally they had sought, his Mind being so troubled with the losse of <hi>Philotheta</hi> and <hi>Persicles,</hi> desired not to lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there, but to hasten in their search. Therefore parting towards the Knights, who were assembled on a heape, studying which way to worke his disgrace, he said to them. Worthy Knights, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to this place, was not to try my Fortune against you, but in the Aduenture, and your private Enuy hath hitherto hindred mée, not regarding into what private Quarrels you enter, and causelesly
<pb facs="tcp:20827:75"/>
troubling me, that haue not offended you: Therefore because busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of more importance then to answer your Spléene, vrgeth my departure, I wish you, not fearing my ability to answer you, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this private Contention vntill another time: and if any of you either enviously condemne me, or repine at my good Fortune, I will be ready to answer you severall Quarrels in <hi>Persia,</hi> at the time that is appointed for the méeting of the Kings of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi> for the cause of your approach, being to release this <hi>Ladies</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, weaken not your force in private Contention: for in the Tryall thereof, you shall find occasion enough to exercise your Armes.</p>
               <p>Hearing his words they consented thereunto, yet contending who should first try the Adventure. In the end they agréed to cast Lots: in which the last fell to the <hi>Knight of the Oracle:</hi> every one having a Dayes respite for the finishing thereof. Thus did they make tryall of themselues: Some with such labour attaining the Bridge, but then forced by vertue of the Enchantment to yéeld, and so were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned in most Lamentable wise, by the Enuy of <hi>Ila,</hi> who desired the Enchantment might never end, but that she might liue there for ever. Others with feare ran away. Many dayes it was before it came to the <hi>Knight of the Oracles</hi> turne: In the end, all being either fledor imprisoned, he alone was left to try his Fortune, neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Friend to succour him, Foe to Enuy him, nor any to behold him: for the Enchantresse had made such Desolation among the Tents, by casting fires amongst them, that all the Servants to those Knights, fled as amazed, reporting from place to place their Masters misery, and the cause of their owne terror. Notwithstanding, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could affright or discourage the valiant heart of the <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> but he rested as resolute to goe forwards, as if there had beene no danger incident to the attempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constantia</hi> séeing how many Knights were at that instant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, all their Tents destroyed, and no man she thought left, began to discomfort her selfe, vtterly despairing of releasement, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Ila</hi> to let her view the Knights that were Imprisoned, fearing that <hi>Persicles</hi> was amongst them: but her requests were in vaine, for <hi>Ila</hi> fretted with extreame feare of the end of her Enchantment, in a mad rage flung from them, studying which way to lengthen the
<pb facs="tcp:20827:75"/>
date thereof, which tormented poore <hi>Constantiaes</hi> heart, that had béen so long in misery, and terrified kind <hi>Philothetaes</hi> mind with extreame feare of further calamity. Both she and <hi>Constantia</hi> all that Night bewailing their misery.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Morning early, the <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> survay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scituation of the Bridge, which way he might either advantage himselfe, or disadvantage his Foe, winded his Horne, wherewith there was such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding Earth-Quake within the Tower, that the Foundation thereof shooke as if it would haue overturned her stately Turrets. At which first Sound of the Horne, one of the Gyants came foorth without speaking, striking at him, but he defended himselfe a great while on Horsebacke, vntill the Gyant pressed so hard vpon him, that he was driven to withdraw him to light. Which when he had done, he againe assayled him, giving him many a déepe wound, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many a sore bruise, that had not his good Armour preserved him, it had brought him in great danger: but in the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he prevailed so much by the death of the first Gyant, that he attained the first and second Fortification of the Bridge. And at the third he was so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently set vpon by the other Gyant, that he was onely compelled to ward his blowes, in the end likewise espying such advantage that he ran his Sword quite through his body. By which meanes, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the first large Court, where he beheld the Armours of such Knights as had fayled in their sundry attempts, hanging about the Walls, hearing their hollow voyces, which by imprisonment had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured much affliction. <hi>Ila</hi> now knowing that the date of her glory in that place should end, in furious sort came running to the place where <hi>Constantia</hi> and <hi>Philotheta</hi> were, taking <hi>Philotheta</hi> with violence from out of the Arbour, and by force of her Enchantment, compelling her to follow her, vntill she came to the Court where the <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> was, he suddainly behelding <hi>Philotheta,</hi> at the first sight knew her: and séeing them so passe by him, towards the Entrance, he stept after them to speake to her, when presently ther rusht vpon him a number of Armed men that laid vpon him with
<pb facs="tcp:20827:76"/>
such swiftnesse, that they had no power to stirre from the place where he stood. They suddainly vanished, and he stood so amazed with the sight, and perplexed with such doubt, that he could not tell what to doe: Sometimes thinking to follow in <hi>Philotheta:</hi> then perswading himselfe it was but an illusion: and thinking to cast off that doubt, and goe forwards, his mind was possest with such desire to sée her againe, for that he stood as a man without sence. When suddainly such a Mist darkened all the place, that he could scarcely sée his hands, which continued by the space of halfe an houre. Whilest he remained in such thoughts, sometimes of perswasion it was <hi>Philotheta,</hi> which troubled his very heart to thinke what should be become of her, that he séemed to haue lost her Sences by the sight of her: remaining in many meditations, the Myst vanished, and the Sun with excéeding Splendor, disclosed the beauty of <hi>Penthrasus</hi> Pallace. When he saw no further expectation of danger approaching, he entred further, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the thrée Gates of Brasse, beholding the curious workes thereof, through which he entred into the Court, which drew his mind into much admiration thereof. Entring the Hall, he beheld the two Lyons (which kept the Passage) that with a faire prospect dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the beauty of the Garden. The Lyons no sooner espyed him, but they presently made such a noyse with their Roring, that all the Pallace rung thereof. And <hi>Constantia</hi> hearing the same, cryed out, as excéedingly affrighted. The <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> attempted to passe by them, expecting no other but cruell resistance: yet contrary to his thoughts, they laid themselues downe at his féet (as it were) reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing him: Which when he beheld, of his owne inclination, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed both their Chaines, and they ran forth of the Pallace with excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding swiftnesse, which amazed him to behold.</p>
               <p>Passing through the Hall, he entred the Garden, looking round about, to behold the beauty thereof, when suddainly he began to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he had beheld never a living creature since he entred, which draue him into an excéeding Admiration, marvailing that he could not behold the Lady of whose Picture he had beheld at the entrance, to that finding himselfe over-wearyed with labour, purposing to rest his Body, he returned into the Hall, and there seated himselfe in a most rich and costly Chayre. <hi>Constantia</hi> being in the Arbour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held when he entred the Garden, and when he went backe, marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what he should be, and little thinking the Enchantment was
<pb facs="tcp:20827:76"/>
ended, not daring her selfe to goe forth of the Arbour, her heart was so possest with amazement, desired one of the Damzels, if she loved her, to goe sée what he was, and learn the cause of that vprore, which they had heard in the Pallace. One of the Damzels being more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then the other, told her, how for the Loue she bare her, she would adventure, though it cost her her life. Passing on towards the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, with such hasty steps, as if something had pursued her, and yet going forwards, as if an evill had béen before her, that she could ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell, whether, wherefore, nor why she went: vntill of a sudden she mounted the passage into the Hall, and was right before the <hi>Knight of the Oracle:</hi> Whom when she saw, she stood looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, trembling as if she had béene distraught. The <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> rising from his seate, said: Damzell, feare not, I will defend you from danger, héere is none intendeth your harme. The Damzell hearing his voyce, was revived, saying: Sir Knight, I marvell what strange accident hath brought you hither, where no Knight hath béen these many yeares? Lady (said he) Fortune and my good Destinies, that haue béene imployed to set you at Liberty. Sir (said she) it is not I, but my Mistris you meane, by whose command I haue adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to sée what was happened: to whom if you will vouchsafe to goe, I will conduct you. He could remember, it was not her Picture he had beheld, therefore he blusht to be so deceived, but told her, his comming was to doe her Lady Service. With that they entred the Garden. <hi>Constantia</hi> soone espying them, and séeing the Knight come in such peaceable sort with the Damzell, went forth to méet him, hée likewise séeing her, sheathed his Sword, his Heart trembling at the first sight of her, by a naturall inclination, bearing such a Reverend regard to her majesticall person, that when he came nigh her, he did her reverence vpon his knée, vttering these words.</p>
               <p>Most Noble Lady, be not disquieted with feare of restrained liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the Date of the Enchantment of thisCastle is finished. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia</hi> stepping to him, tooke him by the hand, desiring him not to knéele to her, who was vnworthy, but rather had cause to vse him, with the like reuerence. Most Noble Lady (said he) I haue all the Reward I expect: yet grant me one favor (which is) to tell me your Name. <hi>Constantiaes</hi> heart at that word leapt within her, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an excéeding blush to possesse her chéekes, saying: Most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Knight, I were too blame to deny you so small a Request, my
<pb facs="tcp:20827:77"/>
Name is <hi>Constantia.</hi> Then haue the Heavens (quoth he) made mée Fortunate with beholding you, whom my heart hath ever honoured. <hi>Constantia</hi> wondred what he should be, assuring her selfe it was not <hi>Persicles,</hi> for he would not haue asked her name, yet she thought that Sorrow might so much haue altered her in the long time of her sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that on the suddain he could not know her, that her heart was much troubled with those thoughts, till he interrupted them with these spéeches. Lady, it may be you suppose me for other then I am, to rid you of which ambiguity, my name is now <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> which I haue but lately béene knowne by, for before I was called <hi>Montelyon,</hi> brought vp in <hi>Persia,</hi> but whether I was borne there, or who my Parents were, as yet I know not: the cause of my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell into this Countrey, was in your search, in the Company of my noble Lord <hi>Persicles:</hi> who for your absence liveth in continuall griefe: Therefore I beséech you reviue your heart from care, and put your confidence in my fidelity: for I will never part from you, vntill I haue brought you to his presence. <hi>Constantiaes</hi> Heart with these words was possest with such joy, as is not to be exprest. And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that <hi>Philotheta</hi> had told her of <hi>Montelyon,</hi> she said: Most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Knight, I haue long before this heard of your Honourable friendship shown to my deare Lord <hi>Persicles,</hi> which maketh me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt resolue my whole confidence in you, which came to my hearing by the report of a Lady whom you lately succoured in this Countrey, named <hi>Philotheta.</hi> With that he fetcht a déepe sigh from the bottome of his heart, saying: Indéed I did once enjoy her presence, but whether I shall ever sée her againe, or where she is, I know not: Yet if I were not deluded, I did behold her departing out of this Castle. It may be so, said <hi>Constantia,</hi> for she was with me this day, and hath béene here this many dayes, but the Enchantresse in great hast, and by violence tooke her from my company, carrying her I know not whether, by whose kind report of your vertues, I conceiue such comfort in their assurance, that I entreat your promise of assistance, and with that shall my heart rest as void of feare, as if I were in the Court of the King my Father in <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My heart, said she, rejoyceth to heare your kind spéeches, vowing to imploy my life, and all my being to be at your command. Then they departed into the Pallace, with purpose not to tarry there, but instantly to leaue the same: but comming into the outer Court, hée
<pb facs="tcp:20827:77"/>
remembred, that he had heard the voyces of men that lay in misery his heart willing to succour them: desiring her not to be offended, if he had made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They all proffered their Service vnto her, but she desiring not to be knowne of any, in courteous sort refused the same, reposing her whole confidence in the <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> who presenting according to her desire, left the Pallace, and without the Bridge found his owne Stéed grasing, in company of others that had lost their Riders: amongst them hée tooke thrée, on which he mounted <hi>Constantia</hi> and her two Damzels, hasting to travell so farre, as the dayes length would permit from the Pallace, Lodging that Night in a Village some sixe Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the same.

               <p>Worthy Knight, should I rehearse the whole circumstance of my misfortune, and <hi>Amphiadors</hi> wickednesse, I should both trouble you with the tediousnesse, and renue my owne sorrowes: onely this, he wrought meanes to depriue me of this Dukedome, and caused <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrasus</hi> to Enchant me in the Desart, with purpose I should never returne: yet he favouring me, bound me there no longer then <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia</hi> should remaine Inchanted in the Tower, built by <hi>Helyon</hi> Prince of <hi>Arabia,</hi> revealing vnto me many Secrets that I will hereafter discover. Not many dayes since, I found my selfe fréed from this Bondage, whereby he knew that the Enchantment was finished. The same day the Enchantresse <hi>Jla</hi> favouring <hi>Amphiador,</hi> séeing the date of her power grew to an end, came to this Castle, and with her brought <hi>Philotheta,</hi> not his, but my Daughter, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him my release, with whom hée is fled, carrying <hi>Philotheta</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20827:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with them, but whether I knew not: Which I feare me will turne to her great sorrow, for his mind is so apt to cruelty and mischiefe, that he careth not to act any villany to satisfie his owne mind. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse this vnto you, though I know it concernes you not: yet to let you vnderstand that by finishing the Enchantment I was released: Which <hi>Ila</hi> knowing, gaue him knowledge of, and that is the cause of his flight: and also I intreat you to grant me one favour: That is, to let me know whether your Name be not <hi>Constantia,</hi> for my mind giveth me you are the same. I am (said she) that most vnfortunate Creature, and by this Knights noble Valour was I set at liberty, to whom am I most infinitely bound. My heart said <hi>Delatus</hi> rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that I ever had cause to doe you any courtesie, and that it was my good fortune to sée you in this place, having long wished for your Releasement: not onely for mine owne good, but for that Noble King <hi>Persicles</hi> sake, who was with me in the Desart where I lived inthralled since his comming into <hi>Arabia,</hi> who with earnest resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion determined to spend the date of his life in your search: From which I disswaded him; and by my directions he returned into <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syria:</hi> for the Sequell of your Releasement was revealed vnto me by <hi>Penthrasus</hi> himselfe: Which none could atchieue but your owne Sonns, which is this Noble Knight. Nay (said he) doubt not of this, for what he revealed, and I haue published is true, though it r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, and the <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> said; Can I be more fortunate, or heare better Newes, or receiue any comfort that can comfort my heart more then this? O Heavens grant that my joyfull hope may not be frustrated, but that I may bée assured I am discended of such Noble Parents: Which may be true, for <hi>Cothanes</hi> often times told me that he found me vpon the top of a Mountaine, lying in swadling cloathes, and not farre from the body of a Woman, torne and dismembred by Wild Beasts, and many Iewels about me: One of which I haue ever since worne about my Necke: When <hi>Constantia</hi> saw it, she knew the fame, embracing him in her armes, and kissing him, whilest he with humble behaviour did him reverence. I should be over tedious to recite their joyes, and how much <hi>Delatus</hi> and <hi>Alsala</hi> made of them, who would not so leaue them, but promised to Travell with them into <hi>Assyria,</hi> where they were assured to méete <hi>Persicles</hi>: but in such sort that
<pb facs="tcp:20827:79"/>
none might know them, for that yet <hi>Constantia</hi> feared her Fathers displeasure. They stayed there but that Night, and earely the next Morning betooke themselues to travell. Notwithstanding this joy the <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> left some sparkes of discontent which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all his Sences, and turned his quiet into disquiet, which was with remembrance of <hi>Philotheta,</hi> whose mishap pincht him to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart: Who likewise was not frée from the like disquiet, fearing never to sée him againe, little thinking his Name had béene changed, and as little thinking it was he that ended the Enchantment: not onely troubled with this Dispaire, but also vexed with <hi>Ilaes</hi> dealing, who hauing brought her to <hi>Amphiador,</hi> fled, and was never séene of them againe. <hi>Amphiador</hi> being alone with <hi>Philotheta,</hi> thought it not good for him to discover himselfe, least he thereby should hazard his life: but disguising himselfe and <hi>Philotheta,</hi> he left <hi>Arabia,</hi> and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed into <hi>Persia,</hi> thinking to liue there vntill his death vndescryed. And finding out an Habitation fit for that purpose, he told <hi>Philotheta</hi> what he intended, perswading her to abide with him. This troubled her very heart, fearing some greater mischiefe would follow. Which like wise according to her misdoubt, fell out: For now that he saw no meanes to recover his Dignity, nor attaine other Felicity, then to liue in obscurity, his mind being like wise much addicted to Licencious desire, began to dote on <hi>Philothetaes</hi> beauty, which burst out into a flame, and he revealed the same i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Philotheta</hi> (said he) if you knew what I would say, or if you could conceiue my meaning without words, I would refraine to speake: but since there is no hope for me to liue, without I attaine that I desire, I will vtter to you the depth of my good Will, and the thing that I desire so much you should know, which is, that I loue you: this I hope cannot be grievous vnto you: Neither will you I trust deny to loue me, considering how tenderly I haue alwayes regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you. Should I not (said she, Loue you) I were to be accounted very ingratefull, and vnworthy to haue found you so kind, which bindeth me to yéeld you thankes. Then (said he,) Let me enjoy that Loue, for your Beauty hath pierced my heart, and nothing but the swéete thereof, can ease my torment: Here wée may liue together, voyd of disquiet, enjoying each others Loue with content, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth the pleasure that more dignified Honour yéeldeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Philotheta</hi> at the first knew his meaning, replying with mildnesse, but her heart

so much disdained to yéeld to that he desired, that she could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her selfe, but gaue him this answer. <hi>Amphiador,</hi> Doest thou thinke thy wickednesse can overmaster my Vertue? Or doest thou thinke I can like to heare thy odious Spéech, that bewrayeth the inward rancour of thy heart? or hast thou beheld such loosenesse in me, that should animate thée to this dishonourable attempt? or canst thou but conceiue an opinion that I will yéeld to thy wicked lust, which is the fruit of thy ill devising Heart? No, know that I so much abhorre thée, that I shall account the worse of my selfe to haue knowne thée, and curse my cruell destinies, that haue made me to sée thée, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will end my life most desperately, then suffer my Sences, to conceiue one good thought of thée. Then leaue off where thou hast begun, for thou shalt rather sée me massacre my selfe, then yéeld to the least part of thy desire.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mphiador</hi> walking alone in a solitary place, heard the wofull Lamentation of a distressed Lady, who vttered these words: What misery am I brought into mine owne doting folly, vpon that vnknowne Knight, which neither regardeth me, nor I shall never sée him againe: Fond woman that I am, thus to abandon my Fathers Court to liue in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurtty, where I was renowned for vertue: For who heard the name of <hi>Praxentia,</hi> that did not adore the fame? And who was more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced then my selfe that now haue brought my Honour into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace? and for the loue of a stranger haue refused the loue of so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a Prince as <hi>Palian?</hi> O <hi>Persicles,</hi> thée may I curse, for by thy meanes is he thus absent, and thou hast lost him, or left him where he will never returne: <hi>Amphiador</hi> wondred much to heare her name <hi>Persicles, Palian,</hi> and <hi>Praxentia,</hi> which severall names he knew, marvelling who that should be: but séeing her silent, he drew neare to her, saying: Lady, hearing your Laments, I could not choose but pitty you: which maketh me thus bold to approach into our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb facs="tcp:20827:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proffering my assistance to aid you in what I can. My friend (said <hi>Praxentia</hi>) against my will you are priuy to my estate, which if you doe pitty, then also succour me, for I am brought low by too much griefe, and weake for want of sustenance, Lady (quoth he) my Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation is not farre hence, whether I will bring you, where you shall not want any thing you will desire. Being come thither they found <hi>Philotheta</hi> drowned in teares, the cause whereof he well knew, but <hi>Praxentia</hi> wondred at it, containing another inward Sorrow, to sée so swéet a creature in such sadnesse. <hi>Philotheta</hi> likewise marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what she was, hoping by her comfort to receiue some comfort, which might hinder his practice.</p>
               <p>He on the other side went forth againe to meditate, leaving them together, meaning nothing lesse then to pitty either of them, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising meanes to attaine both their loues, which he was fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to enjoy, though the déed were never so wicked, and the meanes never so hainous. <hi>Praxentia</hi> having well refresht her selfe with such good food as she had received, demanded <hi>Philothetaes</hi> cause of sorrow. Aye me, said she, none so miserable as I, this Tyrant that brought you hither, is my Father in law, whose mind is so wicked that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth to winne me to his lust, which addeth much sorrow to my heart, as I am weary of my life: my name is <hi>Philotheta,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Ila,</hi> whom all men had thought to haue béene since dead, but he being informed of the contrary by the Enchantresse, fled, bringing me hither by force, where he intendeth to kéepe me as his Bond-slaue, but the Heavens I hope will ordaine some succour to my distresse, your helpe I cannot desire, for that I suppose your selfe in the same state I am in (that is) in distresse: to remedy which evill, you are fallen into a place, that yéeldeth no content, but rather contrarily to insnare me into more misery.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Praxentia</hi> could reply, <hi>Amphiador</hi> came in, entertained her with many counterfeit courtesies, comforting her with many faire Spéeches, protesting so many Services, duties, and promises, as none but one of so impudent a disposition could haue found occasion on such a suddaine to proffer: the intent of which words <hi>Praxentia</hi> as fore warned, well vnderstood, fearing some further mischiefe would follow thereon. That day she could haue no farther conference with <hi>Philotheta,</hi> for he was still in their company. That Night they thought to haue lodged together, but hée ordered the contrary, by
<pb facs="tcp:20827:80"/>
which meanes, both that night, and for some thrée dayes after, they could find no opportunity to vtter their minds each to other. In the meane time he was never out of one of their companies, perswading <hi>Philotheta</hi> to yéeld her liking, so that he had proffered and vsing such spéeches to <hi>Praxentia,</hi> as might draw her to a good opinion of him: which when he thought he had affected: one night when <hi>Praxentia</hi> little thought of such treachery, being overwhelmed in drowsie sléep, he entred her Chamber by a secret way, and comming to her bed side perceiving her sléepe so soundly, without any more adoe, crept into the bed to her: she féeling one in the bed, was so amazed and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, on the sudden, that before he could embrace her, as he intended, she leapt out on the other side, and running to the doore opened the same, to whom he called, saying, I beséech you stay. I meant you no harme, by Heaven I will not offer you injury. What villain art thou, said she, that séekest my dishonour? or what wicked pretence driues thée hither at such vnseasonable time, and in such audacious sort to affright me? neither intending your dishonour, nor vnder other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence then vertuous, came your poore Servant <hi>Amphiador</hi> into your presence, but onely with thankfulnesse, to make manifest vnto you my hearts true affection: therefore I beséech you shun me not, nor suspect me not, for my heart will sooner sée it selfe torne in pieces, then thinke a thought to wrong your worthinesse: would I be so madde as trust thée (said she) thou mightest well repute me for immodest, and well might I blame my selfe if I sustained wrong: therefore for this time I will leaue thée.</p>
               <p>With that she made fast the Doore, and hasted to <hi>Philothetaes</hi> Lodging, knocking very hastily, withall calling aloud <hi>Philotheta, Philotheta,</hi> let me in, she being a sléepe, was halfe amazed with the noyse, not daring at the first or second call to open the Doore: but when she perceived it was a womans voyce, she opened the doore, which was no sooner open, but <hi>Praxentia</hi> stept in, desiring to make fast the same againe. Which done, feare made <hi>Praxentia</hi> so muse, that vntill she had reassumed her memoriall Sences to their proper vse, she could not speake a word. Whilest <hi>Philotheta</hi> with much sorrow beheld her extasie, of demanding the cause thereof: At last, she declared how <hi>Amphiador</hi> had vsed her. O most detestable Villaine, said <hi>Philotheta,</hi> will the Fates suffer him to procéed in his blindnesse and not cut him off? Or can we devise no good meanes to
<pb facs="tcp:20827:81"/>
avoyd his intent? Lady, said <hi>Praxentia,</hi> doe but ioyne with me, and you shall soone see, that betwixt vs we will rid our selues out of his tyranny, O Lord, said <hi>Philotheta,</hi> I shall thinke my selfe the most happiest woman living, and for ever honour you, if by your counsell and helpe I may attaine this felicity. Then said <hi>Praxentia,</hi> doe but this next night by some meanes convey his Swords into my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and there hide your selfe in secret vntill I come, in the mean time I will deale so with him this day, that he shall againe come to my Chamber, without suspect of our intent, but with méere hope to attaine my loue: where, when he is come, I will so worke with him that either wée will by cunning out reach him, or sheath the same into his Bowels. All this said <hi>Philotheta,</hi> will I constantly performe. Earely the next Morning <hi>Philotheta</hi> fetcht <hi>Praxentiaes</hi> Apparell, which when she had put on, she went downe where she knew <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiador</hi> was: who espying her, presently came to her, desiring her to pardon his last Nights oversight. Sir (said she) I was disquieted therwith more then I néeded, considering you meant me no violence, as you protest: but it was a great folly in you to come at so vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a time, and not make the party acquainted therewith. Pardon me, I humbly desire you, said he, and withall pitty me that am ensna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the bands of Loue to your beauty, which will be most pleasing to my sences, and preserue my life, and whatsoever you shall demand mée in recompence thereof, I will performe.</p>
               <p>Many such spéeches he vsed, and she counterfeited many faint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, which yet was intermingled with such hope, that he perceiued she would yéeld: and therefore he the more earnestly intreated, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, swore, and protested to win her consent, which at last according to her appointment, she granted, but with such conditions as furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the purpose of their intended revenge. He joyfull thereof left her, and she went to <hi>Philotheta</hi> declaring every circumstance, how she had dealt with him. When Night approached, he left their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and went walking abroad, to meditate on his ensuing pleasure, thinking by that he returned, they would be parted to their severall Lodgings. In which time <hi>Philotheta</hi> conveyed into the Chamber two Swords, which was all the Weapons which was in the House, and hid her selfe closely from being séene. When he thought it time, he came to the Chamber doore, where he found <hi>Praxentia</hi> very ready to let him in, whose heart faintly trembled with feare at the sight of
<pb facs="tcp:20827:81"/>
him, but yet she shooke it off, with as much courage as might be in a Woman. When he was entred and the doore made fast, having first embraced her with a lascivious kisse, which we patiently endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, void of doubt by reason of her promise, he went to Bed, whilest she stood trifling, as if she had béene most buisily vndressing her selfe. When she saw him in Bed, she came to the Bed-side, giving him a betraying Kisse, vttering these words. <hi>Amphiador</hi> (said she,) How much doe I now differ from Chastity, that must yéeld to violate the same without the holy Rites of Marriage, wherein I shall cast away my selfe, and make my Name in Oblique in the whole World, if you forsake me, of whose faith I haue no assurance? Tush (quoth he) feare not, but come to Bed, then will I make thée so faithfull a Promise, that thou shalt rest there with contented. That were (said she) to yéeld possession before, and afterwards repent. By my Soule (said he) I will dot doe so much as touch you before I be licensed by your frée consent. Then (said she,) for my better assurance let me bind your hands, and then I will without delay come to you. He accounted that request to procéed from bashfull Feare, not from pollicie: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king though his Hands were bound, he should be good enough for her with his Leggs, he granted it. Then she tooke a Scarfe which she had brought of purpose, and therewith bound his hands so fast, that it was impossible for them to vndoe them. Which done, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theta</hi> stept forth, delivering one of the Swords to <hi>Praxentia,</hi> and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other against his Brest, said: Now <hi>Amphiador,</hi> What hath thy lewdnesse brought thée vnto, but to misery: thinkest thou (that hadst no mercy in séeking our dishonour) shalt find Remorse in vs to worke revenge? Nay villanous Traytor (said <hi>Praxentia</hi>) should we suffer so vile a miscreant to liue, we should doe a wicked déed: for a man of thy impious condition will infect the World. Art thou so treacherous as thou carest not what Lawes thou violatest, and yet so simple to be over reacht by a silly Woman? yet know whom thou hast offended, and to whom thou wouldest haue none vio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Know I say Traytor that my Name is <hi>Praxentia,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> that will worke revenge vpon thée, worthy thy hainous Acte. <hi>Philotheta</hi> marvailed when she heard her Name, and he lay confounded with shame, his Coward heart fainting with such feare, that with little violence it would haue béene overcome. To make him more sure, the one of them bound his féet, whilest the other
<pb facs="tcp:20827:82"/>
stood ready to stab him if he styrred: Which done, they withdrew themselues, consulting which way to be rid of him. Most Noble Lady (said <hi>Philotheta</hi>) your Prudence hath set vs at liberty from this Tyrant, whom (so if please you) we will leaue in this place, and not staine our Innocent hands, with shedding such impure blood. But said <hi>Praxentia,</hi> how shall we escape from hence? Easily (said she) for leaving him fast bound, there is none to pursue vs, but we may with safety travell whether it please you. When they had thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>Praxentia</hi> came to him, vttering these Spéeches, <hi>Amphiador,</hi> we cannot as yet resolue how to worke sufficient Revenge vpon thée, therefore make no exclamation, but with patience abide our will, which will be too favourable: for if we heare thée but once open thy mouth, we will in such sort vse thée, that thou shalt wish thou hadst followed our directions. Which said, locking fast the doores they left him. Then they began to consult, what to doe, <hi>Praxentia</hi> saying; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it may be your determination is to returne into <hi>Arabia,</hi> which will be an occasion of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For my purpose is to journey into <hi>Assyria,</hi> vpon an occasion that concerneth me no lesse then my life: which I shall reveale vnto you, vpon your promise of Secresie. I were not worthy to liue (said she) would I reveale your Counsell. Then did she repeat to her, her Loue to <hi>Montelyon,</hi> and how <hi>Palian</hi> crost the same, vntill his departure with <hi>Persicles, Philothetaes</hi> heart melted within her to heare that Spéech, fearing to be disappointed of her intent, and misdoubting his Constancie, being troubled with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame anguish that so great a Princesse should be her Corrivall: sometimes dispairing with a conceit that <hi>Montelyon</hi> did not estéeme her according to his spéech, and her owne perswasion, but that he proffered his loue to her of a customable common courtesie, to try her, not of affection. Many other cogitations suddainly concurred in her braine, but séeing <hi>Praxentia</hi> except a Reply, without further medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Most Noble Princesse, if you will accept of my company, I will in regard of your courtesie vndeservedly showne to me, venture my selfe with you, and doe my best to further you in attaining your desire. <hi>Praxentia</hi> was glad thereof. And with this resolution in the Morning they left that place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> travailing towards <hi>Assyria,</hi> changing their Vpper-Garments, to Palmers-gray, the best meanes so passe without molestation.</p>

Some foure dayes after, Fortune so brought things to passe, that the <hi>Knight of the Oracle, Delatus, Constantia,</hi> and <hi>Alsala,</hi> with many others in their company, having lost their way, lighted on this discomfortable place, where <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiador</hi> lay for want of food, making such outragious lamentation, that it pierced the Eares of the Knight, who first hearing the same, set Spurs to his Stéed, entring the house, the doores whereof he found open, and drawing his Sword, he found the Chamber from whence that pittious cry procéeded, fast lockt, which he brake open, and found <hi>Amphiador</hi> in such a lamentable plight, that the Water stood in his eyes. <hi>Amphiador</hi> séeing him, cryed out to him for meat, as the thing he most wanted.

                  <hi>Persicles</hi> intent in doing this was, that whatsoever Stranger came, that had not good Provision of his owne, should there find Entertainment in Honour of <hi>Montelyon:</hi> in whose memoriall, he had built the same, as a remembrance of his Loue and Favour. His intent being to draw all strangere thither, (by whose report hoping hée might heare some Newes of his beloved Friend <hi>Montelyon:</hi> Travell within few dayes had brought the <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> and his Company into <hi>Assyria,</hi> where they met with an <hi>Assyrian</hi> of whom the <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> demanded whose Tents were those they beheld. He declared so much as hée knew: Where may we haue Lodging, said he? Not within a City, answered the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> for thither are none permitted to come without examination? But in the middest among those Tents there is one Pavilion, the most beautifullest that ever Eye beheld, built in remembrance of the Noble Knight <hi>Montelyon,</hi> that fréed our Country from the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> oppression: in which place all that are strangers, and without provision of their owne haue Entertainment in his remembrance. Wilt thou direct vs thither (said he) and I will reward thée? I will (said he.) When they were come thither according to the <hi>Assyrians</hi> report, they were honourably entertained, and Lodged in such sort as themselues desired.

<pb facs="tcp:20827:84"/>
the discovery of them to <hi>Persicles. Persicles</hi> hearing that many stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were in <hi>Montelyons</hi> Pavilion, that day he disguised himselfe into the habit of one of his owne men, onely to view them, and to sée whether his Servants vsed them so honourably as he intented they should. And comming into the roome where <hi>Constantia,</hi> the <hi>Knight of the Oracle, Delatus</hi> and <hi>Alsala</hi> was, at the first sight he knew <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Montelyon,</hi> which was called the <hi>Knight of the Oracle,</hi> and viewing well <hi>Constantia,</hi> he likewise at the first sight knew her: Then did he immediately beléeue that the <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> had released her, which was <hi>Montelyon:</hi> which <hi>Delatus</hi> told him should be finished by his owne Sonne. These joyes concurring, fil'd vp his Sences with such delight, that he was inforced to withdraw himselfe from being discovered, which at that time he would not be. Altering his disguise againe, and without further deliberation, hée went to the King of <hi>Persiaes</hi> Tent, and finding him in a convenient place, he vttered these kind words. Most renowned King, the Friendship and helpe I haue received by your favour, without any merit of mine owne, hath made me most infinitely bound to your Excellency: yet neverthelesse, I must request one further favour at your hands, which you may with more safety grant, then deny, and thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so make me and your selfe happy. My loving Friend, said he, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be, I will not deny it you. I make the more doubt (said he) because I haue heard you vow the contrary, and yet should you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that vow, it would procure you much discontent. A rash vow, (said hée) may be broken, and therefore let me know your request, and it may be I will dispence therewith. My desire is, you would pardon <hi>Constantia</hi> your Daughter, and remit the offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her, and him that caused her to leaue the <hi>Persian</hi> Court. Why my Lord (said he) doe you know where she is? First, I beséech you grant my request, and then I will reveale vnto you all that I know. For your sake, said he, I will fréely accept her into my favour. Then I most humbly thanke you (said he) both for her and my selfe: For it was my most vnhappy selfe, that was the cause of her departure, but since that time I haue not séene her vntill this day. For going to the Pavillion, which is named by <hi>Montelyon:</hi> this day I espyed her there, in company of <hi>Montelyon,</hi> which is called <hi>Knight of the Oracle:</hi> The King of <hi>Persia</hi> rejoyced to heare that Newes, which pleased him so well, that he could not choose but reveale it to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,

Sir, said the Palmer, I would returne to you againe, if I knew which way I might conveniently come to speake with you: I will be (said he) to morrow without the City about this time, hoping to heare better newes of her by thy perswasions: Then giving the Palmer a Rich Iewell for his paines, they parted, <hi>Philotheta</hi> out of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and he into the Garden, meditating on that which he had heard. <hi>Philotheta</hi> by this time was returned to the Pavillion, vttering the whole summe of the conference she had with the <hi>Knight of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> vnto <hi>Praxentia</hi>: With which she was so grieved, that <hi>Philotheta</hi> expected when she would haue yéelded vp the Ghost, fearing that she would haue run mad, which to prevent, she said.

My Lord (said <hi>Philotheta</hi>) she rageth most extreamely, and I feare me, will doe her selfe some violence vnlesse you pitty her. That cannot I doe (said he) although it pincheth my heart to heare of her sorrow: what should I say more? or what wouldest thou wish me to do, to ease her and yet reserue my loyalty?

               <p>Peace Palmer quoth he, if my fortunes proue so bad, the greater will be my misery: therefore tell me what thou wouldst haue me doe: my Lord (said she) had I not promised her to bring you to speak with her, she would haue destroyed her selfe ere this: therefore vouchsafe mée such favour, that I may performe my word, which may be a meanes to end this malady. Didst thou know (quoth he) how vnwilling I am to doe it, I thinke thou wouldst not request it: but to satisfie her of that, which peradventure she will not credit by thy report, and at thy request, I will come to her this evening. Till then farewell quoth he. <hi>Philotheta</hi> being parted from him, by the way vttered these spéeches. O that fortune would favour me so much, and blesse me with that felicity, to be the party this worthy Knight so constantly loveth. By this she was come to the Pavilion, where even then there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred foure Knights in black Armour, gallantly mounted, by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward habit portended some fatall stratagem: which were <hi>Palian</hi> and the thrée Sons of the King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who had vowed either secretly or openly to plot the death of <hi>Montelyon</hi>: taking vp their Lodging there to complot their treason.

I am come to you desiring you not to misconceiue of me, nor condemne me of inhumanity, that am not mine owne, and therefore I cannot giue my selfe vnto you. I haue vttered vnto the Palmer that which I will now conceale as loath to offend you, yet constrained thereto, desiring you to command my life, if you please, for that shall be at your disposition otherwise I cannot imploy my selfe to your liking. I haue long since knowne of your good will to me, which <hi>Palian</hi> by his subtilty increased, of whose Loue and procéedings I know so much that I thinke: I shall wrong him to fulfill your request: my selfe was the man that should haue joyned your hands, when he tooke my habit and name vpon him which I presume here to vtter, that thereby you may remember my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie in that complot, and how constantly I haue vowed my selfe to another.</p>

                  <hi>Praxentia</hi> what with anger, shame, and griefe, stood like one mute, vexed that he knew of <hi>Palians</hi> act, shame to make loue contrary to the propertie of her kind, and grieved to be disappointed: all which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether not suffering her to speake, vntill at last these passions, and her burning Loue so overcame her, that knéeling downe, she said.</p>
               <p>Good Knight blame me not, nor doe not condemne me of immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, but grant pitty to my torment. He taking her vp, desired her not to knéele to him that was not worthie thereof, nor able to deserue it: then taking him by the hand, she desired him to sit downe by her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bed, beckning <hi>Philotheta</hi> to depart the roome.</p>
               <p>To repeat what manner of behaviour <hi>Praxentia</hi> vsed, and the words he spake, would haue made any modest eare to blush to heare of: but séeing that nothing could prevaile, rage and lust so over ruled her, that in bitter exclaimes she cryed out: Inhumane, disloyall, and dishonourable Knight, doest thou require my Loue with this disdain? Or thinkest thou I will liue to beare the blot of thy refusall? At the conclusion of which words, <hi>Thetus</hi> entred the roome, and with his Sword drawne, ran at him, who by good Fortune beholding him, started aside, otherwise he had béene slaine yet he was sore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wherewith he drew his sword, striking at <hi>Thetus,</hi> and at every blow wounding him. <hi>Philotheta</hi> hearing the noyse, came in and séeing the <hi>Knight of the Oracle</hi> wounded, with feare, grief, and amazement cryed out, helpe, helpe, the Kings Son <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this time <hi>Palian</hi> and his two Brethren came in, who séeing <hi>Thetus</hi> slaine cryed out: Stay the Traytor, he hath murthered <hi>Thetus,</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Macedonia.

What griefe was this to <hi>Philotheta</hi> you may judge: and how much it vexed him to be thus betrayed, cannot be vttered: standing in his owne defence, against such as would haue apprehended him, that knew him not, vntill he was grievously wounded, and many of them slaine, in which time newes thereof was come to the hearing of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicles,</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who with all hast came thitherwards: The Souldiers like wise hearing of the <hi>Knight of the Oracles</hi> distresse, brake the conditions of the concluded Peace, and by Multitudes ran forth of the Citie to preserue them. <hi>Persicles</hi> first entred the Tent, next him the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> giving commandement vpon paine of Death, that no man should strike a blow.

The Embassadors departed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived, were admitted to <hi>Delfurnoes</hi> presence, one of them vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Message in these words.</p>
               <p>Most renowned Emperour, the Kings of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> send friendly gréetings to your Highnesse, desiring your ayd against their mighty Foes, the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> who are now ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with oppression, and vniust warre to offer them iniury

the Sonne of <hi>Persicles,</hi> having in most dishonourable sort deflowred <hi>Praxentia,</hi> and slew <hi>Thetus</hi> her Brother, séeking her rescue: Besides, my Lords, having nothing of more worth then a most beautifull and vertuous Lady, who surpasseth all the Ladies that euer eye beheld, present her vnto you, as being fit for none, but a man of such honour and dignity as your selfe: whose counterfeit imperfectly drawne, we present vnto your Highnesse, desiring your assistance to the ayd of vertue, and suppressing of wrong, which agréeth with you magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. <hi>Delfurno</hi> hearing of these spéeches, and viewing the Picture well, for a while stood in a study. At last he made them answer thus. I know not vpon what ground I should warre against <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> that never did me wrong, yet I would willingly assist your Lords, not drawne thereunto by this present, that I estéeme not, but for the Loue I beare them, and to punish such dishonour as their Foe hath showne: Therefore returne your Lords this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that within thrée Moneths I will be in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and bring with me such a power as shall vanquish their Foes, and set them in peaceable possession of their rights. The Embassadors after they were honourably entertained, and sumptuously feasted, departed with this joyfull newes, which added both comfort and resolution to the <hi>Armenian</hi> Hoast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Delfurno</hi> being alone, commanded the Picture to be brought into his Chamber, which he viewed and reviewed, beholding the counterfeit with such a surfeiting eye, that he began to affect the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Lady, by beholding her present Picture. Afterwards calling before him the ancientest Captaines and Commanders that were imployed in his Fathers Warres, hée commanded them to Muster an Army of forty thousand strong, of the best Souldiers in his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and with all spéed to conduct them to the Hoast in <hi>Armenia,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther staying his comming, nor expecting other command from him for he would be there before them.

               <p>Noble Generall, my Master being a Knight of a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, having travailed many Miles in search of Adventures, happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to arrive neare the Hoast, being neither Foe to this Country, nor Friend to <hi>Persicles,</hi> desireth that with your favour he may make tryall of his valour against the Knights of this Campe, which he will vndertake in defence of his Ladies vertue, beauty and worthinesse, whom he will maintaine in single Combat against all commers, to excéed all others. The King returned this answer. Tell thy Master, he is welcome, and shall haue our frée consent so that he requireth: but withall let him take his friendly warning from me, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware what he vndertake, left the valour of these Knights turne him to repentance. The Squire returned with this answer to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who presently hung the vayled Picture vpon the body of a faire spreading Dake, himselfe resting thereby as a Guardiant, and ready to combate him that came next.</p>
               <p>The Knights of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Macedonia</hi> hearing of this strange Knights braue Challenge, prepared to joust with him, and the first was a young Knight of <hi>Armenia,</hi> named <hi>Tellutus,</hi> who loved <hi>Brisa,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Linsus,</hi> who supposed her beauty by reason of his entyre loue, to excell all, but his Fortune was crost, and he at the second course overthrowne.</p>
               <p>The second that Iusted was <hi>Arnon,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that maintained thrée courses against him with great agility, but at the fourth he was vnhorsed.

               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> noting her well, suddenly remembring he had séen her, felt such a Passion oppresse his heart, that he thought it melted within him: When she was past, he demanded what Lady that was, that was so gallantly attended? Her name (quoth one) is <hi>Philotheta,</hi> Daughter to a Duke in <hi>Arabia,</hi> that was so lately surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Assyria,</hi> and brought thither with intent to be married to <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furno</hi> the Emperor. <hi>Montelyon</hi> hearing that, held his peace, getting from the company into a solitary place, where being alone, he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered these Meditations. And can it be that <hi>Philotheta</hi> was in <hi>Assyria,</hi> in her owne person, and an others name to bring a Message to me? That néed I not doubt of, for <hi>Raleaes</hi> spéeches confirmed it: but may it not be that she sent some other? that cannot be, for they tell me she was surprized in <hi>Assyria.</hi> Moreover <hi>Ralea</hi> told me, that she came in the Disguise of a Palmer, which Palmer I am assured was even the very same that trained me to <hi>Praxentiaes</hi> presence, Whom I now presently remember, had the selfe-same countenance of <hi>Philotheta,</hi> which made me affect him so much. These remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, may be assurances that she rather hateth then loveth mée, for otherwise I cannot be perswaded, and then the taske I haue vndertaken over tedious: for it will be in vaine to séeke her loue that
<pb facs="tcp:20827:94"/>
regardeth me not. Besides, did she loue me, yet having thrust my selfe amongst such a multitude of mine Enemies, that if they knew mée would end my life: it is impossible for me to make my Loue knowne to her, yea, or so much as to speake to her: What hope is there then left for me, but to Despaire, or returne to my Parents, séeke to win her possession by force of Armes.</p>
               <p>Whilest he yet continued in these Meditations he espyed the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> comming towards him, to whom he vsed great Reverence. The King suddainly séeing him, as soone remembred he told him he was of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which made him vtter these spéeches. Well met <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius,</hi> I thinke thou toldest me thou wert of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and therefore it commeth in my mind, that thou art the onely man may'st pleasure me if thou wilt vndertake for me, being a matter of small labour, but much importance: Which if thou wilt but vndertake, and with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy conceale, thy reward shall be so great as thy heart can wish. My Lord (quoth he) whatsoeuer it be, I will vndertake it, doing my vttermost indeavour therein, with such secrecy and diligence, as you shall like of. I doe both trust and beléeue thée (said he) for in thy face I sée the sparkes of Honour: therefore this it is. There is in my Court a Lady of thy Countrey, named <hi>Philotheta,</hi> whom I had thought to haue matched with the Emperour <hi>Delfurno,</hi> but now my Mind is altered, and I purpose to enjoy her my selfe: and for that thou art her Countrey-man, I thinke thou mayst prevaile more to perswade her then any other: therefore I haue chosen thée as my Friend, yea my deare Friend to sollicite my sute vnto her: But thou must not be knowne but that thou doest onely speake in the behalfe of <hi>Delfurno:</hi> for so will I tell him. This is that I would haue thée performe: therefore tell me, art thou resolved to doe it?

Thereupon <hi>Delfurno</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him great rewards, and he as much fidelity, as being contented with his spéeches he departed: He was no sooner gone, but the King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> came in, whose heart was grounded vpon a new Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that <hi>Montelyon</hi> thought not off, for he determined, that none should enioy <hi>Philotheta</hi> but onely himselfe, and therefore came to make tryall whither this supposed <hi>Honorius</hi> would condiscend to be ruled by him: which if he would doe, then he thought to convey <hi>Philotheta</hi> secretly into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> so as neither <hi>Delfurno</hi> nor the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> should haue any suspect thereof. To this effect hée communed with <hi>Honorius,</hi> first binding him to be secret, then by gifts inticing him, and lastly, dealing by intreaty, vntill he had vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the depth of his mind, which he promised to effect, vsing such words as pleased the King, wherewith hée went away contented. Whilest <hi>Montelyon</hi> and the King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> were thus in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> was entring the Garden, but séeing them in such discoursing he withdrew himselfe vntill they were parted, and then he came in, demanding what good newes he had for him. My Liege, replyed hée, the last motion you made to her about her marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to <hi>Delfurno</hi> hath hindred your owne, for I had much a doe to perswade her that you had any intent at all to loue her, that were so earnest for another: but notwithstanding that, I hope soone to alter her, and bring her to a better liking of your affection. The Emperor
<pb facs="tcp:20827:96"/>
hath béene with me already, earnestly soliciting me to prosecute his suite with efficacie. Likewise hath the King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> with many promises, desired me to vse what perswasions I could in the Emperours behalfe: but for that by your Majesty I am so honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly estéemed of, I will try the vttermost of my skill to pleasure you: I thanke thée good <hi>Honorius</hi> (quoth he) and I will for thy kindnesse yéeld thée so large a recompence as thy heart can wish.

haue vowed that my best endeavours shall be imployed onely to your good liking. The King hearing that both of them went about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him raged excéedingly, but trusting his Fidelity, he was quieted: asking what he should doe to prevent them both. My deare Lord (quoth he) this Evening you may effect your desire, or else ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: at which time giue me but directions, whether I may convey her to a place of security, or where we may méete you, and I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture my life but I will doe it: and by this meanes you shall deliver your Signet vnto me, for our quiet passage forth at the City Gate, and then may wée méete you where you will appoint vs. And that shall be (quoth he) at Fryer <hi>Barnards</hi> Cell without the City, if you know it, and there is my Signet. Thither will I convay her (quoth he) at twelue a Clocke. Farewell then (quoth the King) be but Faithfull, and thou shalt find my friendship such, as shall highly reward thy paines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> having effected this, presently went to the King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> telling him how the Emperours importimacie was such, that it was high time, (either then, or never) to convay <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theta</hi> thence, whom he found willing to yéeld thereunto. He hearing that, desired his counsell, promising well to reward him, intreating him to doe it for him, and both himselfe and his Kingdome should be at his command. Deliver me (quoth <hi>Montelyon</hi>) your Signet for my Passe, and appoint the place and Time, and I will bring her thither. There is my Signet (quoth he) the place, at Fryar <hi>Barnards</hi> Cell, and the time, one of the Clocke. After many other spéeches they parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> without stay went to the Emperour, with submisse behaviour, telling him how that <hi>Philotheta</hi> did greatly affect him, and had sent him to make an humble request vnto him: which was, that we might be convayed in secresie from the Campe, for that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers did invirone her in that place, and that of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as did concerne his Life, whereon her safety depended: which for that they were of weight, she would reveale to none but himselfe, desiring him not to come to her, for that his person might thereby be indangered. <hi>Delfurno</hi> hearing this, was excéedingly troubled in his mind, yet glad to heare that she estéemed him, said: <hi>Honorius,</hi> I would as gladly affect any thing to content her, as I would to saue mine owne life, yet doe I not know how, vnlesse by thy directions:
<pb facs="tcp:20827:97"/>
therefore doe but counsell me, and I will yéeld to that which thou shalt advise. My Noble Lord (quoth he) the safest way is, this night secretly to convay her through the Gate where your Souldiers lye, and I will bring her to Fryer <hi>Barnards</hi> Cell, about eleven of the Clocke, where you may be ready to receiue her, and with a sufficient Guard of Knights to convay her into <hi>Almaigne,</hi> or any place of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Moreover, my Lord, she willed me to assure you, that both the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> having disloyally forgotten their promise to you, séeke to win her loue to themselues, which dishonour she cannot endure to be done against you. <hi>Delfurno</hi> was much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to heare that, yet hoping to prevent them both, he quieted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, delivering his Signet to <hi>Montelyon,</hi> with many thankes and much intreaty, desiring him to be carefull, that nothing might prevent their purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> being glad of this, thought not so to end, but presently went to the Quéene of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> telling her the Kings complot, for convaying of <hi>Philotheta</hi> thence, shewing her his Signet: which when she beheld, excéeding griefe possest her heart to thinke of his disloyalty. <hi>Montelyon</hi> séeing that, said. Notwithstanding, hée hath attempted this, I know the Ladies vertues to be such, as she will rather suffer the extreamest miseries in the world, then yéeld there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and for my selfe, though he hath promised me great rewards, I respect more mine honour, then to be the agent in so wicked an Act, therefore to assure, that I entend it not. I yéeld you his Signet, whereby I should haue past the Campe, to méet at <hi>Bernards</hi> Cell.

               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> being gone from her, went to the Quéene of <hi>Armenia,</hi> telling her the like, and indéed the truth of her Lord, both delivering her his Signet and all other directions for her to méete him by: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her so mad with rage and jealousie, that she was ready to teare her hayre: yea even with bitter exclaimes to reveale her mind, but that she referred it vntill she might surprize him with a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science at <hi>Barnards</hi> Cell.</p>
               <p>By this time it grew to be night, and after Supper, was ended, both <hi>Delfurno,</hi> the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> making
<pb facs="tcp:20827:98"/>
more then wonted hast to breake company, each being glad that the other was so willing to part, which the two Quéenes noted, as priuy to their drifts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montelyon</hi> like wise got him to <hi>Philotheta,</hi> telling her, that he had so prevailed with <hi>Delfurno,</hi> that he had gotten his Signet, as their warrant to passe through the Campe, entreating her to be in a readinesse to goe with him, desiring her to feare no danger, for his life should shield her. She granted to goe with him, desiring him to stay there, vntill the time appointed which he performed, passing the time in private conference with her, to both their likings. The time being come, and all things silent, <hi>Montelyon</hi> armed himselfe, leading <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theta</hi> out of the Court, passing all the guards, watches, and garrisons, by shewing the Emperours Signet, and comming where the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers lay, they likewise let him goe, vntill they were without the City gates. <hi>Montelyon</hi> having without danger effected this, turned his steps directly towards his owne City, which was not farre off, and therefore with ease they got thither. Being come to the City gates, the watch espying them, demanded who was there. <hi>Montelyon</hi> had them come downe and sée: they came downe and tooke them in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to examine them: but <hi>Montelyon</hi> discovered himselfe as loath to stay there, yet commanding them to conceale it, and to carry him as a Prisoner to <hi>Delatus</hi> which they performed, where they knocked, and were let in. <hi>Delatus</hi> and <hi>Alfala</hi> knowing him, did him humble reverence, rejoycing in their hearts to see him so safely retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But <hi>Montelyon</hi> vnvailing <hi>Philotheta, Alfala</hi> presently knew her with teares of joy welcomming her, whilest the old Duke melted with passion to behold his Daughter, whom from her infancy he had not séene: embracing her in his armes, and a thousand times kissing her tender cheeke. These embracings being past, <hi>Montelyon</hi> said, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, since you are now in safety with your Parents, my promise is performed, desiring you to haue regard to the passions I endure, which time will not now permit me to vtter, but leaue to your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous consideration: therefore I beséech you in mine absence, let my loyalty be regarded, and your gentle heart willing to pitty me.

She hearing that, taking him to be her Lord, yéelded him many thanks, purposing to try the vttermost conclusion, before she revealed her selfe, saying: Had I not assured my selfe of your Loue, I would not haue come hither: but being here I rest at your disposition: <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furno</hi> then embraced her, oft times kissing her, and being of a quicke conceit, presently bethought himselfe if she would condiscend, to call vp the Fryer, and be married.

The Fryer thinking that some mad spirits were abroad, or that some franticke dreame had overcome his sences, without asking any more questions marryed them, and sent them away.

And comming to the doore, the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> demanded, if there had béene a Lady that night. Yes (<abbr>qd</abbr> be) here hath béene two, but what they were I know not. It was assuredly <hi>Philotheta,</hi> and with her <hi>Delfurno,</hi> to whom I marryed her: but what the other two were I know not: The King hearing that, in a rage ran back to the king of <hi>Macedoniaes</hi> Tent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to speak with him, the Guard knowing him, let him in, and he standing by his beds side, said.

                  <hi>Armenia,</hi> thy life shall not satisfie the dishonour thou hast done vs. With that he drew his Sword, and he starting from his bed to reach his to defend himselfe, in which time the K. of <hi>Armenia</hi> catching hold on her as she lay, drew her forth into the floore, where beholding her he was then much more enraged, being ready to kill her, but that the King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> prevented him: who likewise séeing her, stood as one amased, whilest she hasted to apparell her selfe, and ran from thence vnto the Pallace. The King of <hi>Armenia</hi> vowing revenge, went from the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Tent, and presently caused his Drum to strike vp Alarum, and commanded his Souldiers to destroy the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who according to his command, suddenly set vpon them, that there began an excéeding slaughter amongst them. The Emperor having newes thereof, supposing the cause had béen for the losse of <hi>Philotheta,</hi> commanded two of his knights to goe vnto either of them, and desire them to be pacified vntill they had discovered their griefes to him, which he could easily remedy, if not he would become a friend to one of them. The messengers found them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in single combat, and delivered their Message, but it was long before either of them would goe to him, yet at last they went both: To whom <hi>Delfurno</hi> said: My Lords, I beléeue your strife ariseth from the losse of <hi>Philotheta,</hi> if that be the cause contend no longer, for as you were both willing I should enjoy her, so I haue this night had possession of her life, being lawfully married vnto her at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> Cell.

Honour so betrayed, lay quits bereft of sence, but comming againe to her selfe she cryed out for pardon, alleadging she was betrayed: but there was now no time of parley, for all of them were enraged, and as well <hi>Delfurno</hi> as the rest, betooke themselues to Armes. But the Quéene of <hi>Macedonia</hi> humbling her selfe at her husbands féet. Said: Both you, my selfe, and all of vs are deceived: <hi>Honorius</hi> yesternight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto me, that you intended privily to carry <hi>Philotheta</hi> from hence. I requested him to counsell me how to prevent you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he told me, that you had appointed to méet with him and her at <hi>Barnards</hi> Cell and for his Passe he had received your Signet, which at my earnest intreaty he delivered me, I thinking to surprize you there, came thither, where the Emperour as I now perceiue met
