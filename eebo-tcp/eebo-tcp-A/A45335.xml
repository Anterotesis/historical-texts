            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Epistle to the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst all the <hi>Tractates</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> written by <hi>English men</hi> in <hi>English</hi> (which are very many, and <hi>many</hi> of them <hi>very excellent,</hi> and highly esteemed even by <hi>learned</hi> men of other <hi>Nations</hi>) there are none more useful (in some respects) or more serviceable to the Church of Christ, then such of them which are <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries</hi> and <hi>Expositions</hi> upon the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi> Witness <hi>Ainsworth</hi> upon the Pentateuch. <hi>Willet</hi> upon Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Daniel, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and Iude. <hi>Perkins</hi> upon the Galatians. <hi>Bifield</hi> upon the Colossians. <hi>Taylor</hi> upon Titus, &amp; many others. Insomuch that if we had such like <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Commentaries</hi> upon every Book in the Bible, I doubt not but it would very much tend to the right understanding of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> &amp; thereby to the further propagation of <hi>Truth</hi> &amp; <hi>Godliness</hi> throughout the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reverend, Learned</hi> and <hi>Religious Author</hi> of this ensuing Treatise hath undertaken to give us a <hi>Practical</hi> and <hi>Polemical</hi> Exposition upon the third and fourth Chapters of the latter Epistle of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>; of which it may truly be said, That it is both <hi>elaborate</hi> and <hi>judicious.</hi> And <hi>that he doth not serve the Lord with that which cost him nothing.</hi> There is in this excellent Commentary the sum of nigh <hi>30 years studies,</hi> and the <hi>Epitome</hi> of all those choice things which this <hi>worthy Minister of Christ</hi> hath ever either <hi>heard</hi> or <hi>read.</hi> And therefore I doubt not but it will fully answer expectation, and be gladly entertained by the godly learned Readers.</p>
            <p>Especially if they consider, That the <hi>Author</hi> of this Book is the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who hath by former Books <hi>guarded</hi> the <hi>Pulpit</hi> from unordained Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, The <hi>Font</hi> from Antipaedobaptists, The <hi>Schools</hi> by the defence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning; And the Ministery and their maintenance in a Latine Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise called <hi>Sal Terrae.</hi> His abilities are already sufficiently known to the world by these, and many other of his works, and therefore there is no need to add any thing more in way of commendation, <hi>Vinum vendibile non opus habet hederâ suspensâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My prayer to God is, That this large and yet pithy and learned Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may obtain the end for which it was written, That it may do good to future Generations and speak to the world, when the Author is gone out of it to enjoy the Kingdom provided for him from all Eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>MY hearts desire and Prayer for you is that you may be saved, And since God saveth none ordinarily but by means, I here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with a <hi>Practical Book,</hi> which by the blessing of God may be a means to lead you safely through this Wilderness to the heavenly Canaan. Here you will finde Directions for all sorts, for Magistrates and Ministers, for Superiours and Inferiours. Here you have Antidotes against those nineteen sinnes (of these last and worst times) which are so rife both in City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; for, where can a man goe but he shal finde such as are Self-Lovers, Covetous, Boasters, Proud, Blasphemers, False-accusers, Covenant-breakers, Vnholy, &amp;c. So that
<pb facs="tcp:99118:3"/>
the Treatise is very seasonable, the good Lord make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
            <p>To this end, First, You that are <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Magistrates may see their duty in the Treatise it self, on</hi> 2 Timothy 3.2. p. 26.27.</note> 
               <hi>Rulers</hi> must Rule for God, <hi>you must not bear the sword in vain</hi>; but you must be a Terror to Drunkards, Swearers, Sabbath-profaners, Whore-masters, Seducers, Blasphemers and all the rabble of Hell. 'Tis an old complaint that <hi>England hath golden Lawes, but Leaden Executioners</hi>

               <hi>Zealous</hi> therefore for God, we never lose by venturing for him. Remember that at the last day you must give an account of your <hi>Steward ships,</hi> of those Offices, Talents and Opportunities which you have received, and what good ye have done in your yeare, what Vices have been punished, what Goodnesse hath been promoted, and what disorders rectified.</p>
            <p>A Zealous Magistrate is the best Common-wealths-man, such a <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is a means to keep off wrath from the City and Place of his abode. When Men punish, God spareth; but when men spare then God ariseth to execute judgement on the wicked. Mistake me not, I plead not for <hi>Cruelty,</hi> or rigour, but for <hi>Iustice;</hi> as Magistrates must be Clement and Mercifull (as occasion requireth) distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing of sinners, observing who offend through weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and who of wilfulnesse; So he must be just and sharp against incorrigible and incureable Offenders, least they infect others. Be Men of publicke Spirits, cast off all self-seeking and private-spiritednesse; I could wish that every Magistrate had Master <hi>Iacombs</hi> Sermon, on <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36. it is an excellent piece, and will teach you how to serve God in your Generations.</p>

I</hi> know some that dwell nigh an hundred miles off him whom they call their Pastor,<note place="margin">To cull out ten or twenty and make them the Church, excluding two hundred or two thousand (in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) as dogs and swine, doth exceedingly puffe up the one (so that Ministers can scarce tell how to please them, but in a short time they picke quarrels and fall all to pieces) and discourageth the other, and so prejudiceth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Ministery that it loseth the operation it should have upon their hearts.</note> such sheep are like to be well fed and looked to that are at such a distance from the Shepherd. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is a kinde of Sacriledge to rob godly Ministeres of the first-born of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and pains, of the creame of their flockes, and the Crowne of their Ministery. If they will gather Churches out of the world (as they call it) let them first plow the world, and sow it, and then let them reap with Gods blessing, else he is but a <hi>hard man that reaps where he hath not sowen.</hi> There is supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the right hand as well as on the left, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil cares not on which hand we miscarry so he can but get us out of the right way.</p>
            <p>Be not over-righteous in making the Gate of the Church narrower then God hath made it, shut not out those whom God admitteth. Better be too Charitable, then too censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Pitty the many hundreds of poore, ignorant, profane, uncatechized souls that are in your City, the great (I had almost said the greatest) part of a Ministers worke lieth out of the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>I have experimentally found more good by week-dayes Catechising, then by many yeares Preaching, condescend to the Capacities of the weakest, by workes of mercy, and by all good means labour to win them to Christ: Be not high nor supercilious, be not harsh and censorious in cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the greatest part of your flocke as dogs and swine; if they be ignorant, you should instruct them; if scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<pb facs="tcp:99118:4"/>
by all wise means you should labour to reclaim them. This rigorous casting off them and their Infants doth but harden them, and make them out of love with Religion; when a tender and compassionate carriage towards them, might have brought them into better order.</p>

            <p>THou maist wonder to see me once more in Print, and no wonder, for I wonder, (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) at it my self. I was fully resolved to rest, and never to trouble the world any more in this kind; yet having finisht my other works for the Press, and finding experimentally that I had best health when I was most strongly imployed, and that my work was to me instead of Physick, I chose rather to spend my self with labour, then consume with rust and sickness. I saw that Master <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> had finisht the two first Chapters of the second Epistle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> and perusing the two last Chapters of that Epistle I perceived the handling of them would be very useful and seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable (both in respect of Practicals and Polemicals) for these present times. Hereupon I would have had some abler Pen to have undertaken the work, and that failing, I would have got some assistance, but that would not be, I was constrained if I would have any thing done to do it my self. Vpon this I buckled to the work, and in less then two years space (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing my double imployment) by the strength of God compleatly finisht both Chapters for the Press. I confess it hath cost me much pains, and more then at first I imagined, but if it may be profitable to Gods Church, I have my desire.</p>

            <p>Secondly, I may be the more willing to deliver my Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this Worke, because when <hi>I</hi> had acted the part of a severe Criticke upon it, the Authour testified his inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, by returning me so much the more Thankes, as <hi>I</hi> found the more faults in it; which <hi>I</hi> liked the better, when it gave me occasion to renew the remembrance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary acceptance of the like Office done to <hi>the Bishop of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrie and Litchfield,</hi> a Prelate of as great Reputation for Learning and Religion as any of his rancke in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: who above thirtie yeares agoe, <hi>I</hi> presenting my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him at <hi>Ecclesell Castle</hi> in my return from <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Great Budworth</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> he staid me certain dayes to read over (as a Censor) his Book which he entituled, <note n="*" place="margin">It was Reprinted, 1628.</note> 
               <hi>The Grand-Imposture: I</hi> took it for a great Trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in me, and thought it my Duety to be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it by free Animadversions of any thing which <hi>I</hi> apprehended for an errour, and accordingly did so; When <hi>I</hi> shewed him mine exceptions, at the first he seemed somewhat angry and wrangled with me to excuse the Passage, (which <hi>I</hi> conceived did need Correction) we parted unperswaded, and <hi>I</hi> returned to my Taske with
<pb facs="tcp:99118:9"/>
this Opinion, that he was therefore offended with the fault I found, because on the sudden he knew not how to mend it; after that, to the <hi>Errata,</hi> I added the correction of the first as well as of the rest, and then bringing my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the whole unto him, he shewed himselfe so well pleased, that he would needs fasten twenty shillings in Gold upon me for my pains, besides other courtesies.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I am content that my judgement of this Book should be Printed, not so much to gratifie the Author or the Stationer, as for other reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the whole frame of the work doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fully answer the Frontispiece, (though it promise much) and so is not lyable to the <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, Because though I were well satisfied with the matter of it while I read it in his Manuscript Original, yet <hi>I</hi> desire better satisfaction by a review of it when in a fairer Character from the Presse, <hi>I</hi> may reade it with less diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and more delight.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Because it is not onely the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>I mean the better half not in Quantitie onely as bigger, but in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie as better done then the former part by Mr. B. who though he were a good man, a good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apostle, having in the two fore-going Chapters fore-warned,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Praemonitus, praemunitus.</hi>
                  </note> and so fore-armed, his dear son <hi>Timothy</hi> against those Schismaticks, Hereticks, Hypocrites, and false Teachers which were then arising and creeping into the Church; he comes now, by a Propheticall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, to fore-tell of greater evills, and of more false Teachers and Seducers, which should yet arise, especially towards the end of the world.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter we have 1. A Prediction,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Est Prophetia quâ praevidet &amp; denotat Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolus quanta mala immine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ab mimicis fidei,</hi> viz. <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis &amp; Pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-christianis.</hi> Espencaeus.</note> or prophetical narration, of the men and manners of the last times, from verse 2. to verse 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The better to avoyd them, we have here the marks whereby the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers and Impostors of the last times, may be knowne.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are glozing Hypocrites, verse 5. they have a form, and but a form, of godlinesse.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are of an insinuating disposition: they slily and secretly creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to houses, verse 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are subtle: they set first on the weaker vessel, like the devil their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that first set on <hi>Eve,</hi> that he might by her the better deceive <hi>Adam,</hi> v. 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You may know them by their opposing the Truth, and the faithfull Ministers thereof, verse 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By their corrupt principles and practises, verse 8.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By their Apostasy: they fall away more and more, and grow worse and worse, verse 13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lest <hi>Timothy</hi> should be discouraged, here is first a consolatory promise for the bounding and breaking of the follies, and fopperies, of the malice and madness, of these Impostors, verse 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The better to encourage him, <hi>Paul</hi> sets before him his own Example, and shews him what troubles and persecutions he under-went, and how the Lord delivered him out of all, verse 10, 11. and withall tells him that persecution
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99118:11"/>
was not peculiar to him, but that it was the common lot of all the godly, whilst they live in this world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to constancy and perseverance in the doctrine which he had received, verse 14, 15, 16, 17. and withall to a diligent study of the holy Scriptures, which he adorns with a most elegant <hi>Encomium,</hi> drawn

Be not therefore, my son, discouraged, neither let any of Gods faithful Ministers, thy Successours, be dismayed, or take offence at the Sects and Schismes, at the Heresies and Blasphemies, which shall in those last and loose dayes arise; do not wonder at them, as if some strange and new thing were come into the World; for this also you must know; That <hi>in the last dayes perilous times shall come.</hi>

                  <hi>In the last dayes.</hi>] That is, all the time from Christs first coming in the flesh, till his second coming to Judgement. In scripture the latter or last times, are taken two wayes: 1. More generally for all Gospel-times, from that time since Christ came in the flesh and publisht the Gospel; this is called the Gospel-time in opposition to the Legal administrations: and this is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in scripture phrase called, The last time, and, The last dayes. This appeares by those parallel Texts. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.28. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.<note place="margin">See Doctor <hi>Gouge</hi> on Heb. 1.2. and <hi>Weems.

Thus we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that saying of <hi>Iacob</hi> to his sons. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.1. <hi>Gather your selves together; that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last dayes.</hi> (i.) at the coming of the Messiah, or when <hi>Shiloh</hi> comes, v. 20. Hence Gospel-times are called, The end of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 20.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. and the last houre. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.18.</p>
               <p>Now these are called The last dayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because all was then consummated which was prophesied concerning the work of mans Redemption, and so is the perfection of all times, or, as the Apostle cals it, <hi>The fulness of time. Gal.</hi> 4.4. Nothing now remains but a looking for the day of judgement, which how soon it may come, we know not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because the whole time of the worlds continuance being distinguished into three great Periods, the Gospel-time is the last of The three. The first was from the creation to the giving of the Law upon Mount Sinai. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond from the giving of the Law, till the Appearance of Christ in our nature. The third from that Appearance in Humility, till his Appearance in Glory; and this is that which in scripture is oft called the Last time, because after it there shall be no more.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tanto pejora sunt tempora futura, quanto fini hujus mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di &amp; extremo udicto fuerint proximiora.</hi>
                  </note>3. Comparatively, in respect of the precedent times which have past since the beginning of the world, those times were longer than these Gospel-times are like to be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By the last times more especially is sometimes meant the times that are somewhat near the end of the World, which are the latter times of these last dayes; when people shall give themselves to luxury, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

                  <hi>Perilous times shall come.</hi>] That is, hard, hurtfull, hatefull, heavie, pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, perilous; troublous times shall come.</p>
               <p>On this clause there are almost as many Opinions, as there are Writers; and as many Interpretations, as there be Interpreters. Yet in all this Variety there is no contrariety, they may easily be reconciled, tending all to one and the same end. I shall therefore take them in all; for it is a Rule in expounding Scripture, That when a Text admits of many (but not contrary) senses, it is a safe way to take in all, lest we misse the meaning: where no reason doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain, we are not to restrain the words, but may take them in the largest sense; especially when neither matter, phrase, context or scope do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The last dayes are called perilous, because of those perilous, pestilent, wicked men, and wicked manners that shall then abound. This sense is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, if we consider the context; The last dayes shall be perilous: and why so? not so much because of the sword, plague, famin, persecution, or any corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral distresse that shall molest men, but bccause of those perilous sins which shall then over-spread the face of the Church.

So in our common speech we cry; <hi>O tempora</hi>! O wicked times! when we mean the wicked men that live in the times. [See more in my <hi>Schooles Guard. p.</hi> 172.] So <hi>Amos</hi> 5.12, 13. the Prophet calls the time wherein many crying sins reigned, <hi>an evill time,</hi> by reason of an evill and ungodly generation which made it so.</p>

                  <hi>2. Quest.</hi> How can the last dayes be called perilous, when the Scripture so

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The last dayes may be said to be both glorious and perilous in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent respects. 1. They may be said to be glorious, in respect of the great light, liberty, knowledge, company, commentators, encouragements, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer manifestation of the Gospel, and many other gloriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> priviledges, which former ages never enjoyed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet they will be perilous times in respect of the sad abuse of those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious priviledges, and sinning against such great light and love. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. the higher we are lifted up with priviledges, the greater will our fall be if we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.23. we cannot sin at so cheap a rate in these last times, as formerly men did. The sinners of the last times will have the lowest place in hell.</p>
               <p>Besides, they will be perilous times, in respect of the swarmes of sinners and seducers, which will then over-spread the face of the earth, going up and down (like the Devill their Master, that grand Peripatetick) seeking whom they may devoure; Vermine of this kind will then abound every where: weeds grow no where so rank, as in a fat soyle.</p>
               <p>So that if we take the words in the largest construction, yet the Text is ours; as our Saviour said sometimes of a Text in <hi>Isay,</hi> so may I say of this Text in <hi>Timothy</hi>; This day is this Scripture fulfilled in our eares: our times are a Comment on this Text. I appeale to all that know them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be not perilous, pernicious, troublous, hurtfull, hatefull, hard times.</p>
               <p>I come now to some practicall Observations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Observe from these words, [<hi>This also know</hi>] That it is our duty to take notice of the Prophecies delivered to us in the word of God. As they are not sealed by him, but left open for our use; so they must not by our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be as a sealed Book to us. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. we must not barely read, but search out the meaning of the word. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. So did <hi>Daniel</hi> [9.2.] though he were a great and excellent Prophet, yet he doth not disdain to read: and when by reading the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> he understood that the time was come for the accomplishment of Gods propheticall promises, then <hi>Daniel</hi> begins to pray for the fulfilling of the promises. The Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> is an excellent prophecie of the downfal of the Churches enemies, and of the great things which in the latter dayes God will do for his people, even to the end of the world; and therefore the Lord would have us attentively to consider, and humbly and accurately to weigh what is written there; that so our faith may be strengthened, and we may be quickened (by remembring his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises) to serve his providence, acting and praying for the downfall of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> which God hath so clearly promised shall come to passe. And to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us to read, the Lord hath pronounced them blessed that read the words of that prophecie, <hi>viz.</hi> with attention, affection, application and practice, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.3. God takes it ill when he shall write to us the great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things of his Law, and we shall count them as strange things, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us not, <hi>Hos.</hi> 8.12. this makes people (especially in the Churches distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) so faithless, prayerlesse, comfortlesse, and carelesse. The Evangelist gives this as a Reason why the Jewes committed that great sin in crucifying Christ, it was because they knew him not to be the Messias, nor did they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the prophesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of him, [<hi>Acts</hi> 13.27.] though they were read to them every Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>This should startle us, and make us not only to enquire into the precepts and promises of God, but also into the prophesies which he hath publisht for our good: for this is one great reason why so many stumble and take offence at Gods wayes, because of the Heresies and Apostasies of many: they forget
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99118:13"/>
this prophesie of the Apostle, <hi>viz</hi> That the last days should be perilous times; and therefore <hi>This also know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Observe. The people of God, and specially his Ministers, his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothies, should be so prudent as to know and observe when perilous times are approaching: as the prudent man foresees the evill of punishment before it comes, [<hi>Prov.</hi> 22.35.] so he more especially improves his spirituall prudence in foreseeing the evill of sin and error; and having by certain sins and signes discerned a tempest in the clouds, he hides himself in the chambers of Gods special protection and providence. <hi>Isay</hi> 26.20.</p>
               <p>This spiritual prudence can hurt neither Pastor nor People, but will advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage us much.<note place="margin">

It was a good resolution of <hi>Peter</hi> (had he not taken it up in his own strength) Though all men should be offended at Christ, yet would he never be offended. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.33. Let us take up the like in the strength of divine assisting grace, Though many be offended, though all should be offended at Religion, yet so will we not be: though never so many scandals be given by others, yet shall they not be taken by us, so as in the least to distast the wayes and truth of God.

From hence vve may yet gather this encouragement, That we have the true Church of Christ amongst us, because the Wolves are so busie: where there are no Sheep, the Wolf seldome appeares; but where the folds are full, there the Wolves are busie. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.12. and therefore think it not strange, but this know, and know for certain, That the last dayes will be perilous: we think it strang to hear of Arrians, Arminians, Socinians, Anabaptists, &amp;c. but they are not new nor strange to <hi>Germany,</hi> no, nor to the primitive Church; for in S. <hi>Augustins</hi> time we read of many old Heresies which now go under the name of new light, when 'tis neither light nor new, but onely old error new vamped, an old Hag put in a new dresse.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Observe Gods singular love unto his people, in that he warnes them of perilous times long before they come. He will do nothing against his Church and people, but he will first reveale it to his Prophets, that they may reveal it to his people. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7. Not that the Lord is bound to observe this Method: for he may execute corporall and spiritual judgements when and how he pleaseth, without revealing it to men or Angels: onely it pleaseth him out of his tender love and gracious condescension to his people, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to observe this Method: First to shoot off his warning pieces, before he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99118:13"/>
shoot off his murdering-pieces, Hence he tels <hi>Abraham, Ioseph, Noah, Lot, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. of dangers before hand; he makes them of his privy Counsel: and as Gods Love appears in fore-warning us of corporal judgements; so his tender care over us especially appeares in fore-warning and fore-arming us against spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall judgements, and spirituall enemies, which hunt for the precious soule. Now, that we might prepare for the battell, and fear no dangers nor difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that we might not be despondent, Christ foretells us thrice in one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of false Prophets, and admonisheth us to beware of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.4.11.24.25.

And that we might not be seduced by such Impostors, the Apostle also is frequent in admonishing us against them. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17.18. &amp; 1.4. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. and <hi>Iohn</hi> frequently in his Epistles admonisheth us to beware of deceivers that should arise in the last times, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.1.3.5, 6. <hi>Peter</hi> doth excellently characterize them; that we might the better know them and avoyd them. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.10.13, 14, 15, 18, 19. so doth <hi>Iude</hi> 4. to verse 20. he spends almost his whole Epistle (it being an Epitome and summary of the second of <hi>Peter</hi>) in describing false Teachers, and counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us against them.

                  <p>Whence observe, That the dayes we live in, are the last dayes. Our times are the last times, they are oft so called in scripture. This is the last hour, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.18. and upon us the ends of the world are come. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. the Coming of the Lord is said to draw nigh. <hi>Iames</hi> 5.8. and the Day of the Lord approacheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. 'tis but a little while ere Christ come to judge the World; hence he's said to come quickly, <hi>Rev,</hi> 6.11. &amp; 22.12. and the time is at hand: <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3. and our full Redemption draweth nigh. Luke 21.28. and the end of all things is at hand, 1 <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 4.7. If the Apostle thought the day of the Lord was at hand 1600. yeares agoe, we may well conclude that it is neer now. The Apostle, seeing Christ come, all the Prophesies of him fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Gentiles called, and the Mystery of iniquity beginning already to work, he concludes the day of the Lord was near, and so it was.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Comparatively, in respect of the times before Christ: it was nearer than to those under the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In respect of the certainty of it: the day of the Lord will as surely come as if it were come this day. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In respect of God; to whom a thousand years are but as one day. <hi>Psal.</hi> 90.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In respect of Eternity: a thousand yeares, or two thousand yeares, are as nothing, being compared with the time to come; 'tis but as a little drop of water to the whole Ocean. So that this great day of the Lord which was near in the Apostles time, is much nearer now: then began the last time, but now is the end thereof. It cannot then be long to the day of judgement; for all the Signs and Fore-runners of it are accomplisht, excepting the ruine of Rome, which falls apace; for, as Rome was not buil't in a day, so she shall not down in a day: but as she rose gradually, so shall she fall gradually; in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, Poland, Holland,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. There wants but the destruction of the Turk, and the calling of the Jewes, and then comes the End.</p>
                  <p>Now, since the time is short, and we live in the last dayes, this should wean us from the world, and take off our hearts from these fading, perishing things,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99118:14"/>
and make us labour for grace, which is durable riches. 'Twas an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their sin, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.3. <hi>That they heaped up treasure for the last dayes.</hi> When they were going out of the World, then they were drowning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the World. We should labour to do much good in a little time: and as at all times we ought to be carefull and conscionable in fitting our selves for our Masters coming; so then especially when we see the day of the Lord draw nigh: then we must double our diligence, as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant will when he knowes his Master is at hand. They that lived a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares agoe were bound to lead holy lives but we that live in the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest times, and the nearest to judgement, ought to lead more holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly lives; that our Lord when he comes, may find us prepared.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may teach us patience under all tentations and afflictions: 'tis but yet a little while, and he that shall come, will come, and he will not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36, 37. Let therefore your moderation and equanimity be not only in your brest, but let it be visible and knowne, not to one or two, but to all men, both friends and foes; why so? for the Lord is at hand, ready to help you, and to judge your enemies. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Iames</hi> 5.7, 8.

As that old Serpent the Devill, the older he growes, the more subtle and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced he is; so it is with the wicked who are the Seed of the Serpent, the elder they grow, the more skillfull Practitioners they be in sin; they are witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, and understand more how to contrive Sin, and defend Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours by the improved experiences of their own, and former times.

                  <p>The Reasons are obvious. 1. In respect of Satans rage, the last times will be the worst. The Devills time now growes short, and therefore his wrath grows great. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.12. Satans malevolence is a Spur to his diligence, and he labours to supply the shortness of his time with the sharpness of his assaults: insomuch that the Devills themselves seem to be possest of far more violent Devills;<note place="margin">

Satan now sets upon Soules by seduction most furiously, because when these Times are at an end, his Work is also at an end, in this kind. He's like a malicious Tenant; who, perceiving that his Term is almost expired, doth what he can to ruine the house. Or like a bloudy Tyrant; who sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the loss of his usurped Soveraignty, makes havock amongst his Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is the Worlds Old age, 'tis its last and worst time; for Old age is the Winter of a mans dayes,<note place="margin">

This evill day (in a spiritual sense) is come upon the World, it's come to its <hi>Old age,</hi> I had almost said, to its <hi>Dotage</hi>; it drawes upon the Lees, and its dregges are apparent. 'Tis now Winter with the World, it growes old and cold, according to the Prophesy of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.12. speaking of the Fore-runners of the end of the World, he sets down this as one speciall Sign, That <hi>iniquity shall abound, and the love of many shall wax cold.</hi> That Sin abounds and superabounds, none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; that Love waxeth cold, there are many complaints. Where's our fervent love to God, his Ordinances, his Wayes, and People. The World (saith one) hath been once destroyed with Water, for the heat of Lust, and shall be again with Fire, for the coldness of Love. <hi>Latimer</hi> saw so much lack of Love to God and goodness in his time, that he thought verily Doomes-day was then just at hand; what would he have thought, had he lived in our age, wherein it were farre easier to write a Book of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, then a Book of Martyrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea so grossly degenerate shall the last dayes be, that Christ makes a question whether he shall find Faith in the Earth, when hee comes. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. false Prophets will so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, (in those last and loose dayes) that if 'twere possible, they would deceive the very Elect, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.18, 19.</p>

Weeds which deface Gods Garden, the Church; the good Lord root them out of all our hearts, that our names may never be found in this black Bill, and cursed Catalogue, to be such as make evill times, bad; and bad times worse.</p>
               <p>'Tis worth our noting, that the Apostle doth not place the Perill and Hardnesse of the last times, in any externall calamity, or penall evills; as Sword, Plague, Famine, Persecution: but in the prodigions sins and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, of such as professe Religion.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Negatively, he speaks not here of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> that are without the Pale of the Church, and do openly oppose the Gospel of Christ. But affirmatively, he speaks of such as shall live in the bosome of the Church, and shall partake of the external Priviledges of it, verse 5. they be such as will have a form of godliness: they will be great pretenders to Piety, though their lives abound with all manner of Iniquity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Text may have relation to the Pharisaical Papists, and Popish Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women. How do all the Vices, which the Apostle doth instance in, reign especially in the Popish Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy? In all their doctrine and service, how do they seek themselves? Papists are natural men, and so must needs be full of <hi>self-love.</hi> In their preaching, they cry up the Popes Supremacy, and exalt him above Kings: for the Pope can give them Deaneries, and Bishopricks, which Kings cannot do, without him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are exceeding <hi>Covetous,</hi> they cry up Purgatory, Indulgencies, Masses for quick and dead; all's for money.

Hence <hi>Platina</hi> (one of their own) tells us of 13. Popes that were Adulterers, 3. common Brothellers. 4. Incestuous ones, 11. Sodomites, 7. Whore-masters, and erecters of Stews, where every Whore payeth weekly a Julian penny to the Pope, which many years amounts to 40000. Ducats. Thus by the Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Heads of their Church, we may guess at the unholiness of their Members. This made <hi>Mantuan</hi> long since bid adiew to <hi>Rome,</hi> telling her He would never return to her again, till he went to be a Baud or Brotheller. 9. They are <hi>voyd of naturall affection,</hi> witness their bloudy Inquisition, and cruell persecuting of their nearest Relations, if they be (as they call them) Hereticks, (i. e.) faithfull Servants of Christ. A Turk, a Jew, a Pagan shall find more favour with them then a zealous Christian. 10. <hi>Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> they are notoriously guilty of this, witness their late dealing with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in <hi>Savoy.</hi> No Bonds can bind them, no Oaths can hold them, they deal with them all as Apes do with their Collars, which they can put off and on at pleasure.

               <p>Lastly, they, have <hi>a form of godlinesse,</hi> and that's all. All their Religion is meer formality, lip-labour, and grosse Hypocrisy. Under the name of Christs Spouse they play the filthy Harlot. Under the Title of the Church, they fight against the Church. Under a Shew of godlines they cloak a World of wickedness. Under pretence of vowed Chastity, they lived in Adultery; under the cloak of professed Poverty, they got the goods of the Temporalty, and under the vizor of being dead to the World, they not onely reigned in the World, but also ruled it: creeping not only into mens Purses, but also into their Consciences; they heard their confessions, they knew their secrets, and ruled men as they pleased.

So if you ask me what is the moving and primary cause that makes so many leap out of a prophane course of life, into a great profession of Religion, without any proportionable measure of humiliation? The answer is ready, Money, Money, Money. 'Tis to get an office, or that they may be rising men; just like the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> they would be circumcised, why so?

There is no judging of a Niggard by one great Feast which he keeps, but by his constant fare: So observe, what thy heart doth constantly and habitually run upon, what do'st plod most upon? as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral man deviseth liberal things, and by them is establisht; so the covetous man deviseth covetous things, and by them is ruined. <hi>Isay</hi> 32.7, 8. their end is destruction who mind, <hi>viz.</hi> inordinately, habitually, and excessively earthly things. When men can forget God, dayes without number, and he is seldome in their thoughts, but their minds run altogether on their Oxen, Farmes, Wives, Money; when their desires be greedy after those things, and their joy excessive in the enjoyment of them, and their sorrow excessive in parting with them; these are palpable evidences of a heart that Trades, and is exercised in Covetousnesse. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> You must know that God hath ordained some men for more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent places, and these he adornes with more eminent Gifts and Graces. Others are for lower service, and these he gifts accordingly. Some are to be Eyes, some Hands, some Feet, some little Toes in the body, yet all usefull and beautifull in their places. It's a great dignity to be the least member of Christs mysticall body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though thou be inferiour in some things, yet thou mayest excell in others. Another, it may be, may have more knowledge; yet thou mayest practice more. Another may have more Learning; but thou more Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Aaron</hi> excelled in eloquence, and freedome of speech; but <hi>Moses</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Wisdome, Solidity, and Meeknesse. God in his Wisdom hath so ordered it; that no man hath all things; but some excell in one thing, and some in another, that we might all be usefull in our way, and helpfull each to other.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> As when the Lord calls us to a lower condition, to forsake all, as he did <hi>Abraham,</hi> to leave a certainty, for an uncertainty. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.5.

                  <p n="2">2. When we come not to our Places by Bribery, Simony, or any indirect meanes.

Now, though some learned men do take the words in the former sense, <hi>viz.</hi> for defamers, and slanderers; yet, our Translation renders it truly from the Originall, Blasphemers; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the highest kind of evill speaking, even to all manner of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my against the God of Heaven.

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> Let us be deeply affected with the blasphemies, and dishonours, that are done unto our God, in the land of our Nativity, Let's mourn for all the abominations, and specially for the prodigious blasphemies which are found in the midst of us. Let them deeply affect and afflict our hearts; if we love God, they will do so, for Love is very tender of any wrong, that is offered to the party beloved. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> burnes with an holy zeal, when he heard that one had blasphemed God, he puts him in Ward, and at last stones him to death. <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.11, 12. <hi>David</hi> hated such persons with a perfect hatred, and counts them as his enemies. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Rabsheka</hi>'s blasphemies, <hi>Rent</hi> his cloathes. <hi>Isay</hi> 37.1. So did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 14.14. when they heard the blasphemy of the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strians,</hi> crying them up for Gods, they rent their cloathes, to expresse the rending of their hearts with grief and indignation, at what they heard. And wicked <hi>Iezabel</hi>'s proclaiming a Fast upon the false accusation of <hi>Naboth</hi> for blasphemy. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.10. may teach us to be zealous against Reall blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. So the High Priest rending his clothes for conceited blasphemy. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.65. if every one of us should do so, when we hear God and his Gospel blasphemed, we should have more rent then whole clothes, and scarce a whole garment to be found amongst us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us shew our dislike of blasphemy, by reproving the broachers of it. This is the greatest love that we can shew them; Hence we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to hate our Brother, but rebuking, to rebuke him, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) freely, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, soundly, and sincerely. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. The converted Thief reproves his fellow for blasphemy. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.39, 40. So when the Devill began to utter blasphemy, and to challenge all the world for his own, and began to call for worship, our Saviour cuts him short, and in a holy detestation bids him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, for he would reason no longer with him. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. yet if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that men are incorrigible, and incurable, Prudence must be used; we may not give holy things to dogs, which will but rend us for our pains. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. reprove not such, lest you increase the flame, instead of quenching it. This was one Reason why <hi>Hezekiah</hi> commanded his Commissioners, when they heard the blasphemous Menaces of <hi>Rabsheka,</hi> not to answer a word, deeming it in vain to make any Reply, when it would but incite him to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rage. <hi>Isay</hi> 36.21. But where we see any to be teachable or Tractable, and may be wonne by our Reproofes; of those let us take compassion, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them out of this flame. They will one day blesse God for you, as <hi>David</hi> did for <hi>Abigail,</hi> when she stopt him in a way of sin. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let all that professe Religion, be exact and circumspect in all their wayes and walking, lest they cause the Name of God to be blasphemed. The world is apt to accuse us withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So those Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites that called themselves Jewes, and seemed to worship God, when they were the Synagogue of Satan, and worshipt the Devill; yet could blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme and revile the true Saints. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2, 9.

rather then the Gentiles. <hi>Ram.</hi> 2.9.24. Hence the Apostle exhorts Wives and Servants to walk as becomes the Gospel, that the Name of God be not blasphemed. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1.

Many that prayed, and prized Ordinances formerly, yet now have cast off all, and are become scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous both in their Practice, and in their Principles.

                     <q>That so solemn a Covenant (say they) so gravely and piously penned, so dreadfully obliging the Conscience (in all sincerity and fidelity, to take and keep it) so ratified by authority of Parliament, ordering of it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, exhortations, and satisfactions to scruples: that this Covenant should be by so many without any sense of Religion, both taken and broken, as if it were but a King at Chesse, set upon the board for a game, and so shut up in a bagge, when the game is done; this is that which may make us hang down our heads, and with heavie hearts say, as <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. <hi>O our God, we are ashamed to lift up our faults,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
So they.</p>
                  <p>Now, as Covenant-breaking is a God-provoking sin, so Covenant-keeping is a Sacrifice most pleasing and acceptable to him; and the most compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way to exalt a Nation, as we see in the times of <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> 24, 25, &amp;c. <hi>Asa.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.12.15. <hi>Iosiah.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.3. &amp;c. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. when they brought their people into Covenant, they prospered presently. No sooner did <hi>England</hi> enter into Covenant, but from that very day did the Lord blesse us, and gave admirable successe to the Armies of his people. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.18, 19. The Reason is, because then we engage God more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in our cause; we bring him into the field with us, we put all we are, and have into his hand, we are not now our own people but the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Lords Kingdome.

So when <hi>Iehojada</hi> had brought the people into Covenant, then the Lord gave them rest. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.17, 20. This is like a wall of brasse to a Kingdom, or rather like a wall of fire (as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.5. which none can scale) to defend us, and to offend our enemies. Now we have speciall interest in the Lord, so that all that he hath is ours; his Wisdome is ours to direct us, his Power to protect us, his Goodnesse to save us, &amp;c. As a woman that's married to a man, partakes of all the Riches and Honours of her husband, and as <hi>Laban</hi> said to <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 51.43. so may we say to the Lord, All that thou hast is mine.

But slandering properly is a malicious, bitter, reproachfull spreading of false tales. 'Tis a going up and down with an intent to do them a mishchief. Thus <hi>Doeg</hi> accused <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Abimilech</hi> to <hi>Saul.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. and <hi>Haman</hi> slandered the Jewes to the King, and the Pharises oft traduced Christ and his Apostles. So then, a slander is the Devills arrow, shot by mans bow, he lends him his lyes and malice, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth the slanderers Tongue to utter them.

How many unfit themselves hereby, for the duties of their callings; when a man experimentally knowes that such a Quantity of food will fit him for his calling, and yet he will exceed, that's sinfull. Many look upon drunkenness as a great sin, but as for Gluttony, they make no bones of that, whereas a man may as well offend, and make a beast of himself by excessive eating, as by excessive drinking; hence the Scripture condemns riotous Gormandizing, as well as swinish drunkenness. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. the Rich Glutton went to Hell, not for any drunkenness that we read of, but for Gluttony. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19.

And if to act it in the light of the Sun, be an aggravation, oh what is it to act it against the light of the Gospel? and that now in an Afflicting time, when the Rod lyes upon the Nation for this sin, among the rest. To sin out of ignorance, infirmity and inadvertency, may excuse <hi>à tanto, sed non a toto</hi>: it may extenuate, but it cannot totally excuse.

                     <item>1. Consider that drunkennesse is one of the vilest sins in the World, the Mother of most abominations.

He is <hi>El</hi> the the strong God, and though our corruptions are too strong for us, yet are they not too strong for him. Spread therefore thy misery before the Lord, and let him see 'tis the unfeigned desire of thy soul as freely to forget sin, as thou wouldst have him to forgive it; and to part with it, as to have it pardoned; and then in due time he'l heal thee of it, what ever it be.</p>
                  <p>I come now to some brief <hi>Rules</hi> against it, and so conclude.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Kill it in the Root, get a hearty detestation of it, resolve rather to die, then to be drunk. To this end consider the vilenesse of the sin (in the effects before recited) remember the judgements of God, on <hi>Nabal, Ammon, Elah,</hi> and <hi>Belshazar,</hi> who died in their Drunkennesse. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.36. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.28, 29. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.8, 9, 10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.2.30. Let their falls make thee to fear, for God is the same still, to the same sinners.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be diligent in your callings. Idlenesse breeds Drunkennesse. When men have nothing to do,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quem Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus occupatum non invenit ipse occupat.</hi>
                     </note> the Devill comes and calls them out to work. The flying bird is safe, 'tis the bird that sits still, which is in danger. God hath promised to protect us, but then we must keep his way. <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.11, 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> We are Gentlemen and cannot worke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> You must work, or do worse. God hath ordained, that every son of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the sweat of his brows shall eat his bread. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. and he that will not (not he that by reason of sicknesse cannot) labour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non est panis cujusquam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prius, ne summi quidem regis nisi strenuè la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boret in Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one sua.</hi> Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loc. <hi>in</hi> Joh.</note> shall not eat. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.10. and if <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of Innocency, must work and dresse the Garden; and after the fall, when he was Monark of all the world, yet must he labour; who then can think himselfe free? 'Tis not Idleness which commends a Gentleman, or following of foolish fashions, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Healths, lying in an Alehouse, &amp;c. there's no baseness like this. But the life and soule of Nobility and Gentility consists in noble and vertuous dispositions, in gallantness of spirit (without pride or insoleuce) to do his Country good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In all places, and at all times set a watch against this sin; when men are most secure, they are in most danger: where the watch is most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, there the enemy enters, And if Christs own disciples must watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this sin, who may be secure? <hi>Luke</hi> 22.34. Many when they go to Fairs and Markets, they go without care or fear, they do not take Antidotes with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99118:59"/>
them; hence 'tis, that so many fall by this sin. A man that goes amongst such as have Plague-sores running on them, had need of speciall Antidotes, to keep out the infection.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Shun the occasions of this sin, <hi>He that will no evill do, must do nothing that belongs thereto.</hi> He must not once look on the wine when 'tis red. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.31. a little leak may drown a ship, and great fires have come from little sparks. Especially shun the company of Drunkards, be not amongst wine bibbers. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20. we should have no familiarity with them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.7. touch not this pitch, lest you be defiled with it, mingle not with them, lest you learn their work. What <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of the Harlot, that say I of the Drunkard. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10, 11. remove far from him, come not nigh the door of his house, &amp;c. especially shun <hi>Ale-houses,</hi> these dens of Devills, and Cages of unclean birds; those stewes and styes of all abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Take heed of the Excessive Use, and the great abuse of <hi>Tobacco.</hi> Great Tobacconists oft times are great Drunkards.

'Tis said of Garlick, that it makes men wink, and drink, and stink; Many use To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco to make them drink, till at last they wink and stink. 'Tis true, the drugge is good in it self, as 'tis Gods creature, and the fume of it taken in a discreet, moderate, physicall way, may be usefull.

I shall therefore give some Reasons against the abuse of the creature, because the sin is Generall, and 'tis the Devills shoeing-Horn, to draw men on to Drunkennesse. Instead of Salt-meat, the Devill feeds his followers now with smoak (<hi>fumo pereat, qui fumum vendit</hi>) first drink, and then smoake; Then smoak, and after drink; the Pot and the Pipe, and the Pipe and the Pot walk so long, till they have Piped themselves out of all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider, that Tobacco is a Physicall root, and hath in it a Poysonous quality, as appeares by its Antipathy against nature. Now he that shall take Physick every day, may soon put an end to his dayes. Physick must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rarely and seldom, else if it become familiar to the body, it looseth its operation. 'Tis a violent purge, which wastes and weakens nature, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when taken often. Hence the learned conclude, that frequent using of it is dangerous.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. All excesses are hurtfull, and are abuses of the Creature, and as exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive eating and drinking is unlawfull, so also is excessive smoaking. Not one of many but takes it for fashion and custome, more then for need. Any action (especially Physicall) if not rightly circumstantiated, is very dangerous. If a Physician should advise his Patient to take a spoonfull or two of such a Potion, and he should take ten or twenty; or if he should prescribe him to take a penny-weight of such or such a thing, and he should eat a pound, he might soon put himself past eating. So when Physicians shall prescribe one or two Pipes a day, and men shall take 20. this is <hi>causa adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99118:60"/>
ad mortem,</hi> it's a kind of self-murder, and shortens mens dayes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3, This immoderate and excessive use of Tobacco, brings with it many discommodities. It overthrowes the state of the body, dryeth the brain, dimmeth the sight, corrupts the smell, hurts the stomack, destroyes conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, spoyles the spirits, dulls the understanding, confounds the senses, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifies the body, marres the breath, and turns it into an unsavory stench, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it loathsome to their Wives, Friends, and such as come nigh them. It turnes the Nose into a chimney, and makes a Kithin of the body, sooting it with an oyly Unctious kind of soot, as hath been seen in some great Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conists, that have been opened. It emasculates the spirits, and disables the body for service, when a man cannot go two or three miles without a Pipe smoaking at his Nose. In former ages, what glorious battles have been fought, and to what a great age did they live, who never once heard of Tobacco?</p>
                  <p n="4">

                     </note>4. It consumes abundance of pretious time; No losse, like the losse of time. How many spend two or three houres in a day in smoaking, which if they had spent in Repenting, what abundance of comfort might they have had?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It wastes mens estates. How many poor might have been succoured with that which is idly and vainly spent in smoak? some spending 10 l. others 20 l. others 100 l. <hi>per annum</hi> in smoak? To what end is such waste? we must all one day give an account how we have spent our money; our silver is the Lords, and he expects that we improve it to his praise. Hos. 2.8, 9. How sad will it be with many, when they shall see how many pounds they have spent in smoak, and yet how little for Gods honour? It were well if some way could be found to restrain the great abuse of it, if it were but in the younger, and the healthfull sort, who have no apparent need of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> We are so accustomed to it, that we cannot leave it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> An evill custome is better broken then kept, and therefore as you came to this custom by degrees, so by degrees you must break it. The use of it (saith a learned Physitian) is only tolerable by way of Physick, and not for pleasure, or an idle custom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It's the property of a Gentleman to take Tobacco?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis now become the guise of the Riff-raffe, and Dregges of men. Every Tinker, Tapster, Crate-carrying Vagabond is not well unlesse he have a Pipe at's Nose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It drawes away ill and watrish humours, and cures men of most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> God hath ordained watrish humours for the good of the body, and for the most part they are as necessary in the body, as the blood it self, and therefore may not be drawn away in that abundant measure by To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco. Besides, it's dangerous for weak and sickly bodies, they may quickly waste the Oyle of their Vitall Lamps, and spend their radicall moisture. So that instead of curing, it kills many.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Grant it to be Physicall in some diseases, doth it therefore follow that it is good against all? and that all must use it; of what age, constitution, and complexion soever. To argue from a Particular, to a Generall, is but sorry Logick. <hi>e. g.</hi> Such a man hath need of such and such Physick, therefore all men have need of it. Who sees not the vanity of the practice, yet who leaves it? what should young, strong, healthfull bodies do with Physick? They that are whole have no need of the Physitian, but those that are sick;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99118:60"/>
and those that ate sick indeed, cannot away with it. One mans Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick is another mans poyson; One Medicine cannot cure all diseases, yet men are so bewitcht and besotted with Tobacco, that (if you'l be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them) they'l tell you it's a <hi>Panacéa</hi> that will cure you of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers; and yet those that take it, abound with distempers, as well as other men.

but his are precise, strict and pure wayes, directly contrary to ours. We are all for our selves, our own ease and goods; they are all for God, his praise and honour, so that we can never agree. Hence 'tis, that those whom God hates, the world usually loves, and those whom God loves, the world al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hates. We have a notable instance in our dayes, In the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who is now turned Papist, (for what ends she her self best knows) and is blest, pardoned, praised, by Pope, Priests, Jesuites, and is sumpte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously entertained by others: when she is blasted, cursed, &amp; abhorred of God, as an horrid Apostate, and gross Idolater now in a time of glorious light, when the nakednesse of the whore, is so palpably discovered to the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The godly are the salt of the world, by their savory reproof, and counsell, and by their holy Example, they help to keep the world from rotting in sin, yea the whole life of the godly is a kind of tacite reproof of the wicked wayes and customes of the world. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.

                  <p n="5">5. The godly are chosen out of the world, and therefore they shunne all needlesse society and intimate familiarity with the wicked. Thus <hi>Saul,</hi> when he became a <hi>Paul</hi> and was changed, he changed his company, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.19. and this makes the world hate them, whilest they look upon them as Apostates from their society.

                  <p>Now, if despising and despiting of good men, and goodness it self, be a sinne and signe of the last times; then ours surely are the last dayes. Was there ever more despising of good Magistrates, good Ministers, good people? when were the Reall servants of Christ more despited, not for any evill that they have done, but because they will not doe evill, in denying Ordinances, Order, Government, &amp;c. yet be not offended, neither marvell (2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13.) as if some strange thing had happened to you; you see here it's long since foretold, that it should be so in these last dayes.

               <p n="2">2.

Now when men through feare and cowardlinesse, dare not professe the truth of God in the midst of a perverse generation that oppose it; God esteems this a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his truth into the hands of its enemies. Such are false Prophets, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malists, and Time-servers, which for a time make a shew, but in time of tentation fall away.</p>

That's the best pleasure which springs from the knowledge and love of God. We call not upon you to forsake, but to change your pleasures. Change your sordid, sinfull, sensuall delights, into sublime, spirituall, and noble delights. The pleasures of the soul are more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and masculine; those of the body more soft and effeminate. Sensitive pleasures have more of the dregs, Intellectuall ones more of Quintescence, and so excell all other pleasures in eleven particulars, [as you may see in that learned discourse of the Light of Nature,<note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. Relatively, as it relates to the 18. sins before mentioned, so this sin is the cloak to hide and cover them all, men will be lovers of themselves, but under a form of Godliness. Hence <hi>Observe. That a man may have a form of Godlinesse, and yet live in all manner of wickednesse.</hi> 'Tis true, the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, cannot consist with the power of Ungodliness; but the more the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godliness is lifted up in the soul, the more the power of Ungodliness will be supprest, as the house of <hi>David</hi> grows stronger and stronger, so the house of <hi>Saul</hi> grows weaker and weaker. But yet the form of Godliness, may stand with the power of Ungodliness. A man may be a glorious Professor in the highest form, and yet a Puny in the form of Grace. He may be a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Comet for profession, and yet be a Devill incarnate, in life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. The Scribes and Pharises were glorious Professors, and yet but painted Sepulchers, filled with pride and oppression, even when they were murdering Christ, they had a form of godlinesse. <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.28. they would not go into the Judgement-Hall, lest they should be defiled, yet think it no defilement to crucify Christ, and after they had crucified him, they had a form of godlinesse; when <hi>Iudas</hi> brought the money to them. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.6. they refused to take it, because 'twas the price of blood; and yet they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not to crucify Christ. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> when he beheaded <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, doth pretend Religion, it was for his Oaths sake; and under pretence of a Vow at <hi>Hebron,</hi> riseth in rebellion against his Father, and <hi>Herod</hi> under a pretence of worshipping Christ, seeks to kill him. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Iehu</hi> pretends the destruction of <hi>Baal,</hi> but intends the Kingdom to himself. <hi>Saul</hi> made a great shew, and killed Witches, yet at last runs to them for help. <hi>Demetrius</hi> is zealous for <hi>Diana,</hi> but 'tis to preserve his own Silver Trade. The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists under pretence of Liberty, destroy Magistracy. The Pope began his Bulls. <hi>In nomine Domini.</hi> The Papists cry up the Church, that they may the better destroy it. They put on a fair glove on a foul hand, and get on the Vizard of Holiness, the better to deceive. The Devill gets much by such, and therefore he transforms himself into an Angell of light.

That's a sin of infirmity, which is committed against the bent, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and resolution of the soul, when we suddenly fall into sin without deliberation, either through Passion, Feare, &amp;c as <hi>Peter</hi> did. This is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a falling by an occasion. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. he doth not run himselfe into sin, but accidentally he stumbles at sin, and catcheth a fall; so that when a man fully resolves against a sin, Prayeth against it, strives against it, groans under it, and useth all means to overcome it, and yet cannot shake off this Thorne in the flesh, this may be thy crosse, it shall never be thy Curse. Suppose a man be sayling on the Sea, his intention is for such a Haven, but there comes a violent gust, and carries him into his enemies coast against his will: so the godly resolve to keep Gods Commandements. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.106. and pray against sin. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.13. yet through the violence of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are oft overcome against their wills.

The godly and the wicked both sin, as Pearls and Peebles both fall into the dirt; yet the one is a Pearle still, and the other a Peeble.

Yea, we should not only shun them, lest we be infected by them, but directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them, (as the word signifies) and do what in us lyes, to have them corrected, that (if it be possible) they may be amended.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This admonition shewes that the Apostle speaks not only of evills to come, but also of present evills; for how could <hi>Timothy</hi> shun those evills and errors which should arise, when he was dead and gone? It appeares then that the Church began to be troubled, and tortured with those, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions both in doctrine and manners, at its first arising. Though 'tis true those sins, are too much improved in these last and worst times.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Observe,</hi> That no sooner doth the truth appear, but errour begins to appear also. No sooner doth the wheat arise, but the weeds begin to peep up with it, and (if it may be) to overtop it. As soon as ever the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation began in <hi>Germany,</hi> what abundance of Sectaries and Hereticks, did the Devill raise to oppose it? if one Heresy die, the Devill (who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sleeps, but is is alwayes at his plough) raiseth up seven in its stead.
<q>I my self (saith <hi>Luther</hi> in his Preface to his comment on the <hi>Galathians</hi>) who have been 20. years in the Ministery, can truly witnesse that I have been assailed with more then 20. Sects, of which some are already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, others (as the parts and members of Wormes and Bees, that are cut asunder) do yet pant for life. But Satan the God of all discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion stirreth up daily new Sects, and last of all (which I most wonder at) he hath raised up a Sect, that cry down the ten Commandements.</q>
Alas how would this good man have wondred, had he lived to see our dayes, wherein Law and Gospel, Christ and all his Ordinances are cast out of dores: wherein there are so many Deceivers, and Devils incarnate gone forth into the world, white Devils, black Devils, Pyed and skewed Devils, that are white in their words, and black in their works, that halt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, but 20. opinions; <hi>Menstruam habent fidem,</hi> they change their Religion every month, and are as mutable as the Moon, they are spiritually mad and drunk with errors, and so are truly Lunaticks. Thus the Church of Christ in this world is alvvays militant, it must never look for Peace so long as there is corruption within us, and the Devil and his agents without to oppose us, &amp; therefore marvel not when you hear of Hereticks, blasphemers, &amp;c. such there were in <hi>Timothies</hi> time, such in ours, &amp; some such there will be to the end of the world; the world will ever be wicked, and like it self.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Observe.</hi> That Christians must shun familiarity with the enemies of Christ, these compounded sinners are Christs professed enemies, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not the spouse of Christ to hold correspondency with the open-ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of her head &amp; husband. It may be thou hast not power to punish them, yet thou mayst shun them; perhaps you cannot confute them, yet thou canst and mayest avoyd them, since they are such as are given to changes we should not meddle with them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.21. Hence 'tis that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost hath given us so many Caveats against familiarity with such
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99118:79"/>
wicked ones. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.14, 15. and 14.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. and 6.9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.7.11.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. Sometimes our callings may bring us into their company, but then we must do as wise Physitians do, who if they be called amongst such as have the Plague, they fortify themselves against it, they will not go with an empty stomack, but they fill all the Passages, that no emptinesse be found; they usually in such cases, carry some preservatives about them. The Application is obvious. When Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> went to <hi>Ephesus</hi> to bathe himself, and saw <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Heretick there, he would not stay for fear the bath should fall on him. We should save our selves from an untoward generation. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.7. and not once sit with them, lest we be tainted by them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.4. in this sense we must not once know a wicked person. <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.4. though a man be never so great, if he be not good, he's but a vile person, though he be a Monarch. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17. and 11.21. and though they be high in their own eyes, yet they must be little and low in ours. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.14. <hi>Hester</hi> 3.2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.4. All their Honour is but a bubble, and all their pomp a fancy. <hi>Acts</hi> 25.23. Hence the Scripture calls them chaff. <hi>Ps.</hi> 1.4. dross and scum. <hi>Ps.</hi> 119.119. Dogs &amp; swine. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caut.</hi> Yet in some cases there is a lawfull society even with open sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; as first there is a necessary society of civill commerce, as in buying and selling, Trading, and Trafficking; and thus we may be sociable with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> and the men of the world; if 'twere unlawfull to Trade wich such, we must go out of the world. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10. we may and must carry our selves fairely, civilly, affably, and curteously towards all; though we must be familiar and intimate onely with the godly, as they are men, and usefull in their places, in Church and Common-wealth, we ought to reverence and respect them for their gifts; but as they are wicked men, we must shun them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we have a Call to go amongst them, we may go with safety, comfort, and confidence, when another that goes without a Call, runnes himself into danger. It's one thing electively to chuse wicked company, and another thing by vertue of a Call, to go amongst them. As 'tis in the Case of the Plague, for a man to run desperately without a Call from God into a Pest-house, 'tis a Temptation, and he runs upon his own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. But for a Physitian, a Midwife, or a Tender of the sick to go when sent for, they may go boldly, for God hath promised to keep us, whilest we keep his wayes. <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.11, 12. Thus <hi>Ioseph</hi> lives in <hi>Egypt, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> in the Court of a Heathen King, <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom, Iob</hi> in a land of <hi>Vz, Daniel,</hi> in the Court of <hi>Darius,</hi> God had called them, and he kept them there.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We must distinguish of wicked men, some are curable, others are incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; some are obstinate, desperate hardened sinners, which hate reproof, those shun; others are simple, tractable, and hopefull, these we must pitty. If when we would cure men, they will not be cured, we must forsake them. <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.9. when Christ saw the Pharisees to be proud, captious and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, he denounceth woes against them, and leaves them. But the poor Publicans that were sensible of their low and lost condition, and came to Christ as the sick to the Physitian for health and cure, those Christ deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to converse with; for his mission and Commission runs to such. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.24. So that 'tis not simply and absolutely unlawfull for a good man sometimes to converse with wicked men, how else should we convince them or convert them if we have not some converse with them? A love then of pitty &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration we must shew to all, remembring that we also were sometime foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, disobedient, &amp; as vile as the vilest. <hi>Tir.</hi> 3.2, 3. But a love of complacency, familiarity &amp; delight we must express only to the godly. <hi>Ps.</hi> 16.3. &amp; 119.63.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. See that your ends be good, <hi>viz.</hi> to convince the wicked of the evill
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99118:80"/>
of ther way, to convert them &amp; bring them home to Christ, many are fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with the wicked in their wickednesse, with the Drunkard in his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, with the Idolater in his Idolatry, &amp;c. such harden and confirm wicked men in their wickednesse, but they will never convert them.</p>

When <hi>Iudas</hi> fell into trouble of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he ran to his wicked associates, but see what miserable comforters they are to him in his extremity. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.4.</p>

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:99118:80"/>4. 'Tis a dishonour to our Lord and Master, to be familiar with knowne Traytors and Rebells to him. Every wicked man rebells against God, there's an enmity and an hatred in him to God, his wayes, his word, his worship, his people. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.21. now how can he be a true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, who is familiar with open Rebels to his Soveraign? or how can an obedient Spouse delight in her husbands enemies? we cannot approve our selves faithfull to God, unlesse we hate such as he hates.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It's impossible that ever we should be good so long as we delight in wicked company; Hence <hi>David</hi> resolving to keep Gods Commandements, first he bids the wicked depart. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.115. when a man is changed, he changeth his company; <hi>Paul</hi> when converted, forsakes the Pharises, and joynes himself to the Church of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.19. what communion hath light with darknesse? <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.1, 2. and 26.4.6. if ever we would live the life of Grace here, and glory hereafter, we must forsake the wicked. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By familiarity with such we do not onely endanger our Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, but our Temporall estate also. <hi>Lot</hi> living amongst wicked <hi>Sodomites,</hi> suffered with them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.12. when they were plundered and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners: <hi>Lot</hi> also was plundered and taken prisoner with them. <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> had well nigh lost his life by loving those that liated God. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.32. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.31. and 19.2. a companion with riotous persons shall come to poverty with them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20. <hi>David</hi> by entertaining a league of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with <hi>Hanun,</hi> for the curtesies he had received from his Father <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Caution.</hi> Yet if God have tyed us by any Relations to wicked persons, we must not presently forsake them, or out-run them. Some children have wicked Parents, some husbands have wicked wives, some servants have wicked Masters; now these Relations must not be contemned or violated.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The husband may not leave his wife, nor the wife her husband, for any cause but for adultery. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.9. no other cause can annull marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and therefore those Sectaries that out-run their wives, pretending they are carnall, they are not Saints, nor called, nor spirituall; such must remember what Christ saith, Whosoever puts away his wife, except it be for adultery, and marries another, commits adultery, and if the husband be wicked, yet the wife must abide still with him, because she may be a meanes to convert him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If a godly child have wicked Parents, he must not out-run them, but by Prayer and Patience, and leading a convincing life, he must labour to win them, shewing all due Honour and respect unto them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If a Religious servant have an Irreligious Master, he may not out-run him, but must, by a holy, just, religious walking, labour to win him. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. yea, though they be froward and pervense, yet must they be reverenced and obeyed as Masters. We must obey evill men, but not in evill. <hi>Saul</hi> was a wicked man, yet <hi>David</hi> gives him all due respect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Caut.</hi> When I say we must forsake communion with the wicked, take heed of forsaking <hi>Sion</hi> instead of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Many (especially in these loose times) call the Church of <hi>England Babylon,</hi> a whore, a false Church; which yet the God of Heaven, and his Churches, acknowledge for a true Church.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> There are Defects and corruptions in our Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> And what Church on earth is free? Had not the Church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects? and yet they were called <hi>Holy. Segregatione,</hi> because they were separated by God, and set apart for his service and worship, the name of God is called on there, the Oracles of God are taught there, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is profest there, and therefore they are called Holy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A parte praestantiori fit denominatio,</hi> because there are some Saints there; as we call a man a Rational creature from the soul, which is the better part, and a heap of corn is called Wheat, though it have much chaff mixt with it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Iudicio charitatis.</hi> When people make an externall profession of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, in the judgement of charity we must hope they are Holy. Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. the Apostle calls them Saints at <hi>Corinth,</hi> such was his charity,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Per sanctos intelligit Apostolus baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos &amp; Christianam religionem profitentes, tales enim charitas praesumit esse reverà Sanctos.</hi> Davenant.</note> that he hoped they were such. It were to be wished, that all Gods people were Reall Saints, but Christ tells us his Church is mixt, it hath Tares as well as Wheat, and will have, do what we can. <note n="*" place="margin">The Church of Christ is called a fold in which are Goats as well as sheep; a Noble-mans house, in which are vessells of Dishonour, as well as of Honour.</note> 
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.24. It's a dangerous thing to think that there's no Church where there is not perfect Purity, such a man must separate himself from all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and like <hi>Acesius,</hi> find a new way to Heaven. [<hi>Erigito</hi> Acesi <hi>scalam, &amp; solus in coelum ascendito.</hi>] or else joyn himself to a few Hypocrites, and if our Churches and Ministers be not true ones, I wish the Anabaptists would shew us where we may find better. Oh say they, the Anabaptistick Churches are purer, there they are all Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> As <hi>Samuel</hi> said to <hi>Saul</hi> when he boasted of his sanctity, and how he had kept the Commandements of the Lord, What means then the bleating of the sheep, and the lowing of the Oxen in my eares? so say I, if the Anabaptists be so pure, what makes them raile on those that are pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? what means their railing on the faithfull Ministers and the true Churches of Christ; yea, do not many of them deny Scriptures, Sabbaths, Sacraments, and all Ordinances, &amp;c. If these be <hi>Zion,</hi> who are <hi>Babylon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Were they Saints indeed, they durst not call themselves so. It sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours strongly of spiritual pride, for men Pharisaically, and Donatistically to appropriate to themselves the name of Saints, and the godly party, and the spiritual people. The language of Reall Saints, is more meek and modest in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> We admit such as are openly prophane to the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This is easily said, but not so easily proved. To call a man a Drunkard is one thing, but to prove e man a Drunkard, is a harder mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let them prove if they can, that the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> do admit of such to the Sacrament, as have been convicted (by two competent witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at least) of Drunkennesse, Adultery, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Admit this were so, yet another mans sin cannot hurt me, if I no way partake with him in it. He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgemeut to himself, and not to me. Suppose I could have no meat for my body, unlesse I would eat in the company of wicked men, must I famish my self rather then to eat with them? much lesse may I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99118:81"/>
my spirituall food because some wicked men (without any fault of mine) eat and communicate with me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The Apostle forbids us to eat with such. <hi>1 Cor. 5.11.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle speaks not there of the Sacrament, as the scope and context clearly shew. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. he forbids us intimate, private, voluntary familiarity with wicked ones: for though in respect of publick communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and commerce in Church and State, I cannot avoyd society with such, yet in respect of private, intimate familiarity, 'tis in my power to avoyd them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Apostle speaks here of civill familiarity (saith Reverend Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> in his Treatise on the Sacraments, Chapt. 7. Sect. 16,) the Apostle speaks not at all of the Lords Supper in this Chapter, and 'tis clear in the Text, that the Apostle gives direction about the common course of our life, to shun all voluntary and free converse with wicked men.</q>
So he.</p>
                  <p>Let us not then forsake the Assemblies of the Saints, as too many do. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. forsake not the Lords barne, because there is some chaff there. If once the Devill get you to swallow this errour, you know not where you shall stop. As that great Grand-mother said sometimes, Rise up daughter, and go to thy daughter, for thy daughters daughter hath a daughter. So will you say in a short time, Rise up separation, and go to thy separation, for thy separations separation, hath a separation. Such have no foundation, but run on <hi>in infinitum.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. As for their Names, they are not to be found in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor in the story to which the Apostle alludes. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.11. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it probable, that the Apostle came to the knowledge of them by Extraordinary Revelation (as some imagine) since the bare knowledge of the Names of these Magicians is of so little consequence, and not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to salvation.</p>

So such as go about to draw men from the Truth are vile men, however they may have high conceits of themselves, yet God esteems no more of them then we do of a dog: and though he may throw them some off all and bones to picke (as he doth to the blasphemous Turk, that great Dog of a great part of the World) yet his soul abhors both them and their services, <hi>Isay</hi> 66.3.</item>

               <p>FIrst of all as Juglers and other Vagabonds, such are those who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Bohemiah,</hi> wander almost all the world over, and others of that sort use a peculiar kind of speech understood of none but of their own faction and fraternity; so that before a mans face they can deceive and betray, and none perceive them; so the <hi>Quintinists</hi> use a strange and un-won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted form of words, whereby they chatter with no more perspicuity then is in the singing of Birds, I deny not but they use common words, but when they do so, they so disguise the meaning of them, that none can understand the matter whereof they treat, or what they would deny or affirm; and this they do maliciously, that they may closely, as it were by ambush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment circumvent silly people, for they reveal to none the mysteries of their abominations, which are covertly couched under those Terms, except to those whom already they have bound by oath unto them: for to those

                  </note> as thieves hide themselves in their dens. These are those swelling words which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> compare to Bubbles and froth, which end in nothing. But whilest they study by their lofty stile to lead others into errours, they so mislead themselves, that they understand not their owne bablings. I remember when once <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> saw me in a great Assembly, sharply reproving his chattering; he desirous to shunne the stroke, said, I reproved his speech, because I did not understand it. To which I answered, that I understood some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in it more then he did, for he did not at all perceive those things which he uttered, but I perceived that he meant to bewitch the minds of men with his absurd and pernicious dotages, which will appear to be so, in that he doth so plunge them in, and involve them with such foolish speculations, that neither heaven nor earth can appeare unto them. By this Note they are discerned from others, when they speak, they make a noyse like a Chough, so that nothing they utter can be understood. The tongue was created by God, that we might expresse our Thoughts and communicate them to each other, but they pervert the order instituted by him, and with a confused sound beat the ayre, or by long circumstances they minister matter of such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and altering to the auditours, that at last they are left whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in suspence, when the mysteries of God are to be handled, we ought to make the Scripture our Rule; let us then follow the Rule which God hath delivered to us, and not wander out of the compasse of it: for God knowing that if he should use onely such words as become his Majesty, our apprehensions could not reach them; useth therefore such expressions as suit best with our shallow capacities. And as a nurse speaks broken and imperfect words to her Infant, so doth God to his people, that he may be understood. Whosoever therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts this order aimes at nothing but to bury the Truth of God, which cannot be perceived any other way, then by that which he hath revealed unto us. See then how we must labour in the explication of their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocutions, so as by force to draw their meaning into light; that so their abominations which they study to cover, may be made manifest to all men. And all Christians ought to be admonished, that when they hear their gagling in this manner, they break off their speech and say, Either speak as the Lord hath taught us, and according to Scripture phrase, or get you gone, and make your speech to stones and trees.

               <p n="4">4. Presbytery discountenanceth and punisheth Hereticks and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks truly so called. Episcopacy indulged such (witnesse the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Arminians, Socinians, and Innovators) and punisht the truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under those Notions. Independency is too favourable to most Sects, 'tis the doore by which they creep into the Church, (as sad experience testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, since the Church hath been Independent, what a flood of errours over-spread the land.) It's the <hi>Asylum,</hi> the Catholick shield and buckler of erroneous persons. Lest any should think me singular, you shall have the Attestation of an Association of Reverend Divines.

Yet as we take the Tenet of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to be an errour in it selfe, so do we find it by sound reason, and sad experience to be if not the naturall Mother, yet such a tender Nurse and Patronesse to Hereticall opinions of all kinds, that to it we may (for a great part) ascribe the luxuriant growth and spreading of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Heresies, &amp;c. so farre over this Kingdom.

               <p n="5">5. Presbytery hath Appeales to Synods, aad that not only <hi>ad consilium,</hi> for bare advice and counsell; but <hi>ad jurisdictionem</hi> also; they determine juridically, and with authority they make Decrees according to the word, which bind the Churches. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.17.19. and the people cheerfully and willingly submit to this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<note place="margin">Synods have not <hi>Potestatem absolutam, sed conditionalem &amp; ministerialem. viz</hi> So far as their commands agree with Gods commands, <hi>Spanheim.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. Presbytery allowes of no dumb dogs, no rayling Sectaries, nor Selfe-called Seducers. Episcopacy ordained many ignorant Sots, and Time-seerving Levites. Independency gives too much approbation to <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Priests, and Self-called Speakers.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Presbytery incourageth painfull, powerfull, orthodox Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Episcopacy silenced such, they might not once be Lecturers in the Land. One Bishop (I remember) gave thanks that he had not a Lecture left in his Diocesse. Independency looks somewhat asquint and soure on plain, powerfull, Orthodox Preachers, that faithfully wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against Schisme and Heresie.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Presbytery encourageth people to worship God in their families, as well as in the Publick. Episcopacy punisht such as met together to Pray, or Repeat Sermons, under the name of Conventicles, They were too streight; Independency erres as much on the t'other hand, and gives a toleration to forsake the publick Assemblies, and lye speaking error and Heresie in corners without controule.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In Presbytery there is no Lording it over the flock of God, there is an order of Priority, but none of Superiority. The President or Moderator <hi>pro tempore,</hi> if he have the first voyce, yet he hath but one voyce: his Office is to avoyd confusion, not to seek Prelation. But Bishops Lord it over the flock. Independency (they say) looks somewhat high, they will be accountable to none in spirituall things, but onely to Christ, and what could the Pope say more? this is to pull down one Pope, and set up many: and to make the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of one Minister equall to the authority of many combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Synods. Every Naturall man hath in his heart somewhat of Popery, somewhat of Arminianisme, and somewhat of Independency, so farre as it pleads for more Liberty then Christ hath allowed, and 'tis Naturall (I thinke) to every man to desire to be judged by no man.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Presbytery is candid and cleare, it feares not the light. Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy lyes in the clouds. Independency hath its Reserves, they will not reveale themselves, but conceale their way more then the people of God are wont to do, especially when desired by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They never would shew wherein this New-found way excells the way of all the Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Presbytery is the way of all the Reformed Churches. Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy is disowned by them. Independency is <hi>Via devia,</hi> the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches look upon it as a New-found by-path, which opens the doore to Schisme, and Heresie.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The word All is not here taken collectively, for all the world, for it lyes and will lye in blindnesse and wickednesse. But all must be taken distributively, for some of all sorts, as is frequent in Scripture, where by a <hi>Synecdoche generis, All</hi> is oft put for Many; and especially for all the Elect. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. All in the 18. verse. is called <hi>Many</hi> in the 19.

Now as God confounded those <hi>Egyptian</hi> sorcerers of old before all the world, so he will confound those that oppose his truth and Ministers, that they shall prevaile no further.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Observe,</hi> That Hereticks and false Prophets are bounded and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God. They cannot hurt when, where, and whom they please,

               <p>The wicked are apt to reproach the godly, when they zealously oppose their sins and errors, with the Title of mad-men.

'Tis not said the Lord hath Reigned, that we know; nor the Lord will Reign, for that we believe; but the Lord even now in the midst of all these confusions, yet still Reigns.

               <p>Secondly, What though the Devils Agents are many and mighty, yet there is a Wiser and a Mightier then they, who hath set them their bounds which they cannot passe. I have read a Story of a company of men that were at Sea in a great storm, and all being ready to be drowned, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, there was a little boy, and he was laughing and said, <hi>Why are you thus troubled, my Father is Pilate of the ship; and he will have a care that

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If God thus limit wicked men and rule over them, how comes it to pass that he suffers wicked men to Tyrannize over his people, as they doe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> We must not condemn Gods wayes, because we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Reason of what he doth. There are mysteries in Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as in all Kingdoms there are secrets of State not fit for all to know. 'Tis as easie for a man to rake up all the Sea in a Cockle shell, as to know the Reason of Gods actions in his Eternal Counsel: we must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn what we cannot comprehend, for God is infinitely wise and knoweth how to bring light out of darkness, and order out of confusion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He's infinitely just, though his wayes be secret and full of darkness to us, yet they are alwayes just.

And though his Providences seem to cross his Promises, yet wait the Conclusion, and you shall see and say he hath done all things well.

Great is the power of the Example of superiours, when one praised the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> souldiers for being so orderly, who before had been so injurious, one of them answered; No, the praise is not ours that we are thus changed, for we are the same men still, but we have now another Captain, and he it is that ordereth us. How oft doth God command us to follow our faithfull Guides? <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Iames</hi> 5.10. and commends it. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.6. As we must follow Christ, so we must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all the Saints, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, &amp;c. So far as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ. God hath set them before us as our Copy to write by, and our Pattern to live by; and we must answer not only for sinning against the light of the word, but against the light of good Example also. It will be one day said, you had such and such to go before you in Paths of Piety, and yet you would not follow. The faithfull are called witnesses. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. now if we walk contrary to their light, they will witness against us, as <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> did against the sinners of their age; but if we walk answerable to their Light, they'l witnesse for us. Their practice may comfort and confirm us in Gods way, they declare the possibility of obtaining such a grace, and make it thereby the more easie, when we have seen it done before us. If a man have a Torch to light him in a dark and dangerous path, how glad is he; the godly shine like lights in the midst of a crooked generation. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15, 16. their life is a Commentary on the Scripture. Now since the nature of man is apter to be guided by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then Precept, and to live <hi>non ad rationem, sed ad similitudinem,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath prepared abundance of glorious examples for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thus the Saints that are now at rest and triumphant in glory, their lives are to be our Looking-glasses to dresse our selves by, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe to saile by, and our Pillar of a cloud to walk by.</p>

                  </gap>ds what glorious things they have done and suffered for God and his honour. Now these are patterns of our own rank and nature, whom we must not onely imitate, but labour to equalize, and study to out-goe the best pattern of the best Saints that ever were. We can have no excuse in these dayes of light, if we come not up to the best patterns, because we have more of the Spirit, more light, and more clear manifestation of God, then they had.</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> How far must we imitate the Saints, and be followers of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We may not follow any Saint whatsoever simply and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but onely with a <hi>Quatenus,</hi> so far as he is a follower of Christ. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. the Saints have had their failings, and the best have a great deale of the old <hi>Adam</hi> in them. They are Pillars of cloud for us to walk by, but this cloud hath its dark part, which if we follow, we shall fall as they did. There are 4. sorts of actions which the Scripture tells us were done by Saints.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some were sinfull, as <hi>Davids</hi> adultery, <hi>Peters</hi> deniall; and these are recorded not for imitation, but for Caution and admonition. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. these things are examples that we might not lust as they did. Their sins are Sea-marks for men to shun, and not Land-marks to walk by. It's a sad thing to love that in <hi>David,</hi> which he did abominate in himself. Yet 5. good Lessons we may learn from the falls of the Saints.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When thou readest of their sins, it should teach thee not to idolize any Saint, they were men as well as others, and had their <hi>naevos,</hi> and had need of a Mediatour.</item>
                  <item>2. It may teach us that the best Saints may fall into the foulest sins if they do not watch; yea into those sins they most abhorre. Of all sinnes <hi>Peter</hi> thought himself most free from that of denying Christ, and if a man should have come to <hi>Solomon</hi> when he had made that rare Prayer before all the people (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.22, 23, &amp;c.) and told him, Well <hi>Solomon,</hi> for all this Prayer that thou hast made, thou wilt turn Idolater before thou dye; would not he have answered with <hi>Hazael,</hi> Am I a dog that I should do such things? This shewes that the best have in them the Root of the vilest sins, and if we be not upheld and preserved by Gods assisting grace, we shall certainly fall.</item>
                  <item>3. We may learn what sins are most prejudicial to us. <hi>viz.</hi> Self-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, this brought <hi>Peter</hi> down, idlenesse and prosperity, this brought <hi>David</hi> down. Effeminatenesse brought <hi>Solomon</hi> so low.</item>
                  <item>4. We learn that a holy fear is necessary to salvation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. and to have a holy jealousie over our deceitful hearts, be not high-minded but fear,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sit casus majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, tremor minorum.</hi> Aug.</note> for if such great Saints fell to such foul sins, what shall such poor shrubs do?</item>
                  <item>5. As you that never fell must read these Examples to preserve you
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99118:106"/>
from falling, so you that are fallen must not despaire, but read them that you may rise again by Repentance, as they did. Let us therefore watch and pray continually, for the best Christian is like a man rowing against Wind and Tyde, if he let go his Oares, he cannot in a great while recover again what he hath lost.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. Some actions of the Saints were done by speciall instinct and instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spirit, these are not for our imitation. <hi>Elijah</hi> calls for fire from heaven, which the disciples desiring were checkt by Christ. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.54. <hi>Sampsons</hi> pulling the house on his own and the Philistines heads, was by an immediate instinct of the spirit. So was <hi>Phineas</hi> his acts. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. we must not expect such extraordinary instincts and impulses of spirit in our dayes, we must now to the Law and to the Testimony. <hi>Isay</hi> 8.20. we must <hi>suspect</hi> such extraordinary impulses, rather then <hi>expect</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some actions they did by special command from God, and if we have not such an extraordinary command, we may not imitate them. <hi>e. g.</hi> The Israelites when they went out of Egypt borrowed Jewels of silver and gold,<note place="margin">See my <hi>Schools-Guard.</hi> Rule the 17. for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Law.</note> which they never paid again, because God bid them spoyle them, but we may not do so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.21. so God commands <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill <hi>Isaack,</hi> we have now the word for our Rule, and must not expect Revelations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some were occasionall actions, which they were not bound to in the general, but meerly for such a time, and in a case of necessity, so the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples must carry no scrip nor gold, but preach freely. <note n="*" place="margin">See my <hi>Sal.

                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10. 'twas as a Temporary command, as appeares <hi>Luke</hi> 22.35. such was <hi>Pauls</hi> practise in working for his living. <note n="†" place="margin">See my Text fully vindic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. and 20.34.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some actions of the Saints are acts of Holinesse and Righteousnesse grounded on the word of God, and in these it is that we must imitate them. There is a magnetical vertue and hidden excellency in good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to allure us to vertue, as there is a divellish efficacy in lewd exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to make us wicked, <hi>Ieroboams</hi> wickednesse drawes <hi>Israel</hi> to sin, so there is an heavenly efficacy in good examples (when sanctified) to make us holy. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2.7. the people serve the Lord all the dayes of <hi>Ioshua</hi> who was a good man, and the Elders who out-lived <hi>Ioshua,</hi> so long as they had a good example, they served the Lord. If <hi>Crispus</hi> the Ruler of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue believe, all his house believe with him. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. <hi>Theodosius</hi> by his holy example made his Court a Nursery of Religion. The patient suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Martyrs made many Martyrs; <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> tells us that the pious lives of the Christians were a meanes to convert him. Hence the Scripture ascribes a converting power to good example. 1 <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their example will be a Cordial to comfort us in our distresses. There is no misery that can befall us, but it hath befallen some of the Saints before us. Art deserted in thy own apprehension? so was <hi>Heman.</hi> Art poor? so was <hi>Iob.</hi> Art persecuted? so was <hi>David.</hi> Art called to difficult duties? so was <hi>Abraham</hi>: so were the Martyrs called to forsake all. If a man be to go through a vast howling wildernesse, this is a sad journey, yet if he see a beaten high way all along, this is a great comfort to him in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. This is our condition, the way to Heaven is through a wildernesse of trouble, our comfort is, 'tis a beaten way, thousands of Saints have gone before us in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This following of them will evidence our salvation, and assure us of our reigning with him in glory. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. know Brethren your Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but how? because ye became followers of us <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> tells a story

               <p n="2">2. He descends to particulars, and names the places where he suffered, that he might the better record the whole History; and the better work upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was partly an eye-witnesse, and partly an eare-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and had heard of many of his sufferings by the relation of credible witnesses: for <hi>Pauls</hi> persecutions at <hi>Antioch, Iconium</hi> and <hi>Lystra</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. and 14. But <hi>Timothy</hi> began not to cleave to <hi>Paul</hi> till <hi>Acts</hi> 16.2, &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> had suffered much in other Cities, as appears in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, but he mentions his sufferings in these three Cities, because <hi>Timothy</hi> had heard more of these, being born at <hi>Lystra</hi> which was a neighbour City.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Iconium,</hi> and so they were more fresh in his memory. Or else because the persecutions in those places were raysed more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Jewes, who were more violent in persecuting <hi>Paul,</hi> then the

Gentiles were. However the Apostle the better to animate his son <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> puts him in mind of these particular persecutions of his, that he might not faint, if God should call him to like sufferings. <hi>q. d.</hi> O my dear son <hi>Timothy,</hi> though thou hast suffered something for Christ, yet thou never hadst those trials that I have had, thou never wast cast out of so many Cities, nor so oft imprisoned, whipt and stoned as I have been, my troubles have been great, and my afflictions many yet this is my comfort, let it be thine also, that the Lord who hath delivered me, will also deliver thee out of all thy troubles and afflictions.</p>

When all created comforts fayled me, yet he never failed me, nor forsook me, in six troubles he was with me, and in the seaventh he did not leave me. Feare not therefore <hi>Timothy,</hi> for God will be the same to thee, as he was to me, if thou patiently wait upon him as I have done. Despair not then under the Crosse, but assure thy self of Victory.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Observe,</hi> That persecutions and afflictions are the proper portion of Gods dearest servants in this life. <hi>Paul</hi> a choyce and chosen vessel, yet loaded here with persecutions. But of this, see more verse 12.</p>

                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:99118:110"/>4. <hi>Observe,</hi> That persecution attends the preaching of the Gospel; where ever the Gospel comes in the power of it, it will alwayes meet with opposition from the Devil and his agents. No sooner doth <hi>Paul</hi> preach at <hi>Antioch,</hi> but presently there are some that rise against him. The whole Book of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles proves this point.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Per se quidem Evangelium est res pacifica, sed malorum vitio concitatur di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visio.</hi>
                  </note> God came not to send worldy, carnal wicked peace into the world, but a sword, <hi>Matthew,</hi> 10.34, 35. by accident the Gospel meeting with mens corruptions, breeds division.; though <hi>per se,</hi> and in it self it breeds that peace of Conscience which passeth all understanding.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Observe,</hi> That persecution spreads the Gospel, if the Apostles can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preach at <hi>Antioch,</hi> they'l goe to <hi>Iconium,</hi> and when persecuted, thence to <hi>Lystra.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1.4. the enemies persecute the Church, and thereby spread it, contrary to their own intentions. Persecution is so farre from hindering, that (the Lord so wisely ordering it) it mightily spreads the Gospel; according to that Prophesie <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. Such shakings make way for Christ, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Philippians</hi> 1.12.13, 14. many by beholding the constancy and courage of the Martyrs, together with the cruelty of their bloody enemies, have been converted to the Truth.

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Observe,</hi> That when we are persecuted in one City, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fly unto another. The Apostles being persecuted at <hi>Antioch,</hi> fly to <hi>Iconium,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Lystra.</hi> This is no more then what Christ commands, <hi>Matthew</hi> 10.23. <hi>When they persecute you in one City, flee to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Christ doth not onely permit but command us (when occasion serves) to fly, <hi>Matthew</hi> 24.16, 17, 18, 19.

As <hi>Paul</hi> laboured more then others, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 15.10. So he suffered more then others. A man that goeth soltly by, is not molested with Dogs, but he that rides faster then ordinary, shall have all the Dogs in the town after him. The world lies snorting in their sin, and cannot endure such as would waken them. 'Tis observed of the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea</hi> which were dead and cold, that they had no such trouble as <hi>Smyrna</hi> and faithful <hi>Philadelphia</hi> had.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Observe,</hi> Gratious men are constant men, no troubles can break them off from Gods wayes and works; Persecute, prison, stone them, they are still the same. As the Martyr told the Bishop, <hi>Rawlins</hi> you left me, <hi>Rawlins</hi> I am, and <hi>Rawlins</hi> by Gods grace I will continue. No dangers nor difficulties can drive them from their dueties, but if they be stoned, and knockt down in one place, they rise in another. They are faithful to the death, and so receive a Crown of Life. <hi>Revelations</hi> 2.10. many with <hi>Demas</hi> begin in the Spirit, but end in the flesh, they embrace a more easie flesh-pleasing way, and so loose all, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.4. but the faithful have not so learned Christ: They know not what 'tis to yield, when they can stand no longer on their feet, they will fight upon their knees. <hi>Iacob</hi> will have the blessing though he halt for it, and the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> will not leave Christ, though he call her Dog.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe,</hi> Not onely our dangers, but also our deliverances must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and recorded by us. The Apostle had told us before of his perse<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cutions, now he tels us how <hi>God delivered him out of all.</hi> We must not coldly and carelesly pass over the great things which God doth for us, but sit down and consider them with all their Circumstances, till our hearts be inflamed by them, we should sit down, and with an holy silence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the wondrous things which God hath done for us, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 12.24. <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.13.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Observe,</hi> His Power in Over-powring all the Tyrants of the world, how easily and irrecoverably doth he break them in pieces even as a bar of Iron falling on an earthen Pot: <hi>Psalm</hi> 2.9.</p>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Observe,</hi> His tender Love and care over his People. He hides us as the Hen doth her Chickens under the wings of his special Protection from the Birds of prey, <hi>Psalm</hi> 91.4.

               <p n="2">2. Sometimes he lets the trouble continue, but upholds the Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Thus <hi>Ioseph</hi> was in prison, but the Lord was with him. <hi>Paul</hi> had not the tentation removed, but he had strength given him to bear it.</p>

If God do suffer the wicked to take away their temporal life, yet he gives them eternal life for it, change (we say) is no robbery, but this change is a great advantage, so that sometimes the Lord removes the Crosse, sometimes he mitigates it, but he alwayes works patience in the hearts of his people, and gives a happy issue and event, if not by life, yet by death which is best of all. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.23. neither can any Tyrants take away their lives from them till they have run their race, and finisht the work which God hath given them to do. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.32. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.4, 5. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was oft pursued by <hi>Saul,</hi> yet dieth not till he served Gods will in his generation. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36. <hi>Peter</hi> died not till he was ripe for Martyrdome. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Paul</hi> escapes abundance of dangers both by Sea and Land, till his time was come that he was beheaded at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Nero.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was cursed by many Popes, yet she out-lived nine or ten of them; and when she had finisht her course, she died in her bed in Peace. God hath numbred our dayes which we cannot passe, nor our enemies abridge us of. <hi>Iob</hi> 7.3. our times are in Gods hands, and not in the hands of our enemies. <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why doth not the Lord deliver his people out of trouble?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis not either because he cannot or will not; but for good Ends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To draw out the Graces of Gods people, that their Faith, Love, Patience, and Constancy, may be made more perspicuous to the world, we had never heard of the Chastity of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the Patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> the Zeale of <hi>David,</hi> the constancy and piety of <hi>Daniel,</hi> nor of the Faith of those Martyrs. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. if they had not been tryed.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

This made the Saints so forward in the Primitive times to suffer for Christ, that the bloudy Emperours were fain to make Decrees to hinder their Martyrdome. I have read of a woman that in the time of <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour, ran with her haire loose about her eares, and her child in her armes, to the place where the Martyrs were slain, and being askt whither she ran, she answered, <hi>Crownes are given to day, and I will be partakers with them.</hi> Thus in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, when the Duke of <hi>Subaudia</hi> misused aud persecuted the men of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, burnt down their houses, cut down their Trees, took away their cattle and armes, &amp;c. They fled to the top of a mountain covered with snow, with their wives and children; yet not one of them, no not one of the women once wept or were dismayed: but praised God who counted them worthy to suffer for his name, and had turned their houses into Ashes, to throw in the eyes of Antichrist.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> As it was, so it is, Gods people still find it true, when ever they are afflicted from God, or for God, then they are comforted by God. When they are most weak in themselves, then are they most strong in God; when they are without comfort from the world, they are not without comfort from God. When the worlds breasts are dryed up, then the Heavens and promises breast is full, and running over with consolation. When they cannot rejoyce in the Crosse, yet they can in the benefit of the Crosse. We are glad of a foul day in drought, for the benefit it brings to the earth.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. From an enlightened understanding, there is first spiritual light in the Head, and then spiritual joy in the Heart.

And this is the fouudation of their joy. <hi>Iames</hi> 1.2, 3. out of judgement they really account it joy, all joy when they fall into variety of tentations, <hi>Knowing</hi> that the triall of faith worketh patience. Did men but know what God is, and what it is to have a God to live on, and a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99118:121"/>
Saviour to trust in, and the promises to go to and fill our empty Vessels, they would not whine under their sufferings as they do.</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. It proceeds from an Active and Vigorous faith. Faith is a fruitful and cheerfull Grace, therefore it is called the joy of faith. (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.25.) because it brings abundance of joy in every condition. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Faith is the mouth to draw comfort. Now the child never drawes the breast so well as when 'tis very hungry. The fire never burns so hot as in winter, and faith is never stronger then in affliction. It goes to God, and goes to the promises of God, and to the providences of God, ad draws them all, and so fills the soul with comfort.</item>
                     <item>3. This joy proceeds from the wisdom and goodnesse of God, who is pleased to give out most of himself, when we have least of the creature. <hi>Iacob</hi> when he was going out of his own country, was brought to much hardship, and had nothing but a heap of stones for his Pillar; yet then had he the Visions of God. God is pleased to reserve the sweetest mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations from the bitterest afflictions. The fountain runs most sweetly, when the Cistern is broken. When comforts are most needed, they will be most prized. The Traveller in Summer, when the Sunne shines, cast's off his cloak, but in winter, or when the wind blowes hard, he wraps it closer to him. So when we bathe our selves in creature comforts, we value not the promises of God, but when we are stript of all, then we look after God. When the salt waters are dryed up, then there are fresh springs in God.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But do all Gods servants attain a like measure of joy under the Crosse?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> No, for, 1. Some are dejected, and have little comfort with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and lesse within. The creature is bitter, and God is not sweet. Many can speak of Gods <hi>Supporting</hi> presence, but not of Gods <hi>Ioying</hi> presence. Now this proceeds either from Gods soveraignty, who may do with his own what he pleases, to this we must submit; or form our non-acting of faith, of which we must be ashamed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All have not this joy in the same measure; some can say, I am joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but <hi>Paul</hi> sayes I am exceeding joyfull. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. There is a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for comfort, as well as for Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Those that have the highest comforts in God, yet sometimes under this or that crosse, their comforts may faile them, as we see in <hi>Elijah,</hi> who fled for fear. And <hi>David</hi> who had sometimes the heart of a Lion, yet cryes out in a tentation, I shall one day perish by the hand of <hi>Saul.</hi> So he lookt on <hi>Absoloms</hi> death as a misery (and over-mourns for it) when 'twas a mercy</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Saints have usually more comfort in their afflictions <hi>for God,</hi> then in their afflictions <hi>from God.</hi> When a man suffers for God in wayes of well-doing, these are for Gods glory, and 'tis a Christians glory, and so brings joy. But afflictions from God are a Christians shame, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so much joy in them, it takes off the comfort, when we suffer imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by Gods hand for sin, and so loose our estates, friends, health, &amp;c. 'Tis my sin that hath brought those crosses and losses on me, I abused them, and therefore I am deprived of them; this damps our joy. By this we see that the evill of sin is worse then the evill of suffering; for the one is the bane of comfort, and the other is the Inlet of comfort. There is a great deal of difference between the Poyson of a Toad, and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of wormwood, the one is not pleasant but bitter, yet wholesome: but Poyson though pleasant, is deadly. Sin like the Poyson of a Toade is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99118:121"/>
mortall. Crosses are but the bitternesse of wormwood, though it be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the mouth, it is sweet in the belly. Therefore fear sin more then suffering.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. See the happinesse of a child of God. Take him at worst, and he's better then a wicked man at best. The one in prosperity hath no joy, the other in adversity is full of joy. A wicked man at best is but sad, or if he sing, 'tis like a bird in a Cage, he's the Devills prisoner still, if he have not all that he desires, all that he hath is nothing, <hi>Ahab</hi> is not well, unlesse he have <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine-yard, <hi>Haman</hi> (with all his honour) is not pleased, if <hi>Mordecai</hi> bow not the knee to him. But a good man if he have nothing, yet he hath all, because he hath the God of all, and in him alone he can be chearfull. And if Gods servants have so much sweetnesse in their sufferings, oh how sweet will heaven be and what joy in God will the Saints have in glory. If their bitter be so sweet, what will their sweet be? if their night be so light, what will their day be? If the Saints have so much joy whilest they are here below, have but little communion with God, what will be the joy when they shall lye in the bosome of God to all eternity, being freed from sin and sorrow? Oh then get interest and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in God, get assurance that he is yours, and then though all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts faile, yet you may rejoyce. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. though you want Starre-light, yet you have Sun-light; having God for your Portion, you have the Fountain, the Mine, the Treasury, you have an All-suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, an everlasting Portion, you cannot want. <hi>Psal.</hi> 23.1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. if <hi>David</hi> will have comfort, he must have interest in God. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. Then <hi>David</hi> comforted himself in the Lord <hi>His</hi> God. That word <hi>My,</hi> is a little word, but full of sweetnesse, the worldling rejoyces when he can say, this is <hi>My</hi> house, and <hi>My</hi> Land, and <hi>My</hi> Revenue. So when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can clear up his interest in God, and can truly say with <hi>Thomas, My</hi> Lord, and <hi>My</hi> God, let such a one be sad if he can, said <hi>Luther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Act your faith, according to a Christians faith, such is his joy. He that's full of faith, shall be full of joy. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. Cling to. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. the promises, when there's the greatest darknesse upon Providence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:99118:124"/>1. There is a single, simple Theft, and this admits of discreet pitty, especially when 'tis committed by reason of extream poverty and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is compounded Theft, when Violence, Assaults, Frights in the night time, especially by breaking of a mans dwelling house where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the life of him and his are endangered; and in such cases where the offence is multiplyed and increased, there the Magistrate may increase the punishment; and inflict death upon the party, as appeares 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.31. So then those judicial and civil Precepts which are agreeable to the Moral Law, and do confirm and uphold it, they bind for ever. <hi>E. g.</hi> 'Tis a judicial Law that adulterers and adulteresses should dye the death; now this being agreeable to common equity, and to the Law of Nature, as appeares. <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.24. where <hi>Iudah</hi> (before this judicial Law was publish by <hi>Moses</hi>) appoints <hi>Tamar</hi> his daughter-in-Law to be burnt for this sin, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> burnt <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah</hi> for it. <hi>Ier..</hi> 29.21, 22, 23. So this judicial Law of putting Witches to death by the Magistrate, is agreeable to common equity, it helps to preserve all the Moral Prceepts which are broken by the Idolatry, Murder, and Malice, of Wiches. It preserves the Peace of the land, and therefore is perpetual, and must be executed in our dayes on such as practice witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, be they high or low, white or black. As witchcraft is the same for substance now, as it was in the dayes of <hi>Moses. viz.</hi> a Covenant with the Devil, whereby men can do strange things above the Order of Nature: so the punishment ought to be the same; and Witches should now be more severely punisht, because they sin against greater Light and Love, against greater means and mercies. Yea, though they never hurt any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet if it can be clearly proved that any person hath made a League with the Devil, and is in confederacy with him, this renouncing the Lord, and contracting with his deadly enemy, is a High Treason against God, and deserves present and certain death. It's dangerous for Magistrates to suffer such to live whom God hath appointed unto death. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.42. True, God is very tender of the life of man, and therefore the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate must be very cautious, and make diligent inquiry to find out this great Mystery, he must not judge by bare reports or doubtful signs, but he must lay all the Testimonies, Signs, Circumstances, and strong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions of witchcraft together, and then judge of the Cause. What a heap of words the Lord useth by way of Caution, before a man be put to death. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.14, 15. if a man were reported to be a seducer of others to Idolatry, he must not presently be stoned, though he were a son of <hi>Belial; But they must enquire, and make search, and aske diligently, and behold if it be truth, and the thing be certain, that such an abomination is wrought, then they must surely die.</hi> Levit. 20. <hi>ult.</hi> this made <hi>Iosiah</hi> to destroy the witches of his time. 2 <hi>King</hi> 23.14. yea <hi>Saul</hi> (though a wicked man) yet put witches to death. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.3.9. though his heart was not sincere in what he did, for he sought to them in his trouble, and if the Magistrate will not cut off such, yet <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Clerks</hi> Mirrour <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note>

He who treads this Track, like <hi>Ionathan</hi> and his Armour bearer must climb the Hill; when others swim down the stream. This is the Reason why so many follow falshood rather then truth, not because falshood is in its own Nature stronger then truth, or Satans stratagems too strong for the Spirit of God; but because these false, flesh-pleasing doctrines agree with our corrupt Nature. therefore 'tis that men doe so readily embrace them.</item>
                     <item>6. God in his just judgement gives up such as will not believe his Truth, to the power of error, and to the will of seducers. Since they will be deceived; they shall be deceived, since they will not obey the true Prophets, they shall be seduced by false ones, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.21, 22. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 13.23. 2 <hi>Thessalonians</hi> 2.10.11.12. Let not then Ministers be discouraged when they see many fall off to these Impostors, 'tis no more then what hath been long since fore-told; God sets them their bounds, he limits the time how long; the persons deceiving, and whom they shall dececeive are ordered by his wisdom, both the deceiver and the deceived are his <hi>Iob</hi> 12.16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.9.</item>

As <hi>Moses</hi> was faithfull, and would not part with a hoof to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> so we must not part with a tittle of Gods truth to his enemies: for all Truths even the least are precious; truth is like gold, which is glorious in the Ray and Spangle, as well as in the wedge. As 'tis in Practicals, he that makes no conscience of little sins, will quickly be drawn to greater; so 'tis true, and holds in Doctrinalls, he that admits of a little error, will soon be drawne to a greater. Though every truth be not fundamental, yet every truth is a guard to the foundation, the outer skin of an Apple lyes remote from the heart, yet if you pluck that off, the heart will soon be rotten. The finger is not a vital part, but a Gangrene in the finger will (in a short time) reach to the very vitals, and corrupt the blood with the spirits. Not onely the garment of Truth, but the fringes thereof are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and must be preserved. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.38, 39, 40. We experimentally see that those who forsake Truth, in Discipline, quickly fall to errors in Doctrine. We shall hardly find a man that erres in the one, to be sound in the other. As therefore we must count no sin small, so we must esteem no error small, for the least truth of Gods Kingdome, doth in its place uphold the whole Kingdome of his truth. Take away the least <hi>Vericulum</hi> out of the world, and it unworlds all <hi>Potential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and may unravell the whole Texture <hi>Actually,</hi> if it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by an extraordinary power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider that truth is the choycest gift which God ever gave to the sonnes of men, it is better then any created <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Bonum,</hi> which are but Truths twinnes. Civil Truth is good, but the least Evangelical Truth is of more worth then all the Civil Truths in the world, that are meerly so.</p>

Rev.</hi> 3.10. so thou shalt stand as an impregnable rock, when others fly as the Chaffe before the wind. The Truth of God in judgement is one of the Eyes of the soul, he that wants it is blind and cannot see afar off.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> So soon as ever they begin to learn wickedness, we should teach them goodness; so soon as ever they begin to curse and swear, we should teach them to bless and pray. When Children can mock <hi>Elisha,</hi> and call him Bald-pate, it is time to change their Language, and teach them to cry <hi>Hosanna</hi> to Christ:<note place="margin">Children are mentioned three times in the Decalogue, to shew that God would have his Lambs regarded, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.15.</note> so that we should endeavour to sow the

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> Though Children whilest very young cannot come to much understanding, yet the having of Scripture Phrase and Texts by heart, is very usefull; and will much steed them when they come to years of discretion, and are able to dive deeper into the meaning of those things which they retain perfect in their memories from their Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: We should therefore nurse and nourish them up betimes in the knowledge of Gods Word as <hi>Timothy</hi> was,<note place="margin">

                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:99118:140"/>1. The Scriptures of the Old Testament are of Divine Authority, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, a Rule of Faith and good Life, which appears thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. that which Christ and his Apostles have commended to us as a Rule of Faith and good Life, must needs be of Divine Authority, and ought still to be observed by us. but Christ and his Apostles have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Old Testament to us as a Rule of Faith and good Life <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> no Sober man will deny. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove; First from <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. Christ sends us to the Old Testament, and bids us search those Scriptures, (for the New Testament was not then written;) Now to what end should we search them, if they were of no validity. So <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Romans</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatsoever things were written afore-time</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Old Testament) <hi>they were written for our Learning. Apollos</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his admirable dexterity in opening the Scriptures of the Old Testament, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christ and his Apostles (to shew the Divine Authority of the Old Testament even in Gospel times) did fetch Arguments out of the Old, to confirm many points of Doctrine and Practice, when some doubted whether Christ were the Messiah, Christ proves it out of <hi>Isay</hi> 35. &amp; 53. and 61. when others Questioned the Resurrection; Christ confutes them out of <hi>Exodus</hi> 4. I am the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> When a Question arose about Divorcements, Christ hath recourse presently to the Old Testament, and alledgeth those words, <hi>Genesis</hi> 2. For this cause a man shall leave Father and Mother, and they two (not they twenty, as the Polygamistical Anabaptists would have it) shall be one flesh. So when the Pharisees accused Christs Disciples for breach of the Sabbath, Christ presently defends them with an Old Testament proof, <hi>Matthew</hi> 12.3. compared with 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 21.6. So when the Scribes and Pharisees taught for Doctrines the Precepts of men, Christ confutes them, out of <hi>Isay</hi> 29 13. When Christ would teach men to deal justly and to doe as they would be done by, he proves it from the Law and the Prophets, which comprehend the whole Old Testament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. So did <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 26.22. and 28.23. he taught nothing but what was written in the Law and the Prophets. So <hi>Ephesians</hi> 6.2, 3. and <hi>Peter</hi> confirmed what he said out of the Old Testament, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.4. and 1.1, 15. When <hi>Paul</hi> would fright men from murmuring, he brings an Old Testament Example, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6.11. <hi>All these things are written for our Example.</hi> So he proves Justification by Faith out of the Old Testament, by <hi>Abrahams</hi> being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. He proves the maintenance of Ministers to be due, from the Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7, 8. All this proves that the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not abrogated.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Word of the Lord endures for ever, not a Jod or tittle of it shall pass away till all be fulfilled, <hi>Matthew</hi> 5.18. But the writings of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and the Prophets are the Word of God; Hence they are called, <hi>His Statutes, his Testimonies, his Law and his Commandements,</hi> and in our doubts we must to the Law and Testimony as our Rule. <hi>Isay</hi> 8.20. and <hi>Peter</hi> tells us (2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.19.) that we have a more sure word of Prophesie (speaking of the Old Testament) whereunto ye do well to take heed as to a light shining in a dark place: and if they do well that take it for their Rule and Guide, then they do ill that reject it, to follow some <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis fatuus,</hi> some New-light of their own inventing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that denieth the Old Testament (when it crosseth his Lusts) will when a Tempation comes deny the New Testament also; for the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Old Testament were inspired with the same Holy Spirit of Truth, as were the Penmen of the New.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:99118:141"/>There is but one Spirit, 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 4.13. and it cannot speak Truth in <hi>Paul,</hi> and falshood in <hi>Moses</hi>; but the same Holy Spirit which spake by <hi>Peter, Paul, Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. Spake also by <hi>Moses, Isay, David, Ieremy, Luke</hi> 1.70. <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 1.1. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.21. Question one, and you will quickly question all; Question <hi>Moses,</hi> and you will question <hi>Matthew</hi>; Question <hi>Matthew,</hi> and you will question <hi>Paul</hi>; till at last with the Quakers you have cast off all. For what is the Old Testament but the New obscure? And what is the New Testament but the Old made plain? both have an eye to Christ, they being saved in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament by believing that Christ would come,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Novum Testamentum in Vetere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum, &amp; Vetus in Novo revelatum esse, dixit,</hi> Augustinus.</note> and we in the New by believing that Christ is come. So that, deny one, and you will quickly deny both.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The Anabaptists themselves who cry out most against Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proofs, yet are as ready as any to borrow proofs from thence, when they think it may make for their advantage.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Anabaptists in <hi>Germany</hi> (that cried down the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet) went about to justifie their rising against their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours from the Example of the <hi>Israelites</hi> rising against <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and when we demand what grounds they have to preach without a call, they can then cite, <hi>Numbers</hi> 11.25. 2 <hi>Chronicles</hi> 17.7. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.28. I hope they will allow us the same Liberty which they take themselves, and when we cite Old Testament proofs against Tolerations, and for punishing blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers with death, they will not be offended.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. How shall we be able to convince a Jew that Christ is the true Messias? It must be out of the Old Testament, (for the New he wil not believe) Now that Christ is already come, according to the Promises and Prophesies of him, is as cleare as the Sunne, by Old Testament proofes.<note place="margin">

But the knowledge of the Scripture, brings us directly to Christ, and by consequence to salvation, which is the only true wisdome. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12, it will save a man and his house. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.14. This made the Apostle preferre the wisdom of God in the Gospel, before the wisdome of this world. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6, 7. the Virgins that walked according to this Rule are called wise. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. True wisdome consists in finding the way to blessednesse, and walking in that way to the end. <hi>Psalm</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.24. and 19, 20. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.15, 16. they dye fooles and beasts, how poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick soever they have been for worldly ends, if they have not provided for eternal salvation. <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. <hi>ult. Prov.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Ier.</hi> 8.8, 9. and 17.11. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. This Doctrine like a two-edged sword, cuts both wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It cuts down the <hi>Papists</hi> on the one hand, who deny the Scriptures to be a perfect Rule of Faith and Manners, and therefore they adde many old, mouldy, moath-eaten, superstitious Traditions to be believed as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation: and so come under the curse of <hi>Adding</hi> to Gods word. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Revel</hi> 22.18. They also deserve sharp reproof for keepinng the Scriptures from the common-people and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from salvation, contrary to Gods expresse command, who would have all without exception of rich or poor to read his word. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. and 31.12. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It cuts down the <hi>Sectaries</hi> on the other hand, who deny the perfection of the Scripture, and cry up up their own perfection, their own dreams, and fancies. If the Scripture be able to make us wise to salvation, to what end then serve these <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> but to lead men out of heavens path? such have no true light in them. <hi>Isay</hi> 8.20. and if <hi>Paul</hi> durst not publish any New-light besides or beyond the Scripture, but kept close to the Rule, and preached only such things as were revealed in the Prophets. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. how great then is the presumption of the <hi>Pharises,</hi> of our time, who dare do that which <hi>Paul</hi> durst never do?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be a singular encouragement to us to be much in Reading and Meditation on the word. 'Tis not <hi>Plato, Plutarch,</hi> &amp;c. that can make us wise to salvation (though they are useful in their kind, and we may learn many excellent lessons from them) yet since we cannot find the name of Christ there, it must abate our delight in them, as it did Saint <hi>Austins</hi> in the reading of <hi>Tully.</hi>

To omit conjectures, let us grant that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks of the Old Testament, and that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth they were able to make a man wise to salvation.

               <p n="3">3. What was written in every Age was sufficient for that Age: and the Books which were extant in these times were a sufficient Rule for the Church in those dayes. Thus the five Books of <hi>Moses</hi> (till the other Books of Scripture were extant) were a perfect Rule. So the Books of the Old Testament which were extant when <hi>Timothy</hi> was a child, were a sufficient Rule: yea, and before there was any thing written, Tradition alone was sufficient, neither was any thing written so necessary, but they might be saved without it. But now since God hath revealed his mind in the Holy Scriptures, we must to the Law and to the Testimony.</p>

                  </gap>itable, how great is the profit and perfection of both Old and New together?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. Objection,</hi> A second Cavil is this, That the Scripture is not a Total and sufficient Rule, but onely a Partial one; and though it be <hi>profitable,</hi> yet 'tis not sufficient without unwritten Traditions. They are not here excluded no more then Second Causes are excluded (<hi>saith</hi> Bellarmine) from the generating of things in the World, as the Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> If the Scripture contain all things necessary to salvation, then 'tis a perfect and not a partial Rule. But it doth contain all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to salvation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Minor I prove thus: If the O. T. did contain all things necessary to salvation, and were sufficient without Traditions, then <hi>à fortiori</hi> both Testaments together must needs be sufficient. But the Antecedent is true, and therefore the consequent. The Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is able (saith the Apostle) to make us wise to salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must needs be sufficient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The comparison from the Sun holds not, because unto generation second causes must necessarily concur; but for Regeneration here is such a full enumeration of all things to be done, that no more needs be added, and therefore Traditions are vain.

Reason raised and rectified, is the candle of the Lord and good, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27.) so long as 'tis subordinate to faith: but when it goeth about to judge it, then it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrowes all, as we see in the Socinians, who abound with such grosse Heresies, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines Question whether we may call them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?</p>

Gods Spirit teacheth us to try the spirit and doctrines of men by Scripture. <hi>Isay</hi> 8.20. and if they speak not according to this word, 'tis not because they have New-light, but no light in them. Christ who was full of the Spirit of the Lord, yet doth not go about to prove things by the Spirit within him, but he sends men to the Scriptures, as their Rule. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. and when he disputed with men and Devills, he doth not appeal to the spirit or light within him: but he cites Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without them, against them: for though Gods Spirit do enlighten the Saints on earth, yet it is but in part, this illumination is imperfect and mixt with much darknesse within them, so that they have need also of a light without them, which is the Scripture. And if <hi>Timothy</hi> who was inlightned by the spirit in a more then ordinary measure (he being an Evangelist) yet must give himself to reading the Scriptures, how much more have we need to read and study them, who have not that measure of the spirit as he had. And if the spirit were our Rule, how many would be deluded with Satanical spirits,<note place="margin">See an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent little Treatis to this purpose, called the True Guide.

                  </note> but God hath given us a surer word of prophecy, so that we must not trust onely to the Testimony of the spirit concerning it self, but we must bring every spirit to the Trial and Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of Gods word. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. yea, though they pretend to have the Spirit of God, yet must it be tried by the word of God.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter is <hi>Pauls Cygnea Cantio,</hi> his last, and sweetest Song; by a Spiritual sagacity he saw his end approaching, and the time of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome to be at hand, and therefore now he doth as it were make his last Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein he gives <hi>Timothy</hi> many things in charge, &amp; especially commends to him the work of Preaching. And since the words of dying friends usually take deep impression, he doth not barely exhort, but solemnly adjure <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> to preach the Word with all diligence and care, according to the ends mentioned in the two last Verses of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter.</p>
               <p>To quicken him, he tells him what dangerous times were coming, and of his own death approaching. He desires <hi>Timothy</hi> to come to him, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how he was forsaken of all men; and then concludeth the Epistle with divers salutations, and a Valedictory Prayer.</p>

                  <item>1. Here is a serious Exhortation and Solemn Adjuration given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him to all the Ministers of the Gospel successively, to quicken them to a faithful discharge of that great Ministerial duety, <hi>viz. the Preaching</hi> and pressing of the Word in the several Parts of it, Verse 1.2. This Exhortation he backeth and enforceth with several Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.

                        <item>1. From the day of judgement, Verse 1. There is a day coming when we must give an account of our Stewardship to Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead, we had need therefore to be faithful and active in our Masters service.</item>

Now the greater the danger, the more careful he must be to prevent it, Verse 3.4.</item>

Because some had forsaken him, as <hi>Demas,</hi> v. 10. Others abused and opposed him, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-smith, and others were sent by him to other places to preach the Gospel. v. 12.</item>
                  <item>3. He gives a brief account of his first Answer before <hi>Nero,</hi> shewing how all men forsook him, yet the Lord was with him, who supported him in his trials, and delivered him from the cruelty of <hi>Nero.</hi> v. 17, 18.</item>
                  <item>4. After some particular Salutations he concluds with Prayer and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, for <hi>Timothy</hi> and the rest of the Brethren with him.</item>

                  <p n="1">1. That Christ is very God appeareth by the Titles which are given to him in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is called <hi>Iehovah,</hi> which is the most Glorious, proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Name of God, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 23.6. <hi>Malachi</hi> 3.1.</p>

It is the Fathers Will that all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.23. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Grotius</hi> the <hi>Socinian-Arminian-Papist</hi> labors to pervert those texts which hold forth the Deity of Christ, as <hi>Philippians</hi> 2.6.1. 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 1.2. and especially, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Romans</hi> 9.5. These two Texts are so clear for the Deity of Christ, that the Learned <hi>Socinian</hi> hath no shift but this, that some old Manuscripts which he hath seen, read it otherwise.

                  <p n="5">5. There is an absolute necessity that Christ should be God as well as Man; for as an Infinite Justice was offended, so an infinite Justice must be satisfied. The intollerable weight of Gods wrath the burthen of sin, the power of Satan which is to be opposed, and the great good which we had lost and must be restored by Christ, all conclude Christs Deity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides he is Judge of all the World, which necessarily presupposeth his Deity, he must be Omnipotent, Omniscient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who is this Judge.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. This may discover to us the hainous nature of sin, in that nothing could pacifie the wrath of God, nor wash out the stain of sin, but <hi>the blood of God,</hi> as the Holy Christ stiles it, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Consider but the price that was paid for the least sin, it made Christ to groan and sweat <hi>non guttas sed grumos</hi> clodded blood, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. great was the soare that needed such a salve, and sad the malady that could be cured by no other medicine. In nothing is the horrour of sin seen like as in the Humiliation, death and suffering of Christ.

We should hate it not onely <hi>Odio aversationis,</hi> but also <hi>odio inimicitiae.</hi> Not onely by flying from it, but by pnrsuing it with an hatred of enmity.

                  <p>Lastly, Consider our love, 'tis the best thing that we can give unto Christ, 'tis indeed the man, it denominates a man, that we are that we love most. <hi>Affectus Virum indicat,</hi> If a man love pleasures most, then be is a voluptuous man, if the World, a worldling. Christ I am sure hath best deserved our love, and hath payed dearest for it; if any can shew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Title to it, let him take it. It should deeply humble us to consider how there is none less beloved then Christ who yet hath best deserved our love. Every one hath his beloved, the Drunkard hath his beloved cups and queans, the Worldling his beloved bags and barns, onely Christ lies unregarded by the most of men. Of all Evils the evil of sin should most affect us, and of all sins, Gospel sins and unbelief, not prizing Christ nor receiving him into our hearts, but like the Gadarens preferring our swinish lusts before him. This is that damning sin which Virtually is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sin, and binds the guilt of all sin upon the soul, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. Let us then promptly obey him and readily submit our wills to his Will; let us take him for our Lord, as well as for our Saviour.

                  <p n="1">1. Since Christ is Judge of all men, take heed of offending him. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter displease all the world then displease him. He can do more for us or against us then all the world besides. He's the best friend, and the saddest foe; if he be against you all the creatures are against you, and if he be for you all are for you. The men of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon made their peace with</hi> Herod, <hi>because their Country was nourished by the Kings.</hi> Acts 12.20. We hold all in Capite, Christ is Lord Paramount of Lands, Life, Liberty, and all that we possesse, and can take all from us when ever pleaseth him; it will be our wisedom therefore who ever we fall out with all, yet to keep in with him. <note n="*" place="margin">See more M. <hi>Ienkin,</hi> Jude 14. p. 210. fol.</note> Make the Judge your friend, agree with him whilst you are in the way.</p>

The greater the Prince, the more Noble the Service: Christ is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; none like him, and therefore no Service like his.

When all created comforts forsake you, he will never forsake you: Our Fathers dye, and the Prophets dye, but Christ who is the Father of our Fathers, and the Prophet of Prophets, lives for ever, <hi>Zachary</hi> 1.5. When these Cesterns are broken, yet this Fountain abideth, <hi>Psalm</hi> 18.46. Most men are careful to get and keepe the favour of great men, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 29.26. but what will it avail us to have the favour and applause of our fellow-prisoners, if the Judge condemne us. It will be our onely wisedome with <hi>Paul</hi> to labour to be acceptable with Christ, and that upon this very ground, because <hi>we must all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement Seat of Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This speaketh <hi>singular Comfort</hi> to all Believers who have taken Christ for their Soverain, as well as for their Saviour. Why the Judge is thy friend, yea he is thy Saviour and Redeemer, it is he who was judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned for thee, it is he who hath satisfied Divine Justice, and paid thy ransome; So that thou needst not fear what sin or Satan can do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee.

Then God will review the judgements of the World, and those sinnes which have not been judged and punished, and the things which have been falsely and unrighteously judged, shall be brought to open view.</p>
                  <p>God will not alwayes suffer his Jewels to lie in the dirt, but he will Vindicate the injuries which are done to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7.

But positively to

                  <p n="2">2. Since the day of Judgement is of such general concerment both to good and bad, and since there is no Doctrine so powerful to awaken secure, impenitent sinners out of their sins; it may teach us <hi>Ministers</hi> to be much in preaching and pressing this day upon the consciences of people. As King <hi>Iames</hi> said of one that preacht before him of death; <hi>this man</hi> (saith he) <hi>preacheth of death as if 'twere at my back.</hi> So Ministers should preach so powerfully of judgement as if 'twere at mens backs ready to arrest them. This Christ himself expresly commands us to preach unto the people. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. As they should desire to hear of that day, that so they might be kept in a continual preparedness for it, so we should delight to be setting it forth in its lively colours for the comfort of the godly, and for the converting (if it may be) of others; for if this will not work, nothing will, if the terror of this day will not awaken thee, thy case is dreadful and desperate. The hearing of this day made a <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble, and if thou be not past grace, it will make thee to tremble. When <hi>Solomon</hi> would fright young men from their sinful pleasures, he tels them of a stinging <hi>But.</hi> Eccles. 11.9. <hi>but remember that for all these things he will bring thee to judgement.</hi> If our heart be not harder then the Adamant, the remembrance of this day will quicken us to amendment. And this is the reason why Gods servants in all ages have been so careful to mind people of this day. <hi>Enoch</hi> of old prophesied of it. <hi>Iude</hi> 14.13. so did <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 32. and <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 96. <hi>ult.</hi> and <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> 11.9. and <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.13, 14. and <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. and <hi>Malachy</hi> 3. and 4. and Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and 25. and <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. and <hi>Iude</hi> 6. and <hi>Iohn, Rev.</hi> 1.7. and 20.12. So that this is no such Legal Doctrine as some Illegal and Lawless Atheists do imagine, for Christ, <hi>Paul, Peter, Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. that were Evangelical Preachers oft treated of it, yea, before ever the Law was publisht by <hi>Moses,</hi> this Doctrine was preacht presently after the fall by <hi>Enoch.</hi> Jude. 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It must quicken <hi>Iudges,</hi> and these in authority to execute righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement, remembring that they judge not for men, but for the Lord whose Vice-gerents they are, and to whom they must shortly give an account. He judgeth among the Gods by discerning whether their judgement be right or not. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.5, 6, 8. He is with them in the judgement, though <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> could not ride circuit with them, yet God did; he is with them not onely by way of assistance and <hi>protection,</hi> but also by way of <hi>observation,</hi> he takes notice of every sentence that passeth, and will bring it again to judgement; for one special end of that great day is, <hi>judicare non judicata &amp; malè judicata.</hi> To punish those sinners which have escaped unpunisht here, and to rectifie the unrighteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world. Let there be no partiality, bribery, oppressing of the fatherless and the widow, but hear both sides patiently, fully, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently; so acting and so judging, as remembring that you your selves must ere long be judged.</p>

This season Christ and his Apostles usually observed, <hi>Marke</hi> 6.1. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. and 13.14. and 20.7.</p>

                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:99118:173"/>2. There are times and seasons when the Word may be most accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and most profitable to the hearers, as when Gods hand lies heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a people, and they are broken with some great affliction; then is a time to speak a word in season, then they will hear our words for they are sweet, <hi>Psalm</hi> 141.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Out of Season.</hi> Not that the Word is ever out of season in it self, for it is the Bread of Life, all other meats have their times and seasons, but Bread is the Staffe of Nature, and is never out of season. There is no season unseasonable for so seasonable, for so necessary a duty in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of a Natural man, and in the eye of carnal reason it seems some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be out of season, as when it is preached on the week day, when Pastor and people have profits and pleasures, and worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to draw them off: Now a Sermon seems like snow in Harvest to such earthly souls, it is out of season with them, yet even these seasons which the world judgeth unseasonable must a Minister redeem for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus Christ himself did not onely preach on the Sabbath day, but on the week dayes also, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.1. and 19.47. We must not to favour our selves preach once a moneth, or once a day, but we must be diligent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Lords Vineyard if we expect our penny: So that there is no contradiction in these commands, both may and must be done by a faithful Minister, who must Preach in season when God gives the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and the people desire it, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.42. and out of season, when peoples hearts are so distracted with worldly cares that they have no desire after it. Now if Ministers must preach the Word in season and out of season, then <hi>People</hi> must hear the Word and be instant in season and out of season. Preaching and Hearing are Relatives, if there lye a Necessity on us to Preach, by the same Rule there lieth a Necessity on you to hear, you must redeem time from your worldly affairs to attend on this Ordinance, not onely on the Lords day, but even on the week day. It will not repent you when you come into your Kingdome. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and peace which you will gain by a right attendance on this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance will abundantly recompence all worldly losses, you shall incur by it. Let thy bodily affairs wait on thy Spiritual, and the lesser give place to the greater, we have a notable instance for this in the men of <hi>Bethshemesh,</hi> who were busie at their Harvest till the Arke came, and then for joy they lay by all, and goe to offer Sacrifice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Question,</hi> But would you have us cast off our callings, and doe nothing but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Sermons?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> By no means, for he that commands us to be swift to heare, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.19. commands us also to be diligent in our callings, yet whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is no letting, the oyling of the wheels doth not hinder the going of of the Clock. An houre spent in hearing a Sermon is no hinderance to our particular calling. We can spend two or three houres in Visiting our friends, and think it no impediment to our Temporal imployments. So that in Cities and Towns especially where people may meet conveniently in respect of cohabitation it will be their wisedome to improve these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for their spiritual advantage, as they did (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.42.) who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Apostles to preach in the space between that and the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath <note n="(i.)" place="margin">

If a man have broke his bones or lost his sight we do not use to revile him, or rage against him, but we pitty him, we pray for him, we bemoan his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A little Patience will not serve a Ministers turn who hath to doe with all sorts of persons, he must get a suffering frame of Spirit, Long-suffering, yea, all Long-suffering and Patience, that he may be able to bear with the weak, not despair of the wicked, nor rashly cast off any, but patiently wait till the Lord shall give them repentance to salvation. As the Apostle prayed for his <hi>Colossians</hi> (1.11.) that they might be strengthened with Patience, yea, all patienee; so we had need to pray for our selves that God would strengthen us with Long-suffering, yea with All long-suffering that we may patiently endure the reproaches and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities which attend our callings, and are annexed to our Orders, that so we may condescend and stoop to the slowness and dulness, weakness, and waywardness of our people.</p>

'Tis true <hi>de facto,</hi> that the Tythes are sold, but <hi>quo jure</hi>? what power had they to sell that which was devoted to the immediate worship of God? Had there been a sufficient mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance left for the Ministery, they might the better have taken the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining superfluity. But to take away a Ministers necessary maintenance, and thereby to starve souls (for scandalous means breeds scandalous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters) is the ready way to bring a curse on such persons, and all they possess. 'Tis a snare to devour holy things. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25.

His house was no house, and his rest no rest to him, till he had finisht Gods work. So the wicked man sleeps not till he have brought his wicked devices to pass, and as the good man hath his awaking thoughts with God and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.18. <hi>So soon as ever I awake my thoughts and meditations are with God:</hi> So the wicked man when he awakes, he is still with sin; his waking-thoughts in the night are to do mischief in the morning. <hi>Micah</hi> 2.1, 2. they hinder themselves from sleep that they may further themselves in sin; the night is spent in plotting and contriving mischief, and the day in accomplishing these plots. Thus night &amp; day they follow the Trade of sin, &amp; so are justly stiled workers of iniquity. Now as to be zealous in goodness is the height of goodness, so to be active in wickedness is the height of wickedness, when men shall sell themselves to sin, and work wickedness with greediness. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.20. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.17. Lastly, others are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous against zealous ones; they cannot endure to see any better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The Scribes and Pharisees will not go to Heaven themselves, nor yet will they endure that others should go. If Christ do but set his face towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Samaritans will hate him. While <hi>Paul</hi> was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor, he met with no persecution, but when he was converted and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:99118:178"/>
preached the Truth, then he's a pestilent follew, and is mad. In other Religions the more zealous a man is, the more he is esteemed, but amongst us the more zealous, the more hated. These hate their best friends, for these zealous <hi>Elijahs</hi> are the Pillars of a Land, the very Chariots and Horse-men of our <hi>Israel,</hi> the strength and ammunition of the Land, that by their prayers and tears keep off many a Judgement. The wicked fare the better for them every day, why is the heap of chaff kept from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but because there's some wheat mixt with it; but if once the wheat were out, the chaff should soon be set on fire. When once the number of Gods Elect is accomplisht the world shall not stand a moment. 'Tis just with God to take them from us for our abusing them, we cast dirt, and God casts dust on them, many great men are fallen of late in this our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Israel,</hi> nigh an hundred godly Ministers are taken from us within the space of three years past, many of them young and eminent for Piety; so that we this day are weakned both in Church and State. <hi>Ioseph</hi> is not, and <hi>Simeon</hi> is not, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> is not, all these things are against us. This is and should be a Lamentation to us.</p>
                     <p>Now since there is such aboundance of false fire and fein'd zeal in the world; we had the more need to try our own. Some are mislead by a <hi>blind zeal.</hi> Rom. 20.2. Others by an <hi>indiscreet zeal.</hi> Matth. 26.51. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.52, 53 54. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> Others by <hi>an hyrocritical zeal,</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Religion, but they intend their own inriching. So <hi>Demetrius</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the preservation of Religion, when indeed he intended his own silver Trade. <hi>Acts</hi> 19, 24.</p>

                        </note> we are not born zealous for God, his Truth and People, but by nature are full of enmity to all these. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 36. <hi>Paul</hi> in his natural state per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes the Church out of a blind zeal, many mistake the fire of their own flints, and the fire of Hell for this celestial fire. But the Author of all true zeal and Heavenly fire is the holy Spirit of God, which is oft called <hi>fire. Acts</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. because like fire it inlightens, and heats our cold and frozen hearts. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32. A man that hath fire in his bosom will quickly be sensible of it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.27, 28. 2. Tis operative like fire, daily burning up our lusts, purging out our dross, and working out our scumme. 'Tis the true purgatory fire which all beleevers pass through <hi>Isay</hi> 4.4.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It springs from knowledge, as <hi>David</hi> first beleeved, and then spake, so the zealous man first knows Gods Will, and then is zealous in the prosecution of it.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Verus zelus non est sinevera cognitione. Rabies est non zelus sine vera scientia.</hi> Rolloc.</note> Blind zeal is rather fury and madness, rashness and rudeness then zeal. 'Tis <hi>celeris cursus extra viam.</hi> It's like mettle in a blind Horse, which carries the Rider into many dangers. Like a Ship without a Pilot, which runs it self on many Rocks and Sands. Like wild-fire in a Fools hand, or the Devil in the Demoniack, which cast him, sometimes into the fire and anon into the water. The Jews had a zeal after Legal Rites and Ceremonies, <hi>but</hi> 'twas a blind zeal: that, But spoiled all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. as without knowledg the mind is not good, so neither is the man, nor his zeal. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. as blind obedience is no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, so blind zeal is not zeal. Such is the zeal of Papists and Sectaries.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It springs from a Love to Christ, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains us to do and suffer for Christ.<note place="margin">

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:99118:178"/>
will make us to spend our selves for him. This fire of Gods love to us will make us contemn all other fire.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When it springs from a Love and Compassion to our Brethren, when all our admonishions and reproofs come from a spirit of love and tenderness,<note place="margin">

                        </note> and are mixt with meekness and mourning, this is true zeal. Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> (1.16.) tells <hi>Saul</hi> plainely and sharply of his sin, yet mourns for his person. <hi>Lot</hi> reproves the Sodomites for their wickedness, yet calls them Brethren. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Christ</hi> was angry at the sin, yet mourned for the sinners. <hi>Mark</hi> 3.5. So doth <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.22. Hot and moist is the best temper, both in nature and grace. When men rave and rage, and are full of bitterness, then Satan casts out Satan, and they do more hurt then good. These hate the sinner and not the sin, when the good man is merciful to the sinner, but cruel and unmerciful to the sin.</p>

Like Fountain-water, 'tis hottest in the coldest weather. As water cast on lime. (by an Antiperistasis) burnes more fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely. The more the wicked oppose Gods Law, the more <hi>David</hi> loves it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.126. If <hi>Michol</hi> mock <hi>David</hi> for dancing before the Ark, he'l resolve to be yet more vile. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.22. True zeal over-looks and over-leaps all lets and impediments, difficulties are but whet-stones to fortitude. Heroick spirits know not what discouragements mean. Many waters of opposition cannot quench this ardent love, but intend it rather. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 7. As we see in <hi>Iacob,</hi> (Gen. 32.24, 25, 26.) and the Woman of <hi>Canaan.</hi>

Tell <hi>Paul</hi> of bonds, why he fears not death. Hypocrites make a great shew till they meet with oppositions, and then like snailes they pull in their horns.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It will make us abound in duty, if there be the fire of zeal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, there will be a flame of a holy Conversation without; love, especially zealous love is bountiful, it thinks it can never do enough for God, he's glad he hath any thing of worth to lose for him, and resolves with the Martyr,<note place="margin">

Zeal is a very high and intensive heat of all the affections, it makes us burn in our love to God, in our desires after him,<note place="margin">

'Tis not so much any one Affection, as the intensive Degree of all, when they are all improved to the utmost for the furtherance of Gods glory, and the good of his People.

But the Hypocrite is affraid of being too zealous and active for God; whereas we can never be too zealous in that we know to be good in it self, and good for us to do. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exceed in our love to God, nor in our obedience to him. No vertue in its formal reason can be too much intended;<note place="margin">

                     <p n="3">3. It will make us sharp and severe against our own sins, but pittiful and compassionate to others.

                     <p n="4">4. It makes a man more zealous in great matters then in lesser. In great causes, he sheweth great zeal, and in lesser causes, lesser zeal. He calls not for a Sword to kill a Flea, nor for an Axe to crack an Egge.<note place="margin">

But the Hypocrite he's <hi>magnus in minimis,</hi> he's fiery in small matters, and cold in weighty ones. With <hi>Saul</hi> he kills the lean, but spares the fat. And with the Pharises, he Tythes Mint and Cummin, but neglects obedience in the great things of the Law. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He's more zealous in Gods cause then in his own. <hi>Moses,</hi> how meek and quiet in his own cause. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3. Yet how hot in Gods. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.9.19.27. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> mourns more for <hi>Senacherib</hi>'s blasphemy, then for the Sword that was drawn against himself. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.3, 4.16. <hi>David</hi> when himself was persecuted became as a deaf man, but when Gods Law is transgressed his zeal consumes him, and rivers of tears run down his eyes. <hi>Christ himself</hi> in his own sufferings was as a Sheep before the Shearer dumb, but when Gods house is profaned, he doth not onely by words, but blows drive them out with an holy violence. <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> how silent when himself was reproached, but when Gods Sabbaths are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned he contends even with Nobles about it. <hi>Ioshua</hi> (7.8.) is more tender over Gods Name, then his own: he doth not say, what shall our names, estates and lives do, but what wilt thou do for thy own name? The Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> could bear any suffering, but not sin. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. But the hypocrite is hot in his own case, and key-cold in Gods, let any wrong him, or rob him, he's all on a flame, but let Gods Name, Sabbaths, Servants be wronged, he cares for no such things.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. True zeal may be known by it's concomitants and companions,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:99118:179"/>
which are 4.1. 'Tis ever attended with wisedom and <hi>discretion.</hi> 'Tis not a rash ungrounded zeal, but a wise, sober, well-grounded fervour. As a good dish may be spoiled in the dressing, so a good reproof for want of observing due circumstances of persons, time and place, may loose it's due operation. Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> commends a word that's spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Beophman, super rotis suis,</hi> running on the wheels of all due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.11. Fire on the hearth is good, but fire in the top of the house is dangerous. Love allows us to be warm and plain, but not scalding hot in our reproofs. A well-ordred zeal will teach a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> to catch a <hi>David</hi> in a parable.</p>

                        <hi>Caut.</hi> Yet must we beware least under pretence of discretion we destroy zeal, of which see more in the Objections.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It keeps the bounds of its calling. It dares do nothing without a call from God. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were good men, and the cause was good, but the prosecution of it was ill, for they assumed the Magistrates power without a call. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4.

                     <p>Lastly, this must quicken us all to an holy zeal and emulation in well-doing. Most men seek to excell their Neighbours in riches, fine houses, fine fare, but who labours to excel in vertue? The living God delights not in dead hearts, dead spirits become not his servants; cold wishes, and faint desires please not him, we must be active and stirring, if we desire that God should be with us; for our God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Who should be zealous and active for God if we be not? as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> said in another case, (<hi>Neh.</hi> 6.11.) Should such a one as I fly?

We should burn and boyl up in our spirits in duty. By this meanes we shall prevent aboundance of dangerous temptations which seise on Luke-warm professors.

But then we must be holy men, else if a Rebel or Traitor should come to the Princes Chamber, and lay hold on him, it would be accounted Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, before we come to reason with God, we must wash our selves, and then come and welcome. <hi>Isai.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. We must get a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al induration and holy impudency, let God do what he will with us, let him oppose, delay, deny us, yet we will not let him go till he bless us. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had a cursed Induration, and a plerophory of hardness, so that no plagues could work on him; so we should get a blessed induration and fulness of assurance, resolving though God should crush and kill us, yet that we will trust in him. <hi>Iob</hi> 13.15. And when we find our spirits flat then cry, because thou canst not cry; and be in an agony, because thou canst not be agonized.

Our zeal is the best thing we have, and therefore to be given to God who is the best of beings.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> One zealous man <hi>may,</hi> yea, and hath done much good to a whole Land. <hi>One Phinees</hi> by executing Justice turned away Gods wrath from all <hi>Israel, Numbers</hi> 25.6, 7, 11. One faithful <hi>Hushai</hi> by his Counsel spoyled <hi>Achitophels</hi> policy, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 17.14. One poor man saved a Citie, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.15. and the Prayers of <hi>One</hi> righteous man availeth much, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.16. When Gods judgements were falling on <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he sought but for a man that he might spare it, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 5.2. A carnal man dares not stir without company, especially the company of great ones, they enquire whether any of the Rulers and learned Pharisees have gone that way, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.47. Jades will not go unless some lead them the way; and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards stand still to see who will go first, but a gracious soul is content to fit alone, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.28. and go alone in the way to Heaven, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.10. He stayes not for company, but if the cause be good, rather then it shall fall, he will endeavour to uphold it himself. <hi>Hester</hi> will venture all for Gods people, and if she must perish, she will perish in this cause. Let nothing discourage you, if God have called thee to a good work and none will joyne with thee in it, yet remember he that called thee alone will bless thee, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 51.2.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> Yet thou mayest doe somewhat for God; we reade in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what great things God hath done by women, <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Iael</hi> two excellent women. The one ruled with an Heroick Spirit, the other kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sisera</hi> a valiant Commander, <hi>Iudges</hi> 4.4, 5.22. The woman of <hi>Abel</hi> by her prudence saved the City, 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 20.16.22. <hi>Abigail</hi> by her wisedome preserved her husband and family from an imminent danger. The <hi>Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> that great good woman stirred up her husband to entertain <hi>Elisha</hi> to the great benefit of her family, and <hi>Hester</hi> was a means to save the Jewes from ruine.

                        <hi>3. Objection,</hi> It is good to be discreet and wise in what we doe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> Discretion doth not hinder but further our zeal, it doth not diminish it, but directs it; and therefore they are not to be <hi>Opposed,</hi> but <hi>Composed</hi> and made subservient to each other. Prudence doth not abate our Diligence, but guideth it in its work, it teacheth us not to doe lesse, but to doe better. Thus there is an Harmony amongst the Graces, and we may in no wise set them at variance amongst themselves. Yet 'tis the property of the men of the world to accuse Gods faithful ministers (who tell them discreetly and zealously of their sins) for rash, heady men, and such as want discretion..</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> Moderation in our own causes and quarrels doth well, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5. But moderation and indifferency in Gods Cause is not moderation, but luke-warmness and coldness, which God abhorreth; and if wicked men will not content themselves with moderation in pursuit of their lusts and Idols, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.2. but will spend their estates, <hi>lavish Gold out of the bag upon them, Isay</hi> 46.6. shall not we in an holy prodigality spend our selves and what we have from God for his honour?</p>
                     <p>'Tis true in Moral Vertues which are <hi>circa res medias,</hi> the mean is best. But Religion admits of no mediocrity. <hi>e. g.</hi> our love to God, and our hatred against sin can never be too intense. Yea, no Vertue in its formal Reason can be too much intended nor admit of an excess: that man that saith he hath zeal enough, had never any true zeal at all. The Apostle saith its good to be zealous in a good thing, and is not zeal then best in the best things? and are there any things better then God, his Truth, Worship, People? Is it good to be earnest for a friend, and is it not much better to be zealous for God? The things we strive for are so Excellent that no zeal can be too much. 'Tis for a Kingdome, for an Heavenly Kingdome, 'tis for Christ for grace and glory; and if thou canst finde any thing in the world that better deserveth thy zeal, let it have it.</p>

Zeal is to the soul that which spirits are to the body, and wine to the Spirits, it puts activity and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in us.

                     <p n="1">1. The first is the retaining of any one bosome beloved sin, be it Pride, Idleness, Formality, Covetousness; either thy zeal must destroy thy sin, or thy sin will destroy thy zeal. Zealous affections are the <hi>wings</hi> of the soul, but sin like bird-lime intangles them that they cannot fly Heaven-ward. They are the <hi>feet</hi> of the soul, but sin like fetters hindereth us from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They are <hi>the fire</hi> of the soul; but sin like water quencheth this fire. We must resolve therefore against all sin if ever we would have the Spirit of zeal to dwell in us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Take heed of the inordinate love of the world. These thornes will choak our zeal, and this outward heat extracts and consumes our inward. Cast earth upon fire and you put it out; <hi>Demas</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> the love of the world drew them off; we must get our affections loosened from the world, and use it as though we used it not. Use it we may as the Traveller doth his Staffe, but love it inordinately we may not, unlesse we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Love of God, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.15. Our love cannot stand in intense degrees to two such contrary Masters.</p>

Hence zealous <hi>David</hi> commands evil company to depart, <hi>Psalm</hi> 119.115. We must therefore be very choyce of our company for it hath great operation upon us either to good or evil. As iron sharpens iron, and one edged tool helps to sharpen another; so God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the society of men to quicken men. Conference and communication of experiences hath incredible profit in all Sciences. Hence the Saints that lived in dead times did by conference excite and quicken each other in the wayes of God. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16, 17</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Formality in Religion is a great enemy to zeal, When men rest in a bare performance of duties without any power of godlyness, this is the <note place="margin">See notes on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</note> bane of Religion: when ever we come to duties we should stir up the graces of Gods Spirit in us, 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1.7. If fire be not blown and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, it will decay and goe out. We must also dayly be adding fuel to it, for <hi>where there is no fuel the fire goeth out, Proverbs</hi> 26.20. Pray much, men of much Prayer have been men of much zeal, as we see in <hi>David, Daniel, Paul, Bradford.</hi> Frequent the Preaching of the Word. <hi>Accede ad hunc ignem,</hi> there is a hidden Vertue in this Ordinance to kindle this fire in our breasts, which maketh the Devil so busie in drawing men to separation, for he well knowes by long experience that if he can but get men out of Gods way they will soon decay in grace; the body may assoon live without food as the soul can live without this bread of Life.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ministers must take all occasions to preach the Word.</hi> They must preach on the Lords Day, and on the week day, in publick and private, at home and abroad, In prosperity and adversity, In War and Peace, In Prisons and Palaces. We must not be Strawberry-Preachers (as Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> calleth them) which come but once a year and are quickly gone again. Not long since the Church was troubled with <hi>Canon-Preachers,</hi> who preached according to the Canon once a moneth, or once a day; insteed of these we have <hi>State-Preachers</hi> who preach such stuffe for quality as may please the State; and so much for quantity as will bring in their Angmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no Catechizing of the flock, no preaching on the week day unless <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Nobles</hi> call them. No baptizing of Infants, no fitting of the flocke for the Lords Supper, but all lies at random and in confusion; surely such Halving-Preachers should have half-pay. Doth not he that commands us to Preach command us to Baptize also, and to dispense the Lords Supper often. Surely, this is either not Scripture, or els some of us do not doe our duty. Let us therefore either do our duty, or else cast off our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and give place to such as will. As the woman said to the King, either do me justice and act as a King, or else put off the Title: so either let us do the whole work of our Ministery, or put off the Name.

                     </p>
                     <p>Let us preach in season and out of season, so did our Saviour; he took all occasions to preach; sometimes he preached in the Synagogues, anon in a Mountain. <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> on that Text. <hi>p.</hi> 99. <hi>folio.</hi>

We are Gods Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen and in the morning we must sowe our seed, and in the Evening not be idle, for some may prosper: when we consider the great price that was paid for souls (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.) it must quicken us to redeeme all opportunities to gain them to Christ.

                     <p>
                        <hi>We are exceeding backward to the best things,</hi> and have need of many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and exhortations in season and out of season to quicken us in Gods work. It's much adoe to make us begin, and when we have begun, we are ready to look back on every discouragement. Were there in us that Tractableness and teachableness which ought to be, how easily might Ministers lead us in good paths.</p>
                     <p>'Tis prophesied of Gospel times that so meek and teachable men shall be, that even a child with Scripture reason shall lead them, <hi>Isay</hi> 11.6. A wicked man, though you bring an hundred plain Scriptures yet he will not be convinced; but a gracious soul if he have but a little hint from Scripture, that what he holds or doth is displeasing to God, he presently casts it off. We should therefore lament the sad depravation of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have need of so much quickning to the best things. Many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why we are so fervent and frequent in reproofs, why our necessitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, and God in this Text injoynes it. Many love us whilest we comfort them, but when we come to cutting, reproving and launcing their soares, then they look upon us as enemies. [See more before on 2 <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> 3.16.]</p>

                        <hi>Application must be joyned to Doctrine.</hi> The Foundation and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must go together; for a foundation without a building argues the folly of him that laid it; and a building without a Foundation will soon fall.

'tis just with God to send them Teachers according to their own desire, that he who is Heretical, may be Heretical still, and he that is profane, may be profane still. When men sleight truth, they shall have Teachers which shall be Gods Executioners to bind them and blind them, and lead them into error. As God punisht the contempt of light in former ages, by giving men up to Antichrist, to be deluded by Monks, Friars, &amp; Lyars, because they received not the truth in love; so now, he punisheth formality, and contempt of the Gospel by giving men up in the hands of Socinians, and such like Seducers which shall feed them with fables in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of truth.

                     <p>Grant but this, and then <hi>Cain</hi> need not fear to kill his brother, <hi>Saul</hi> to persecute the Church, <hi>Herod</hi> to kill the Saints. Who will study to keep Gods Commandements or make any conscience of his wayes?

The broachers and obstinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of such Tenents should die without mercy, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.3.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> This doubt is easily resolved by distinguishing. Fighting is twofold. 1. Corporal and that also is twofold. 1. Lawful, as when a man fights in defence of the truth and of his Relations. 2. Unlawful as rash, drunken quarrelling and fighting; and this is that the Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns in a Minister, he must be a man of patient and peaceable temper, not given to fighting and quarrelling, else a Minister may (as occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires) correct his children and servants, and <hi>se defendendo</hi> strike an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulter. 2. There is a spiritual fight against sin and Satan, and of this the Apostle here speaks. <hi>Paul</hi> was a warriour, his weapons were spiritual (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.) his adversaries spiritual or for spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:99118:198"/>
and his victories were spiritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. God had placed him in the head of his Army,<note place="margin">

Others say the Metaphor of a Souldier is still continued, who promiseth fidelity to his commander and performs it to the death. The sense is the same either way. Fidelity is required of all servants, but specially of Depositaries and Souldiers. This Faith <hi>Paul</hi> had. 1. He kept the grace of saving Faith which was committed to him as a signal gift of God, in which he perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the end. 2. He was faithful in keeping the doctrine of Faith (what in him lay) from corruption, and in a faithful propagation of that choice Treasury to posterity in despite of the Legal Jew or the profane Gentile. And thus the word Faith is often taken in Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. and 3.9. and 4.1. So <hi>Acts</hi> 6.7. they obeyed the Faith (<hi>.i.</hi>) the Gospel which is the doctrine of Faith. So <hi>Acts</hi> 24.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. and 3.31. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19. So <hi>Saul</hi> is said to preach the Faith (<hi>.i.</hi>) the doctrine of Faith which sometimes he persecuted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.23. so <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Iude</hi> 3.3. The word <hi>Faith</hi> sometimes signifies fidelity and constancy in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and engagements. So <hi>Paul</hi> saies of himself that he was a Teacher of the Gentiles in Faith and truth (<hi>.i.</hi>) he was a faithful and sincere Teacher of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. I have not taught for gain or applause, neither have I taught the fancies and inventions of men, but I have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught them the Faith of Christ. So <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.18.

'Twas a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome amongst the Romans that none should go to the wars till they had first taken the military Oath (called the Sacrament) to be faithful and true to the Emperour, to observe all his commands, never to flye from their colours, nor to refuse any death so they might be serviceable to the Common-wealth. Such an Oath we all take at Baptism, we there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Devil and all his works, and devote our selves to God and his service for ever. This is general and common to all Christians. But there is a more special fidelity required in Ministers whom God hath in trusted with his Sacred Oracles and truths; such stewards especially must be faithful, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. such a one was <hi>Paul,</hi> he was not onely faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as a Christian in general, but as a Pastor he faithfully distributed to all the bread of life without the leaven of superstition, the poison of heresy, or the chaff of mans inventions, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. and therefore now he's dying he cannot but glory in this and speaks of it with confidence and comfort, <hi>I have kept the faith.</hi> Now happy, yea, thrice happy are those who when they come neer their end, and are within the Horizon of eternity can speak <hi>Pauls</hi> words with <hi>Pauls</hi> Spirit, and can truly say, I have fought the good fight, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The day of the generall judgement is oft called in Scripture Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, <hi>That day,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. and 24.36.) by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency as being the day of dayes, the most illustrious and glorious day that ever was or ever shall be: The most terrible to the wicked, and most comfortable to the godly who are commanded to lift up their heads for joy when they but think of it, what will they do when they shall see it?</p>

Now they are in glory, but then they shall be in perfect Glory and enjoy a clearer Vision of God. Then the desire which the soul hath to its body shall be fulfilled.

All Christs sayings are excellent, but none so sweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as those which he delivered a little before his death. His last Sermon and Prayer how sweet are they? <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Iacob</hi> dying, how sweetly doth he bless his sons? <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>Steven</hi> dying prayes for their life who put him to death; so did the Martyrs.

secure, benummed, erroneous, seared Conscience; but it is an inlightned, inlivened, renewed, pure conscience which is purged from the guilt of sinne by the blood of Christ, and delivered from the Tyranny of sinne, by the Spirit of Christ:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Puritatis indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidua comes est laetitia.</hi>
                        </note> This, this onely is a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This puritie of Conscience breedeth Peace, and Peace breedeth Joy, and Spirituall Mirth; this reconcileth those Translations which render it a quiet or merry heart, which is true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the effects and fruits of a good conscience. Now this good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is called a Feast.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because at a Feast there is variety of dainties and dishes, abundance of cates and delicates; 'tis not a Feast without variety and plenty, and more then ordinary fare. So at this Feast there is great variety.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Here is <hi>Ioy,</hi> this is most sutable and seasonable at a Feast, not a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, sensual, external inferiour joy; but a spiritual, supernatural, Holy, Heavenly, solid, serious, well-grounded, durable Joy, which none can take from us, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.22. They rejoyce in the Lord alwayes, <hi>Psalm</hi> 33.1. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.4. yea even in Tribulation, <hi>Romans</hi> 5.3. <hi>Iames</hi> 1.2. and that with a superlative transcendent Joy, hence called <hi>Ioy unspeakable and glorious,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.8. and compared to Joy in Harvest, when the husbandman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long toyl reapeth the fruits of his labours, <hi>Isay</hi> 9.3. yea, it surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that joy, <hi>Psalm</hi> 4.7. it mortifieth our delights to these low things, makes us to rejoyce in them, as though we rejoyced not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. Lo this is the first dish which is served in at this Royal Feast, <hi>Matthew</hi> 13.44. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.34. and therefore it is called by a special propriety, <hi>the joy of Gods people, Psal.</hi> 206.5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. At this Feast here is <hi>Peace,</hi> not a Fading, unsetled, transitory Peace, such as wicked men have; but 'tis a well grounded and a well bottomed Peace; 'tis built on the Word, and it's foundation is laid in Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it had a storm before it came to this calme.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. 'Tis not an ordinary but a <hi>transcendent Peace,</hi> such as passes all human understanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. mans wit cannot sufficiently conceive it, nor va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it according to its worth. To have Peace with men and Angels is a mercy, but when the soul lieth groaning under the sight and sense of sinne, then for the Spirit to speak Peace to us, to assure us that God in Christ is reconciled to us, this is a mercy of mercies. <hi>David</hi> had this Peace and therefore he fears not though ten thousand should compass him about, <hi>Psalm</hi> 3.6. <hi>Peter</hi> that was in great danger of his life, yet having a good cause and a good conscience he sleeps in Peace, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.6.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. 'Tis an everlasting peace, Christ hath bequeathed it to his for ever, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.27. <hi>Peace I leave with you my Peace I give you.</hi> The Lord hath bound himself by Covenant to continue it, it is more firme then the pillars of the Earth, or the Poles of Heaven, <hi>Isay</hi> 54.9. <hi>The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my Peace be removed.</hi> Their Peace may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and clouded for a time, but it shall never be totally taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for their seed abideth within them, even the spirit of Peace and comfort.</p>
                     <p>Though the good mans beginning may be troublesome and sorrowful, yet his end is Peace, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.37.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Feast is an excelling Feast, all other Feasts compared to this are meere hunger and empty things. This excelleth all other Feasts in three particulars especially.</p>

can remove the guilt of it, and by his Spirit infuse comfort and make peace there. Other Feasts have men for their Founders.</item>
                        <item>2. In respect of <hi>the nature of it.</hi> This is a Spiritual Feast full of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual delights and comforts; other Feasts are but carnal, corporal, sensual ones that feed and delight the carcass and outward man onely.</item>
                        <item>3. In respect of <hi>Duration,</hi> 'tis not for a day, or twelve dayes, but for ever, 'tis a continual Feast; 'tis a Feast in prosperity, and a Feast in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, a Feast at home, and a Feast abroad, a Feast in publick, and a Feast in private, a Feast by day, and a Feast by night, a Feast in a prison, and a Feast in a Pallace: this is the happiness of such as get and keep good Consciences, they keep holy day every day, be it clear or cloudy. He enjoyes a perpetual serenity and sitteth at a continual Feast. As it is the misery of the wicked that their worm never dies, so 'tis the happiness of the Saints that their joyes which are begun here shall never end. This is the beginning of Heaven here, <hi>Romans</hi> 14.17. 'tis Heaven upon Earth, 'tis <hi>praeludium caeli, a taste of the joyes of Heaven.</hi> This is the Heaven of Heavens, as in ill conscience is the hell of hells: without this heaven would not be heaven to us. When all other Feasts can yield us to comfort yet this will, and that in three times especially.

It is a debasement to a Christian who looks for a Crown of Glory to mind earth and to pursue these low things, this is as if a King should leave his throne and go rake in a kennel, or fight for bones. We may well trust God for crusts who hath promised us a Crown, he that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us his Son (which is a greater gift then ten thousand worlds) with him will much more give us all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>

This doctrine needs no proof we have too many sad instances of it in our own dayes. Such as begin in Hypocrisy will end in Apostasy. So did <hi>Hymenaeus, Philetus, Alexander,</hi> who at first were great Professors, yet at last become gross Apostates, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. and 2.2, 17. So did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi> 2 Chron. 25.2. see his fall, V. 14. Hypocrites seldom die undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, <hi>such as pervert their way first or last will be known,</hi> Prov. 10.9. Such may fall fearfully and foully, totally and finally. <hi>Pelagius</hi> a man so seemingly religious that they who wrot against him were fain to conceal their names for fear of the people, yet at last became a great enemy to the Free-grace of God. Now the Reason of all this is, the way to Heaven is a strait and self-denying way, beset with many troubles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, losses, reproaches which make soft and delicate Hypocrites for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it; they love with <hi>Ephraim</hi> to tread out the corn where they may have present pay, a bird in the hand with them is worth two in the bush, but they cannot endure plowing which yields no present profit, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.11.</p>
                  <p>Let the fall then of this great Professor make us all to fear, let him that stands take heed least he fall.

Nothing but sincerity can preserve us from Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy. Let us therefore especially at our first setting forth, <hi>Dig deep, lay a good foundation,</hi> consider what the truth may cost us, and ask our selves whether we can deny our selves universally for Christ if we cannot or will not we are not fit to be Christs disciples, we shall shrink in the wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and start aside like a broken bow when a tentation comes, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>

                     </note> In this sinne of <hi>Demas</hi> almost all the Aggravations of sin may be found.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He sinned against great <hi>Light,</hi> he being a Professour, yea, a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Gospel could not offend (in this kinde especially) through ignorance.</p>
                  <p>To sinne for want of Light may excuse <hi>à tanto,</hi> though not <hi>à toto</hi>; it may extenuate, though it cannot excuse, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1.13. Nothing aggravateth sinne like this sinning against Light. He that knew his Masters will and did it not, was beaten with many stripes. When a man sinneth for want of Light, God usually beareth and forbeareth; But when Light is come and men are convinced of their sinne, and yet will goe on, this is presumptuous sinning, this is Rebellion which is as the sin of Witch-craft, it maketh sin exceeding sinful.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To sinne against the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> aggravated the Heathens sinne, and they were punished for it, <hi>Romans</hi> 1. When they knew God in his Workes, and yet did not gloryfie him by walking up to that light, God gave them up to a Reprobate sense.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To sinne against the Light of the <hi>Law</hi> is worse, the Jewes that knew the Law, yet sinning against the Law were sorer punished then the Gentiles that were ignorant of it, <hi>Romans</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But we have the <hi>Light of the Gospel,</hi> and so sin against both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Lights and this too, which maketh our sinne in some respects greater then the Devils sin, for he never sinned against the patience of God, as we do, nor against the Tenders of a Redeemer and the offers of grace in the Gospel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27, 28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Demas</hi> sinned against great <hi>Love.</hi> God had inlightned him, made him a Preacher of the Gospel, gave him a roome in the affections of his chosen Vessel <hi>Paul,</hi> who had made him his Coadjutor, and commended him in his Epistles to the Churches, yet see his Ingratefulnesse, <hi>Demas hath forsaken me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To desert an ordinary Professor of the Gospel when he is in bonds for the Truth, is ill; but to forsake a <hi>Paul</hi> his approved friend, an Apostle of Christ, and that in bonds for the Gospel (when the sincerity of a Friend is tried who should love at all times, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 17.17.) when it was honourable to live and die with him; yet now to forsake him was both inhumane and unchristian. And this aggravates <hi>Englands</hi> sin. We cannot sin now at such cheap rates as formerly; Our sinnes (especially in this latter age of the World) are committed against greater Light, and greater love then ordinary; against greater Priviledges, Experiences, Victories and Deliverances, then ever our fore-fathers saw.</p>

He taketh it ill to be thus wounded in the house of his friends, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.6. As <hi>Absolom</hi> said to <hi>Hushai, Is this thy kindnesse to thy friend</hi>? So may we say to sinners, Is this your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to your Saviour for all his sorrow and sufferings? <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord o foolish and unwise? Deut.</hi> 32.6. God keepeth a Catalogue of all his favours to us, and when we sinne against them he is much displeased at it; as we see in <hi>Davids</hi> case, where the love aggravates his sinnes by the mercies which he had shewed him, 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 12.7, 8. Fire mingled with Oyle or Wine burneth more fiercely, so sinnes against great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are great provocations,</p>

                  <p n="3">3. He sinned against the light of good <hi>Example. Paul</hi> went before him in doing and suffering and glories in all as comfortable and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet <hi>Demas</hi> deserts him, and is not this our sinne? How many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Zeal, Piety, Chastity, Temperance, constancy hath God set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the Old and New Testament, and in our own dayes, and yet men will not follow?

The Devils sins are not fleshly sins for he hath no body, but they are spiritual sins, hence they are called spiritual wickedness in high places, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.12. They are full of Pride, Envy, Blasphemy, Heresy, Hypocrisy.

                     <p>As he doth not simply condemne the being called <hi>Father,</hi> but the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious seeking of that Title; so it is here.

might appear more then vulgar gravity: but the Scribes abusing this to Pride and selfe prayse, placing Religion chiefly in the outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance wherewith they veiled their detestable impieties, upon this account it is that our Saviour condemneth them, and biddeth us beware of them.</p>
                     <p>Now see what <hi>Quakers</hi> Logick here is, because some abuse long Robes to pride and ostentation, <hi>Ergò,</hi> none must use them.

                              <p>I hold it no point of wisedome for a man to tire out himselfe and his Auditours, and make the Ordinances nauseous, which rightly timed and performed would be very profitable and delightfull; for God in his Wisedom hath so ordered the variety of holy Duties on the Sabbath, that

                     <p>I should advise every Governour of a Family to goe home immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rtely from the publick Ordinances, and to set his Family in order, and set every one (according to his ability) some taske either in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise, or to learn a Psalm, or a Chapter, and such as can write to review and digest their notes. Else whilest the master of the Family is at the Publick repetition the children and servants will be in disorder at home.</p>
                     <p>It is this private Meditation, self-examination and application of the word to our selves which is the duty of duties, and all the Repetitions in the world without this will doe us no good. One Sermon eaten and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, and made our own will bring more solid joy then a thousand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.16. This private retiring and refreshing on our wayes comparing our hearts with the Rule is the principal duty, and what ever be neglected this must not be neglected if we looke to be saved. If ever we would get sound wisedome, we must separate and sequester our selves from crouds, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 18.7. Other things must be done in their proper time. but this of all duties must not be left undone.</p>
                     <p>It is true, this publick repeating maketh a greater noise and shew in the World, but it runneth up into straw, into formality, censorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, spiritual Pride (as is experimentally seen in the most) for want of this secret, Soul-humbling, Soul-affecting work.</p>

                     <p>The Devil can be content we should hear a thousand Sermons, yea, and repeate them too, when we have done, so he can but keep us from this private worke of making them our own by serious Meditation and Prayer, Repeating our Sermons in our lives (which is the best Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Sermons) the Devil hath his desire, and I appeale to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of those who spend so much time in publicke and private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions.</p>

                        <p>For still I say, it is most proper, profitable and convenient to have this duty performed in every particular Family where there is any number especially.</p>
                        <p>Now this keepeth Duties in their order; Here is time for private pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, then for publicke duties, then for workes of necessity, then for private Meditation, and lastly, for Family duties.</p>
                        <p>Thus you have my judgement, I shall not confine any one to it, I give you in onely what I finde Experimentallie most beneficial to my self and others: and if any can experimentally finde out a more profitable way to promote Godlynesse in its power, I can well permit every one to abound in his own sense, and to take his own way. My Record is on High that I have no designe against the persons, parts or performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of any, I rejoyce to see Gods work goe forward in any place; my one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire is, that the power of Religion may prosper in the Land, and the efficacy of it may appear in holy and mortified conversations.</p>

So praid <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 143.10. and <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. 3.16, 17. This inward presence of Christ with the Spirits of his people is one great part of the reward of their love and obedience to him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.21, 23.

We should therefore alwayes pray that Christ by his Spirit would be present with our Spirits, and that we may so live that he may delight to dwell in us: for if he be not with us sin and Satan will soon prevail against us. We should therefore labour to find and feel this special presence of Christ in our hearts, that we may rejoice in it, and lament its absence, without it we can do nothing, nor understand any thing in the mysteries of Religion, for the wisdom of the flesh is not onely an enemy but enmity it self against God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.

               </note>THese Post-scripts are no part of the Text, neither was this added by the Apostle, for it contradicts the Text. The Apostle calls <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> an Evangelist, <hi>2 Tim. 4.5.</hi> and the Post-script makes him a Bishop; The Evangelists were not tied to personal residence in one place, as Bishops and Pastors were: but they were to go from place to place to confirm the Churches planted by the Apostles. <hi>Beza</hi> observes that this first clause doubtless is spurious, it is not extant in divers old coppies, and, which is much, the Vulgar Latin omits it. So do the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Versions. So that this is but a very sorry foundation to build the Divine Right of Episcopacy upon.</p>
