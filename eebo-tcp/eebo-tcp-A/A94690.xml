         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat ſince we are aſſured of our Creation in the image of God, and of an intereſt in Chriſt, equal unto men, as
alſo of a proportionable share in the Freedoms of this Common wealth, we cannot but wonder and grieve that
we should appear ſo deſpicable in your eyes, as to be thought unworthy to Petition or repreſent our Grievances to
this Honourable Houſe.</p>
            <p>Have we not an equal intereſt with the men of this Nation, in thoſe liberties and ſecurities, contained in the Petition of
Right, and other the good Laws of the Land? are any of our lives, limbs, liberties or goods to be taken from us more then
from Men, but by due proceſſe of Law and conviction of twelve ſworn men of the Neighbourhood?</p>
            <p>And can you imagine us to be ſo ſottish or ſtupid, as not to perceive, or not to be ſencible when dayly thoſe ſtrong defences
of our Peace and wellfare are broken down, and trod under-foot by force and arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>Would you have us keep at home in our houſes, when men of ſuch faithfullneſſe and integrity as the FOVR PRISON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERS
our friends in the Tower, are fetcht out of their beds, and forced from their Houſes by Souldiers, to the affrighting and
undoing of themſelves, their wives, children, and families? Are not our husbands, or ſelves, our children and families by the
ſame rule as lyable to the like unjuſt cruelties as they?</p>
            <p>Shall ſuch men as Capt. <hi>Bray</hi> be made cloſe Priſoners, and ſuch as Mr <hi>Sawyer</hi> ſnatcht up and carryed away, beaten and buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted
at the pleaſure of ſome Officers of the Army; and ſuch as Mr <hi>Blanck</hi> kept cloſe Priſoner, and after moſt barbarous u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
be forced to run the Gantlop, and be moſt ſlave-like and cruelly whipt; and muſt we keep at home in our houſes, as if we
our lives and liberties and all, were not concerned?</p>
            <p>Nay, shall ſuch valiant religious men as Mr <hi>Robert Lockyer</hi> be lya-ble to Law Martial, and be judged by his Adverſaries, and
moſt unhumanly shot to death? <hi>Shall the blood of War</hi> be shed in time of Peace? doth not the word of God expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it? doth not the Petition of Right declare, that no perſon ought to be judged by Law Martial (except in time of
Warre) and that all Commiſſions given to execute Martial Law in time of Peace, are contrary to the Lawes and Statutes of
the Land? Doth not Sir <hi>Ed. Cook</hi> in his chapter of Murder in the third part of his Inſtitutes, hold it for good Law (and ſince
owned and published by this Parliament) that for a General or other Officers of an Army in time of Peace, to put any man
(although a Souldier) to death by colour of Marshal Law, it is abſolute murther in that General? And hath it not by this
Houſe in the caſe of the late Earl of Strafford been adjudged high Treaſon? And are we Chriſtians, and shall we ſit ſtill and
keep at home, while ſuch men as have born continual teſtimony againſt the unjuſtice of all times, and unrighteouſneſſe
of men, be pickt out and be delivered up to the ſlaughter, and yet muſt we shew no ſence of their ſufferings, no tenderneſſe of
affections, no bowels of compaſſion nor bear any teſtimony againſt ſo abominable cruelty and injuſtice?</p>
            <p>Have ſuch men as theſe continually hazarded their lives, ſpent their eſtates and time, loſt their liberties, and thought nothing
too precious, for defence of us, our lives, and liberties, bin as a Guard by day, and as a Watch by night; and when for this
they are in trouble and greateſt danger, perſecuted and hated even to the death; and should we be ſo baſely ungrateful, as to
neglect them in the day of their affliction? No, far be it from us: Let it be accounted folly, preſumption, madneſs, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
in us, whilſt we have life and breath, we will never leave them, nor forſake them, nor ever ceaſe to importune you
(having yet ſo much hopes of you, as of the unjuſt Judge mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 18. to obtain Juſtice, if not for Juſtice ſake, yet for
Importunity) or to uſe any other means for the enlargement and reparation of thoſe of them that live: and for Juſtice againſt
ſuch, as have bin the cauſe of M. <hi>Lockiers</hi> death: Nor will we ever reſt until we have prevailed, that We, our Husbands,
Children, Friends, and Servants, may not be liable to be thus abuſed, violated, and butchered at mens Wills and Pleaſures.
But if nothing will ſatisfie but the bloud of thoſe juſt men, thoſe conſtant undaunted Aſſerters of the Peoples Freedoms will
ſatisfie your thirſt, drink alſo, and be glutted with our bloud, and let us all fall together: Take the bloud of one more, and take
all: Slay one, ſlay all.</p>
            <p>And therefore again, we entreat you to review our laſt petition in behalf of our Friends above mentioned, and not to
ſlight the things therein contained, becauſe they are preſented unto you by the weak hand of VVomen, it being an uſual
thing with God, by weak means to work mighty effects: For we are no whit ſatisfied with the anſwer you gave unto our
Husbands and Friends, but do equally with them remain lyable to thoſe ſnares laid in your Declaration, which maketh the
Abetters of the Book laid to our Friends charge, no leſs then Traytors, when as hardly any diſcourſe can be touching the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the preſent times, but falls within the compaſs of that Book: So that all liberty of Diſcourſe is thereby utterly taken
away, then which there can be no greater ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Nor shall we be ſatisfied, however you deal with our Friends, except you free them from under their preſent extrajudicial
impriſonment and force upon them, and give them full Reparations for their forceable Attachment, &amp;c. And leave them from
firſt to laſt, to be proceeded againſt by due Proceſs of Law, and give them reſpect from you, anſwerable to their good and
faithful Service to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Our houſes being worſe then Priſons to us, and our Lives worſe then death; the ſight of our Husbands and Children, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of grief, ſorrow, and affliction to us, until you grant our deſires, and therefore, if ever you intend any good to this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Nation, harden not your hearts againſt Petitioners, nor deny us in things ſo evidently juſt and reaſonable, as you would
not be dishonourable to all Poſterity.</p>
