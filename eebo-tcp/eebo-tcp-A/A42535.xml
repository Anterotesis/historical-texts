            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Whose cunning placing doth much skill detect,</l>
               <l>To make it so far off these times reflect.</l>
               <l>For we the common size of men out-grow</l>

               <l>And being you know a Coblers Daughter</l>

But then 'twas fit, there should be next,</l>

               <l>How shee should e'r deserve a Lover?</l>

               <l>And <hi>Sanoho</hi> too, that doughty Squire,</l>
               <l>Attends <hi>Dulcinea</hi> thorough the mire;</l>
               <l>Through thick and thinne, o'r hedge and ditoh,</l>
               <l>The trusty Squire goes thorough stitch:</l>
               <l>'Tis a hard taske to wait upon her,</l>
               <l>But the more hard, the greater honour.</l>
               <l>Easy Atchievements are not nam'd,</l>
               <l>'Tis hardship makes adventures fam'd.</l>
               <l>The Island, he expects, no doubt</l>
               <l>Is very hard to be found out:</l>

               <l>But <hi>Don,</hi> I doubt, will scarce be found</l>
               <l>To keep within the Comments bound.</l>
               <l>If hunger pinches, out he goes,</l>
               <l>And makes a break fast on his Foes.</l>
               <l>For having first his Armour put on,</l>
               <l>He streit goes forth, and routs the Mutton;</l>
               <l>Then to <hi>Dulcinea</hi> comes he post,</l>
               <l>Laden with spoiles; shee rules the rost.</l>
               <l>If any Gyants him oppose,</l>
               <l>(As oftentimes he meets with those)</l>
               <l>He then his passive Valour showes,</l>
               <l>And gallantly receives their blowes;</l>
               <l>And 'tis an argument of great</l>
               <l>And daring courage to be beat.</l>
               <l>Yet let <hi>Dulcinea</hi> name but bread,</l>
               <l>And streight you heare a Windmil's dead:</l>
               <l>And were that Gyant ten times stronger,</l>
               <l>There's no resisting against hunger.</l>
               <l>That breakes stone wals you know; how can</l>

<hi>the Name whereof I purposely omit.</hi>] Why
our Author doth purposely omit the name of
the Village, where this Knight of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
did live, is easily smelt out, even this, that
he might make the greater search after it. The
place of <hi>Homers</hi> birth is yet a challenge upon
Record, and the head of <hi>Nile</hi> being undiscove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
breaks many a mans braine to find it out.
<hi>Tennariffe</hi> and <hi>Pen-Men-Maure,</hi> are Mountains
whose tops are obscured by their heights, and
herein he hath politiquely out-gone our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man
<hi>Tom Coriat,</hi> who indeed was borne in <hi>Zomersetishire</hi> (as the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious

But certainely he had been far more eminent, and a grander search made
after him no doubt, if he had been pleased to have concealed his Nataliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Town of <hi>Odcomb,</hi> and left the world upon enquiry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To pile up in their Halls old Launces,</hi> &amp;c.] This description of his house is
in short the very same with an ancient Justice of Peace his Hall, a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Armory to be toucht, like <hi>Pauls</hi> Scaffolds, Monumentally standing,
because none dare take them down: he proceeds not unlike the Welch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventary,
but it is not so large, nor so good, <hi>Sow's Babys</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> being a meat
for the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and not garsionable by the <hi>Manchegans,</hi> though
ennobled by the residence of <hi>Don Quixot.</hi> His Wardrobe not much excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Major of Quinboroughs,</hi> though for the thrift lesse notorious. The
Frugality of the Canvasse back to the Velvet fore-body, being not then
known at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and so could not possibly arrive at the <hi>Mancha.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>He had in his house a Woman about forty yeares old,</hi> &amp;c.] His Family (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
included) like that of the Arke, two and two, Male and Female, but
not of so many persons by halfe, yet here was as great Beasts. I do not read
that the <hi>Don</hi> did ever augment his Number, though his Neece was under
twenty, and himselfe (as is supposed) by the swelling of his Lip of the
<hi>Austrian</hi> Family (somewhat removed,) or at least of the race of the Jews,
as appeares by his <hi>Errantry,</hi> which is but a neater word for wandring: unto
whom it was, and yet is lawfull to match within their Tribes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He was an early riser, and a great friend of Hunting</hi>] Now you perceive
the reason of his continence, he was an early riser; That indeed made not
much for it, but withall a friend to hunting, that did it. Our <hi>Don</hi> was a dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
Vassall to <hi>Diana.</hi>

Hunting Speares and Javelins are not of <hi>Cupids</hi> Quiver, nor will I attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
this Costivenesse (as to the flesh) to his yeares, being on the worse side
of forty, as they say, or to his withered face, or dried flesh, which may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <p>
                        <hi>He made away many Acres of Land to buy him Bookes of that kind.</hi>] We have
a Proverbe (but the Spaniard have two for one) That a foole and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
are soone parted; It seemes our Knight (pardon the application) made
his Lands <hi>Errant</hi> before himselfe, and dub'd his Acres first, so that what he
did afterwards was but in pursuance of his Lands that went before, and so
made himselfe a Wise-Acres. Laugh not too soon at our Spaniard, unlesse
you can acquit your selves countrymen of as great a folly. Are not Books
of this kind as well bought as those of the Philosophers stone? And pray
what difference in the price? How much good gold hath been fired, out
of whose ashes yet the young Phaenix never rose? What did <hi>Banckes</hi> spend
in Coales do you thinke? How much <hi>Terra</hi> was <hi>Damnata?</hi> How many
Lordships sold? besides the inestimable losse of Time and Braines, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57130:9"/>
this empty name, and sound the Philosophers stone? There is not
of all that expencefull madnesse so much left for profit or recreation, as the
History of that <hi>Quixo-Philosophy,</hi> or <hi>Philosophers,</hi> unlesse what is most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
Satyriz'd by our Father <hi>Ben</hi> (of eternall memory) in his Play of
the Alchymist:
<q>Spectatum admissi Risum teneat is Amici?</q>
Which would move laughter most, our <hi>Dons</hi> encountring his Windmill, or
his Lordship at the Furnace? Being <hi>Subtle, Face, Lungs,</hi> and all: Bestow a
brace of tassled Caps upon them both, and so <hi>exeant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He did not like so much the unproportionable blows which</hi> Don Belianis <hi>gave
and tooke.</hi>] Our <hi>Don</hi> is not so much transported with <hi>Belian is</hi> his Blowes as
a passionate Butcher of our Nation was, who being at the Play, called <hi>the
Greeks and Trojans,</hi> and seeing <hi>Hector</hi> over-powred by <hi>Mirmydons,</hi> got upon
the Stage, and with his good Battoone tooke the true <hi>Trojans</hi> part so stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he routed the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and rayled upon them loudly for a company
of cowardly slaves to assault one man with so much odds. He strooke
moreover such an especiall acquaintance with <hi>Hector,</hi> that for a long time
<hi>Hector</hi> could not obtaine leave of him to be kill'd, that the Play might go
on; and the cudgelled <hi>Mirmydons</hi> durst not enter againe, till <hi>Hector,</hi> having
prevailed upon his unexpected second, return'd him over the Stage againe
into the yard from whence he came.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Many times he did fall at variance with the Curate,</hi> &amp;c.] As great an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of quarrell was this of a brace of Students, who kept short of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidents
of their Colledge Fines (for that was meat for their betters) while
their Seniors were sharing that money, walkt in their Grove, (taking the
fresh aire without any contradiction of Superiours;) At last one makes a
supposition, If thou or I now should happily find a purse of Gold, how
should we divide it? They were, you must conceive, of different degrees,
one Master, the other Batchelour of Arts. The Master of Arts, like the
Lion, asked the greatest part. The other said, no, <hi>Simul occupantes aequÃ¨ Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntes:</hi>
Equall purchase equall share. The Master would not forgoe his
priviledge of seniority, the Junior insisted upon his Title of halfe; at last
it grew so hot that they fell to Cuffs, and bang'd one another devoutly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till,
weary of their blowes, they began to examine each other of the ground
of their falling out, which was no other than about the divident of a purse
of gold, which was never yet found.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the</hi> Cid Ruydiaz <hi>was not to be compared,</hi> &amp;c.] To the Knight of the

fortune to have adventured into <hi>England,</hi> and seen the Knight of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pestle, who carried all the Ladies before him: Or if that other Knight
of the same Nation had ever come to thy eares, whom I may call the
Knight of the <hi>high Scurrado,</hi> or the <hi>Spouting-Pestle,</hi> by name plaine <hi>Captaine
Iones?</hi> Certainly <hi>Bernardo Del Carpio</hi> (though of greatest esteeme with
thee) should not have been in the same leafe of the Book in the Diary and
Register of valiant men: Besides, this Nation (for I cannot give all Heroick
actions to the Spaniard) have produced names as high as <hi>Hercules.</hi> What
I pray was <hi>Chinon</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or the Foole transform'd? <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>

and <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> or that Cripple-errant of famous memory, who
stole the golden weather cocke from <hi>Pauls</hi> steeple, before it was a Tower,
which was the highest piece of desperate valour that ever was performed,
but that his piety is as notorious as his sacriledge, for with the same wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cocke, he built Cripple gate; which untill this day retaines his
name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rosinante a horse of labour and carriage.</hi>] I wonder, the Don being so neer
neighbour to the sunne, did not borrow some of his horses names, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they did most properly belong to the knight of the same name. He
chose rather by a figure, the nomination of his <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> and by a <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steron
Proteron</hi> (as we say in English) of putting <hi>the cart</hi> before the horse, he
succeeds very happy in the title, which in English makes not so high a
sound as in <hi>Spanish,</hi> but will doe indifferent, <hi>Latpackasad,</hi> being in senso
the very same, though not in sound with <hi>Rozinante,</hi> though our horses doe
not take their names for adventures, like the <hi>Dons,</hi> yet they have their names
from their presenters; if a friend bestow his horse, he passes his name with
him, &amp; by that means, the names of many worthy persons (who have not left
succession behind them) are continued in the race of their gifts. It would
be a pretty imployment (for there is little work now for Heralds) to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
those gentile horses coates. There is an able fat farrier herald, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
Northward, whom it would (being the trades are already met in
him) very excellently become, unto whom I leave it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>DON Quixot of the</hi> Mancha] It was as small a labell, and as modest, as
any Knight could first have vent red on into the world with; for lower mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Empire of <hi>Trapesonda,</hi> having shaken hands with their names,
and not retain'd so much as <hi>Don Quixot</hi> of <hi>Quixada,</hi> or <hi>Quesada,</hi> which was
rather a syncope or diminution to his name, being more at length natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
or rather literally, though in account lesse: some of our Nation
have accounted it more honourable to owne a bastardy, by assuming the
name of the Lord that gat them to an Annuity, then to hide their mothers
shame, under the plausible covert of their supposed Fathers.</p>

                        <hi>I am the Gyant</hi> Caro Culiambro] A very good name for a Gyant, but
I will tell you what will fill ones mouth as well, even one of our English
Gyants, as <hi>Sheildabrawne, Colarobrawne, Legomutton, Rasherobacon,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<hi>Ioneses</hi> of our times, the <hi>Marriots,</hi> the <hi>Woods,</hi> the <hi>Stubbinses,</hi> and

care not for the transposition of letters; I shall conclude this
Chapter with a reply of <hi>Don Gondamore,</hi> Country-man to our <hi>DON.
Condamore</hi> was talking in the Latine tongue with King <hi>Iames,</hi> and the
King speaking exactly, <hi>Gondamore</hi> tooke liberty to expresse as he pleased
whereupon the King not enduring the Peace should be so oft broke before

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND therefore acquainting no living creature with his
intentions</hi>] No living creature; it cannot be so, for
certainly <hi>Rosinante</hi> was of the counsell, and enjoin'd
much secrecy. For the <hi>Don</hi> might tell his tale to his horse
without danger of discovery, though he might heare
<hi>of his tale</hi> againe for it: (as the English proverbe hath it
in another expression.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He was not yet dubb'd Knight.</hi>] This was a horrible
scarre, and enough to have crush'd our cock of the game in the egg. It was
strange he did not instantly unsheath his owne sword, and crosse it over
his owne pate, and having impressed a Knighthood on his forgetfull
noddle, spoke the words himselfe, rise up <hi>DON Quixot,</hi> &amp;c. or what if
he had submitted, and falne on his knees to <hi>Rosinante</hi> (a horse formerly
of very good carriage,) the Brute could have done no lesse, then boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
immediately, and laid his hoofes upon his Helmet (which was as neer
his head, as they could come) and it might have passed, and the <hi>DON</hi>
ever after accounted himselfe of the <hi>Equestrian</hi> Order, which is the order
of Knighthood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As touching white Armour.</hi>] It is strange; <hi>once out</hi> and <hi>ever out:</hi> what
a mischance was this. Ã´ for a chalke hill! it would have whitened him and
<hi>Rosinante,</hi> as if they had been Knight and horse of the vail of white horse.
The first Knights that ever were heard of in white Armour, and on white
horses, were (as I take it) <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> who though they never shine
together in the Heavens, yet at one great battaile, wherein the <hi>Romans</hi>
got the victory, they were discovered to come into the field, and doe
wonderfull execution, and then vanish streight to their Orbs in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens:
and ever since, those mares that saw those white horses, have
had colts with starres in their heads.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He did parle with himselfe on this manner.</hi>] Of these kind of Soliloquies,
or selfe-discourses, you shall every where rather see then heare: what man
almost is it that you meet alone, if he be thoughtive or cogitabund, but
his lips, his eyes, his hands, goe as well as his legs. If one should, or could
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57130:11"/>
but spare his time, to observe the severall postures of passengers in the
street; he might after a little curiosity of intention, know most mens bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses
by the motion of their lips, and discover their intentions by the
signes in their faces: whether the businesse were matter of law, love, debt,
anger or jovialty. Such agreeable indications every face doth betray, that
in spight of the verse we may say, <hi>fronti summa Fides,</hi> every mans passions
are written in his forehead, and if women might be commanded to goe
unveil'd, much more would be knowne, then they would have willingly
discovered. It were very good policy in times of warre, suites, or jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
to learne to undecipher mouths, lookes, and gates; there is more to be
got out of them, then out of this extaticall speech of the <hi>Dons,</hi> to which
<hi>Rosinante</hi> prickt up his eares more from the sense of his sides, then the sense
in the oration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Written in the Annals of the</hi> Mancha.) The Annals of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> are
in as large a faire Foolio, as those of <hi>Goteham,</hi> and are kept in very safe
custodie, few Travellers have had the favour to see them; <hi>Tom Coriat</hi>
had a view, and to a wise man it is enough. It is very difficult now, unlesse
recommended from some great personage, to have admittance to the sight
of them: there must be two certificates at least, of the family of the <hi>We be
three,</hi> who are of the <hi>Quorum</hi> alwayes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There stood at the Inne by the door, two young women adventurers likewise.</hi>]
These I beleeve had been dubb'd and dubb'd againe, and had devises in their
Targets, for hotter adventures then ever the <hi>Don</hi> assaied; it was strange
that the <hi>Don,</hi> (but that strong imagination is irresistible) being <hi>gaunt,</hi> (not
<hi>Iohn a Gaunt</hi> I meane) but fasting, and therefore of more exquisite sense,
had not smelt out their profession from the evaporations of their saltpits:
or that <hi>Rosinante</hi> had not by a merry neighing, discovered the approaches
of two over-ridden jades. Their standing at the Inne door, was a sign of
themselves and the house, and (though they were bound for <hi>Sevil</hi>) that
their behaviour was not so.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Checking</hi> Rosinante <hi>with his bridle</hi>] <hi>Rosinantes</hi> head-strongnesse, is here
remarkable, and shewes that a beast knowes when he is weary or hungry,
better then his rider. These naturall offerings at an Inne door, gazings, and
head writhings, are most proper symptomes in the creature, of an appetite
or longing for Limb-ease, and tooth motion. A way bit then, and not a
bit of way more. The Knight (for all Knight errants, understand all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
whether vocall or naturall) apprehended <hi>Rosinante,</hi> and taking
pitty of the croakings of his empty guts, to which his owne some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
sympathetically answered. He spurr'd up to the Inne door, full up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Donsellas;</hi> which Item, <hi>Rosinante</hi> tooke the more patiently, because
he was within the comfortable smell of provender: but O the hogheards
horne! 'twas an ill winde, and blew no body good; for by this meanes it
came to passe, that <hi>Rosinante</hi> must heare the other speech, which came
from a head as empty as his belly, in which was nothing but wind, just both
alike.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Discovering his withered and dusty countenance</hi>] This souldier-like visage
of the <hi>Dons,</hi> brought the <hi>Donzellas</hi> to a stand. <hi>Ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Vulcan</hi> for his lame leg, as she was enamor'd of <hi>Mars</hi> for his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57130:11"/>
(whose opinion being asked concerning a very beautifull and streight
limb'd gentleman Usher, how shee liked the owner of that face) that shee
replyed thus presently, (Ladies wits being best upon the sodaine,) Pish,
what doe you tell me of a face; I say, a <hi>Venus</hi> face, and <hi>Mars</hi> his trunche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
never met together in the same person.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They could not containe their laughter</hi>] Continence was rare in any thing,
as wel as laughter with them, yet their rude carriage, shewed that they were
tender hearted; for they had been of very hard hearts, if they could not
have laughed at him, and I believe, had the <hi>Don</hi> made experience, he
would have found them thorow good natur'd, and as ready to lye downe
as to laugh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mine Host, a man of exceeding fatnesse.</hi>] I did not think that mine Hosts
of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> or indeed of any place of <hi>Spaine,</hi> had been of such vast di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,
certainly he was transported out of <hi>Holland,</hi> or great <hi>Britany;</hi>
this is the first <hi>Rhodomont ado</hi> in <hi>Re</hi> that I have met with; but yet conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to be of the <hi>Commark</hi> of St <hi>Lucars,</hi> and no lesse theevish then <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
if he stole and eat as much provision as that beast-robber did, his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
is no wonder. Allow us but in <hi>Spaine</hi> the beasts, and I will grant
the Host a thiefe, and as fat: untill then I suspend my beliefe.</p>
                     <p>Rozinante, <hi>one of the best pieces that ever eate bread.</hi>] Mine Host viewed
the Brute very narrowly (as if he meant to buy him) he need not have
gone round him, to his great paines; for the horse was transparent, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a beast that had never eat a piece of bread, then as the <hi>Don</hi> expressed
it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The strangest and most pleasing figure to behold.</hi>] It was well that the <hi>Don</hi>
was pleased to tell his name, for by his face they should never have known
him; his Helmet being on, he was a hard head, and when that was off, he was
a Cods-head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And then the valour of mine arme shall discover.</hi>] The valour of that part,
was not the thing his courteous undressers expected, who rather wished
him steel to the back, then as it fell out to be to his head. It was impossible
to salute him without losse of teeth; this sad apprehension of their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
defraudings, made them melancholly at present, but they are resolved,
since they can make him no sport, to make sport of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>One of the Ladies served his turne in that.</hi>] She was enforced to <hi>Caw</hi> him,
as they doe young <hi>Iack dowes,</hi> and every bit she administred, he gap'd full
wide, as the Helmet would let him; which if it had not streigthned (and that
very much) the widenesse and capacities of his jawes, the poor <hi>Iohns</hi>
would have past whole without slicing, and with more ease down his
throat then a cormorant dispatches <hi>Minnows.</hi>

of <hi>Rosinantes</hi> own or during (for It was in the stable.) It was well the

                        <hi>Mine Host as was noted before was a great Gyber.</hi>] It is ordinary for Hosts
to be khavishly witty, the latter being a set-off to the former. Much of a
reckoning goes current sor the Drolery of the maker of the Bill. There is
a kind of Leachery in neat and ingenious cozenage. It doth find mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Judge, and applause amongst most, but this was a great Giber, but
not so great as to lose a friend for a jest, that was the way to undo himselfe,
no, no, the Authors Counsell runs upon his Corpulency, just as one said of

This order of Knight errantry is very ancient, when there were but three

Knights Bannerets, Knights Templars, Knights of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Knights of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi>
and Knights of the Post, which two last were very much like the

called <hi>Sympathy,</hi> now crumbled into a Powder, the wound was healed,

Some thrifty Sirs have thus conveighed their Brutes, and their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender,
and for dispatch sake, having far to ride, to avoid the turmoile of
Innes, Hosts, Chamberlaines, and Ostlers, have made choise of a greene
grasse-plat, and joyn'd Commons, the same parcht pease sufficing for two
Creatures at once, the rationall, and irrationall. But this device (as subtle
as it was) hath met with misfortunes, for one more frugall than otherwise,
having at his Inne at night (for the device is but for a day-shift) left some
inconsiderable snip of a craggy rack of mutton, gave order to his man by a
winck (which was his usuall way to have his miserable commands execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
to cloak-bag the slender residue, whither also his over-provident ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
(to please his Master) poured in the remaines of the pottage, and so
made up a full adage of Parsimony.</p>

owne armes, more Dragon in them farre, then out; but more watchfull
out, then in them, for he often slept on horseback. Now like a poor
snake, but yet cristed still (though stript) he doth attend the Cisterne,
mounting himselfe, and hissing furiously at any thing that comes neer; that
hissing he had not learnt of the snakes, but of some other creature (as
watchfull) who sav'd sometime the Capitoll. He is now in this posture,
both St <hi>George,</hi> and Dragon too.</p>

that of St <hi>George</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and most earnestly and often, even to the

such a terror into his landlord, that he left the place; and the painter not

(whence, by the way, Beere first learned to run a tilt) she would, no doubt,
have said as much for <hi>Rosinante</hi> as the Dray-horse in his full careere, that he

you see the shapes of Men, Lyons, Horses, and other
strange creatures; so by the light of this Book-bonefire (as
plaine as <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices</hi> in their flames were seen figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
did visibly apprehend, he saw the most desperate Tourney that ever
was performed by Knights, which raised his valourous soule from his bed
to action: depriv'd he is, stout heart, of armes all, but his naturall; his

in so many despicable pieces, not fit to make nailes of, yet thus bereft, only

as I knew one, who being soundly doz'd, had the charity of his conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
to buttresse him up from the Inne to his chamber, where like my
<hi>Don,</hi> he took quiet repose for two or three houres, after he awakes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerably
dry, and inflam'd i'th throat, roar'd out and stampt (supposing he
had been at the Inne, not in his chamber) for the Tapster, whom loudly
and often he call'd for, crying, I burne, I burne, Canns you rogue, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of delay, threatens to fetch him with another Alarum, which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
he puts in execution, and stormes his owne glasse windowes so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
with bedstaves, old shooes, and the like weapons, that he made a
breach big enough, out of which he might have throwne the room after:
And had not one of his fellow Collegioners pass'd by, and reconcil'd him
to his windowes, the actions of battery would have been so chargeable,
that his whole yeares pension would scarce have paid for the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                        <hi>His lines, pronounced by himselfe, doe ravish the hearers.</hi>] Just as much I
believe, as when a Greek Oration (spoke excellently well by a boy, who
stood for Election, but made by his Master) wrought upon one of the chiefe
of the company, who commended the boy that spoke the Greek so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
that the Electioners (which were Scholars) induc'd by his excessive
liking of that tongue, desired to know, how long he had been skill'd
therein, and he answered <hi>bona Fide,</hi> 'twas well he had so much Latine,
that he understood not a tittle of it, but he lik't it, because it sounded brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
It is indeed a brave language, for a man of a full mouth, a large tongue,
and wide jaws, which are good marks for a horse too, (for there is roome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for their breath to play, and 'tis a sign also of a noble heat in any
creature, where the parts are not too unproportionably extended.)</p>

                     <p>I have heard, that the Poets of the Fortune and red Bull, had alwayes a
mouth-measure for their Actors (who were terrible teare-throats) and
made their lines proportionable to their compasse, which were <hi>sesquipeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
a foot and a halfe.</p>

Sejanus.</hi> Downe goes <hi>Retont</hi> and <hi>Pellican, Sericon</hi> and <hi>Bufo.</hi> If these
books had been old shirts, much might have been sav'd in tinder, enough
I believe, to have serv'd the <hi>Mancha,</hi> till the Resurrection: But paper,
though it be made of rags, is the most unprofitable of all things set on fire.
Nay, I think, that out of the ashes of these monumentall Histories, it were
impossible, ever by the labour of <hi>Alchymie,</hi> to recover the resemblances of
the principles, whence they came, nay, not so much as the figure of the
pot, which in most Quires is very visible. Otherwise, the <hi>Don</hi> no doubt,
for the love he bare these Authors, would have made that his first adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and might have been as famous upon Record, for Chymicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
as he is at this day, for Heroick undertakings.</p>

                        <hi>The Barber opened a book, call'd the teares of</hi> Angelica.] One act of grace
yet, <hi>Angelicas</hi> teares would have extinguish'd the fire, and therefore were
kept out, but without doubt, the true reason, why the Curate and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
were induced to save it, was this; they both were good fellows, and
looking downe upon their bestript doublets and skirts, spar'd the teares of
<hi>Angelica,</hi> for the teares of the tankard, wherein both were drencht.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In good sooth, Lord Arch-Bishop</hi> Turpin.] Such strange impressions makes
strong fancies, and works not onely upon women wonderfull effects, but
even the most masculine spirits have been (as well as our <hi>Don</hi>) shrewdly
tainted with it. A Gentleman importun'd, at a fire-night in the publike
Hall, to accept the high and mightie place of a mock-Emperour, which
was duely conferred upon him, by seven mock-Electors at the same time,
with much wit and Ceremony; The Emperour ascended his chair of state,
which was plac't upon the highest table in the Hall, and at his instalment,
all Pomp, Reverence, and signes of homage, were used by the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57130:20"/>
Insomuch that our Emperour (having a spice of self-conceit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was soundly peppered now) for he was instantly Metamorphoz'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the stateliest, gravest and commanding soule, that ever eye beheld. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>

pace, his look, his voice, and all his garb was alter'd. <hi>Alexander</hi> upon his
Elephant, nay, upon the Castle upon that Elephant, was not so high, and
so close did this imaginary honour stick to his fancy, that for many yeares
he could not shake off this One nights assumed deportments, untill the
times came, that drove all Monarchicall imaginations out, not only of his
head, but every ones.</p>

                        <hi>He call'd for his breakfast, which was presently brought.</hi>] This Barber,
I perceive was no Barber Chirurgion; nor the Curate himselfe any great
observer of Lent, Ember weeks, or other fasting dayes, else they would
have kept him fasting, according to the dyet of Bedlam, which was the
only way to allay his fighting spirit, which being ever and anon supplyed
by the fumes of bak'd pudding, and his body blowne up with flatulent
meat, such as pease-pottage, radishes, and on yons made, such dangerous
recruits in him, that without prayers and spare dyet, it was impossible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcize

                        <hi>The plot was to change his Chamber, and damm up his study.</hi>] This delusion
of his Chamber, was good, <hi>pro tempore.</hi> I knew a humorous Cook in
<hi>Oxon,</hi> so given to shift and alter doors in his house, that one morning early,
he chang'd the door belonging to a paire of stairs, which went to one of his
Lodgers chambers; who not knowing of this alteration, run down hastily
(as at other times) and found his head stuck in a new mud wall, which
did so confound him (going about some other necessary businesse) that by
reason of the forcible detainer, it was a great question, whether he was
in more morter, above or below. Of the like losse of a study, it is certaine,
that a scholar call'd somewhat hastily from the place to a friend, who had
brought some token to him, left his door wide open, and making merry
somewhat late, return'd at night, and resolved to have candle, (though his
head was light enough, he passed by his study-door, and came to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

(awakened with the noyse he made) recovered him to, and
having put the door into his hand with much adoe, was perswaded to lock
it up, and secure the Study better against morning.</p>

                     <p>Sancho Pancha <hi>rode on his beast like a Patriarch.</hi>] whether the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Patriarchs rode so, (I meane those before the flood) is very difficult to
prove. Asses indeed, were then much in use, but for the Wallers, unlesse it
were in the great famine, when they went down to <hi>Aegypt</hi> to buy food, I find
not example for it; I am sure our Moderne Patriarchs doe not so, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> not so, nor of <hi>Alexandria</hi> so, nor his Holinesse
Papatriarch so, nor the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> so. The <hi>Mule,</hi> and glorious
Foot-cloath-pages, and Harbingers, are all too little for these Patriarchs;
yet these are governours of more then Ilands, what <hi>Sancho</hi> will do when he
is in honour, noman knowes.</p>
                     <p>Joan Gutierez <hi>my wife become a Queen.] Ioan</hi> was a great damp to the
high thoughts of <hi>Sancho.</hi> For a man of his expectations to be depressed with
a slut, a whore, or a fool (or it may be all at once in one) was an intollerable
weight. A dung boat sunck in a shallow, where a wherry is to passe, lies so

It cals to mind, a story of a poor, but simple woman, who for want of a
graine or two of discretion, lost her husband the highest advantages of the
World that ever was. For the good man had so spent his time in true and
honest paines, contented and not murmuring, that Fortune seem'd to smile
upon him, as oft as he came to worship at her Temple, whither he oft
resorted; the gracious looks of the Goddesse encouraged him to aske
something more then before he used, &amp; yet considering with himselfe, that
too bold a votary might be repuls'd, he modestly bounded his request with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57130:21"/>
sure, that her goodnesse would conferre three wishes upon 'um, which
from the Oracle was answered; <hi>Ratify'd; Wish, and be happy.</hi> The joyfull
man acquainted his wife strait, who having been the constant companion
of his labours, was meet to share in his good fortunes; but shee was just
such another Niddecook as <hi>Ioan Gutierez,</hi> and the first thing shee desired
her husband, was, that one of these wishes, might be left to her disposall.
The good old man, willing to gratifie her, said, yea Love, one I will spare
thee: So to the Faire they came, whither they were bound, and the woman
casting her eyes round about, to see what she should make the choyce of
her wish, at last, (remembring what shee wanted at home) spied a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
wooden ladle, which shee forthwith wish'd for, and as soon the
thing was in her hand, which her husband seeing and impatient at the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
of the first wish, wroth with his wife for her simplicity, wished
the Ladle in her breech, which out of hand was instantly there. But the
poor woman (like a fly with a straw in the same place) was so tormented,
besides the shame, that she desired her husband, that as he ever hop'd to
partake of the delights of the opposite place, he would remove this impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment,
to which the uxorious man condiscended, and in charity to his
wife, wish'd it out againe. So all the three wishes went in and out with a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>

by no meanes of straining his neck, or shifting his port-holes could receive
any articular sound or sentence, which troubled him much, but so much
the more, when he espied him, and farther off than he stood, one taking
notes very swift in short hand: Whereupon he removed his station, and
thought philosophically, that some angles of the Church might carry the
voice to that place by his circular concaves, whither when he came, he was
as unable to heare as before. He beheld himselfe, and Sermon-Writer, and
did not know which most to wonder at, his own deafenesse, or the fellows
acutenesse. At last he asked the <hi>Brachygrapher,</hi> whether he wrote the notes
of that Sermon, or something of his own conception? Yea (good Sir) said
<hi>Stenography,</hi> the words of the Teacher in truth; The other replied, it was
impossible, for I have stood by thee some while, and but even now a yard
or two nearer to the Minister, and cannot heare a syllable; That may be,
said the Scribler, unlesse you have sanctified eares. So it may be the Don
had his eyes sanctified, and happily then (though unhappily here) he might
discerne Windmills for Giants. But yet <hi>Sancho's</hi> eyes for me, which in time

than the assault: His prayers were short and home; God blesse me, and my
children all three, and <hi>Ione</hi> from above th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not the Knight to give this liberty to his Squire, nor the Squire to
take it, who was not to be upon his knees when the <hi>Don</hi> was upon the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.
But 'twas his first entrance; and though <hi>Sancho</hi> did not what was soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierlike,
yet he obeyed orders, and therein he is excusable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>With this the wind encreased, and the sailes turn'd about.</hi>] Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the danger of their turning, the <hi>Don</hi> scorn'd the motion, and assailes
them, and no doubt had <hi>Rosinante</hi> been a Mill-horse, as his Master by one
attribute was a Miller, they had carried the businesse round; but here the
Mill had the better, for their want of experience only in such fights, for the
<hi>Don</hi> should not have grappled here, but charg'd at distance, and letting alone
his trusty Launce should have ventred on with lighted linkes, and then he
had made cleare way to his victory, and having fired the sailes had also
fired the Castle, and <hi>Cacus</hi> in it, where if there had been as much dough as
meale, the same fire would have made him and <hi>Sancho</hi> Cakes enough for
their Wallet, and the Mill should have been the Oven; but those that ever
saw the Picture of falling <hi>Icarus,</hi> may guesse the condition of our <hi>Don,</hi> who
fell not into any sea, that afterwards bare his name, but with a sound
Thump he fell to the Earth, who bare his body; his mother had hop'd he
would have returned to her as she gave him to the World, but he falls a
<hi>Centaure,</hi> who came forth a man, and a heavy burden he was, as ever lay
upon a Grand-mothers back.</p>
                     <p>Sancho <hi>comes to his succour as fast as the Asse would drive.</hi>] Poore <hi>Sancho</hi>
laments the windfall his Master, and was gathering him up like a bruised
Codling Apple a little corrupted on the Leiger side. I know not whether
from this eminent misfortune that befell the <hi>Dons</hi> Windmils, since have been
made to go to the Left, in memory of this dishonourable usage. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
hath escaped the learned Author of the Vulgar errours, and I will
not undertake the decision.</p>

                        <hi>Diego Peres of Vargas.</hi>] This Knight from his successe against the Moores
gotten with an Arme of an Oake, was sirnamed <hi>Machusa,</hi> which signifies
with us <hi>Iohn an Oakes;</hi> and our <hi>Don</hi> (or if <hi>Sancho</hi> had the braines, for the
Squires were whim'd in the whiske) might very well from that encounter
have stil'd himself a Knight of <hi>Millan.</hi> So <hi>Scipio</hi> from his victory against <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
was called <hi>Africanus,</hi> and the <hi>Caesars</hi> surnamed from their Successes,
<hi>Almanicus, Gothicus, Britannicus, Germanicus, Dacicus,</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> for other
exploits, was called <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        <hi>Dackins</hi> of all the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
And no doubt but <hi>Sancho,</hi> if he had skill in the Latine, would have
call'd him <hi>Querceticus</hi> of the <hi>Mancha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Don Quixot <hi>could not forbeare laughing, hearing the simplicity of his Squire</hi>]
This is the first symptome, whereby 'tis guess'd the Don to be rational, that he
could laugh. The Query of <hi>Sancho's</hi> was very provident. For <hi>Sancho</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now two capacities, the one personall, and the other <hi>Squire erranticall,</hi>
'twas very well worth the enquiry to know in which of those two he should
suffer. For if the Squires Arme, Leg, or Neck were broke, it made no
matter, so that <hi>Sancho Pancha</hi> were a whole man (as they say.) But the
Knight did state the Question in the Affirmative, that the Bodies of <hi>Squire-Errants,</hi>
and <hi>Knight-Errants,</hi> likewise, do suffer personally (as Witches in
their Bodies suffer for the harmes of the shapes of Cats, Dogs, Hares, or
any Creatures else they assume) For <hi>Errantry</hi> is but a nobler kind of Incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Witchcraft <hi>sans</hi> question, and therefore <hi>Ã  simili</hi> 'tis subject to
the same Inconveniencies. Our Knight (who was none of the wisest) expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
knew (which is the surest knowledge of all, but not the safest,)
that when the <hi>Knight-Errant</hi> was in the aire, that <hi>Don Quixot</hi> was there
also, and when he and <hi>Rosinante</hi> come with a squash to the ground, that the
<hi>Squire-Errant</hi> was then Couchant in a field Greene, Nose Gules, and
Sides and Back azure: and so you may state the Question for Personall
or Politique capacities, if you hurt one you hurt both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then</hi> Sancho <hi>said unto him, it was dinner time.] Sancho</hi> could not looke
on the one side him, but the Wallet did <hi>Item</hi> him, such memento's he lik'd
very well; a fall too, rather than a fall from the Windmill; but the <hi>Don</hi>
had not maw to victuals, having not yet disgested his Feast of fresh aire,
which almost turned him into a <hi>Camaelion.</hi> But he that travels with a Cane
that will hold Sack (for such there are as well as Sugar Canes) may go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than one with a firme Staffe, this is better to jumpe with, or leane on,
but for a great journey I would relie on the other. The Bottle and the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
are two good Companions; and as he rode, it was in <hi>Persian</hi> state, for
the ends of the Wallet being of each side, <hi>Sancho</hi> possessed the middle place
(which in those Easterne Countries) is of highest honour. The Bottle <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
often advanceth to his nose, which raised his eyes to heaven, which he
seldome so devoutly looked on, as in that posture, and by that meanes he
often called to remembrance that there was something above him.</p>
                     <l>So <hi>Cyrus</hi> on a Dromedary rod,</l>
                     <l>Adoring, like to Sancho, his Warm'd God.</l>

                        <hi>He tore an Oake and set on the Iron of his own.</hi>] It was strange that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
did not alight and set on the Iron, but permit his Master to doe it. But
hence you may gather, that <hi>Knight-Errants</hi> as they are of all Countries,
and all Languages, so they are of all Trades; They take it from the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

                        <hi>Thou must not assist me, unlesse those that assault me be base and Vulgar people</hi>]
Very easie Indentures these of a <hi>Squire-errant;</hi> and yet had they been given
sooner, <hi>Sancho</hi> was, by his Conditions, to have run the same danger with his
Master at the encounter of the Windmils: For what more base Castle than
a Mill? And what more vile Rogue than the pilfering Giant in it? But
<hi>Sancho</hi> was not dub'd, and therefore was excusable, and never meant to be,
and therefore would for ever be excused. Nor did <hi>

make tryall of his Squires personall valour before they mounted, as a
Knight in our Country (but not of that Order) did, who having dealt with
a Master of the noble science of defence for his Usher of the Schoole, whom
he obtained from him for a summe of money, before he came to his owne
seat rode to a City, where he was acquainted with a huge <hi>Bravo</hi> in that
Art, unto whom he repaired, and told him, that he had got a young pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to the tacticks, and desired that he would be pleased to try what
mettall he was made of; the Tryer, looking very disdainefully upon the
young man, (as <hi>Goliath</hi> upon little <hi>David</hi>) went forthwith to the Schoole,
where having chose the weapons, to it they fell, the Tryer bidding him
<hi>Guartha,</hi> and be carefull, for he should give him cause to know, that he
met a man of skill; the Usher lay purposely open, and unguarded, and the
other spying the advantage gave him a brush, whereat he vapoured ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely,
shaking his head at the fellows unexperiencednesse; whereupon
the Usher gathered up his skill and mettle at once, and gives his Trier such
a wipe o'r the shins, that he made him make a Leg for't, though not in
Courtship; and presently retires to the Knight, and swore, 'Tis a pretty
fellow, there's hopes of him: Anon the Usher gives him a shrewd swap on
the very end of the elbow, which he rub'd likewise in his commendations,
and said, 'Tis a very pretty fellow i' faith. By and by the Probationer with
quick returnes laid his Trier o'r the sides, legs, and pate, all in an instant,
whereupon he threw away his Weapon, and sware to the Knight, He is
for your turne Sir, 'Tis a question whether his Tongue or head ran faster in
his commendation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Do you not see Sir (said</hi> Sancho) <hi>that these are Friers of Saint</hi> Bennets <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>]
The <hi>Don</hi> (contrary to the advice of <hi>Sancho</hi>) attempts this more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
adventure; for the Windmils could only grind the body, but these
Friers the Purse. That Coate is higher priz'd in <hi>Spaine</hi> than in <hi>England,</hi>
where it was five pound a blow, and the <hi>Don</hi> being a nimble striker, how
soone might the revenew of the <hi>Mancha</hi> have been thrash'd out upon one
of their Canonicall Coates? Besides the danger of the Inquisition, which
<hi>Sancho</hi> dreaded as hell, where no Wallet would be admitted, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of good Sack for ever to be banished, Bread and Water unto <hi>Sancho!</hi>
the Furies were not worse Torment to him than the latter of them, for which
cause he was very glad the World should ne'r be drown'd againe; for of
all deaths he hated it, and like <hi>Ovid,</hi> not with him, was used to cry out,

videt id Manticae quod in tergo est?</hi> Yes, <hi>Sancho</hi> had seen <hi>Cappuchines,</hi> and
knew where their Wallets were, where the stock lay, no paddee to a
Trooper, so expert; and now you see the chiefe of <hi>Sancho's</hi> service, he was
for the plunder, the Squire for the bag, the Knight for the baggage, for
he is with the <hi>Biscaine</hi> Lady, while his Squire made an adventure indeed,
of robbery, but was taken in the fact, and having two unmercifull Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Judges (for they were all) two heavy fisted Lackeys, never was
horse so curryed, betwixt two Northern Jockies, as <hi>Sancho</hi> was. <hi>Sancho</hi>
pleaded well, that they were lawfull prize by law of Armes, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
knaves (not knowne to Civill Courts) used him very barbarously,
nay, no Barber would have serv'd him so, (though he had often gon away
trimm'd for nothing) they grubb'd up his reverend haires by the roots, and
left his chin as bare, as a pull'd hens rump. In ten yeares travels they came
not againe; so that <hi>Ioan</hi> at his return, thought him made young againe,
and had they grubb'd downward, and a like growth come there also, it
might have passed for a very good Metamorphosis. The <hi>Monk</hi> all this while
(though he had his, <hi>Thou shalt not steale for</hi> Sancho) not remembring his
Lackeyes of the other precept (which was very neer violating, for
<hi>Sancho</hi> was breathlesse, and that is as good as dead,) got to his horse, and
with a greater speed (then he rode to be admitted into the <hi>Monastery</hi>) made
away, and left poor <hi>Sancho</hi> in pate and beard a <hi>Monke,</hi> but of the order of
the <hi>Maledictines.</hi>

                        <hi>Get thee away Knight in an ill hour, or I will kill thee,</hi>] This <hi>Biscainer</hi> was
a <hi>Castrill,</hi> a very Foighter, and no doubt, but the Pusses in the Coach,
were his sisters. But the <hi>Don</hi> recounting with himselfe (notwithstanding that
he swore damnably, he would kill him) the infallibility of his security in
being <hi>Knight-Errant,</hi> that it was impossible to be ever out-right killed, he
made bold to throw the Caytiffe in his face, which was the greatest affront
to a <hi>Biscainer</hi> (who is <hi>terrÃ¢ marique,</hi> a gentleman) that could be offered.
Had the <hi>Biscaine</hi> been tossed as our <hi>Don</hi> was by the Windmill, and a little
higher in <hi>concavum Lunae,</hi> no doubt but he had been a gentleman by all
the four Elements. Two such high spirits are now met, and more impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
then <hi>Clinias</hi> and <hi>Dametas.</hi> The Author leaves us uncertaine of the

like an <hi>Istmos</hi> or <hi>Peninsula,</hi> which dividing two enraged seas
by her naturall interposition, keeps them from emboguing or
praecipitating one into the other. Otherwise, <hi>Ionium Aegeo frangit

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57130:24"/>
Combatants by their metall, like Stags and stonehorses. For as on each side
of an <hi>Istmos,</hi> by the iterated beatings and rebeatings of the waters, the froth

at top about the shoar: So every where did appeare upon this <hi>Pharsalian</hi>

Boars, or blowne <hi>Mastiffs,</hi> whose rage had curded one anothers chops, that
had they been milk-sops, they might have din'd from one anothers face, nor

and sweats, they were laundred and ladder'd; had there been water
by, as there was land enough, they might have very well serv'd for the

                        <hi>The Author leaving no notice, where we might find the rest of the narration.</hi>]
This a <hi>Spanish</hi> quirk, a maze of the Authors owne making, as intricate as
his braines, to puzzle and with-hold the inflamed Reader, whom he would
make believe, for the dignity and antiquity of his History, that it came
from <hi>Arabian</hi> head and language, and was translated by an <hi>Hebraean;</hi>
But I am cleare of another opinion, though I like his invention well,
and
<q>Facile est addere.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I shall put my conceit upon the judgement of the World, which
of the two they thinke most probable. Therefore I conjecture that this
story of <hi>Quixot,</hi> with many more eminent <hi>Opuscula</hi> of that nature, were
all preserv'd in that famous and wonderfull hollow tooth of <hi>Garagantua,</hi>
from the irruptions of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the <hi>Barbarismes</hi> of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> cruelty: which said tooth, <hi>Iohn Pontaeus,</hi> his <hi>Ter-quaterque retro-Tritavus</hi>
descended into, by the assistance of a Colledge of Physitians (for
there was room enough) and Chirurgions also, with all those huge engines,
tooth-pick-axes, tooth-mattocks, and all manner of mouth-Pionery, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for the scouring, cleansing, and purging of that stupendious concavity.
In the rubbish of that vast <hi>Hiatus,</hi> were these two Volumes of the <hi>Don</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
safe and unperisht; which how they came thither, will be the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thing to make good: But it is of no such difficulty to salve the scruple.
For that exceeding Gyant being troubled with no small paine in his tooth,
called the <hi>Hodontalgia,</hi> it caused such a <hi>vacuum</hi> in the place, that so much
wind had gathered thither, as it was enough (as out of <hi>Aelus</hi> cavernes)
from thence at any time to have caus'd a tempest; wherefore from all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there were helps and councels call'd, and when stopping of it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
upon, they thought not at the instant, with what to doe it, (mens
braines being not alwaies ready for every punctilio) but then finding what
an intollerable charge it would amount to in Cotton-wooll, Linnen or
Canvas, they thought it best, (and best cheape) to doe it with wast paper,
which was approved on, and the Gyant willing to save his purse, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to it: So all the Pamphlets then extant, all Romancees, English,

as our Irish women use to go laden (who without all question were vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins)
at their backs: Which cals to mind, a story of a Foot <hi>Knight-Errant</hi>
of our Land, who was much given to take the pleasure of the Woods in
the Summer time, and especially that time of it, when nuts are in season;
into the thicket, where he was used to adventure, came a very faire Lady of
goodly stature, rare and flowing haire, and of good carriage (for she had
two barnes bound fast to her:) the melancholy Knight viewing her, was
amaz'd at her rich beauty and poor clothes, at her light ordering her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternes,
and heavy burthen at her back, and calling the Lady to him, ask't
her, whence, and who she was, she told him, one whom misfortunes had
sent into England sor reliefe; yea said the gentleman, that thou shalt not
want, and presently gave her a piece of mony, the Lady bowed her selfe
and her family to him, and as she was praying God to blesse him, he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her to spare that, and stay a little with him, and presently requested
her to take the pleasure of the place, and shee should have better chaffer
then nuts; which the Lady apprehensive enough, was willing to entertain,
but told him the disconvenience of obtaining his purpose, whilst those
weights and impediments were tyed to her, we will unloose them, said
(<hi>Sr Solitary</hi>) nay said the Lady, but if they be unfastened, they will cry
for meat, and laid aside without it, keep such a noise, that may call in
spectators more then we desire. Come said (<hi>Sr Solitary</hi>) that all may be
secure, fasten the barnes to my back, and I shall be (as you shall order it) as
good as a cradle to them. The Lady lik'd his pregnant fancy, and presently
unwhitled, and swathed them to her Paramor, who was no sooner fast, but
he was desirous to be loose, and when he prepar'd himselfe to beat the Tree,
the Lady vanish'd with such speed, that he running (with weight) was not
able to overtake his flying <hi>Daphne;</hi> and too farre he durst not follow, for
feare of discovery: now he tryed to ease himselfe of his charge, but the
cunning Lady had fastened the whittles so equally behind, that his hands
could not reach the knots, and while they were in the amorous embraces,
shee withdrew with his mony, all injurious weapons from him, so that his
knife, which would have decided this Gordian knot, was stolne. The
Gentleman reflected upon himselfe, and both sorry, and asham'd of the
action, that he might take heed for the future, and satisfie for what was
past, made hast toward night to his Towne, accoutred as he was, and at a
Tenants house dismantles himselfe, telling her the story, and giving her
charge to see the brats well brought up, which was a piece of gallant <hi>Foot-Errantry;</hi>
and so what was intended Lechery, prov'd an act of excellent
charity.</p>

two short stories in our owne Country: where a Gentleman having invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

such cheer as was seasonable, the Collops and Eggs, and as it fell out, (a
Hogg being slaine) shee had a service of the puddings, which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
commended by the guests; Nay, said the Gentleman, friends be

but true story I shall tell you of the effects of some of it. A Lady fell asleep
(as many do) with needles and pins in her mouth, which she unhappily swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd:
great care there was to preserve her; Physitians from the four corners
are called, and a Regiment of Apothecaries &amp; Chirurgions; For her Knight
terribly afriad of intestine turn-pikes, could not rest, till some remedy was
found out. A councell was had, and no conclusive result; at last a little
<hi>Paracelsian</hi> Apothecary Clyster-high, advised to make a Clyster with three
hundred ingredients, which you may read in the <hi>Pharmacopoea</hi> (translated
or not translated) but the chiefe <hi>praedominator</hi> in the businesse, was to be
two graines of <hi>pulvis magneticus,</hi> powder of Loadstone, which having the
<hi>Misceatur</hi> and <hi>Condiatur</hi> by direction, was administred unto the Lady
by the <hi>Pigmy Minos</hi> (drest up like a Gentilewoman) for more modestyes
sake, which wrought so appositely and sympathetically, that the occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Loadstone, presently exerted and shot out their vertues through
the body of the patient so vigorously, that at last they fastened upon the
needle, which was attracted with a powder, the other impulsives helping
to the <hi>qua data porta,</hi> and in such an instant of time, that little <hi>Minos</hi> could
recover himselfe from the storme of her Ladyships Posternegate, which
stream'd and issued so furiously, that my Apothecaries face was stuck like
a pinne-cushion, and the needle stuck, was in his nose cleer and untainted,

Goates flesh.</hi>] Here is <hi>Aesops Fable</hi> of the two Hounds, mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
in the Squire and the <hi>Don.</hi> Hound <hi>Sancho</hi> was for the
Kettle, Hound <hi>Quixot</hi> for the Field, Orations, or Musick; but
<hi>Sancho</hi> as he had a tun belly by nature given him, so he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much given to the belly, which being of that measure, was not easily fill'd.
Such a servant was never advis'd to his Master by <hi>Marriot.</hi> But although
the <hi>Don</hi> could have been contented with the fresh services of <hi>Madam Aura,</hi>
for which he opened as constantly, as an Oyster against tide; Yet the Knights
of the Mountaines obtained this favour of their younger brother of
the Hils and Dales, that he would vouchsafe his company to such cheer
as they had; which Goat-provision were most agreeable with their
<hi>Errant</hi> bodies, which were alwaies saltitant, passant or currant, sometime
volant, sometimes after a Windmill, or so, couchant. <hi>Omne simile
nutritur Ã  simili,</hi> which is the reason that swines flesh, (which most
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57130:29"/>
inwardly of all creatures resembles his master) is so nutritive and apposite,
unlesse to old Jewry men, or <hi>Scots.</hi> I belive <hi>Sancho</hi> and his Master, fed
most upon Goates countenance, the head boil'd in haire, being as rare and
choyce meat, as Lambs head in the wool; very good dyet, and the most
successfull for any that are troubled with a <hi>desperatio Barbae,</hi> beyond your
unguents, or whatsoever else is given to dilate the pores of the place:
'Tis true, 'tis somewhat rough at going downe and untoothsome, but I told
you before, it is not for the teeth or palat, but the chinne, though a pallat
of Mo-haire is very good lodging (I take it;) now you know the attractive
facultie is implanted in every part, ad every part drawes, and every part,
(as the learned say) <hi>agglutinates,</hi> and <hi>assimilates,</hi> and then the work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is done, so that the chinne, the cheeks, the boscos, and suboscos (I
mean,) the dulapes and the jawy part of the face, know what they have
to doe, and what thatch is best for that place: And it is very well known,
that ever after this entertainment, and the next day, <hi>Sancho's</hi> face moss'd,
and his chinne had a down sprung out, substantiall enough to grate a nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg.
The <hi>Don</hi> had a Philosophers Aspect, wih an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

circular, which were a great grace to his countenance Martiall. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
was a most grosse feeder, and you might smell much of his dyer, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
from under his Arme pits, which reak'd upon motion like a lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill,
and by this dyet, gave a stronger Hogo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And spreading certaine sheep-skins.</hi>] Those sheep-skin coverings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
infringement of his oath, the <hi>Don</hi> might endure at his table; it was
agreeable with the chief head at board, and the bottome of the trough was
sutable to a knight in pennance, and in pilgrimage for a new Helmet; the
horne cup, if it had been large enough, would very well have supplyed
the defect, and became the <hi>Don</hi> better then the cushion did the <hi>Biscaine.</hi>

                        <hi>The same is said of Chivalry that is said of Love, that it makes all equall.</hi>
Love and danger are very glutinous, and of a sodering and associating na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
if two love one another, it is very probable they will lie together;
and so for quarrelling, if two fall out, they will presently fall in, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the eares; <hi>Contrariorum eadem est Ratio.</hi> So here, extreame love
of <hi>Sancho's</hi> person made his sides-man with his Master, love is a leveller,
for laugh (which is a but a variation for love) and ly down, and Chivalry
do's so too, lay all before it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I doe here renounce from this time to the worlds end.</hi>] It was not modesty
in this duck-legs, that made him refuse the Table-fellowship with his
Master, but only feare of starving. For the Knight was but a small feeder,
and <hi>Sancho</hi> durst not gormandize, and guttle and guzzle too (for he would
doe both) under his Master's nose, as he us'd to doe at the side Table or
the Cupboard. It is a good house-policy, and piece of great frugality, that
a whole family should set all in common together (according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
'tis merry when beards wag all;) the Master and men, Dame and
damsels all together, (these cannot be so merry) whereby much, that by
licentious feeding, would be wasted is sav'd, beside, orderly eating makes
no mammocks, nor scraps for the Almes-basket. It is impossible to cure
servants of the woolf or dog in the stomack, without they be sed under
the Mistesses eye; and on the other side, I doe admire how Ladies gentile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women

those slender pittances, which they eat at their Tables, where I am sure
they abstain not out of an intention to save their meat, but from constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

leave them to their owne waies and customes, knowing full well, that they

nimbly down, as it ever alive went up the crag; they doe as an exact

some of his Astrological postures, and it had been a done businesse: But
where were his braines that he never cast her, nor her nativity? Could not
he read in those bright Characters, what would be the event of his own

Our figure-flingers went beyond him farre; they deal with the
Chamber-maides to Ladies first, and (more like sutors then wizards) learn
of them what the stars shall prognostick: <hi>Abigal</hi> discovers whom her
Mistresse dreames of, and then this <hi>Albumazar</hi> will tell her it waking at
what rate he pleases: Or if this take not, peremptorily conclude the Lady
doom'd, destin'd, and star-assign'd to one, who at such a time, in such a

that laid before by the gentile-man, who brib'd his <hi>mercenary</hi> tongue to the

Many take great Omens from the place where they first saw their
Mistresses; this fellow's first view was from a Cork-Tree Fountain, ever
since she made water in his mouth, but it was unfortunate; first, because
there was a Rock, which was the emblem of her hard heart; then a Cork
Tree, which is the emblem of levity, inconstancy, volubility, and huperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability;
then at a Fountain, which will never stand still, but is alwaies
running, and so nothing can be done. It had been farre better, (if fortune
had owed him so much good luck) to have seen her rising from gathering of
a Rose, or in the very cropping a flowers, or collection of a whole posy.
Besides that the proverb (especially that which plainly, and not para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically

his stand at one place about the pew, where sate his Mistresse, who was
a very attentive hearer of the man above her, and the sutor was as diligent
an eyer of her, for having a book, and black-lead pen alwaies in his hand,
(as if he took notes of the sermon) at last he got her exact picture. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
observing his constant zeale, and quotidian paines (for she imagin'd that
he wrote short-hand) could not withstand the pious Rhetorick of his eye, by
which fascination he first transmitted the venemous qualities of his warme
affections; then finding some gracious returnes of her bright luminaries,
and favourable aspects, he gaz'd so long sometimes, that he forgot his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

In processe of time, he came to neerer Colloquies, and they spake as
others doe by their lips, whereby the Impulses of his desires were so strong,
that shee submitted her selfe to this religious servant, who, (after taking
possession of her ensuring office) told her the notes he took, and shew'd
her the fairest lines, that ever were drawn in short hand; the Lady seeing
her face so well done, chid him for his hypocrisy, and bid him abuse that
place no more, but charg'd him to work on where he was, untill he copy'd

I can tell you of a stranger Metamorphosis, and of a Knight and an old one,
(who by his yeares was fitter for the grave than a Lady) Who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the silver Items on each side his face, and argont pendents of his
chin, was resolved to stumble in at the Lover hole, before he fell into the
pit, and so passionately pursued his affection, (<hi>Hercules</hi> was not more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,

be comment to these; for a word or two backward, you shall find him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled
for a good fellow, thence you guesse, in what degree of beatitude
his face was, an illustrious face, a glorious face, a bony face; or if you
will have names more known and to the life, a <hi>Robin Good-fellowes</hi> face,
a <hi>Bardolphs,</hi> a <hi>Furnifals Inne</hi> face, or a <hi>Bradwels</hi> face, which was the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
that ever I saw, wherein there was not room for another bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
if you would have studied it. Our Hosts faces (if they have not the tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

blessing) yet their Noses commonly are in the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and as torrid
as if they lay parcht under the Sunne, when he enters into <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</hi>
Dangerous faces, to come neer a Magazine, and as comfortable and
refreshing in a frosty morning, they smell well, (as the English proverb
hath it) such a Nose is worth a double tost in a pot of Ale, and will make
it whisse as well as a hot steele. It hath other uses too, and very serviceable
ones. It was ones fortune to prescribe a direction to a friend, (who was too
impatient to follow it, being cholerick of constitution, and blessed in that
part,) and it was concerning the fetching out a spot of grease from a sute,
which the party imagin'd, should have been effected by brown paper and a
coale, but the adviser said, with no coale (friend) only a brown paper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
which being applied to the middle part of his arme, on whom the
mischance of Tallow fell, the patient, so I call him, though he prov'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
ask'd, and what now? e'n lay your Nose close to it, (said the
Emperick) and it shall take it forth sooner then the best coale that comes
from <hi>New-Castle.</hi> But the blade was Sr <hi>Iohn Oldcastle, Duke Humphrey</hi> never
raged so, and made after the Emperick, whom if he had reach'd, he would
have given him a fee for his Counsell, as good as he could have told with
his ten ends of his toes. Thus you see that all blessed Faces are not charitable,
for who, (but one that will carry no coales) would have rewarded a friend
thus for his opinion, only in Face-hot presses.</p>

                        <hi>Her Face had on the one side the</hi> Sunne, <hi>and the other side the</hi> Moon.] I see
<hi>Peter</hi> is no kinne to him that keeps the Keyes where these Stars shine;
what a heavenly wide face was this? wherein the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> must
necessarily be ever in Eclipse one to the other, the interposition of the Nose
being but small, and not casting shadow enough for a dyall, the Stars no
doubt were like beauty specks all her body over, and from her breasts
downeward, those infinite company of little Luminaries made a milky
way, whither we must referr the man, (usually in the concave of the
<hi>Moon</hi>) but now somewhat eccentrick; for it would have spoyled the <hi>Moony</hi>
side of her face, to have had the pourtraicture of a man there. Beside the
spoyling or crossing of the proverb, for the woman dyed in child-bed; but
what of that? <hi>Sol &amp; homo</hi> (as is aforesaid) <hi>generant hominem,</hi> as was here
done; homo being Latine for Man or Woman, which at this time was

<hi>Moon,</hi> and the Man in the <hi>Moon</hi> together by the eares, with old <hi>William</hi>
the Man of the house, about the Legitimacy of <hi>Marcela,</hi> which was the

make them tast of the Body of the Tree. A short, but apposite tale I shall tel
you, and conducing much to the note; There was a Gentileman, who was
very discreet, and searching into the natures and dispositions of his family,
and finding amongst his <hi>Philocleas</hi> and <hi>Pamelas</hi> (his daughters, for their
beautie some, and some from gravity might not be denyed these names)
that one, and one of the least and youngest was ripest, and more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
then the rest; Husbandically provided first, that wanted first, forthwith
got a <hi>Principiis obsta,</hi> as they call it in Physick, or an <hi>Intus existens prohibet
alienum.</hi> The Virgin overjoy'd, that her good houre was come, could
not containe, and be content, that the servants should invite the guests, but
her selfe would needs speake to some of especiall familiarity with her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
any should forestall the news to those, whom she wish'd in the
same happy condition with her selfe; which when shee had done to her
play fellowes, (for she was not well wean'd from that society) they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and said, (good Lady!) Mrs <hi>Abigail,</hi> I pray how is it, that you are so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and leap over your sisters heads: We should never have believ'd it,
but from your owne sweet lips. Truly (said shee) simpering, and with her
hankerchiefe at her mouth, it were presumptuously done, but that my
Father, who knowes me of an egg, gave very good reason for it, for he said,
(I know not what he meant by it) that some eggs would hatch in an Oven,
and that in hot weather, things won't keep without salt.</p>

whom it concernes this. The worldly Parents of these dayes, are rather
hucksters then Parents, and make markets of their children, <hi>Aquantum
dabis,</hi> upon their heads, putting them off to him that will give most, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect of yeares, or complyance in affection. So the Lands be coupled,
the estates joyn'd, the parchments seal'd, 'tis no matter whether the two
parties come in any other sheets. Like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes, they meet, if ever,
with sirebrands in their tailes, and burne up all that Patrimony (or Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
say you which) that was so unhappily laid together: Matches made
in the minority of both parties, are like those in a tinder box, for a short
flame, not durable love, and goe out as soon. The Male commonly, is sent
to travell halfe a dozen yeares, to know what to doe against he returnes, and
in the mean time (scholars in that school, take too much, and turn over too
many lessons;) he learnes more then doth him good: Sometimes (like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Merchant) he brings home lesse then he carried out, and if he
dare examine his Cocquets, he finds himselfe a shrewd loser. Miserable
must needs be the condition of two so joyn'd, especially, if the Female
have made experience, or was told by her Aunt or Grandmother, what
incombe he might have made in his travels. As unfortunate it is, when fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

and so for other things, as your owne application shall best serve.</p>

the <hi>Yanguesian</hi> Carriers (finding the Beast troubled with <hi>melancholy</hi>) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
flew in to the assistance of their Mares, who had hitherto (more then
many rationall creatures will doe) defended themselves from this foule ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visher

affect the <hi>Don,</hi> that he was so unwilling to relieve <hi>Rosinante</hi> from the <hi>Yan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guesian
Gyants;</hi> but he had reason for it, he saw their number, and the
noise of the weapons, from <hi>Rosinante's</hi> sides, made him provide for his
own: Feare hath a quick eare, and though it was tickled with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Island, (which alwaies buzz'd in the hollow of it) yet he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it was a desperate causway that conducted thither, and that he should
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57130:41"/>
undergoe very strict discipline, before he came to exercise any. And so it
proved; for though he was spurr'd up with hopes by the couragious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations
of the <hi>Don,</hi> yet (alas, notwithstanding he collected his full spirit)
what were <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Lycas</hi> against more then twelve labours at once, or
rather labourers? whom <hi>Sancho</hi> very properly advised not to charge on
foot, or indeed at all, or to engage upon a horse quarrell, which would
gaine no credit in History, and especially if they should be foil'd; what
a blemish would it be in the book that was to be wrote of them? to see in
a great Cut or Brasse leafe, there <hi>Rosinante</hi> laid breathlesse, and by him the
<hi>Don,</hi> not able to heave a side or stir a limbe, or stretch forth a hand, and
<hi>Sancho</hi> in wofull manner pictur'd aloof off with his face to the ground, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
to looke up to Heaven, or upon man or beast, after this ignoble
victory; Only the Asse, reserv'd to carry away the blushing spoiles of the
field, will be seen in the piece free, grazing and leaping, and as having more
wit then three, contented himselfe with his pasture, not like <hi>Rosinante</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

given to revenge.</p>

injuries done to them: But it was secure as to that matter, for <hi>cantabit vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>

him after dinner. But confession is the first step to repentance, though a foot
could not be mov'd by either of them, yet notwithstanding it was reall, for
here was contrition, (or rather attrition) also adjoin'd, and an absolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
upon <hi>Sanchos</hi> part, never to play such a prank againe, with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of satisfaction, and an Act of Oblivion to these <hi>Banguesian</hi> Carriers.
There wanted now the <hi>Monks</hi> of his former adventure to pronounce the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,

the matter, though the forme were wanting) yet he lookt to get that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise

were too mean for a Knight, and more compatible with his Squire, who
by often malleations, hammerings, poundings, and threshings, might in

from the ground: Inso much, that he gave over the thought of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Island, and imagin'd he had taken possession of the Continent,
where he lay a <hi>Living Lease</hi> seal'd upon the ground, yet not in case to molest
any Trespassers. For unlesse <hi>Rosinante</hi> could be caught againe and his Asse,

that they conduced not to the exercise of his Armes, Sides, Back, nor
Thighes: all the parts of his body being in a parity of suffering, not by
compassion or sympathy, but by the proper anguish of each particular
joynt and member. Otherwise some unexercised Limb (like the undipp'd
heele of his brother <hi>Myrmidon</hi>-killer <hi>Achylles</hi>) had been enough to lose
the whole man. For I can compare the thorough and Integral, and almost
quotidian poundings and bastings of the Squire and his <hi>Don,</hi> unto nothing
apter and more convenient, then the daily sowsing of that valiant Greeks

extreamly and uncouthly accoutred, yet he resolv'd to call for no helpe till
the like mischance ensnar'd some body into that inchanted Castle, which
was the first that ever was made under ground. At last a stranger (who with
good Ale, had mellowed and lenified his intestines) came wadling with a
load of Sacrifice to <hi>Stercutius,</hi> and ready to present to <hi>Cloacina,</hi> fell into

of the <hi>Asturian,</hi> he touches balm and dissolv'd gumms, when his fingers

her Man-Midwife) help at her delivery. The Scene of this various Tragedy
cals to minde the song of <hi>Iohn Dory,</hi> personated and well performed by a
Company of lusty shoulder-thumpers, who discharg'd the mutuall thwacks
so stoutly, that they make a noise, as if they were beating of hemp. The
miscarriages of this Love-Scene, turn'd into a sad and lamentable Catastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe,
cals to memory the story of an Outlandish Peregrine, or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
who having seen most parts of this Nation, came at last to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where being infinitely satisfied with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the place, the magnificence of the Colledges, the discipline, habit,
and order of the Students, and above all the famous structure that was
then almost finished of Sr <hi>Thomas Bodleyes</hi> Library (not inferiour to the
<hi>Vatican</hi>) and since inlarg'd from a <hi>T</hi> which was its figure, to the
from of an <hi>H.</hi> he did confesse abundance of contentment, and resided
long in the place, which though he liked very well, yet there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting to him, for the pleasing of <hi>Scaliger</hi> his sixth sense, as he cals it.
And comming from, and having been born in hotter climates, he would
use to say, that those Countries were better furnished with she-<hi>Nurseries</hi>
and <hi>Seminaries</hi> of no Religion, and vertue, then this colder Island: The
Popes <hi>Seraglios</hi> were very profitable and necessary Refrigeratories for the
constitutions of the men upon the place. But one day passing through the
street, with his Interpreter, of whom he enquired the name of every place;
at his return to his lodging, entred into a Table-book, what instructions
were worthy the notice. Amongst the rest of the lanes, he remembred,
one was called <hi>Seven deadly sins-lane:</hi> Which place he marked and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57130:46"/>
observ'd, that he might find the way thither, (when occasion
served) without his guide, which not long after was put in practise,
and one evening he repaired thither, and as well as he could in his
halfe English, he required in this <hi>Deadly-sinnes-Lane,</hi> whereabout
was te <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lust,</hi> pray tell me te <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lust;</hi> scarce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

sharpe nos'd eager Woman came, unto whom he said, Madame, is
<hi>dis te House</hi> of <hi>Lust;</hi> of <hi>Lust,</hi> you rogue, said the Woman? having
in her hand a broom-staffe. (wherewith her Husband and shee had
been deciding the controversie for the Breeches,) and laid it on with
that force, that shee gave him a broken pate to his broken Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish;
whereat the stranger stood plaguily corrected, and crying her
Mercy, that had none of him, said, I be mistake Madame, <hi>dis be</hi>

it fell out out here, <hi>Maritornes</hi> thought to have made a vaulting-School
of this Chamber, and to her abominable griefe it proved a
Fencing School, where a Prize was played, and shee a great part
of it, at never a weapon that shee liked.</p>

Fascinations were knowne; yet something of high concernment, and
great prefit was discovered, and (as an Antienter Author hath it of that
Nation, then <hi>Cyd Hameti Benengeli</hi>) by <hi>Priapus</hi> himselfe, who was the
greatest Herbalist in the World, and the Tutelary genius of all Gardens,
and handsome Plantations: This <hi>Phutologicall</hi> Deitie (I say, or rather the
old <hi>Arabian</hi>) being enamor'd of a Smiths wife (that was usuall amongst
those powers) who came constantly to his Quarters, to gather Sallads,
who looking many times on, and with good liking upon the portraicture of
this high-mounted Genius) he understood her meaning (as they say) by her
gaping and discovered (by way of recompence for her favours) the <hi>Secreta</hi>
and <hi>Arcana Herbarum,</hi> which the fond foole revealed to her husband, and
he upon his death-bed to his brother, which was the first Catholike Kings
Farrier; And it is credibly reported by my <hi>Arabian,</hi> that he chose him a
<hi>Venus</hi> out of the sisterhood of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> from whom this <hi>Opobalsamum</hi>
as well as the <hi>Don</hi> himselfe was traducted, as by his looks is most evident,
that he was originally descended, not of the <hi>Fabri,</hi> (or <hi>Fabritii) Lignarii,</hi> but
<hi>Ferrarii;</hi> for he did often account himselfe of the house of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and
might very well. Thus by many meane conveyances this rare Secret was
at last lodg'd in the Family of <hi>Quesadas, Quixadas,</hi> or <hi>Quixots,</hi> as is aforesaid,
that's all one: And this derivation I have been somewhat more curious in,
because it might be wondred how the <hi>Don</hi> should come to the knowledge
of such a Rarity, and this same search hath not cost me hot water (as they
say) but what is more dangerous, it is fetch'd out of the Fire, and if you

what employment the fellow was of. Now, whether he meant of those
sort of Bottles, where Duke D' <hi>Alvas</hi> Face is so eminently fixt, is a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

doe wonder, that in all his sodaine accidents, the wholsome cure of Pisse
and brown Paper was never discovered to him, nor his Squire <hi>Sancho;</hi> which
if he had known, it had been of great consequence to him, and because it
was frequent with him to Urine (being much given to Horse-radish, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke

for the most part musing; (that is to say in a browne study) He was sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

Aves <hi>and</hi> Creeds.] The Tinne Oyle-pot did very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
to the cure, for his pate being but lately broke by a Lamp-panne,
(which was of the same metall) that being broke, spoil'd, and uncapable, the
experiment might be made upon a pot that was coaetaneous, and of the
same make with it: So by application of the <hi>Balsamum</hi> to the very <hi>Sofia</hi>-tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot

shew'd that though most men would be counted Physitians, he laid sure

usuall custody of those, to whom it was first administred, and then tied
him up (well cloath'd) to the Racks, and some three or foure houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
refreshed his sweated body with a mesh. But had not the <hi>Don</hi> been
of a stronger constitution then that creature that us'd thus to take this Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
a Body of Brasse indeed, this <hi>Balsamum Fierebras</hi> had dissolv'd this

something of every thing, and it was strange (but that his heart was great
and could not get through the <hi>Isophagus</hi>) that it came not up with the rest;
Much undigested <hi>Poor-Iohn</hi> and the <hi>Goat,</hi> came skipping back faster then
it went down; the Iron Cheese made a horrid noise, (as if the Mils had

perceiving his Master cleans'd and cleare, (for he was as gaunt as a Hawke
after casting) desired a Dose for himselfe, which his Master very willingly
did condescend unto: And <hi>Sancho,</hi> like the wench that desired to be us'd
well by the Apothecary upon her <hi>Recipe,</hi> had so much given her for
Gods sake by the knavish boy over and above the prescribed quantitie, that
shee wish'd upon the returne of it, that the Devill had taken him for his
courtesie. So <hi>Sancho</hi> very liberally drencht him selfe, but as Physick is not
alike to all constitutions, as the French Doctor said; if <hi>te</hi> Body be full
of grosse humours, and that it operates excessively, <hi>all de better for dat;</hi>
and if the Physick doe not stirre the Patient, 'tis a good signe that <hi>de</hi> grosse

<hi>Sancho,</hi> having a tough and tenacious stomack, and that was not us'd to
part with any thing it had once receiv'd (unlesse (dogge fashion) upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Resumption,) labour'd to digest it, and turn it into nutriment,
which verily had been effected, had the Dose not been over-proportioned;
which put the Squire into such an Agonie and maw-Convulsions, that he
thought his soule had been transmigrant and <hi>Errant</hi> from his Body. At last
gathering all his expulsive faculties together, and setting his hands to his
sides, at the first reach he threw out his troublesome guest, and dislodg'd
the <hi>Balsamum,</hi> which being embitter'd by his long stay, made the Squire
look very sowerly, and so distorted his face by manifold writhings, that
he looked handsomer (if his countenance could have kept the posture) then
ever he did in his life. But he had more motions then one, his backward
memento's came so fast, that he could not mind what his mouth utter'd:
No Bed-panne was sufficient, nor the Tub for that purpose. He was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled

the enormities happ'ned) very glad that shee had this revenge for the Battell
plaid upon her <hi>Maine-Pillian;</hi> shee ever and anon held his head too, which
shee bound about with a list taken from her leg. The halfe Tub began to
fill, for up came all his Wallet-thefts, his stomack was like a Foxes kennell,
or a Polecats hole, whence innumerable parts of the creature came flutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out, as if they had been upon wing againe. It would have puzz'led a

his Brother Broad-face when he flies abroad in the day time. It was well
the <hi>Balsamum Fieribras</hi> had so throughly purg'd his sinke, otherwise he had
left foule signes of his high Indignation in the Blankets. In his Tranation
he lookt about, and saw under him (though a farre off) his Lord upon
<hi>Rosinante,</hi> no bigger than a Toad upon a Bucking-stoole; and the <hi>Don</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in amazement the motions of his Squire, now equall with him in all
Adventures, this last paralelling his of the Windmill. But the <hi>Don</hi> sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his Javelin over the wall, and discovering implacable rage, and
threatning, but not attempting to leap the wall, the Inne-keeper gave the
signe to the Ringers, and they let the Bell goe very Musically downe, by
lessening their stroaks, heaves, and tosses, till they brought <hi>Sancho</hi> very well
breath'd and air'd to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Sancho <hi>requested</hi> Maritornes <hi>to give him some Wine, which shee did.</hi>] Poor
<hi>Sancho</hi> was as dry, as if he had been visiting the torrid <hi>Zone,</hi> or pass'd the
<hi>Line;</hi> a draught of water he would have, but his Master knowing in his
great observation, that water will putrifie and stink <hi>under the Line,</hi> would
not permit him to drinke it, nor yet would <hi>Sancho</hi> be perswaded to a
dram of the Bottle, no <hi>Balsamum</hi> goes down his throat, which was as open
as a Sepulchre. But <hi>Maritornes</hi> (all after-claps forgot and forgiven) mov'd
with a Fellowship of his sufferings, risings and fallings, helpes him at last
to a draught of pure <hi>Nepenthe,</hi> a lusty glasse of Claret wine, wherein the
dead flyes look'd like the wholsome Clove, and because he should be
sure to have no more risings in the stomack, she powder-sugar'd it with
a little burnt Allum, which shee crumbled into it, and stirring often, said,
partner in affliction drinke, drinke it up, the deeper the sweeter, parting
with <hi>Sancho</hi> in the very same proverb, as she hop'd to have laine all night
with him.</p>

they could not beat, which was enough for larger bowels,
(and theirs were of the largest too) but not of Mercy, that
you should see. This knowne cruelty in them, made them
terrible, and fear'd where ever they came, and those who stood out
should be paid, (except Inchanted Inne-keepers) was known throughout
all rodes: So upon their approach, Castles were surrendred, Ladies sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,

where it was to lye nourisht in heat, by the Sulphurous supplement of
that Minerall, untill one of the most redoubted and Moderne Knights in

grasped the Serpents in the Cradle) grasped as much of it in it pretty fist,
smiling, and pleas'd with no rattles, babies, hobby-horses, or any such toyes,
but only this burning sword, which as it never burn'd his fingers, so he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dreaded it; and come to age (Captaine <hi>Iones</hi> was this Valiant

many a man, and was only vanquishable by the Knights of the <hi>Well,</hi> or the
<hi>Running spring.</hi> Wherefore it was time to look to it, for now if ever he was

                     <p>As appear'd by the Catastrophe of this battell, wherein, though the
<hi>Don</hi> did slay seven Knights of the <hi>Curled Fleece,</hi> yet he paid for the honour
very dearly, and lay speechlesse, toothlesse, and witlesse, and the pillage of
the Field carried off by the enemie supperlesse: Otherwise <hi>Sancho Pancha,</hi>

It was never so, but when this Valiant Knight join'd unto it; but the
Knight by the Order, was to be on the oppressed party, whereby he was
sure to have the worst on't. I believe <hi>Sancho</hi> would have been Jack
of both sides, for he lov'd a side of Mutton, both leg and the other, as well
as he lov'd his wife, which was rib of his rib. Here was a recruit for the
Wallet, but where is the Wallet to be recruited.</p>

this Army are very well lik'd of every where; no Lord, Knight, Squire,
Gentileman, or Yeoman, but are joy'd to see them at their Houses and
Tables. And such is the great love the People beare to them, that they
may quarter with them all the yeare long; but they seldome doe lie upon
the meaner sort of the People (though they would willingly entertaine
them) but at the ablest mens houses, and most wealthy, which is a great
ease to the whole Nation where they live; and were it not for that ravenous
Gyant, who doth without mercy devour 'um, the cruell <hi>Woolfangus,</hi> they

Thus was this Sheep-Field Marshall'd, which the <hi>Don</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> saw
through the Prospectives of their fingers; but <hi>Sancho,</hi> a very <hi>Woolfangian,</hi>
was bloody minded, and wished the utter ruine and confusion of these two
Warlike bodies.
<q>â€”Animal propter Convivia natum,</q>
was all the Latine he had, or cared for, and to expresse his Sanguinarious
Nature, he whispered the <hi>Don</hi> in the eare so subtilly and close, (that <hi>Cyd
Hameti</hi> did not hear it) and protested by the Gods of <hi>Mancha,</hi> that he wisht
from his heart, and the bottome of his belly, that every Souldier in both
those Armies were dead upon the Turfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And so it was indeed.</hi>] If ever Knights wits went a wool-gathering, ours
did at this instant, where a Flock of Sheep are supposed an Host of men,
Ramms taken for Gyants, Ewes for Ladies, Wethers for Eunuchs, black
Sheep for <hi>Negromancers,</hi> Lamkins for Knights Pages, Shepheards with
their Crooks in their hands for Inchanters, and Pioners with their pipes
for Martiall Flutes, the Wethers bels for Drumms, and their taile clouts,
their colours, their tupping and rutting for the maine Battalia, and the
Buttons for the slaught' red bodies, which were innumerable.</p>
                     <p>One of the effects of feare, is to trouble the senses.]</p>
                     <q>Videri facit quae non sunt Timor.</q>
                     <p>If this axiom be true, the <hi>Don</hi> by his owne mouth shall be judg'd, that
he is the greatest coward of the two, and that he reprehends <hi>Sancho</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57130:53"/>
who was not distempered by that womanish passion; for he saw
really that the Sheep were Sheep and no Gyants; but the <hi>Don</hi> taking Geese
for Swans (as we say) Sheep for Souldiers, 'tis a hundred to one upon
<hi>Sanchos</hi> side, that his Master was more timerous <hi>pro praesente.</hi>

                        <hi>For all this,</hi> Don <hi>would not returne, but cri' don, on Knights, all that March
under the valorous Emperor</hi> Pentapolin.] The Knight is as mad as his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
when it is vex'd with the ticks, he charges through and through, and
routed the whole Body, and made such gaps and gashes in the sides of the
assaylants, that one Sheep might have leapt through another, till the
main part of the Armie had escap'd through the first Sheep-breach. Never
was such a slaughter; here lay legs and armes, there breast and sides, there
necks, there heads without hornes, there hornes without heads, there feet,
there rumps; Sire, Dam and Barne, Ram, Ewe and Lamb, lay all in one
ruine; the Knight himselfe like <hi>Iohn-a-Green,</hi> discolour'd with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
of the Enemie, which he fetch'd out of the very bowels of them, using
the Sheep, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did the <hi>Iewes,</hi> at the sacking of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacking
in their Fundaments and upwards, for conceal'd Gold and Jewels;
but the <hi>Don</hi> ripp'd them up, not out of covetousnesse, but meer revenge, and
was so bespattered and bespringled with the Intrailes, that a-was more
terrible then a Forrester, and did so stinke of offall and slaughter, that the
Crowes, Owles, Ravens, and Buzzards flew about him for provisions,
as if he had been Quarter-Master-Generall for those birds of prey. His
word was <hi>Pentapolin</hi> of the Naked Arme, and look'd himselfe like a Lyon
of East-cheap.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Shepheards unloose their slings and bepelt him, he crying</hi> Ali-fam-fa-ron
<hi>where art thou.</hi>] The Shepheards at last, take heart and stones, and defy
this Goliath of the <hi>Mancha,</hi> who (not afraid of an incounter of that nature)
run in upon the great <hi>Ali-feramme-Anae-faron,</hi> and advancing his sanguine
Javelin in the very curled front of him, said, dye Tyrant, dye libidinous
Ravisher, dye of the yellowes, as thou livedst (jealous and lecherous) so dye.
Never any more hope to tup the daughters of <hi>Pentapolin,</hi> or see the naked
and goodly leg of the faire Lady <hi>Ovesia,</hi> or the tender quarters of the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
young, and chast <hi>Agnetis,</hi> or <hi>Agnesia.</hi> So fell this buffle-headed Gyant
by the hand of <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> who skill'd in Astronomie, (as farre as an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack
could instruct him,) struck the Ramme in the neck and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and with one blow (the signe being at that time <hi>Aries</hi>) sever'd his head
from his body.</p>
                     <p>He thought himselfe slaine, and remembring his liquor, he took out the oyle-pot,

burnt child dreads the Fire, (saith the proverb,) but the truth of it is, that
the <hi>Don</hi> and his Squire were never parabolically basted, but literally in the
very common notion and acceptation of the word. And this encounter at
the first view, did presage more danger then any yet, here being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number of enemies, except in the adventure of the Flock, that ever
they met with; besides, it was like to be night-work, and <hi>Sancho</hi> had bad

star'd and grew wilder at the approach of the lights, then the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill,
for they had been acquainted with that adventure, and had gone the
rounds, often employed by <hi>Molendinario,</hi> The Gyant of the place: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Reader blame not this <hi>Tertian</hi> that is upon them at present, for indeed
they were seldome out of a <hi>Quotidian</hi> shaking. But now it intermitted, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
in <hi>principio morbi</hi> being the best Physick for it, of which they had
their belly full, (if that may be said without a bull;) but considering they
did bucket and discharge on into another, (like two cunning gunners, who
shoot so direct and levell against one anothers muzzles, that they send each
ones ball back to the mouths of the Canon from whence they came, and
make bullets Sea-Crabs, and teach them to be retrogade;) In that significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I say, they may be said to have disembogued their belly full. But to
the note; the horrid fright they are in, cals to mind a paire of Spirits of
equall match, who like <hi>Sancho</hi> and the <hi>Don,</hi> or rather like two cakes of
Size, or trembling Custards, are put into an Ague with apprehension of
their sodaine devouring: But this story which I shall now tell you, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
apposite to this, and neer upon a subject. In a Tragedie (that was
prepar'd for the publike view of the University,) the Actors were privately
to be trled upon the Stage, that upon the insufficiency of the persons, or
unfittednesse, the men might be chang'd, But two Scholars there were in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57130:55"/>
this Spanish Tragedy (which was the story of <hi>Petrus Crudelis</hi>) whose parts
were two Ghosts or Apparitions of some Noble Personages, which that
Bloody Prince had Murder'd. These two at the Repetitions spoke their
lines very confidently, insomuch, that the Judges thought they would be
very good Ghosts; but when the tryall night came, that the Play was to
be presented to some few friends before the publick exhibit, and then
these two Scholars were put out of their blacks into white long robes,
their Faces meal'd, and Torches in their hands, and some flashes of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
made at their entrance, just as they put their heads through the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
of the Scene, comming out at two severall sides of the Stage, they
shook so, and were so horribly affrighted at one anothers gashly lookes,
that no force of those behind them, could get them to advance a foot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
toward the stage, or speak a word of their Parts; but there as they
first stood, they stood for halfe an houre shaking, quaking, and staring
one upon another, Insomuch, that they put the Auditory into such a shaking
with laughing, that they had almost died with the excessive motions of the

                        <hi>Sancho</hi> with leave, departed a little out of the way, and discovering many white
things, so that his courage abated, and he did chatter with his teeth.] The Don

                     <p>Indeed the <hi>Don</hi> could not chatter so well as <hi>Sancho,</hi> because of the losse of

for his <hi>Carnimotus</hi> was so violent, that he had like to have throwne

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57130:56"/>
knackings of <hi>Sancho's</hi> teeth, puts me in minde of a strong fancied man, a
Scholar, and a good Trencher-man, who was invited to a great Feast,
(which was the next day prepar'd) and some of the principall dishes being
related to him, (for he was alwaies inquisitive upon such occasions, into
the bill of Fare,) he lik'd them very well, for they were very agreeable to
his palate; and for better inabling himselfe for the tooth-encounter, the
day before he walk'd methodically, eat slenderly, dranke cauteously, and
went to bed seasonably (being excellent preparatives for the next dayes
action.) But O the mischance! he was no sooner in bed but asleep, no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in sleep but dreaming, for his hightned fancy presented all the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of the dishes to his soule, as lively as if they had been at Table; so that
it wrought reall impressions and impulses upon his body, to the motion of
his hands, which he manag'd, as if his knife had been in it; but above all, his
Teeth out-travell'd <hi>Sancho's,</hi> and went such a swift trot, that it waked his
Chamber-fellowes, who thought by the noyse that he was dreaming he
had been in Hell; wherefore about to rise and wake him, they were suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
awhile by his words, for ever and anon he said, Sir, Sir, Sir<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> pray
hand the Spring of Porke to me, pray advance the Rump of Beefe this way,
the Chine of Bacon, O the Chine, with your leave the Chine, Sir, and

and <hi>Semibriefe</hi> time so excellently, that the persons resolv'd to wake
him, did lye down and laugh, wonderfully pleas'd to see their friend so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
contented in the same instant at bed and board. The Scholar wak'd
after a sound sleep, but could remember no sport that he made, nor would
he believe the Auditors relations, untill by wofull experience, he found
his Face swell'd, and his Gumms so batter'd and bruised with the reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussions
of his grinders, that he was not able to stirre his jawes, nor could
be partaker of any of the good cheer, except it were the liquid part of it,
which they call <hi>Dutch gleek,</hi> where he plaied his cards so well, and vied and

Is our adventure prov'd a Fulling-Mill? are our Silver staves turn'd to Iron
Maces? and our Gyants (earth-bred indeed) but of Fullers earth? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the sound, something of the employment wrought upon <hi>Sancho,</hi>
which scowr'd him so; and yet if either of the two, <hi>Sancho</hi> should have
been first in this Encounter, for it was necessary for him after he had foul'd
his Breeches. Our Tragedy is chang'd into pure Comedie, and instead of a
Prize, we are like to have a jiggo of two principall Clownes, each gibing
the other, they are now at the Ti-hee, and without tickling, laugh till their

This contempt was so high, that in all the books of <hi>Errantry,</hi> I meet not
any Relation to match it withall. No Squire ever took that liberty which
<hi>Sancho</hi> did, to deride his Knight to the face, and by a looser carriage to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
him to the nose; but nothing was so distastefull at present, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly,
and reproachfull wide opening of his mouth, whereby the
Squire did manifest to the world, that he had a better set of Teeth then his
Lord: so that the abuse being triple to his face in generall, and his nose and
teeth in particular, the punishment should have been answerable, and hee
should have basted him from head to taile. Now it is a great Dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Martiall men, whether this <hi>Launce. Bastinado</hi> (for it cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an Encounter) did dis-Squire <hi>Sancho,</hi> that is, Cashiere him. In the
truth of the state, I doe believe it did; but by the consequence of the story,
finding his Repentance so suddaine, and his submission so exemplary, he may
passe in <hi>Errantry</hi> for a Squire <hi>Reformado.</hi>

having recovered the use of his naturall legs, though he came thither Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

too much given to Drinke, which betrayes secrets; too much loving a
Whore, which is a revealer of their stealthes, but not their own; too much
addiction to Gaming, which doth waste the small stock their industrious
pilfering hath got together, and enforceth them upon fresh Designes, and
suddaine, but dangerous Recruits; also hankering after Repentance, and
hopes of Pardon, which is alwayes of dangerous consequence, and either
alters the whole course of ones owne life, or else the latter, (being base
Peachery) brings anothers life to a Halter. Wherefore very solemnly they
conjure their friends to doe nothing simply, rashly, or unadvisedly, that
should conduce to such Casualties as these; but at all times to steale with
great care and prudence; to wench soberly, and undiscover'd; to sweare
their Hosts once a Moneth to secrecie, and once a yeare at least to bring 'um

the expence of the Prison, and the Keepers Fees, and Rent-money for the

did Passe a Jew in slavery, never out a whole seven years together: so that
he reckons his life by the <hi>Iustra</hi> of his Imprisonments, the first five of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency

love Flattery and Applause for all our gratuities, that if we misse our
vaine-glorious Harvest, wee never sow seed in that barren and lethaean
ground againe. But on the other side, when we are in the veine of Presents,
and that to great ones; Curtesies not acknowledged are suspected, that they

the unfortunate issue of any fight, nor the necessities of a Retreat, whether

                        <hi>Scarce had the</hi> Don <hi>heard him make mention of books of Knight-hood, &amp;c.</hi>]
Here is the <hi>Dons</hi> Cue, and he will enter, and speak in spight of a broken
pate, which was sure to ensue, yet with more manners then ordinary, he
excuses his interruption of the story, opening his foolish infirmitie to
<hi>Cardenio,</hi> and telling him plainly, that he was no wiser then he should be,
and though his head was full of Bookes, it was like a Library, which was
not a jot the learneder for them: But if so, it had been well, the <hi>Don</hi> would
have bestowed Chaines upon them, they would have stood the quieter in
his own head, and would have been lesse troublesome to others.</p>
                     <p>He is a bottle-head that would thinke otherwise, theu that <hi>Elisabat</hi> the Barber
kept Queen <hi>Madasina</hi> as his Lemmon.</p>
                     <l>Uvaque conspectÃ¢ livorem ducit ab uvÃ¢.</l>
                     <l>One Foole makes many.</l>
                     <p>Humours are sodainly imitated, especially if there be any life and fancy
in 'um. Many have by representation of strong paisions been so transported,
that they have gone weeping, some from Tragedies, some from Comedies;
so merry, lightsome and free, that they have not been sober in a week af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and have so courted the Players to re-act the same matters in the
Tavernes, that they came home, as able Actors as themselves; so that their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57130:77"/>
Friends and VVives have took them for Tonies or Mad-men. It fell out
here so, for <hi>Cardenio</hi> is rais'd a Cue above the <hi>Don,</hi> who was in the behalfe
of Ladies; but <hi>Cardenio</hi> is for the more dishonourable part, which is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of a great quarrell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That is not so I vow, by such and such, quoth</hi> Don Quixot, <hi>in great choler.</hi>] If
the <hi>Don</hi> had permitted <hi>Cardenio</hi> to have compleated his story, he would
not have been so fiery in the defence of Ladies; but (<hi>alterÃ¢ parte inaudiÃ¢,</hi>
the <hi>Don</hi> hearing but of one Eare;) this matter prov'd a dispute, for who
knew <hi>Elisabat</hi> the Barber, or Queen <hi>Madasina</hi> better, the <hi>Don</hi> or <hi>Carde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi>
is a hard question to resolve? (the Persons being no where in the
world;) wherefore the Queen and the Barber being no where to be
found, I doe rather adhere to <hi>Cardenio's</hi> opinion, that they were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queen</hi> Madasina <hi>was a Noble Lady, and 'twas not to be presum'd that shee
would fall in Love, &amp;c.</hi>] The <hi>Don</hi> goes upon presumption for his Argument,
and Oaths, the lye given, and Villanie for the Victory: These were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
both presumptions, as it fell out; for great Ladies have miscarried in
their affections, (though the <hi>Don</hi> was not yet belov'd by any) and stories
(his owne stories) are full of their Levities, Inconstancies and Falshoods,
to their Knights; insomuch, as some have submitted to their Coach-men,
Foot-men, and Lords Pages, in a vacation of service. But the Lady <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dasina,</hi>
being a meer Chimera, a name and nothing else, the <hi>Don</hi> therein,
might justifie the chastity of a Queen and no Queen; a Lady and no La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
a name and no body. To the other presumption it was harder replyed,
for that part of it rais'd an adventure, wherein the <hi>Don</hi> had his usuall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and successe; for with a well ordered and right guided stone thrown
by <hi>Cardenio,</hi> (now in his fits,) <hi>Quixot</hi> was confuted flat, and lay on his
back, indifferent for the present, whether <hi>Madasina</hi> were vitiated by <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabat</hi>
or no.</p>
                     <p>Sancho <hi>seeing his Master so roughly handled, &amp;c.</hi>] Compassionate <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho!</hi>
That good Nature should betray a man into mischiefe! Yet <hi>aliquod
Malum, propter vicinum,</hi> and like Master like Man, is a Proverb, at this
time very true; for <hi>Cardenio</hi> (feeling the rude assault of his clownes fist)
runs upon him with more then Humane violence, and turnes the tunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belly,
and rides him in worse fashion, then our Countryman <hi>Coriat</hi> did
the Barrell at <hi>Hiddleberg;</hi> But <hi>Cardenio</hi> did so trample him, that he made
him run worse liquor by halfe, and after he had pressed him, and flatted
him like a Pancake, he imitated his companions, the Goates, and left <hi>Sancho</hi>
to the Goatheard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The dispute ended in catching one another by the Beards.</hi>] 'Tis not alwaies
true, that 'tis merry when Beards wagge all, for these mens Beards wagg'd
as fast as they could tug 'um, but mov'd no mirth at all; they were verifying
that Song
<q>
                           <l>Of heigh brave <hi>Arthur</hi> O' <hi>Bradly,</hi>
                           </l>

                     </p>
                     <p>Two Ancient Reverend Men, had almost disthatch'd their Faces, and
coud neither of them sue for distraminations. If <hi>Quixot</hi> had not recovered
out of his sound, and reconcil'd this difference, his Squire <hi>Sancho</hi> might
have pass'd for his Page, he had been made so smooth chinn'd, and the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57130:78"/>
Goates would never have own'd such a beardlesse boy as the unstead
Goatheard for their leader. But the Knight of the <hi>Ill-favoured</hi> Face, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the misusage of their's, thought he might lose his own title, or have a
compartner; which is very dishonourable, that any should give the same
Field, world, or devise, as himselfe. Wherefore he parts them; now
very fit for Mr <hi>Elisabat</hi> the Barber, if he had done with Queen <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina.</hi>

(as they did in the</hi> Guisipetes <hi>time) the harme had been lesse, for
then would I have discours'd with</hi> Rosinante.] <hi>Sancho</hi> doth
very bitterly, but very simply complaine against the safe and
incomparable use of silence, admirable if voluntary, indeed
lesse commendable if impos'd; and because he doth instance
of that happy time of the (<hi>Guisipetes</hi>) wherein Beasts had the freedome of
speech; it shall be made appear to <hi>Sancho,</hi> that there was no such time,
when the Creature spoke, or if at any time it did, it was but once, and that
an Asse too. The <hi>Guisipetes</hi> were a people of <hi>Sancho's</hi> onwe making, for no
History, nor Chronology, ever heard of 'um, and it may be, were those
where he was to be Governour of, unlesse he mean the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> where
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57130:78"/>
notwithstanding, the common errour men goe upon their feet, and the
Beasts speak as they doe now, and ever did. It is silence in Beasts, that
hath kept them at such Amity, as they are, peace and quietnesse; there is
no challenges amongst them, no Duels, no Wars, (except what are ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Frogs and Mice) and the Frogs indeed, (a croaking generation)
that is somewhat neer speaking, have incurr'd by their mutinous noise <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters</hi>
great rage. But the rest of the sensible Creatures, having some two or
three naturall sounds for the significations of their severall wants or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions,
live contented, that is, speechlesse, saying nothing, and grow
fat upon it; for talking spends the Spirits, and <hi>Livia's</hi> would never be
fat.</p>
                     <q>Eheu quam pingui macer est mihi Taurus in Arvo?</q>
                     <p>That was a bellowing Bull, that in the best Pasture, <hi>Sancho,</hi> will never
thrive; an Asse that brayes in that manner, will eat but few Thistles: Nay,
reasonable Creatures, to whom Language is permitted, the wisest are
counted the lesse talkative, the wisest of Nations (which our <hi>Don</hi> counts his
owne, and it might have pass'd, had he not spoiled the Universality of it)
are no pratlers, and very weary in answering frivolous questions, passing
off replyes in a politick silence; the Country shrugge, and a considerative
gloat of the Eye, which are maine good preventives in a place troubled with
the Inquisition. What a miserable things is it, to heare Men and Women
every where almost, saying, would my Tongue had been out when I
spoke it: That Tongue of yours will undoe you. <hi>Aesops</hi> two dinners of
the same sort of meat, may very well shew the vanity of <hi>Sancho's</hi> wish;
where, of bad Tongues he provideda most plentifull Feast, but of good
ones, he could scarce make a messe. I would <hi>Pythagoras</hi> were alive
againe, that men might be taught silence for seven yeares, and a seven
yeares custome would not easily be broken. The <hi>Don</hi> sure was a <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
for he had enjoyn'd silence, and for a time he practised it: But <hi>Sancho</hi>
now being wild and passionate for the losse of his Asse, he will no longer
live in that safe condition of Mutes, (whom as no man will hurt, so the
grand Signior doth highly Honour and trust) but most foolishly obteines
the liberty of speech againe, which did ingage him into many adventures,
and that his Tongue might goe a little, hath been the occasion that his head
hath too often runne.</p>
                     <p>I' faith <hi>Sancho,</hi> if thou didst know how Honourable the Queen <hi>Madasina</hi> is,
thou wouldst say I had great Patience, that I did not strike thee on the Mouth.]</p>
                     <p>See the fruits of his freedome of speech; his Mouth is no sooner open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but 'tis like to be seal'd up againe. <hi>Sancho's</hi> tongue was like a Bels clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
beating others, and ever beat it selfe, and never better then when it
was an end. Who would have such an instrument, that should be alwaies
jarring? <hi>Sancho,</hi> returne to silence, and to security, Canst not thou (Fool)
content thy selfe with thinking; your Thinkers doe more knavish, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
things unpunished, and unblameable, then any of the subtilest
railers in the World. <hi>Sancho,</hi> be tongue-tide againe, or lose thy teeth, never
speake much, but confine they selfe to some few and necessary quaeries, ask
for Mony, ask for meat, ask for the way, and ask for plasters. These things
are but short, and yet it will be long before you get them.</p>

                        <hi>The truth of the History is, Mr</hi> Elisabat <hi>was very prudent, and a man of
great Iudgment, and serv'd the Queen as Tutor and Physitian.</hi>] The <hi>Don</hi> hath
given a degree to day, and made a madd Dr in the Forrest of <hi>Stenna More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi>
To justifie the quarrell, he hath created <hi>Elisabat</hi> Dr and Tutor to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dasina;</hi>
the degree of Physick was the most proper he could thinke of in
that place, for it was naturally made for simpling, where the <hi>Don</hi> gave a
great augmentation in his own person.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Those that suspect and affirm that she was his Friend, I say again they lye; and those
that either thinker or say it, lie a thousand times:</hi>] This kinde of Confutation,
is not only Spanish, but hath got into other Countries, where if it be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically
spoken, that is, stoutly and in full accent, it confounds for the
time. But suppose one thinke so but once, who shall know it? and if he say
it no more, how shall he lie a thousand times? Our <hi>Don</hi> is transported
mainly with Mr <hi>Elisabat,</hi> and I doe believe he hath some plot upon him, to
change Basons with him, for <hi>Mambrimo's</hi> Helmet was most rufully batter'd:
that he is so favourable to Physitians, may in time procure a Counsell to
mend his <hi>Balsamum Fierebras,</hi> and the promotion of a Barber Surgeon to a
Doctor, (Things done by wiser men then <hi>Don Quixot</hi>) they will confer their
Plaster-boxes, and poor <hi>Sancho</hi> and thy selfe shall no longer be tied to that
poor refuge of Pisse and Oaken leaves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou must wit that desire of finding the Madman alone, brings me not into
these parts so much.</hi>] As for that, he meant to turne Mad man himselfe.
Now, whether a man may abdicate his reason, renounce his understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for a time, and discover (if not discover'd) no reasonable Acts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a man should not undifference him from a Beast, and live and enjoy
himselfe in the sensitive part alone, is a hard matter to determine, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to doe. To counterseit Madnesse is ordinary, and to be really so,
more. <hi>Bedlam</hi> affords you these; the streets (if not better places) the other.
After Death, the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> averr'd a transmigration of Soules into new
Bodies, and oftentimes entred the Soule of a Philosopher into a Goose;
shifted <hi>Alexanders</hi> gallant Spirit into a Dottrell, and such like changes, as
<hi>Lucian,</hi> or such abusive Forges, had a fancy to fashion 'um in. But these are
fantasticall conceits; our <hi>Don</hi> is reall, he will put off the Man, and put on
the Beast, only reserve to himselfe the benefit of Speech, which whether
man have, or not have, he cannot be said to be out of his Senses for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Strong passions left too long unsuppress'd, may overthrow the temper
of the braine, and totally subvert the rationall parts, and some paisions
counterfeited long, whether of griefe or joy, have so alter'd the persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that players themselves (who are most usually in such employments,)
have been forc'd to fly to Physick, for cure of the disaffection, which such
high penn'd humours, and too passionately and sensibly represented have
occasion'd. I have knowne my selfe, a Tyrant comming from the Scene,
not able to reduce himselfe, into the knowledge of himselfe, till Sack made
him (which was his present Physick) forget he was an Emperour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
all his old acquaintance to him; and it is not out of most mens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
that one most admirable Mimicke in our late Stage, so lively and
corporally personated a Changeling, that he could never compose his
Face to the figure it had, before he undertook that part. The Knight of
the <hi>Ill-favour'd</hi> Face, had much done to his hand, in his intended Emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57130:79"/>
for counterfeiting there was not much need, (if hunger did not
make a revocation of his little wits at any time.) For Crabs, Hawes,
Acornes, Berries, agreeing naturally with his complexion, and embet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
his Face to all purposes: I doe believe it 'twas possible for the <hi>Don,</hi> for
a certaine time to lose his Wits, and to revoke so much as he parted
withall, and be not a grain the wiser at their returne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Have I not told thee already saith</hi> Don Quixot, <hi>that I mean to follow</hi> Amadis,
<hi>by playing the despaired Wood and Mad man.</hi>] The example of <hi>Amadis,</hi> is
very autorative with our <hi>Don,</hi> but why he should rather labour to imitate
him in this fit of Madnesse, then-in any other of his magnanimous Acts, is
very strange; no, it is not so strange, but a common thing: When did you
see a wise example followed by many, or any? Let it alone, 'tis grave,
stanch, and singular. Thin are the appearances at <hi>Gresham</hi> Colledge, when
the Bearegarden, the Cock pit is thrung'd with Company: If Bartholmew
Faire should last a whole year, not Pigs not Puppet playes would ever be
surfeited of. The wenches could live and dye with Jack-pudding, what
flocking of good wives and Pickpockets to a Ballad? or if at any time a
Mad man have broke his custody, he shall have more followers then pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.
Our <hi>Don</hi> is of this number, who cannot read of a mad prank, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he must augment the sport, and rather then hee'l have no part in the Stage,
hee'l play the mad man.</p>
                     <p>I believe (quoth <hi>Sancho</hi>) the Knights which performed the like pennance,
had some reason for their austerities, &amp;c.]</p>
                     <q>Insanio cum ratione;</q>
                     <p>To play is allowable (quoth <hi>Sancho,</hi>) I have lost my Asse; for me to be
beside my selfe, were a pardonable thing: But for you, who have lost
nothing, but the way home and your wits, why should you be madder
yet? who have a Mistresse, Lady, Queen, (what doe you call 'um) that
is secure of her honour, whom no Prince, Knight, <hi>Inchanter, Moor,</hi> nor the
Devill himselfe would come neer: Why should you run mad? unlesse
that 'tis your good hap, to have such a singular piece, that you need never
be jealous, never keep a spie, never use <hi>Italian</hi> gimcrack, or any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
upon; and doe you therefore surfeit of happinesse, and are mad,
because you have no cause to be so? <hi>Amadis</hi> had a powting slut, a sullen
huzzy, he should have curried her Coat, and ne'r run mad for it. Our

though he gaine but few followers, now by frequent private practises
upon himselfe, as by being quarter Mad, halfe Mad, and three quarters
Mad upon severall experiments, is the full Midsommer Moon madnesse to
be attain'd unto. No doubt he had pass'd the three first tryals, and was
very neer his perfection: The first quarter it is totty &amp; freekish; the second,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57130:80"/>
phantasticall, melancholy and suspitious; the third, quarrelsome and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and then pure phreneticall. Our Knight is now in the increase, he

Sancho</hi> in this censure, discovereth his Masters aptnesse and preparednesse,
for the incounter of Pennance, and that he was a Knight of so great curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
that he went the most appointed, and disappointed, unto any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of any Knight in the World, being at that time the only <hi>Knight-mark</hi>
of the East and West, and alone acted in the empty Theatre of the World.
Captaine <hi>Iones</hi> was many years since downe in the Annals; and now to
see, when his head should be busie composing Love-letters to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> his
Heroick braines are working, where he may finde some wand'ring Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
to mend that scarre of the broken Helmet; But dull-pate his man, upon
the strength of sensitive observations, cannot be perswaded out of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
that it was a Bason. <hi>O curvae in Terras animae,</hi> his Soule was as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
as the Helmet, which the <hi>Don</hi> beholding in the notion and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his new vertiginous braines, left it with <hi>Sancho</hi> till it was uninchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some man of Metall, or else some Negromancer: For it was as sure
to returne to the shape of <hi>Mambrinos</hi> helmet, as his owne face after all his
labours was to be changed, if any would change with him.</p>
                     <p>

Hide. So as they say, if one would present a thing to like one, he should
have sent that. But Paper is the great want. It is a great quaerie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it had not been better the invention had never been, and it had been
wanting still, or that the <hi>Don</hi> had amongst his adventures, destroyed and

dangerous, or of evill consequence; it being the fairest child of foul
Parents, that ever was, converting the <hi>Axiom, corruptio pessimi est generatio
Optimi.</hi> For from rags, Snattocks, Snips, irreconcilable and <hi>super-annuated</hi>
Smocks and Shirts, come very faire sheets; so that had not Writing and
Printing corrupted so faire an invention, by the pestilent matter that they
cast upon it, the project was of great use, as to put under Apple pies,
make Lant-hornes in dark nights, Burn-graces in Summer to save childrens
Faces, and Stomachers against the wind, (as they call 'um) when they are
indeed very cleanly coverts for foule Shirts, (since the fashion of unbutton'd
Doublets) besides the great service it stands Barbers in, for pictur'd Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns,
and Card-makers; and then ends not so unserviceably, but departs
(somewhat blewly indeed) in being matches for your tinderbox. But for this
quaerie, 'tis alike with those of Gunpowder, Tobacco, Printing, Writing,
(whether it had been better they had never been) most men thinking their
inconveniences to exceed their conveniences. Let it alone for me; the <hi>Don</hi>
is to write Letters, and we must have Paper, or somewhat like Paper, or
all the encounter of Madness is spoil'd. But happily, and in a good houre,
<hi>Cardenio's</hi> Tablets supply the defect. You will have the Letter in time, bless

is left grazing, and picking of sallads, which being the only nutriment he
had, did so discolour him, that he might have added a superlative to his
title, and wrote of the most <hi>Ill-favour'd</hi> face. Besides, the crude herbs so
frequently made their green sallies through his body, that all the Field
where he rav'd up and downe, was full of Knight-sharne, and had it been
possible to have got a fire and frying panne, he might have thriv'd better
upon the Tanzies he evacuated, then with the herbes at first gathering.
VVherefore he might very well containe, and most properly usurp that

of his misfortune, he arrives at the Inne, where he incounter'd the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57130:85"/>
Coverlet, and came clean off. But the indignity disturb'd his Valiant soul,
and he is as much toss'd in mind as then in body, and at last resolves not to
enter into the house, though his owne belly, and <hi>Rosinantes</hi> were of the
dissenting party. But while he plaies about the door, he and his horse are
discovered by two of the <hi>Mancha</hi> (the knowing part of the Village) the
Curate and the Barber, who betwixt threats and intreaties, worke out of
<hi>Sancho</hi> all the passage of his Masters new projects, the errand that he had
to his Lady of <hi>Toboso,</hi> and that in Tablets the Letters to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> as also
his warrant, for three Asses were included.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When</hi> Sancho <hi>perceived that the Book was lost, his visage waxed as pale and
wanne as a deadman, &amp;c.] Sancho</hi> not capable of his Book, doth fearefull
execution upon himselfe, and in an instant, unthatches his reverend chin,
that Mr Barber with his Razor or his Tweezers, could not be so expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
He grub'd up all by the rootes, where-ever his unmercifull hands
fastened, and quarter'd his face into a plaine betwixt two thickets, nor did
the rest of his Face scape his fury, which he did assault in such rough man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that he was all gules, which running along the Champion of his Chin,
made a bloody field. Poor <hi>Sancho,</hi> I pitty thy mistaken vengeance, and
causelesse revenge upon thy selfe; and above all, that thou shouldst forget
thine own counsell to thy Master, whom thou wouldst have (if he had
a minde to castigate himselfe) to breake his head against the water, or a
tod of a wooll, or some such favourable matter. But great griefe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
and impatient of advice; The Curate and the Barber stand astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
at his passion, (and forgetting for a time, both their professions) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spirituall reproofe, exhortation, or comfort, came from Sr <hi>Iohn</hi> in the

                        <hi>Both of them took great delight to see</hi> Sancho's <hi>good memory.</hi>] <hi>Sancho</hi> had a
brutish memory, and only serv'd him for the remembrance of his three
Asses, and the losse of his grey Asse. But the Letter to <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> it was
as much from his head as the Tables were from his Breeches; they never
were there, yet the fool ventures on a recitall, and mingling his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
with <hi>Don Quixots,</hi> he rendred himselfe to have as much fancy
as memory: He only retaines that part of it which might have been best
forgotten; (the subscription) <hi>Yours untill death, the Knight of the</hi> Ill-favour'd
<hi>Face.</hi> As to the relation of his Lords wandrings and prancks he
was very punctuall, but his memory fail'd him, as to the tale of his owne
tossing in a blanket, which being perchance a secret belonging to the bed,
he thought it not fit to be revealed.</p>
                     <p>

is a strange transition, that the most wicked, unwarrantable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Order in the world should be at any time capable of the most holy
and sacred: But yet in this also <hi>Sancho</hi> looks to be preferr'd; If he had
peel'd his crowne as he had done his beard, he was in preparation for a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery:
No further could <hi>Sancho</hi> goe or proceed to the hopes of a Fortune in
the Church.
<q>Barba aliquando facit Monachum.</q>
And <hi>Sancho</hi> if he had not disparag'd his Face (with friends to shift off exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
and subscriptions) he might have pass'd for one <hi>Ordinus Minorum</hi>
(as to his wit) but <hi>Superiorum &amp; Majorum</hi> as to his Corps: unto which
when he had another Corps added, what a goodly monke would there be?
But <hi>Sancho,</hi> what thinke you of the Beneficiall Office of Porter to the Lord
Cardinall <hi>Quixot,</hi> when in your gowne (not a Clericall habit of any Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
but welted and crosse-lac'd, with gilded staffe of power in your hand,
and your beard growne downe to the girdle; you have the power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
or refusing accesses to my Lord Archbishop <hi>Quixot,</hi> unlesse they pay
the Turn-key: The Dollars dropping every day into the hand, would make
you looke upon your selfe with good regard. Besides, in that Signiory, your
wife (<hi>Mary</hi>) may be dispenc'd withall, or more, if (as you only are in favour
with my Lord Prelate) you doe require a License in case of extreme cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and supersufficiency. <hi>Sancho</hi> was now in comfort, that go the world
wik way it would, he was provided for, either with an Island, if the <hi>Don</hi> was
an Emperour, or with an Honourable Mace, if the <hi>Don</hi> took into Church-preferment,
which he had lesse mind unto. For though the Porter of a
Cardinall may exercise his power over people without the gates, and sits
there upon his Bench, and from his peep-holes judges of beneficiall Visitors
to his Lord, and then most officiously opens the great gates (as his opinion's
of them) and returnes them out at the Wicket: Yet he bethought himself,
that in the Administration of his Governour-ship he should keep himselfe
such an Officer, and sit upon the Bench in Judicature, advanced aloft, and
have servants, which is better then to be one.</p>

bonum finem nisi sit;</hi> that distinction is not visible in the <hi>Canonists:</hi> But
let it passe, this was a pretty invention, and like to prove a very good
Scene, and the only probable way to reduce the melancholy Knight. Mad
men (as well as mad Girles) love mad toyes: Strong conceits must be
flatter'd, not resist'ed, and when you have humour'd such distempered fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the full of their folly, they will decrease (like the Moon) into
quarters, till at last there is nothing to be seen. Such a course, and with
very good successe, was taken by a Doctor, with a melancholy Patient of
his, who using to sleep with his mouth open, (as he suppos'd) imagin'd a
Mouse had slipt downe his throat; the Doctor perceiving his fancy to be
strongly perverted, concurr'd with him that it was a Mouse, and nothing
else that troubled him, and that he should (upon a little Physick taken) see
the returne of him to his great joy. The Patient desired his dose; and
within a day or two, the Apothecary gave him a slight vomit, which
wrought very well, but at the first and second straines, no Mouse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peard;
whereat, the Apothecary sware, he smelt him comming by the
scent of the ejection, and therefore he wisht him to reach lustily the next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
and he doubted not but to shew him his incroacher, and to make
him pay for a entry and forcible detainer: The next bout, the Apothecary
under care of holding his head, clapt his hands about his eyes, and while
he was expectorating with the other, he conveyed a live Mouse into the
Bason, which the Patient seeing, he highly triumph'd over his disposses'd
inmate, and at once clear'd his stomack and his fancy of the imaginary
Mouse, by the Doctors wise application of a reall one.</p>

pardonable Rubbish, if he had taken the paines to reforme <hi>Sancho's</hi> Beard,

                        <hi>The Hoastesse trickt up the Curate so handsomely.</hi>] So rare a dresse is this
of the Gown, with the guards of black Velvet ful of gashes and cuts, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the <hi>Don,</hi> or whosoever saw her, must needs take her for a distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Lady, and oppressed too, if it were no more, then with that Gowne
upon her back in the middle of <hi>August.</hi> But it seems the Gowne was of
great Antiquitie, and being made in King <hi>Bamba's</hi> dayes, a Prince
that delighted in no fashions, was extreamly ridiculous in King <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bises</hi>
time, who was the most glorious Courtly Prince, and most obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of Modes in <hi>Arabia.</hi> Now what would move one of us easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
to laughter, will worke other effects upon the <hi>Don,</hi> who seeing a
Lady submitting her selfe to his protection, and stiling him her deliverer,
restorer and avenger of her Injuries, would instantly imagine, that some
Villaines, Thiefes, Gyants, or Inchanters, had robb'd her Castle, kill'd
her Knight, stript the Empresse, murder'd the young Princesse, and left
her naked, untill shee was compassionated by a certaine Midwife, who
accommodated her with her Christning Gowne, wherein shee got more
pity, and rais'd a higher desire of revenge in the <hi>Don,</hi> by how much that
more eminent she had been, and especially, that by her muffler he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
she was very tender of laying open her rare beautie to the Sun-beams,
which was another inducement to provoke him, that such a Beautie
should not (and he a living <hi>Knight-Errant</hi>) suffer (unreveng'd) this injury.
These opinions no doubt would surprize the <hi>Don,</hi> beside the uncouth figh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of her Squires face-handle, (by which he might seem to be a longo-beard)
would much amaze him. But more the variegated forme of it, the like
whereof he had not seen upon the face of man in all his Travels: But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
reflecting upon the hubbub, affrights, and confusions of the stormed
Castle, he found, that the present feare and amazement the Squire was in
personally, and the deep griefe that did seize him for his Lords and his
young Ladies, and the sweet Princes Ruines, and his most sweet and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Ladies horrid abuses, did change in a night one side of his Beard, as is
frequent with those, who take too deep impressions of sorrow, to have
their whole haire altered from any colour (except the same) into white.</p>
                     <p>Sancho, <hi>came over to them about that time, and seeing of them in that habit, he
could not conteine his laughter.] Sancho</hi> shews himselfe a man by his proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and though it be the sign of a fool to laugh excessively and often, 'tis the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57130:87"/>
part of a rational man to laugh somtimes, especially when merry objects are
presented. The contrary passionate Philosophers from the same objects
rais'd teares and laughter: A great Argument that most mens actions are
like Mr Curates Beard, <hi>pied:</hi> and that both <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi>
might exercise at once their customes upon them. Mr Curates Beard was
indeed more ridiculous then <hi>Sancho's,</hi> yet <hi>Sancho</hi> sneers at it, having not
seen his own face in a glasse since his first setting forth. Yet the intention
of this foolish Metamorphosis, was commendable in the continuance, and
dolorous in respect of the object; that wise men should permit themselves
to play the fooles, to regaine a perverse and obstinate mad man to his
home againe; let a man judge himselfe, and at night recount his dayes
severall workes, and he will ingeniously (if he be impartiall betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
Jury and selfe Judge) confesse, <hi>Inter ridenda &amp; deflenda tempus esse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum,</hi>
and he might lay himselfe to bed like the Picture with a face of
severall sides, the one weeping and the other smiling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They arriv'd the next day following, where</hi> Sancho <hi>had left the tokens of
boughs.] Sancho</hi> is now neer Bedlam, as he supposeth, and that he shall
find his Knight, out of wits, out of cloths, and out of knowledge. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
instructs him what to doe, and gives him a letter of word of mouth,
(not to be shewn, if he would conquer the world for it) which if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
with that fidelity as he did the <hi>Don's</hi> to the Curate, he may be stil'd
<hi>Mercurio del Fido.</hi> They injoyne further secrecy, that he reveal not the
designe; a thing which he was very well contented to doe, hoping it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to his present installation to the government, and then there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infallible token, that of two things committed to his memory, he
could remember but one, and that was for his Asses, his profit quickning
him in that particular. But as for the Letter to <hi>Toboso,</hi> it crumbled into
such miserable Snattocks, that the Divell could not piece it together.</p>
                     <p>Both therefore arriving quietly under the shadow, there arriv'd to their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a sound of a voice.]</p>

would have been very unseasonable<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> especially in beating out such a

meet with a word and a blow of reproofe. Thirdly, I believe that Mr Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

It was so ravishing a voice, that it was able to compose the troubled
soule of <hi>Cardenio;</hi> who weary with the sad relation of his own Story,
is now at leisure to heare this, which that it may gaine all its grace,
the Author places us a roome off from the Musick, and only in this
Booke, gives us the eccho and falling tunes; but in the next you shall
have the fulnesse of the melody, the Beautie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which he sufficiently invites us to, while he
raises in us appetite, which will not be
satisfied without tasting.</p>

                        <hi>It was</hi> Sancho Pancas, <hi>who, because he found them not in the place where he
left them, cryed out lowdly.</hi>] He might have cried bread and meat for the
Lords sake, (for his halfe starv'd Lords sake) who with hunger and
cold had almost put an end to his Errantry. He cried, and his Knights bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rung noon, and the wood rung of them all; and now they have <hi>Sancho</hi>
in a ring, and round him, untill he have made his Mr as ridiculous as himself.
The whimsy of the Knight, is to be cured with another whimsy, as they
say, set a <hi>fool to catch a fool;</hi> a Proverb not of that gravity (as the Spaniards
are,) but very usefull and proper. For example sake: An English Lord
kept a Fool, a very naturall, who being displeasur'd at some ill usage of
the Family, absented himselfe so long, that the Lord was much troubled
lest he should have made himselfe away; others thought he might be gone
in a visit to a neighbour fool some few miles off. The Lord sent thither to
enquire, and withall, to intreat that Fool over, (in case he was not there)
to their house. Fooles are soon intreated, especially the servant telling
him, that his Couzen had been missing many daies; al's one for that quoth
<hi>Tonie,</hi> I'll find him out, ne'r feare Coz. At last they came to the Lords house,
and all of them, Lord, Lady, servants of both sexes ran out to the Foole,
and wofully lamented the losse of <hi>Tonie,</hi> who was as good as meat to their
bellies. Coz <hi>Tonies</hi> cryed, get ye all <hi>to prayers on your backs</hi> you long

coates (speaking to the women) my Coz is safe enough, he is too wise for
you. Then the foole was ranger of the whole house, and in every place
he came, he cried, O Coz, Coz, are you there. I see you well enough?
Thus having travers'd the best Chamber; at last he came to the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofts,
and with a more hearty and confident noyse then in other places, he
cried, ha Coz have I found you, I see you, that I doe. The other foole had
unpil'd some wood, and lay behind it, then his Coz cried out againe, I see
him, I see him, in very joyfull acclamation: Whereat his counterpart

the place, whence out they pluckt him, halfe starv'd, for he had there but
wooden entertainment; but the Cook got him some spoon meat for his
Coz and himselfe, and they were very well satisfied. Such a dish now
hot in the Plaine, where <hi>Don Quixot</hi> acted more then the Knight of the
<hi>Naked</hi> Arme, would have put an end to the play, and all the bitter usage
of <hi>Dulcinea</hi> would have been forgot in a <hi>Lethe</hi> of settle-braine; wherein if

                     <p>Dorothaea <hi>said that shee would counterfeit the distressed Lady better then
the Barber.</hi>] The Barber might have done much, if he had his wife to
attire him, and set him out in Ladies combings; but I doe not think shee
would ever have let him shav'd off his Mustachoes for the matter, it being
the only hold she had, (for his haire of his head was but thinne) when shee
found occasion to pull him to her pleasures, or from the Alchouse to his
paines. Let him be honest <hi>Oxen-sterne,</hi> the Lady <hi>Nicomiconas</hi> servant

him, and send him home <hi>Knight-Errant</hi> on foot, if he paid not, what his
Squire and Himselfe had eaten. Lastly, for his obligation to his Lady,
there was no feare, but of himselfe: For who could damnify her, who
had nothing to lose, not so much as credit? and for his personall injury to
her, he had sufficiently done it in his Pennance, which had so mortified
the man in him, that all the wealth he had would not repaire him into a

beaten path of truth, and take that way which made most expedition to his

Thieves; and questionlesse with the Pathetick expressions, which he was
singular at, the <hi>Manchegan</hi> could not choose but melt into pity and reliefe,

all; but the severe rebukes end all in a generall pardon, (which though the

such, as he could call his Souldiers all by their owne names; <hi>Seneca</hi> could
remember all that ever he wrote or did, others what other men do, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their owne. Some remember more then they should, and some
not so much; and those whose memories are pitched very low in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part of their heads, are so long before they can pumpe out what
they have treasured up, that they remember not at a first or second time,
but at a third. I have heard of one of so strong observance and retention,
that if he saw a man but once, he was able to tell him a long time after,
how many buttons he had on his doublet, what kinde of shooe-ties, band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings,
and hat-band he had at their first meeting: The chiefe matter is
constitution, use, and liking. A well tempered braine remembers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
habit strengthens, and perfects; and like old men, what we have a
mind to and affect, will be remembred well enough. So it is with the
Queen, whose owne fancy setting her upon this designe, (except the
first halt) went very cleverly on with the rest of the story.</p>

on a Black, his Royall Robes on, and the glittering Ensignes of his men,

dry. Water's like Butter, 'tis good for any thing, and according to the
play of what is it good for, it is good for <hi>Sancho's</hi> foule mouth to wash
it cleane after the telling of so many lyes to his Master. It was good for his

civility, thrift, abstinence, and such like personated parts and customes at

ingenious, pardonable, and profitable, then our duller wayes of Billiards,
Kettle-pins, Noddy-boards, Tables, Truncks, Shovell-boards, Fox and

and proclaiming a free accesse to that sport, the worke-men from
all places came thither, and by that meanes with his brewings of Beer, and
<hi>Brewin</hi> the Bear, he got his worke done, and yet every day did play. Mine
Host hath another benefit by his books, or his wife rather, for it seems he
was a fiery cholerick man, and the book was her security, as long as he
was reading, shee was at quiet; a very good recipe for either sex that
are troubled with the Alarum of the tongue. Romances may be very
well read by women in such cases, and not as <hi>Maritornes</hi> the fousty slattern

The Hostesses daughter is also smitten, but dislikes the blows that are given,
shee cannot indure severing the head from the body. Those indeed were

                        <hi>Peace (quoth the Hostesse) for it seems thou knowest too much of those matters,
and it is not decent, that maidens should know or speak so much.</hi>] The daughters
of those mothers (who have been in the oven) are forward and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standable
of womens matters, sooner then other children. The egs that are
hatcht in an oven, bring forth spirituous chickens, and they commonly prove
of the game. Mine Hostesse and her daughter were as like as one egg to
another, and like Mrs, like maid too; <hi>Maritornes</hi> serv'd the Carriers, if
they pleas'd the best sort: The rebuke might very well have been spar'd,

was fearfull shee should too much lay open <hi>secreta Domus,</hi> especially the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

modesty into their impudent breasts. My young inheritrix of the Inne
would not have any man call her <hi>Tigre</hi> or <hi>Lyon,</hi> shee was gentle as a Lamb

quick and phantasticall blades of your employment, that have hundred
witty Remoras for their guests, which they cannot escape for the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of them, nor dislike them for the invention. One of them having some
guests that lov'd Larks, said, I will fit you with such a service of Larks
as you never heard of the like before: how, Landlord, quoth the Gentlemen,
what part of the skie proves your net, that you have such heavenly food!
The Inne-keeper soberly (as his custome was) replied; gentlemen, The
Larks come not to me by miracle, nor doe I take Quailes for Larks; But
these birds my servants catch, indeed, the rarity is their tast, as you will
find at supper; for (marke me Gentlemen) in and neer the Fields where
these pretty warblers resort, I my selfe set Garlike and Onyons, which the
birds feeding on, have such a naturall <hi>Hogou,</hi> that no French Artizan is
able to make a higher, but for fashion sake there needs no sawce, and it is
alwaies disht severall, that the Larks grand tast may be found to be from
its selfe, nor is this all the vertue that comes from my device, for (Gentlemen
be confident tis true) I have preserv'd of the young ones, and train'd them
up to sing, and they have learn'd instantly; but then by reason of this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
food, which I alwaies us'd them to in their Cages, O what throats
they had! what melody they made! no Canary Bird hath reach'd so shril
a note, the Nightingall not clearer, and that you may be confirm'd in the
truth of it, you shall have a Cage brought in, and as they sing, (though that
aire be sweet and desirable) you shall smell easily by what arts they come
to have their pretty pipes so cleer. This is very strange replied the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen.
If this be strange, said mine Host, what think you then of my brother
at the next signe, who hath taught foure Robin Redbreasts of severall
growths, as he had chosen Musitians, to sing in parts, which they have done
long, to the great delight of all his customers. But unhappily an envious
Bard of the Towne, seeing the birds have more custome then themselves,
gave one of them Allom instead of Sugar, and so spoyl'd the Consort, so
that now I believe my Larks will carry it for musick, from all the birds in
Town or Country.</p>

thereby to gaine Customers; so that keeps our wits in action, and aemula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
preserves our trading. <hi>I</hi> had some guests that were very unapt to sleep
any where but in their own houses, which when I once understood, against
their next comming I made a pretty perfume of many odours, and amongst
them mingled Poppy leaves, and would you thinke it? the composition
wrought so effectually upon their braines, that whereas they heretofore
awakened all the house in a morning, now they would not have awaked
if the house had faln upon their heads. When they were up, the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
was of the sound sleeps and pleasant rest they took; to which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
nothing, but that I had given speciall order for the making their beds.

famous for catching a monstrous Eele with his horse hoofe; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
through a Marsh, a loose naile stroke into the fish, and held it: Being

(for he swore it was as thick as his sign-post) and the manner of taking it,
attracted much people to his house, for he had stuffed the skin for a shew,
and made it bigger then any Conger. This story swamme a long while,
untill it was drown'd by a brother of ours, who being a great fisher, troll'd
for a Jack, which he had observ'd often, and was of a wonderfull growth,
wherefore furnisht with tackle accordingly to the worth of his prey, he
threw in and sodainly she pouch'd his bait, and held him play for an houre
before he could bring her to land, then he presently disgorg'd the fish, and
upon the opening, out flew a Wild Duck, which it seems the Pike caught
as it made a stoop to the water; the Duck by reason of the closenesse of
the place it was in, and being grip'd at the catching, could not fly far, so
that he came home with double prey, and justifies this to be no flying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>

comming late, the Host told him all the Chambers were taken up, except
one, which he durst not commend to him, because of the Spirits that did
disturbe any that lay there. The Gentleman said (mine Host) with your
leave I will lie in this spirituall room, and wil venture my flesh amongst 'um.
Mine Host disswaded, but could not prevaile; wherefore a good fire was
made, and supper in good time brought in, the guest was instantly for bed,
his Landlady and Host bidding him good-night, in as sad a tone, as if it had
been his last farewell, he had not lain long after the candles were burnt out,
but the Familiars were upon his bed, squeeking and running upon his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
for the redress whereof, he took one of the bed-staves, and as they came
in his reach, he laid a Spirit sprawling, and thus plaid the Conjurer, untill
they were weary of <hi>Phairy</hi> Dances. In the morning he lookt upon the floor,
and found himselfe victor over a score of Rats, and calling for his Host, who
came gladly to him, he shew'd him his Devils, that had lost him the benefit
of that roome so long. Mine Host wondred with himselfe, where the Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunt
should be. The Gentleman looking behind a vacant place, found
a tub and three quarters full of feathers, and being quick of apprehension,
conceited they quarter'd in that warme corner; wherefore he desir'd a
Kettle of water scolding hot might be brought in, which he sodainly
poured into the tub, and immediately there was sogreat a cry of the scalded
Vermin, as made mine Host thinke the Devils were in the feather-tub, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the drown'd Rats, which were many, were thrown out, and the Devils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

                  <p>I shall not make any literall observations upon this story of the curious,
Impertinent, but only labour to satisfie Mr Curate, who having read and
lik'd the penning of it, yet stood incredulous to the beliefe, supposing it a

winding up of the whole matter.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> cannot imagine, that any Husband would be so foolish, as to make
so costly expence, for the purchase of a staine.</hi>] Mr Curate, to
corroborate, confirm, and illustrate this History by many
examples, is the best way to reconcile the credit to it, and
first in your own way. <hi>Abraham</hi> durst not let <hi>Sarah</hi> passe
for his owne wife, but agreed with her (while she travell'd
through a strange Country) to go by the compellation of his sister, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
(had no divinity interrupted the events,) he brought his wife into great
danger of her honour. But Mr Curate, I shall endevour to give you more
pregnant proofs in the next relations. It was in the Country of the <hi>Orientall
Saxons,</hi> where a man offended much that he had no child by his wife,
took a mad course to obtaine his desire, and condemning himselfe in the
case of insufficiency<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> absolv'd his wife, assuring his thoughts, that change
of Person would remedy the businesse; the chiefe matter was to affect his
wife with his plot, and obtaine her consent; which he did by often sighing
and lamenting his condition, who was bless'd with a fortune, but could not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57130:108"/>
tell you how, or to whom to dispose of it; it was his earnest desire, that from
her body, that comfort might be rais'd unto him, and he should esteem it as
the fruits of his owne loynes, whosoever could give her the right contagion.
The woman wearied out with such plaints and importunacies, yielded to
one single tryall. Her Husband had before hired a young lusty fellow
to doe this drudgery, who was so happy in his experiments, that he made
himselfe a father, and got his Chapman a child. The thing done, he came for
his wages, which was ten pounds promised; but the Chapman fell from his
word, and would not give him but half, though he had not done his work so.
In conclusion, a sute was comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where the supposed Father was cast, and censur'd to pay what was behind to
the true one.</p>
                     <p>This next vindication of the possibility, and facility of such fond and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
actions in some men, comes from the septentrionicall part of those
<hi>Saxons.</hi> In the times of those wars it fell out, that a proper young <hi>Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>

behaviour, he purchas'd esteem and honour, even in the Garrison
of his enemies, who were very industrious to get a change for him, though
no allurements could worke a change in him to forsake the side he had
once ingag'd for. One of the wealthiest inhabitants did dote upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and parts, and grew so enamour'd of him, that he did invite him to all
liberty of his house: He did not refuse the offer, but was an often guest at
his table, but with that caution, reservednesse, and circumspection, that the
more he frequented the house, the more stranger he appear'd: Insomuch
that his free and open Landlord wondred at his solemn mode, fearing that
his guest might not think his curtefies reall, because no greater pleasance
and alacrity proceeded from him, at the reception of them. And having
watch'd an opportunity, <hi>Deere Renigard</hi> (so was this <hi>Chevali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>

his entertainer, I hope you have not the least suspition, that these my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
are feigned, dissembled, or politique, but are such as they seem to be.
I have not yet learn'd to make my Table a snare, or to catch <hi>regall Birds, by
laying salt upon their tailes.</hi> The freedome that I give you, is as fubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
as it is open. I account my selfe happy in the placing them on so meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Person; let me not be unfortunate in this only, that you cannot think
so. Or prithee tell me, is there any thing wanting, that other places per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
afford you, &amp; being the stronger recreation, with-draws your liking
from our defective entertainments? I know (be not afraid to confesse) that
such complexions are not only recreated with Feasts, Wine and Musick, but
naturally incline to a <hi>Lais,</hi> or a <hi>Corinna,</hi> as the Complement of all joviallity
and freedome. <hi>Renigard</hi> smil'd at his prophetique quaeries, and told him,
not without a blush, that he had not for a long time been acquainted with
an <hi>Utile ad purgandos Renes.</hi> Why law you now, said he, you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
this that would make a horse melancholy; now I can give you <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
cheer.</hi> To morrow night (<hi>Deer Renigard</hi>) you must sup with me, and
vouchsafe to take a hard bed too. It shall goe hard (friend) if your second
course like you not better then the first; and so I leave you this night, that
I may make you worthy entertainment for the next. Both departed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
highly exalted; <hi>Renigard</hi> wishing it a <hi>Barnabies</hi> Night, or such as <hi>Iupiter</hi>

had with <hi>Alcmena,</hi> that this and that following were come together. His
Landlord (carefull providore) omitted no cure to compasse all that might
delight, and having effected that, which he counted most difficult, he
went the cheerfuller about the culinary part. The next day ended to
both their joys, and <hi>Renigard</hi> repair'd to his entertainments, wondring
where his living banquet would be procur'd. A supper was provided fit
for such appertenancies, and every dish had sawce of a most stirring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Insomuch, that <hi>Renigard</hi> had great conflicts with his flesh and the
provisions. His Landlord supplyed him with fresh provocatives, saying ever
and anon,
<q>sine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget Venus.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ha quoth <hi>Renigard, Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres</hi> are in abundance here, but where's
your <hi>Venus?</hi> within a stones cast, said the Landlord, leave you that to me;
the Lady of the Table wondred at these loose discourses, but replied no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
having charge from her Husband, to give no place for feare of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
from her. Wherefore in a glasse of wine, she gratified <hi>Renigard's</hi>
mirth, and was now assured of his acceptance of her entertainments, by
his cheerfulnesse and merry discourse. My Landlord and he had mutuall
froliques at the Table, and charg'd on the other very home, untill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
lights admonished them of the night, and forthwith he was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to his Chamber, a very well furnish'd roome, where sorts of delicacies
were on a Cupboard in dish-glasses, offering themselves to his tast or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.
His entertainer took solemn leave of him, wishing him the pleasures of
the night, and so departed, only saying in his eare, I have not forgot thee
<hi>Renigard,</hi> be confident I have not, and then withdrew.</p>
                     <p>A thousand thoughts and feares surpriz'd our Chevalier, he casts in his
mind, what the reason should be that he knew not more circumstantially
and punctually of the person or the time he should expect.</p>
                     <q>After such various and delightfull food
Soft sleep might come, and that would be as good.</q>
                     <p>Why might he not suborne a common Strumpet, in place of a bedfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
who would give the reward of such unjustifiable pleasures? yet he
recomforted himselfe, calling to mind that the artifice was all his friends,
unto which he had scarce concurr'd, but in a smile or shrug: Surely the lawes
of Hospitality would prevaile with him, not to mischiefe him he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
into his bosome with such strong signes and demonstrations of
sincerity. In these varieties of disturbances, he thought the bed would best
compose him, and either remove 'um by the promis'd satisfaction, or allay

waking, when his Chamber door gave a gentle creak, such as confess'd the
opener sorry for the noise it made, and instantly a stately Lady in her

her selfe with a large glasse, and after in some other parts of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

the Curtaines, and to his griefe, spied it was the Lady of the house, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<hi>Cupid</hi> do's not sleep though he be blind, unless pillow'd on his mothers breast;
come (saith he) arise and follow me. In that amazement he was obedient,
and resolv'd to goe, though he knew not whither, desiring his Landlord
that he might carry his weapon with him, (not without it for the world
said the other) then he usher'd him into a closer Chamber, and more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and bid him enter the sheets, they were warm'd <hi>sartagine vivÃ¢,</hi> and
if he took cold, it would be his own fault.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Renigard</hi> laid, his Landlord left him to the sweets of the night, and hop'd
(he told him) that the change of his lodging would not displease him, and
so remov'd. He found in a short space, that his Landlord was in earnest, and
that the Lady came into his chamber for the purposes presum'd, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to be put in execution. Small Courtship pass'd betwixt them now,
the Castle being surrendred before capitulation, only <hi>Renigard</hi> embracing
her very amorously, begg'd her pardon, if he made bold a while with his
Landlords Quarters: And shee to excuse her frailty, answered, you could
not (worthy Sr) have <hi>ingresse</hi> or <hi>egresse</hi> here, without my Husbands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
<hi>Renigard</hi> knowing <hi>volenti non fit injuria,</hi> and having two to please,
spent no more time in words. In the early morning his Landlord came
againe, and with great sigre, of inward contentment reattended him to his
first Chamber, (as fond of him as he was of his wife.) Thus Mr <hi>Curate,</hi> you
percieve that these tame tempers are in the world, &amp; every place yields not
such obdurate hearts, that desire to ingross and inclose their delights. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
(even in that particular) is allow'd by many, who rancking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with Beasts in their sensuall appetite, applaud the liberty of <hi>Animals,</hi>
and without any

                     <p>Account it naturall, congeniall, and proper to their constitutions to
runne in common, and to lay no stricter obligations on their wives, then
themselves. Singular was the answer of that Gentleman, who being

more then a Towne-<hi>Bull,</hi> a <hi>Cock,</hi> a <hi>Boare,</hi> or a <hi>Horse:</hi> An excellent two-legg'd
Stallion. Short of these are those soft dispositions, who have rested
contented after the knowne violation of their beds, and jealous-headed,
have not found out the praevarications of their spouses, until some four years
practise in disloyalty; this is patience perforce, and not so punctuall, and

effects, as indiscretion did in others.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Clarissimo</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> (a dignity not inferiour to that of the Roman <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricii</hi>)
liv'd in a port and fashion above any of the place, being a man of
vast revenews; and had in addition to all his other blessings, a Lady of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
beauty and chastity, in so high a degree, that though it be
naturall to the soyle, the <hi>Clarissimo</hi> was not jealous, nor us'd those customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
restraints on his wife, that others did, exposing her to publique view,
and priviledging her with the liberty of entertaining his friends or her own,
(as oft as they were call'd) in person, unvail'd and unsuspected, so that they
were counted them iracle of <hi>Venice,</hi> she for her transcendent beauty, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57130:110"/>
the old Noble man for his indulgencies and permissions. Her irreprova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
demeanour, and disposition to please him, gave him great cause to
suspect and grieve, that the default was on his part chiefly, why that faire
Copy was not taken out, that <hi>Lucina</hi> was never yet call'd upon for helpe,
and that no lovely pledges plai'd about his Hall. On the other side the
Lady (ever honoured for ignorance; like that innocent soule, which was
join'd to a Husband of a most impure and noisome breath, never fain'd
any dislike at it, imagining all men had smelt alike.) The Lady I say knew
not, but she was as well serv'd as <hi>Niobe.</hi> But the old <hi>Signior</hi> was resolv'd, since
he had depriv'd her of her Virgin honour, to recompence her with the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and dignity of a mother. But how to effect it, was <hi>res ardua;</hi> how
should he with hopes of any success, communicate so foul a design to
her chast ears, with whom, even lawful delights were not admitted without
a blush, and some modest aversenesse? Doubtfull, and beyond measure
troubled, his rest fail'd him his countenance chang'd, his sprightfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
and galliardnesse abated, which so deeply affected his pious consort,
that in sympathy shee refus'd all those contentments, whereof her Lord
could not partake.</p>
                     <p>The Lady innocent, and assured that no cause was given by her, depor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her selfe in silence, not presuming to enquire whence these alterations
did arise, but applying comfortable cordials, and what ever would che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

to such perswasions, it was most necessary to accost her first,
without whose consent all the rest of the project would come to nothing.

thy eye single out one, whom if I like for quality, as well as thou for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonablesse
and ingenuous favour, I may, if we continue issulesse, adopt into
my Family. Of this faile not, as thou wouldst perpetuate the life and name
of him, thou never yet in the least circumstance didst offend. <hi>Euphema,</hi> so
was this accomplish'd Lady call'd, made no scrupulous demurs to her Lords
desires; and since the businesse was to be transacted in the Church, she was
confident the sanctity of the place, beside the holy exercises, would guard
her from any undecent gestures, thoughts, or carriages. Moreover shee
knew her selfe a Temple, into which no prophane thoughts had ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
unresisted, and unreplied; nor did shee (and rightly too) account
those thoughts her owne, which she forthwith was in Armes against, and
summon'd all the <hi>spirituall Posse</hi> of her soule, to expell as invaders and
deadly enemies to its happinesse and pious tranquillity. Violent intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
upon devout and sacred mindes, are Diabolicall suggestions, and such
as Crown the vanquishers with honour upon earth, and immortality and
glory afterward.</p>
                     <p>The day came, when deckt like the Altar, she went to the Church with
an humility and reverence due to the place, with eyes fastened unto the
earth, she knew she came from, and was to returne to, then advancing
to her seat, private short devotions ended, she join'd into the publique
worship, which being begun, rais'd a condemning, but selfe-absolving
blush into her cheeks, that shee had lost any part of the Oraizons, staying
for the other pinne, or hanging on her watch. About the middle of the
Anthem, she remembred her Husbands injunction, who all the while had
riveted his eyes to hers (not till then removed from the Psalter, unlesse to
Heaven; when her exalted affections mov'd by holy impulses, and efficacy
of the matter, lifted them up to the Author from whence they came.) Not
<hi>Cephalus</hi> durst pursue the destin'd object with such certainty, as his eye her
motions; And perceiving her twice or thrice to fix upon one person, it
was sufficient to confirme him, that <hi>Padri Casimire,</hi> who read the Masse
was the man; nor did shee upon her Lords inquiry deny, but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> he was
the only object of her eye, all the service while, wisely concealing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of her intentivenesse on him, whom she knew a man of great devotion,
Religious without ostentation, and of an extraordinary strict life, and
customary charity to the poor, strangers and prisoners. If her Husband
meant well in this eye-service, the good Father would incourage him in it,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57130:111"/>
but if he had any evill, sinister designes, such was the gravity of his person,
integrity, and known austerity against any wicked practises, that reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and admonitions, and upon an obstinate preserverance, canonicall
charge would follow; so that secure of her marke, she rejoyc'd greatly that
no other object had diverted her eye. <hi>Impotentio,</hi> that was the old <hi>Claris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo's</hi>
name, the next day dispatches a loving letter to <hi>Casimire,</hi> reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
him to honour his house, and therein intimates, that he desir'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
with him, about some scruples, which did a little disturb the quiet of
his mind.</p>
                     <p>Nothing was more affable and willing, nothing more able in all manner
of knowledge, but especially in <hi>practicall Divinity,</hi> and cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
so that the courteous invitation wrought not so powerfully on him, as
his owne propensity and readinesse to give those helps and satisfactions to
any, that were desirous of them, which by his function he was ingag'd to,
and by his great knowledge and experience he was inabled for. <hi>Euphema</hi>
had been foure years join'd to <hi>Impotentio</hi> and <hi>Casimire</hi> was the Priest that
knit their hands, which caus'd <hi>Euphema</hi> to bestow more then ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
on him, in respect of the mysticall tie where in shee was bound, and
according to the Tenet of the <hi>Church,</hi> accounting <hi>Marriage</hi> for a <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
did not conceit so rudely and uncivilly of her conjunction, as if it were no
more then saying, <hi>I Ione,</hi> &amp;c. Looking upon the estate, wherein she was
now plac'd, and that from whence shee came, she could find it but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from chastity to chastity, from <hi>Virginall and continuall abstinence,</hi> to
a moderated and <hi>restrain'd indulgency of permitted pleasures.</hi> And though
her Husband was a sufficient barr to excessive dallyances, (yet knowing no
other, then that it was so with every man) she labour'd to lessen his rare and
seldome fruitions, by subduing her own flesh rather then his. This day
in honour to her spirituall Father, was an extraordinary Feast provided,
and about the season of the day <hi>Casimire</hi> came, and was entertain'd by
both of them, with respect, affability, and cheerfull lookes, worthy of his
person, parts, and function. And in dinner time he took occasion to bless
himselfe, and them too, who were so conspicuous for their mutuall loves,
that he receiv'd no small respect among the People, because by him they
were united, who attributed much of the blessings and happinesse of their
lives to the consecrated hands, and effectuall and intentive prayers, which
flow'd from him at that solemnity. A matter little set by in other places,
who care not whether their Priests lips preserve knowledge, or their hands
confer a blessing.</p>
                     <p>Dinner ended, and some competent time spent after in Table-discourses,
<hi>Padri Casimire</hi> and Signior <hi>Impotentio</hi> went together into a large Gallery,
where the Merchant pulling from his breast a paper desir'd his Fatherhood
to read those heads of his troubles and discontents. Which being twice or
thrice perused by <hi>Casimire,</hi> at last with a great sigh, taking <hi>Impotentio</hi> by the
hand, (Sr said he) and are my strongly conceiv'd hopes dash'd so sodainly?
know you what these papers containe? even a divorce to all your joyes on
earth. You desire to know first, whether it be lawfull for the conservation
of your name (an evident impediment being on your side) to find a supply,
and Proxie of your own election, who shall be <hi>Loco Patris</hi> to the wife by
making her a mother. It is as just a reason, as if a Thiefe for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57130:111"/>
of his wife and family, should provide himselfe of the next house he
could breake open, or the next man he could rob. The conservation of your
<hi>species,</hi> and endeavour of continuing your name and nature upon earth, are
very justifiable, and warrantable actions founded in Nature, and without
which
<q>Res erit unius aetatis populus virorum.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>One age would be the period of man-kinde; wherefore they were not
to be discommended, who under pretence of <hi>Equestrian sports,</hi> made a prey of
all the Virgins that came to the sight, satisfying for the present rape with an
after-marriage. Their dearth of women at home enforcing them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
in time from their neighbours, lest their Nation should end in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for want of posterity: Yet none of these usurp'd the beds of such as
were married amongst them, or thought it lawfull to abuse those Husbands
who were not bless'd with issue. Much lesse doth any History afford men
of so stupid and low soules, who would prostitute their wives to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that they might be supposed Fathers, be known Wittals to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and panders to their own beds.</p>
                     <p>It is not with women as trees, there you may inoculate, and set strange
grafts, not so on them without spoyling the stick, and unbarking that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which is vitiated and corrupted by the approach of outward air, and for
want of the genuine covering and naturall security it was plac'd in. The
more generous of sensible creatures, permit not variablenesse in their
mates, but punish their delinquencies with death, and the assaulter too, or
else die themselves in the revenge, abhorring so tame and degenerate a
complyance, as to look on, or enjoyn it. The men of Primitive times, or
the Golden Age (as they call'd it) in case of their defects, took to themselves
Concubines, and obtain'd from them, those comforts which they would
rather have had from their legitimate consorts. But these men multiplyed
themselves, they did not hire journy-men to doe their work for them, nor
rejoyce in a Changeling, as it were a child. But to all this you answer, that
the impotency and fault being on your own side, your are bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to recompence the wives patience and defraudings with something
answerable to her expectation. If you were (Signior) <hi>frigidus antÃ¨ nuptias,</hi>
then you should not have adventur'd upon Marriage, it being <hi>nullitas fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementalis,</hi>
and a just cause why your wife should require her dowry
back. Or is it any fascination or Witchcraft, whereby you are <hi>frigidus
quoad hanc?</hi> then you must use holy meanes, and the assistance of devout
persons and prayers to disinchant you; the Church in such cases hath not
lost the power of Exorcisme. But the remedy you seek, is worse then the
disease, to give your wife to the Divell Body and Soule, because a part of
yours is impedited by his ministers. Or if your frigidity be from the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

or involuntarily, hath lost the propriety in his wife. But a resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is most unmanly and impious. How can two indispensable vows and
bonds be by consent broken, unlesse one may consent to doe what he
hath articled never to doe? how can you permit your wife to be a Whore,
(unlesse you misplace or misunderstood the words, <hi>for better for worse?</hi>)
Againe, would you give another leave to call you what you make your
selfe, or your wife by that title which you have impos'd upon her; or (if
your spurious designe prosper not) would you try the <hi>Piatza</hi> over, and make
your selfe <hi>Notissima Fabula mundo.</hi> You have vow'd to be hers, she likewise
to be yours, and what shall be borne of her, to be both yours and hers. A
stranger intervening, breaks all these ingagements; you plainly with a

because nor Father nor Mother would owne them, but expos'd them to

Father, priviledge that at home, which you would severely punish in
such incontinent persons abroad. <hi>Impotentio</hi> was very much disturb'd
with these rebukes and reasons: (but yet not disswaded) which change of
looks <hi>Casimire</hi> taking for a remorse, and outward signe of inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,
did not farther nettle him; but said, the conviction of your
forehead puts me in hopes of the conversion of your heart, which I hope is
alter'd by this discourse from your first intentions. A blessing on the cure;
and so giving him his benediction, the good Father departed full of hopes
and joy for his new convert.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Impotentio</hi> waited on him, fearing his wife might be inquisitive to learn
some what of him; but the good Father knew that such discoveries, though
not in confession, were of dangerous consequence if reveal'd, and therefore
with a look as cheerfull as when he came first, having given a <hi>Benediction</hi>
to his daughter, (freed from suspition by his plausible countenance) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
to his Covent. <hi>Impotentio</hi> champt upon this bit of <hi>Casimires</hi> a day

                     <p>That he had often commerc'd with a Merchant of <hi>Angli-terra,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
youthfull, handsome and ingenious, in very high credit on the <hi>Piat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi>
and on whom the <hi>Clarissimo's</hi> many of them cast an eye of more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
regard, and often call'd him to their Tables. The gentleman was a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
man, and very rich, so that <hi>Impotentio</hi> promised to himselfe successe, if his
vigilant wife were not impregnable, nor to be surpris'd. The next Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
his fortune was to meet him, and having saluted each the other,
the <hi>Clarissimo</hi> desired him, to honour his house that day with his company
at meale. <hi>Sanguine Vernall,</hi> such was the Merchants name, intimating his
unworthinesse of so high respect, said, he should hereafter endeavour to
make himselfe capable, and for the present he would be indebted for the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57130:112"/>
entertainment. Our Merchant was not acquainted with the <hi>Venetian</hi> humor,
&amp; therefore summon'd up all his cautionary rules, circumstances and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
which either his friends, or his own observations had enrich'd him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and having heard very much of the fame of the old Signiors Lady, her
beauties and accomplishments, he resolv'd to double arme himselfe, and
set a watch upon his eye and tongue, for there was subject enough for either
to be luxurious on. From the <hi>Piatza</hi> they went off together to <hi>Impotentio's</hi>
house, which was one of the stateliest buildings of the City, a Receipt for a
Prince, but that it entertain'd a Goddesse; for <hi>Euphema</hi> comming into the
dining Room, so transported our Merchant with her lustre, that he knew
not presently, whether he should salute or worship.</p>
                     <p>But presently restor'd by the melting Corall of her lip, he sate down
with civill confidence, inwardly admiring the severall confluences of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that his eye beheld, and could no where, but there behold. At dinner
he durst not let his eye beguile his mouth, nor wander on the womens side,
which made him eat like a Mad man, not minding what he took, nor how
it went downe, and <hi>Euphema</hi> (as shee was an excellent dissecter of the
Creature) carving to him some speciall fowle, the puzled wight gave her
his us'd plate instead of the servant. The <hi>Clarissimo</hi> gave him the boon cheer
in a lusty glass of Wine, which being by one of the Gentlemen presented
to him, it was his wish, the glass had been the spire of a Steeple, and as
narrow as a pin-case; for all that while he might have viewed, unsuspected,
the Face which had set his heart on fire, not to be quench'd by such a glass,
though it had been fill'd with <hi>Alpine</hi> water. Wherefore imputing the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his draught to the goodness of the Wine, which was to be drank
with no hasty, but with deliberate pallat, he said, <hi>Signior,</hi> other <hi>Clarissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo's</hi>
drink Wine, but you <hi>Nectar,</hi> and a <hi>Philoxenus's</hi> neck were not an
ill wish to him, who would take a right <hi>Gustow</hi> of it. And craving ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
glass, he presented health and happinesse to the Lady of the place. The
Table's remov'd, <hi>Clarissimo</hi> and <hi>Vernall</hi> retir'd into a very faire Garden,
and a little behind that, they enter'd a grove of Trees, and delicate walks
every where betwixt 'um. The Trees were so plac'd, that their Armes
shot into one another, and were so closely interwoven, that the vernant
and aestivall Sunne beames could not pierce their rare imbroydery. In
this secret of the house, <hi>Clarissimo</hi> will now disclose his intentions. Such
designes as these were <hi>Lucifugous,</hi> and would not endure the face of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
wherefore opportunity and place adding courage to his purposes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<hi>Sanguines</hi> hand, he thus accosted him, who wondred with
himselfe, what would be the end of so courteous beginnings, but <hi>Caesar</hi>-like
accounting his fortunes in himselfe, he said, <hi>Sanguine, feare not:</hi> when
<hi>Impotentio</hi> gravely and resolutely confess'd; it is not the custome of this
place, (friend <hi>Vernall</hi>) much lesse of men of my Port to afford strangers
such liberty, as you this day have found. But your lovely person and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did

it either by signes, writing or talke, no not (if we are both of an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
to the Priest. <hi>Sanguine</hi> call'd to minde the <hi>Venetian</hi> absolution after
<hi>renunciation of the faith,</hi> and with these ensuing cautions to be <hi>praemitted,</hi>
he promised secrecy and assistance. <hi>Signior,</hi> said he, if so be the secret be

abode to be true to, nor my owne Country, whose weale I have sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally

and amaz'd. He left her mixing threats with entreaties, and gave her
some small time to consider in a back Chamber next to her Bed-Chamber,
which he vow'd was to be her Death-Bed, if shee refused. In this great
conflict was the disconsolate <hi>Lady</hi> full of fears and teares, and amidst those

owne, yet being as docile as an <hi>Elephant,</hi> and of as precious Teeth,
by often teaching and practising, her Lady had so instructed her, that
upon the motion of her fingers, eyes and head, nothing was unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that <hi>Euphema</hi> commanded. By these signes shee took instant
notice of her Ladies intentions, and the <hi>night-Piece</hi> provided to put them
with all hast in execution.</p>
                     <p>By this time the two transported persons were at the chamber door, which
unwillingly open'd, as sensible of the ensuing mischiefe, and abhorring to
give quiet entrance to such wicked visitors. <hi>Impotentio</hi> kept up his cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
looks, and said, Dearest, thou art still the same <hi>Euphema;</hi> but yet
remember, unto what <hi>Planet</hi> more then any you are subject; she who
rules and predominates over the sexe, permits a monethly change, thou

the Sutor, that if <hi>Impotentio</hi> had not shut the doores upon 'um, he had
Fac'd about, and never made stand againe; But as the Devill would have
it, Rats, Cats and Dogs will make head, if they cannot fly any farther, so
<hi>Sanguine</hi> lockt in his Armour, charges boldlier: Madam, said he, were
not the way made by my loving friend your Husband, many preambles,
much Oratory, and a great deale of Court-ship were requisite to a worke
of this nature. Besides, my stint of time abridges all thought of Ceremony
and complement, which I am not wanting in to Ladies of your quality;
but what is defective in language, shall be made up in performance, that
you shall (I hope to the honour of <hi>Angliterr</hi>) prove the least <hi>Talkers to be the

that time is precious, and not to be plai'd withall. Let no scruples
seize you, Madam, concerning my ability or wholesomnesse; my looks
speak me sound, ther's no <hi>Compurgators</hi> like the complexion. Your <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan's</hi>
(unlesse by name) are unknowne to me, nor came I from my own
Country, after the chargeable experience of the <hi>Bath, Guiacum,</hi> or the <hi>Tub.</hi>
I will not make apologies, hoping I shall cleare my selfe (Lady) in your
judgement, and to your great satisfaction, and your Husbands joy, when
by your owne confession he shall know, he did not delegate to his servico
one unworthy, or unfit for the deputation. I stand upon my credit with the
<hi>Clarissimo,</hi> to keep my reputation, and with your Ladiship, to beget it.
Madam, speed to the tryall, wherein, such is the confidence of your new
servant, that he shall thinke himselfe most happy, in having the beautifull
<hi>Euphema,</hi> Judge, witnesse, and party in the businesse. Sir said the Lady,
you are in place of my Husband, and your commands are his, give me the
civility of withdrawing, and you shall not long be unprovided.</p>

predominate in him, choler licking up all the rest of the humours, and
converting them into it selfe; his dyet below <hi>Lescius</hi>'s would scarce make
an excrement, that he might compare with a Mouse for the rarity of it;
his parched body, black and withered flesh, and rusty haire, shewed that
the fire was great within which made such a Chimney-piece. Lastly, His

Lyons skin (which was the pattern of most of these short robes) came not so

                        </gap>. Water is good for any thing: It will part dogs, it will make
Pottage, and howsoe'r and wheresoe'r the Barber found out this recipe for
a dead sleep, it was no dry device, <hi>Veritatem Ã¨ puteo hauriunt tantam,</hi> the truth
of it is, the very Probatum for a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> and drawn out of a deep well
cures a deep sleep. The Moon was alwaies beholding to the Pleiades, for
waking of <hi>Endymion.</hi> I doe believe the Barber learned it of a Mountebanck,
and 'twas first taught him to awaken drunken customers, who fell asleep in
trimming-while, and with the sprinkling of this <hi>Frigida,</hi> were restor'd to
their senses againe, and paid for the nap, as well as the snip. But the
circumforaneous <hi>Emperick</hi> rais'd his Fame, in using this admirable Element
upon any other disease. An honest Farmer in some of the Townes, (where
the Inhabitants at their proper costs and charges paid for being cheated
every Market day) was a long time vext with a <hi>Priapismus,</hi> which is <hi>tentigo
sine voluptate in instrumento generationis.</hi> To this Mountebanck he repaires,
who having remedies for all diseases, could not be ignorant in this; and
having told his tale, O saith he! <hi>gravis morbus, acutus, perniciosus;</hi> but that
you may see that I love your Person more then your Purse, I will presently
send home, and prepare a remedy for you, come an houre hence to my
house, at the signe of the Cat and Fiddle, and you shall not faile of ease.
About the time the patient came, and being brought into a private room,
the Mountebanck said, (Sir) here is a Bath made with the coolest herbs that
can be got in this place, and the most soverain Spring-water; for in your case,
every ordinary water will not serve; therefore be confident, that after halfe
an houres plounsing in this Bathing-tub, you will be eas'd of your paine.
The silly Farmer followed his advice, and the effects prov'd answerable to
his expectation, wherefore well sous'd and duckt he came forth, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanck
demanding of him, how it wrought with him, and whether the
tumour were not allayed, and his paine vanisht? The fellow answered with
chattering teeth, (but not where they did) that it was pacified, and giving
him a Fee, departed. The Mountebanck could not conteine, but acquaints
his wife with the simplicity of his new Patient, and his disease, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
her, that his servant should prepare the same dose for him every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
the Mountebanck being one day abroad, the Farmer came for his
Cure, which his wife then, having opportunity, provided, and chang'd his
cold Bath into a hot, but a very crosse Bath to the Mountebanck, and a horse-Bath
to her selfe.</p>
                     <p>He was preparing double Fees for her, but she said, I am contented, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and paid, and told him, if this Bath lik'd him better, he should with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57130:117"/>
convenience use it oftner. But the simple fellow not using to the Bath, so
oft as he did before, one day the Mountebanck spying him, call'd him, and
smiling, said, well friend, I hope you are perfectly cur'd now, farre better
then before, for you put me not into the best Bath which your wife hath,
and the vertue of it yet remaines, whereas your cold Bath cool'd for a day,
and the next morning all was as it was before. The Mountebanck shak'd
his ears, (as if he drank base wine) and giving the fellow back his first Fees,
and cursing him for his second, desir'd him silence, and not let any man know,
or of the cold or hot Bath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He laid himselfe on his knees before the Curate, and said; well may your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>

it; which being rashly unveil'd, startled the bold discoverer, so that
he stood extatiz'd at that Picture, whose person and substance his soule
thirsted for. It was <hi>Euphema</hi> in her haire, at full proportion, in a blew
rich embroyder'd Mantle, preparing for bed (as the fond <hi>Clarissimo,</hi> the
first night he met her, would have it pourtraicted) in golden letters; on
the top of the piece was set <hi>Aetatis</hi> 16. and in as rich Characters under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,

                        <hi>Sanguine</hi> was singularly well pleased with the excellency of the Tune,
but more really heightned with the matter of the ditty, which assur'd him
of the neer approach of his desires; and forthwith a gentleman lighted
him into a Chamber of much rich furniture, and in it a stately bed, and
not far from that place a side-Table rich, and deckt like an Altar, he
follow'd his courteous conduct, who opened one of the Curtaines of the
bed, where he discovered his <hi>Euphema</hi> lay. The convoy presently depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
leaving him to his privacy, with a Virgin-waxe-light, in a golden
Candlestick, supported by a brace of <hi>Cupids.</hi> Every thing was admirable,
but the <hi>Venetian</hi> Paradise, which he was straight to enter, would not
permit him to fixe upon any subject but its owne selfe; wherefore with
Pigeon speed he flew into his <hi>Venus,</hi> whom he found laid averse, and with
her face from him. To whom he softly, said, Madam, 'tis improper
now to be coy, and therewithall he insinuated his warme hands into her
Bosome, which was as soft as silke, or the choice Downe of <hi>Swanns,</hi> and
with all gentlenesse turn'd her about, her face being cover'd with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tissues, he coveted to behold, and labouring to unveile her, Madam

her sooty fists, did so affright and terrify the poor naked gentleman,
that he wish'd himselfe transform'd into any thing, but of a Hog, for feare
of being possest. These Clamors brought back <hi>Impotentio,</hi> jealous that
his designe was interrupted by some scurvy accident or other, and entring
into a <hi>Patritian</hi> night-Gowne, and rich wast-Coate, with his sword in one
hand, and in the other a Pistoll prim'd, finding <hi>Sanguine</hi> in a distraction,
and the cause of it at his heels, apprehending the delusion, <hi>Osperma Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli,</hi>
are you an Actor with your <hi>Westphalia</hi> Armour, I'll try if it be proofe
(said he) and immediately discharg'd a Pistoll at her, which lighting on
her shoulder plate, bruis'd and wounded the poor <hi>Moor,</hi> that shee roar'd
out so hideously, as if shee were going to her winter quarters, and falling
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57130:119"/>
to the ground, with her hand pointed up to Heaven, and then downe to
the Earth, intimated that the Powers above would send 'um both to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

                     <p>
                        <hi>Euphemae</hi> hearing the Pistoll goe off, came into the room in her Night-dresse,
and a black Velvet Mantle over her, with a Book in her hand, but
beholding the sad mishap of her bleeding servant, shee ranne in to her suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.
<hi>Impotentio</hi> was directing his Rapier unto her Breast, when <hi>Sanguine</hi>
(untill then melancholy) interpos'd himselfe betwixt her and the imminent
danger, beseeching the <hi>Clarissimo</hi> to abandon such a mischiefe, which though
it happily befell that Hell-Cat, yet this act would never be forgiven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
or find pardon amongst men. But <hi>Impotentio</hi> raging with revenge,
and with eyes and hands, menacing, that what was now intercepted, should
not long be deferr'd, spurning at her, with language sharper then his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers
point, and more wounding; said, Whore! have you us'd me thus?
Shee turn'd her head about from the <hi>Negro,</hi> and only replyed; my Lord,
that word is not yet my due, and I have done all this that it may never be,
and that your name may not be read in the vaine Register of easie natur'd
men, or mine amongst that of over-kinde Ladies. Then turning on her.

by a hazardous interposition of your person, proceed to higher vertue,
and save, protect, and vindicate that, which unto me is dearer, (and ought
to be so to every generous soule) a fame unspotted, a chast Breast, and
the honour of a yet undefiled bed. Here are but two of you, and three
Thieves and Murderers. My Husband (and then shee wept abundantly,
will posterity believe it of a Husband?) seeks to kill me for that he
should wish me a thousand lives: And both of you, (the worst of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers)
have conspir'd to deprive me of a Jewell the Heavens bestow'd on
me, and I have vow'd to keep. Have you not read (Sir) turning to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,

to preserve chastity, argues her soule not of the same hue with her course
outside, and proves you foule within, and the worse <hi>Negro.</hi>

                     <p>Have you not read, young Gentleman, (sure did you goe further then the
sixth Commandement) a prohibition against this very sinne? will you

and so biting his thumbes, a sign of fixt and determin'd cruelty, he left her,
calling for a servant to draw off the <hi>Moor,</hi> and conveigh her to a lodging,
where for want of timely dressing, shee almost expir'd. All but <hi>Sanguine</hi>
and <hi>Euphema</hi> were remov'd, who took her gently from her knees, weeping,
and imploring Heaven for protection. In pure desire Lady of saving

                        <hi>Euphema</hi> hearing his blasphemies, and Hell-borne <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> fell againe

then calling Heaven to witnesse, and assist her constancy, shee
drew from that part, where her buske was us'd to be plac'd, a Ponyard,

                        <hi>Sanguine</hi> was somewhat startled at her quaeries, yet as for his mother
he was secure, being on the worst side of fifty. But his Sister was very
young, and deare to him, and at that time about his breast hung her Picture,
set in a rich Ovall, which recalled her to his memory fresh as if she had
been present, which he was willing to divert, and therefore he desired her
Ladyship to presse these points no farther, unlesse in bed, where, being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the sheets, they are most properly treated of. Then <hi>Euphema,</hi> quite
out of hopes to convert him, or make him any way sensible of his errour,
resolved to try one weapon more (and if he persisted) after that to end her
life upon the Ponyard.</p>

                     <l>Of bastard issue, which thou boasts to lend's,</l>

                     <l>And kisse those Babies as thine own, and blesse</l>

Madam, said <hi>Sanguine,</hi> I should kick her, her Barnes, her Stallion into
the aire unto the Prince of it, (their <hi>Ghostly Father</hi>) but innocent Lady,
though it be true, every one should do as he would be done by, and harme
watch harme catch are good rules, yet at this time they are misapplied, and
quite beside the purpose. And to be true to you (Lady) I have no Mistris
of that nature; then straight <hi>Euphema</hi> rejoyn'd:
<q>
                           <l>Suppose that I were she, as who can guesse</l>

                           <l>Couldst thou accept me for a wife, who have</l>
                           <l>Wrong'd my repute before he's laid t'th' grave?</l>
                           <l>Sure a pure Chrystall would more pleasant be</l>
                           <l>Than a Speekt glasse tainted by venemous eye.</l>
                           <l>O change thy mind, thy hopes may not be far,</l>
                           <l>Preferre no Falling to a Fixed star.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At these words <hi>Sanguine,</hi> brought lower than his knees, fell prostrate,
and beseeched her Ladiship that she would pardon his bold solicitation.
And calling Heaven and Earth, Angels and Men to witnesse, All that he
feared hereafter, or desired, if, Madam, (said he) you and the Fates decree
me to that happinesse, and at once provide to blesse me both in soule and
body, it is not seven yeares expectation can weary out my patience; nay,
those yeares (though I wish not the prolongation of my felicity) repeated
would make me value my purchase the more by the gratefull stay before
fruition. And I shall wish to perish to eternity rather than adde a thought
more to this loathsome sute. I hate my selfe now for it, (I cannot say more
than I love you) but I hate my selfe perfectly, villaine, monster of my
Sexe, that came to spoile the miracle of hers; unlesse your clemency raise
me from this place (Madam) I will grow to it, and not looke to heaven
(that is, not you in the face) untill I find your serenity in assured forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of what is past. <hi>Euphema,</hi> confident that these expressions were not
feigned, said, Sir, Your repentance doth oblige me to remission of past fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
and your protestations of fidelity are so high, that I will not question the
faith of the speaker, or have the least scruple of doubt about it. Absolved,
and credited, (my trusty and well accounted servant) let us in a noble and
just conspiracy joine to elude my husbands fury and suspition both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which cannot be but by a seeming losse of that ehastity, preservable
in being supposed lost. I have heard much of Platonick love, now I will
make experience of it, and in that height that <hi>Impotentio</hi> shall be satisfied
in my obedience (as he calls it) if the dutifull submission to so base an Act
can please any long. And as for you friend (when the just time for such a
motion shall permit) I am to be challenged upon the promise, which I shall
not recede from, you using the modesty and reverence of a Sutor. <hi>Sanguine,</hi>
upon these words, religiously kissed her, and confirmed his perseverance
in all chaste and civill deportments to her for ever. There hung by the
bed-side a rich and glorious Cymitar, and they entring together the same
sheets, it was laid betwixt them emblematically, designing the danger of
violated oaths, or else as a Ceremony preceding (after the manner of espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Queens) and ratifying the Contract. <hi>Sanguine,</hi> (no doubt) wished the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57130:121"/>
crooked weapon edgewaies upon <hi>Impotentios</hi> last thread of life, that it
might prove his <hi>Atropos,</hi> and make a short cut to their desires. But check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his recoyling thoughts, he asked the Ladies leave to charme her eyes
asleep with this ensuing Song.</p>

Wittall to <hi>Euphema,</hi> and joyed her by the name of <hi>Mother;</hi> kissed her, and
bid her love his friend, who had done more far for her than her husband
could. It was my griefe (said she) to find it so, though he hath proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a man of honour, reputation, and ability, and hath laid the seeds of
a long trust in me. It should be so (said <hi>Impotentio</hi>) but let us thinke what
Gossips we shall have; The Duke will not deny me I am sure, and the great
Monsieur <hi>Le Spraffe, Leiger from France. Sanguine</hi> replied, nay Sir, thinke
me not so able (though 'tis pretty well with me) to get Children o'r night,
to be borne men the next morning; we are sure of our Workmanship accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the naturall way in due time, but for miracles you must not
look. While they were in these discourses, in came an old maid-servant
very ghastly with watching all night, wringing her hands, and crying, Oh
my Lord, Oh my good Madam, what shall betide me! the <hi>Moore</hi> is dead,
and in the piousest manner, as we could guesse, as any Christian could dye;
her hands often lift up to heaven, sighing and making signes as if she cared
not for her own death if her Ladies were secure, and for want of timely
salves expired in my Armos. Woe is me that she died in my Armes! I
shall never thinke well of my selfe for it; I have lived these fifty yeares
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57130:121"/>
with my old Lord, and truly no body ever died in my armes before but
your Lordships gibb'd Cat (rest his soule) that died of a bone crosse his
throat, and I kept my bed a month upon it, and what will follow after
this who can tell? The foolish story of the old nurse-woman troubled <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentio,</hi>
who loved <hi>Fuseilla</hi> (though his Slave) for the love of his wife to
her, and it in wardly grieved him that by his rashnesse she was destroyed.
It was not long after that he sickned himselfe, reflecting deeply upon the
murder of the <hi>Moore,</hi> (which was openly bewailed) but the deepe touch
of Conscience for the abuse of his most constant wife was the maine stab;
it was never well with the poore creature after that libbing fellow was in
the house.
<q>
                           <hi>Hoc tibi</hi> Penelope!</q>
What be as bad and worse than her luxurious Sutors! and now that his
foolish brutish humour was fulfilled, the inhumanity and barbarisme of
the Fact stung him worse than <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Vipers, hearing the fall of her
Amours to <hi>Marke Antonie.</hi> Little <hi>Ascanius</hi> too must play in his Hall, the
long brand of his dishonour; and he reputed his, though no man could
believe it; wherefore disturbed in mind, and every day decaying in strength,
he intended to make a quiet end, though he lived, since the time of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
very pettishly: Considering also that the abuse of his wife was his
own invention, nothing was more worthy in his imagination then to hate
her for obeying his will, and submitting upon force and execrtable threats;
and below his anger it seemed to maligne the fruit which he himselfe inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated;
wherefore he sent for his brother, and reconciled the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
their Families, and satisfied his expectations, confirming his eldest
son in a faire estate; then, sending for <hi>Euphema,</hi> said, we are now private,
and you see how fast I decline, there is no dallying, nor hypocrisie to be
used, a small moment being betwixt me and my account; wherefore as I
desire it whither I am going, so I heartily beg your pardon for my rash and
ridiculous rape upon your Chastity. Conceale my folly, (faithfullest of
wives) though what I have done cannot long be kept close. Let his name
be (if a Male) <hi>Potentio,</hi> and do thou endowe him as his manners shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
deserve. The Child is innocent, (pointing to her rising mount) and
fruits of this nature, though they grow wildings, prove rarely off the tree,
and become Queene <hi>Apples,</hi> the delight of their Princesses, and fervants of
great trust; a more generous <hi>flavour,</hi> and vigorous <hi>contagion</hi> giving influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
at those stolne and illegitimate births than when legall duties are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
'Tis not therefore that you should be ashamed of him, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
his active spirits, which that I may improve unto him, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrixship
of all is thine, and thou canst not hate what with such paines
and dolours thou must dearely buy; the Quarrels betwixt my Brother and
my selfe composed, thou wilt have no trouble but this stripling, and then
he sigh'd and wept bitterly, being almost at his last gaspe; which <hi>Euphema</hi>
perceiving by his short breathings, instantly fell down on her knees. 'Tis
pity (worthy soule) to let thee go out of this world deceived, in that thing
too which you do most repent of, and in whom you think the grand ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of your house will for ever survive; Depart, Sir, as to that matter, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in this discovery. Here is <hi>Ascanius</hi> and <hi>Astyanax</hi> the hopefull issue
of my impurity, and drawing from underneath a fine wrought silken
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57130:122"/>
rowle absolv'd him of the jealousie. This is your <hi>Angliterra</hi>-man, which
according to the times of growth, hath been lesse or bigger, pardon my

<hi>Sanguine</hi> is as innocent as this rowle for any act with me, nay more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
for Heavens forbid, he should ever have come so neer me. <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio</hi>
made a spring up in his bed, and kiss'd her, and forthwith dyed,
having confirm'd her in a vast estate, and left her Convert to be her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,
those dayes of publike sorrow over, they married without the
intervening of a Cymitar.</p>

been hidden, if her gentlewoman had not been educated and instructed, at

Ladies resolv'd to take their recreation; they were very richly set forth,
both men and women; yet the unusualnesse of such apparell, and their ill
management, and odd carriage in their bravery, made them suspected to
the Inn-keeper, that they were not what they would be reputed, or else

their wings. But the variety of their habits distracted him more then all,

Marshall'd the dishes, being <hi>Sewer</hi> and gentleman of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
himselfe; at a round Table they sate, and intermix'd, a Knight and a
Lady were very handsomely checquer'd; and <hi>Daplusee</hi> and <hi>Periwiga,</hi> were
the best train'd paire there, and had seen fashions abroad, and were now
trickt up in two great Ladies new Gownes, which was a customary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57130:124"/>
the <hi>Mounsieur</hi> ow'd his wife, and at this time his wives friend, before
the Sutes were carried home: Insomuch, that his <hi>Daplusee</hi> was the most
noted for new Dresses and shifts of Apparell of any where shee liv'd; but
the <hi>Protean Tayloresse,</hi> nor her Husband <hi>Akillouse,</hi> could never be found in
the same shape above once, that their neighbours wondred where she had
supplies for their various Wardrobe. Shee undertook the carving, and
handsomely dispens'd the cheer about; but not with so good grace did
the men carry it out, who, some slovens, and some penurious, very much
disparag'd their apparell and their Ladies. For <hi>Mounsieur Suteur</hi> was
espied by his wife, scoring the reckoning of Jugs, and quarts of Wine, by
the losing a button on his doublet for the one, and his sleeves for the other.
Insomuch, that had not <hi>Daplusee</hi> taken him a Button lower, his whole set
would not have serv'd the turne for Supper-account in liquor, for his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<hi>Gallinego</hi> the Vintner, and <hi>Flounderferkin</hi> the Brewer did so ply his little
body, and his Brothers <hi>Clippochopo</hi> so hard, that they were not able to endure
the narrow precincts of their new clothes; but unbutton'd all, and lost at
once, wits and reckoning. Their Ladies are very joyfull to see them so
cheerfull, for they were never fit for Ladies indeed, but when they were
a little <hi>Monkey,</hi> then they are all Love; the prettiest Cubs to play withall,
that <hi>Paris Garden</hi> affords, then you may command all, that is, their purses,
which nothing will open, but the disclosing juice of the grape. Dame
<hi>Corpulent</hi> accosted their slender sisters, and told them, lacing so close spoil'd
their breaths, and did very much infringe the liberty of their bodies, and
for example sake, shewed them by what meanes themselves came to the
full extent and widenesse of their skins; which was express'd by dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
a lusty Rummer of Rhenish to little <hi>Periwig,</hi> who pass'd it instantly
to <hi>steepen Malten,</hi> and shee conveigh'd with much agility to <hi>Daplusee,</hi> who
made bold to stretch the Countesses Gowne into a pledge, and <hi>Cover</hi> and
<hi>Come,</hi> which was the only plausible <hi>Mode</hi> of drinking, they delighted in:
This was precisely observ'd by the other three, that their moistned braines
gave leave for their glibb'd tongues to chat liberally, then every ones Sute,
Gorgets, and attire were censur'd, their fancies compar'd, every one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
the others, and highly praising their Husbands liberality,
when perchance they were the presents that some welcome servant had
gratified them with. From themselves they proceed to descant on their
neighbours; and (good lack) what faults they found every where. Mrs
<hi>Almond</hi> the Confectioners wife is much set behind, because shee wanted a
good Dresser, and never was pinn'd handsomely, but her things stood
awry. Mrs <hi>Figg</hi> the Grocers wife as much condemn'd, that she had not
yet left off her Hat, and put her selfe into a Bag; and such a one had spoil'd
all her teeth before shee was eighteen with Sweet meats, that shee never
durst laugh without her handkerchieffe, otherwise the woman was a feat
one. And Mrs such a one never came abroad powder'd enough to take
away the scent of her body; which was the cause shee never came neer the
fire. But above all they admired Mrs <hi>Spruce</hi> the Parsons wife, who though
shee were crump'd-shoulder'd, and had other imperfections, yet her
cloths were so neatly contriv'd, that being drest, shee seem'd as straight as
an Arrow. A good soule that, and never miss'd the good wives <hi>Club,</hi>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57130:124"/>
was an example to the rest, and carried the businesse so quickly, that after a
good rowze or two, no more signes appear'd, then if shee had been with her
Good man at the Exercise: Others of their sisternity (very weak headed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
frail vessels) carried not matters so well for want of use and experience,
which in a short time would be perfected. Then from that to childbearing,
and what easy labour Mrs <hi>Touch</hi> had, and how pretty a boy, and how kind
a man Mr <hi>Touch</hi> was, who let her have her will in every thing, which no
doubt is a great helpe toward the facilitating those matters. It is so tender a
soul, that if she should but look awry, 'twould make her miscarry; for she is
true Touch, and never misses. And then to the differences of Midwives,
how comfortable <hi>Dame Short</hi> would speak concerning patience and stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in those cases, before shee had drank Sack and Sugar, and after it
how fluently her tongue walk'd untill the time came to shew her skill,
which shee alwaies perform'd with such successe, and was so skilfull in
<hi>Phisnomy,</hi> that those signes and resemblances (which we poor women
could never discerne) were made so apparent to our Husbands, that they
found the child to be their own by the countenances, and those marks which

speech and incouragement fit for women in those plights, they are harsh
and imperious also, enough to scare them more, then the businesse it selfe.
From such Midwives good Lord deliver me, and when the time shall come
againe (saith Mrs <hi>Clippochopo.</hi>) Let Mrs <hi>Short</hi> be for my labour; I love a
short cut of it: It will not be long first, (saith <hi>Corpulent</hi>) Mr <hi>Clippochopo</hi> do's it
to a haire, and to that good houre, or whosoe'r it shall be next; we fat
women are not so good Breeders, 'tis true, but we envy not your forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as shall appeare by this full Carowse, and to you <hi>Steepen Malten,</hi> to
the next rise amongst us, be it right or wrong. Softly that, said <hi>Dame
Suteur.</hi> All this time the Knights play'd it at <hi>Dutch Gleek,</hi> and had so vied it,
and revied it, that they were all <hi>Honours</hi> in their faces, and <hi>Toms</hi> by their
stradling, and now they are for their <hi>Tibs,</hi> who had plaid faire, and made
never a <hi>Reneg</hi> all the time. The Knights went every one first to his owne
Lady, and then his friends, and did so smouch them, that the lippe-frolicks
were heard into the Kitchin, which fetch'd up mine Host, who very much
welcom'd his Noble Guests, and joy'd to see the strong affections they
bore to one another. He ask'd their Ladiships, what refection they
would have before bed-time. All were for a Sack Posset, you shall have
one, you may swimme in, (said mine Host) Quickly then (said the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
with expedition Madam, and with spice enough. In this space,
they agree to ly in the grand bed, and to avoid errors, they dispos'd of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for the first paire, female on the out side of Male, Male next to that
Male, then two females, next two Males, and a Female utmost. Thus
they made all secure, by the contrivance of their wives, whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at the instant were the quicker. Fresh lights brought up,
came a Cauldron of <hi>Posset,</hi> which the Host (fully satisfied of their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity)
had besprinkled with some <hi>Pulvis Crepitorius,</hi> the Inne-keeper staid
and saw such mannerly feeding, that he bless'd himselfe, and thankt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57130:125"/>
that posset was no meat that he lik'd, much good doe you Gallants
said he, this is lusty stuffe, warme, and wholesome. True <hi>Myn-here</hi>
(quoth <hi>Steepen Malten</hi>) we shall not heare of this againe; But for your
goods, quoth mine Host, and wishing them good rest, he sent his maids to
attend them to bed.</p>
                     <p>Foure handsome Girles presently appeared and proffered their service,
but the Ladies desired only to know the places of conveniencies, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
them. And with good speed they did <hi>Abigail</hi> it each to others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
all being ready for bed, they had very much ado to make the Knights
(laden with posset and Canary) to observe the order of their bed-postures
as was prescribed. After a small rest, the Posset work'd with a powder, and
from the north side of the bed <hi>Steepen Malten</hi> gave such a warning piece, that
alarum'd all the quarters neare her, and <hi>Corpulenta</hi> (being her selfe a petty
garrison) returned two guns for one; <hi>Daplusee</hi> and <hi>Clippochopo</hi> laughing so
violently at it, broke into consent with them, and did peale it about, and
sometimes ring the Changes so merrily, that the continuall noise wak'd the
dull Knights, who no sooner stirred, but <hi>Flounder Ferkin</hi> gave a broad side,
which almost spoiled all the tackling of the bed, and now the other three
upon the report of the last, like <hi>Block-houses,</hi> did so play their great Guns,
that there was nought but smoke and stench, the Wind being in every ones
Face. It was a night of high service, and great action, but the wind a little
appeased, a storme came suddenly, the men running to the Close-stooles,
the women to the Looking, or Leaking-glasses, (where they sate not so
sweet as Roses and Flowers in a garden-pot) but wondring at the mischan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
each complained, and heard one anothers tailes very dolefully, crying,
It was never so with me before; O, I have plaid the beast, saith another;
<hi>Daplusee</hi> could not hold, but went to it without measure; and Dame <hi>Clipp.</hi>
wished for her husbands Bason, these utensils would not conteine; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they were enforced to the Chimneys, where like Hawkes on a
perch they <hi>slic'd</hi> it, while their Males were for <hi>casting</hi> and <hi>muting</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It began now to be day-light, and by the waggery of the Hoste the
Musitians were tuning, but alas their Cats guts were instantly out-sounded
by the loud musick within, which so confounded them, that they could not
heare themselves; wherefore they sent for their <hi>Hoboyes, Cornets, Sackbuts,</hi>
and other great Instruments, and then the aires within were higher and
hotter than those without, which put the Musick to a retreat from the
doores. But they knock'd at length, and sent the Musick a reward by a
maid-servant, which was of a good smell enough, though the Bringer very
nicely held her nose whiles she gave it; The Maid call'd for more help, and
forthwith the foure girles, whose hands they refused over-night, were
scarce sufficient for their night-worke; But <hi>Daplusee</hi> had so sweetned the
maids in the Palme, that they began silencing without missing, and mine
Hoste, understanding the lanck state they were in, provided very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Caudles for my Dames, and a Gallon of burnt Clarret for the
Knights, which (with the reckoning) went down very current and glib.
Their stomacks at ease, they resolved to dine nearer to the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to stay any longer at that Foule nest; so they called for the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who put the horses in readinesse, and received them againe, a great
deale more comfortable carriage than they were before. And now we
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57130:125"/>
must returne to <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> where by this time the <hi>Don</hi> is uninchanted from
sleep, and no sooner awakened, but his Squire <hi>Sancho</hi> brings new feares up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and destroyes all the Designe of the Kingdome, the Government,
and his hopes of the Princess of <hi>Nicomicon,</hi> which puts the Don upon fresh
actions, as you may hereafter read.</p>

Yes indeed (Sr) so it is, we be <hi>Three</hi> may be inscrib'd over our heads,
and no injury to the Reader, for we are no small fooles. The Queen of
<hi>Micomicona</hi> is turn'd to <hi>Dolla Roba Bona,</hi> wife to the Duke of <hi>Andalusia</hi>'s

                           <l>The red Sea of his foule Phlebotomy?</l>

                     <p>I (Sr) said <hi>Sancho,</hi> when his head was struck off, then these Rivers of
blood flow'd from him, and in the tide his head also ran from us. Mr
<hi>Quesada,</hi> I intreat you act not beyond the play. Al's done, the Knights done,
the Squires done, the Ladies done, and we are undone; good Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into your selfe againe, for you have been <hi>Errant</hi> too long; have you
no conceal'd Royals, Dolars, or old Gold quilted in your doublet or wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?
This blood cals with a vengeance, mine Host cals, his wife bals, 'tis
not the blankets, a tosse or two into the aire will satisfie; The Asse (my
Lord) will be laid by the eares for it. Pray look about you, doe you not
smell the Fe Fa Fum of the Gyants blood? Here is the Gyants skin, this
wine-bag pierc'd indeed by your <hi>Killsa-hog,</hi> poor <hi>Borachios,</hi> would they
had been in your belly, (not for my part) then my Asse had gone for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
but to part with it for a dry reckoning, and with dry basting too,
for that will be the end of it; Sir, can you heare it and not weep, not for
the Asse Sir?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If thou dost well remember, I told thee when we were last here, how all that
succeeded here was done by Inchantments.</hi>] Sir, said <hi>Sancho,</hi> were the hoysts
in the Blanket an Inchantment? is mine Host (the same foule beast now and
then) an appearance? a Vision with all that load of flesh upon his back?
'Tis true, he hath prov'd a Devill incarnate, Wife, Daughter, and Maid to
me, and your turne is next, for you have a very ill-favour'd score at the
letter <hi>Q.</hi> which stands for your whole name. Give me my clothes quoth
<hi>Don,</hi> will your search your pockets (good Sir,) or feel about the stiffnings
where your hoard lies? what dost tell me of scores (quoth <hi>Quixot</hi>) think'st
thou I'll take chalk for cheese, were they hundred of <hi>Scores,</hi> am not I able
to sweep 'um off with a wet finger? <hi>Sancho</hi> sigh'd at his high phrensie, and
weeping for fear of the losse of his companion, the Asse, well Sir said he,
shew your selfe a man of your hands then this time, and deliver us from
this chalky way: I tell thee <hi>Sancho,</hi> I will not leave thee, till thou hast seen the
<hi>Milky way,</hi> and I have made thee and thy Asse a <hi>Constellation, Dyonagri</hi> I'll
have you call'd. This Milky way is even home againe (thought <hi>Sancho</hi>) to
the Dairy at the Mancha, and my poor Asse must be a Stallion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am inform'd (beautifull Lady) that your greatness is annihilated, and your
Being destroy'd, for of a Queen, you are become a particular,</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>Don</hi> would
have said (if he had consider'd the condition shee was in) that her Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was augmented by the proliferous <hi>Contagion</hi> of <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Don,</hi> and untill this instant <hi>Errant;</hi> the Magicall Father <hi>Don</hi> is at hand
to justifie his worke, which though it were a deed of darkenesse, yet it will
come to light, without your man Midwifry; nor was it in his thoughts,
to diminish your abilities at the acting of it, or require them, the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57130:126"/>
being a single Duell without partners or Chirurgions: And as for
the Gyant so lately beheaded by you, the witnesses are alive that saw
your valour. The Host here made a serious interruption, and told him to
his teeth, that the Gyant was two wine bags; Foole said the <hi>Don,</hi> they
were the Gyants two wine-pipes, for he had every thing double, but his
head, and that doubled with us two: But the Host commanded silence, the
<hi>Don</hi> proceeded, and embold'ned the Lady to slight her <hi>Negromancing</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and reply upon his armes for restitution;

                     <p>Who hath endeavoured (Heroick Sir) to rob me of my person, my State,
mine Honour, and what is most tender to me, your good opinion of me?
I am all the same, (except this misconstruction) and my expectancies as
high of your performances as ever. Drive home, Sir, your great designe
and mine, and I shall accompany you unto the journies end. To you I
attribute these beginnings of my joy, these Noble friends, who never had
set eye on me, but that your name, like a Land-Mark, guided them to this
Inne. Give leave most sufficient Knight, that these may be joy'd witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of your great actions, they shall not need to lend a hand to your assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
the fame of your motion, and approaches to the place, will be a

battle, wherein you are to gain me what I long desir'd, and your selfe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
fame, which you deserve.</p>
                     <p>Don Quixot <hi>having heard her, turn'd him to</hi> Sancho, <hi>with very manifest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of indignation.</hi>] O unpolisht Knight; not so much as an obeisance or
the bend of <hi>Mambrino</hi>'s Helmet to the Queen, after her so eminent and
clawing Oration! But fury doth transport him, and choler against his
Squire hath wholly invenom'd his spirits, which are as fiery now, as they
were dasht before. Now he will vanquish all Gyants, Knights, Monsters
and Squires, in the person of <hi>Sancho</hi> in <hi>saeculae saeculorum.</hi> One <hi>emanative</hi>
blow, shall transfuse it selfe <hi>vigore &amp; impulsu agentis,</hi> unto the right eares
of all lying Squires in the world, who being call'd to the proofe of the

<hi>aflation</hi> on the right cheek, and justice themselves worthy of Cuffs a piece
for their paines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Good my Lord replyed</hi> Don Quixot, <hi>I doe highly gratisie the honour that is

more mealy-mouth'd then the Knight of the <hi>Ill-favour'd face?</hi> words I'll
promise you very shrewdly plac'd, and to good advantage (for the
trepidations about the rescue of the slaves, were not off the <hi>Don</hi> nor <hi>Sancho</hi>
neither) and a friend in Court is better then money in Purse. This was
a sure Proverb with the <hi>Don,</hi> and much of his direction. Now thoughts of
action are laid aside, and the <hi>Don</hi> too for a while. Roome for fresh Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,

I shall strive to equall by the like, where a Christian Lady fals in

being enforc'd to try her womans wits to compasse him: But the <hi>Don</hi> a
while will deprive you of the tale, being very highly taken up with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Learning, most unhappily seizing his head, when he should
have put bread into it, in collation Time; A thing very few Scholars or
Souldiers are guilty of. So that by the practise of those Professours, the
<hi>Don</hi> should have little correspondence or interest in either, yet in his owne
person he seem'd to be compacted of both. His Man-like, dreadfull and
<hi>Ill-favour'd</hi> Face, render him a sonne of <hi>Bellona;</hi> his lank Barebone sides, a
sonne of <hi>Minerva,</hi> wherefore he undertakes both parties, though with a
resolution to vilify and undervalue Learning. Behold the wise, politick,
and Learned <hi>Vlysses,</hi> and the rash, stout and magnanimous <hi>Ajax,</hi> bound
up in one <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> and a Theatre of Knights, Lords and Ladies, with a
crowd of Clownes, Cockscombs, and other Auditors all assembled to
heare who shall winne <hi>Achilles</hi> Armour. It had been very well for the
<hi>Don</hi> (if that such a prize had been at stake) for his owne Armes were most
pittifully batter'd, antique, and rusty. But here was no reward for his
Oratory, go it how it would, only empty praise, yet successe in Armes,
as he promised to himselfe, in the design for the Kingdome of <hi>Micomicona,</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey seem not to understand well, (great confluence of
Queens, Princes, Peeres, Knights, Squires, Ladies, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and Commons, who knew not that <hi>Minerva</hi> or the
great Goddesse <hi>Pallas</hi> is equall Goddesse of Arts and Arms,
and that the Purple of the Field as well as the schooles, the
green Lawrell of the Barre, and the gilded Lawrell of the
Standard, are both her <hi>Donatives,</hi> Largesses, and rewards, and though shee
appeare as often Armed, as in her Candid, and pure Robe, yet these men
of the Quill very much ingross her to themselves, and will allow us men
of the blade, a very small or no share in her. Something indeed it is they
say, that <hi>Shee</hi> her selfe being the off-spring of <hi>Iupiters</hi> braine, <hi>Sine Matre
Filia,</hi> they may lay greater claime to her, because all their labour is <hi>opus
Cerebri,</hi> the sweat of the <hi>Pericranium;</hi> a little noddle intention, or head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache
perchance, which when they have hammer'd it out, they call it <hi>Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia;</hi>
and by this meanes would shuffle us from <hi>Ioves</hi> Head to his Thighes,
where he preferv'd a young plumpe Godling call'd <hi>Bacchus,</hi> after the death

and consequently of quarrels, our profession at first sprung. 'Tis true, that
the Cradle of our <hi>Deity</hi> (they will allow us) was the strength of his Father,
but what, will they make only foot-ball players of us? they shall finde it
contrary; or if it be so, that the ball is the world, and we carry it upon our
Toes before us. Another argument they have from the nine Muses, who
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57130:128"/>
all of them seem (except some one pittifull whiner Melpomene) to be their
Patronesse, and that <hi>Apollo,</hi> when he is an Archer, is not President of the

and would have relieved the Lady <hi>Daphne,</hi> but that he was inchanted into a
Bay Tree; yet though he could not winne her, he doth weare her in signe
of his true affection about his browes for ever. Out of the number of the
<hi>nine Muses</hi> they have excluded our Goddesse <hi>Indignation</hi> and <hi>Eris,</hi> which
themselves say are Poeticall, <hi>Facit Indignatio versum.</hi> Those are verses now
with stings in their tailes. <hi>Lycambaean</hi> Poetry, lines will make their subject
hang themselves; And, they have thus cheated the world with the
height and antiquity of their originall, they thinke to o'rcome us with
numbers too, laying clayme to all Merchants, Pylots, Sea-men, Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,
Masons, Carpenters, Shipwrights, as their alumni; things that
live out of the Mathematicks. Then they bring Fidlers, Barbers, Harpers,
Dancing Mrs, Singing men, Choristers, Ballad singers, Coblars, and
Plowmen, the heires of Musick; and then a Regiment of Factors, Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Usurers, Vintners, Tapsters, Cookes, Writing-Masters, Almanack-makers,
Fortune-tellers, Surveyours, Brewers Clerks, Bakers, and all
Tally-men, marching under the account of Arithmetick. To these they
joyne Historians, Poets, School-Masters, Divines, Advocates, Attourneys,
and Solicitours, Book-sellers, Printers, all of them are most dependant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Grammer, Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> so that by their good wils, they will not
leave a man for Armes, unlesse he be a Porter, a Vagrant, or a decaid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
Bankrupt, a Waterman, or journy men Taylors; who yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
mightily to be under some of the seven <hi>Sciences,</hi> though not as they
are liberall: Shoomakers pretend to a <hi>Gentle Craft</hi> too, but honest <hi>kill-Cow,</hi>
he is ours: The Butchers are not deny'd us, though they are not allow'd to
be <hi>de Iure Pacis,</hi> they <hi>are de Iure Belli.</hi> This one profession is enough for
our worke, to cleave such a company of Calves-heads, as they have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd
up together. Another thing they object, that their paines exceed
those of the Souldier; by how much spirituall or mentall paines transcend
corporall. Indeed the School-Masters paines is somewhat, and the scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
under him more, but that is all corporall.</p>
                  <q>Huc ades, haec animo concipe dicta tuo.</q>

in <hi>lachrymae;</hi> or a
<q>Parce precor, PosthÃ¢c aeternÃ¹m versificabor.</q>
Is that <hi>animo concipere?</hi> Truly the School-Masters and Tutors (whether
at the Universities or at home) are most necessary instruments in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth; for without the seeds of knowledge, reading and writing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the principles of learning, the rule and direction to higher mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
(whether in Armes, Law, Physick, or Divinity) no man could serve
his Prince, or be usefull to the places where he was bred. These men that
thus discipline, and traine up our youth in civill behaviour, decency, good
manners and knowledge, are men worthy of double honours, that is, sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
and reward, yet you need not be at two charges for it, of a <hi>Ruling</hi>
School-Master, and a <hi>Teaching</hi> School-Master, it all being the excellency
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57130:128"/>
of one man. The Government and discipline of the School, instils as much
as the Masters presence and instruction: And it were to be wish'd, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
Guardians, and others whom it concernes, would reflect upon
the men of this condition, with as good an eye of favour, as on those espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Officers of the Hawkes and Hounds, which appurrenances to great
Families, commonly are gratified in a better sort, <hi>per annum,</hi> for the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a whelpe, or making a Hawke, then the other professours are for
educating a son, and fitting him for the World. A decrepit Huntsman or
Falconer may have a <hi>quietus,</hi> and goe with a Coppy-hold, or some small
annuity, when after the polishing and preferring of a hundred Scholars suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,
a School-Master shall have only his punctuall <hi>Minervall,</hi> and so
leave him to his <hi>Mill,</hi> to weary out his life like a Horse with continuall
exercise, forgot alike, by Parents and Scholars, unlesse it be a <hi>Seneca</hi> or
an <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose scholars were very able men and Souldiers, <hi>Alexander</hi>
and <hi>Nero:</hi> Yet this latter wish'd a <hi>Nesciisset Literas,</hi> the knowledge of
Armes being more sutable to a Prince then books. And <hi>Alexander</hi> lov'd
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> and admit'd him, but followed the Camp, and left him to his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
naturalia. Caesar</hi> also was a great Souldier and Scholar, and I only wish
my selfe more learned then I am, for the commendations given of him; <hi>he
wrote with the same Genius that he fought.</hi> Now were <hi>Don Quixot</hi> so inabled,
what Comments would the World have of his adventures, and how
plausible? The <hi>Arcadia</hi> would be laid by, <hi>Polenander</hi> set aside, and only
<hi>Don Quixot</hi> would be the studdy and delight, and taking Legend, with all
that love Armes, or to Arme Ladies. And for this very end only, I can
admit of some small familiarity with learning, for it did highly inflame me
to read, well worded, and in expressions answerable to their actio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Of Armes.</q>
                  <p>Most illustrious Queen, and by your residence, glories, presence, and
derivative rayes, eminent and conspicuous Confessours. I know full well,
that the Tree of Knowledge, was the most glorious pleasant stock of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi>
but yet forbidden, the bold attempting to know above what they
should, disposfest the aspirers of that beautifull Garden, and gave the first
occasion for Armes in the world; a Flaming sword being set for an eternall
barre upon the passe, that they should not re-enter. A long time it was
before warrs came in, (though a fourth part of the world was murder'd by
his brother) as the generations of men multiplyed, then societies, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Governments were erected in severall places, and good and
wholesome Lawes invented for the security of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> every
man's right; the Vindex of which lawes, (if they were infring'd) was the
publick Magistrate; but sometimes the multitude offending, the Delegated
Power could not restraine 'um; wherefore he was enforc'd to call in help,
and friends, to set all right at home. And to prevent future insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they rais'd a Military Power, which stood for the defence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
against contempt and violence, so that the same strength serv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
civill Commotions, and forraign invasions. At home the souldiors
life was easie and gratefull; But when he was commanded to draw forth,
to avenge the injuries offered to the Prince, then his life is worth taking
notice of; what long Marches? what tedious Sieges? what short allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?
what thin accoutrements? what dangerous duties? and what gallant
ends? VVell said our Poet,
<q>Multum ille, &amp; terris jactatus &amp; alto.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There's tossing for you, Scholars, a little more troublesome then ratling
chaines in a Library, and tumbling old musty Authors from morning till
night, not a line there hurts you, but from one of our <hi>Lines,</hi> perchance a
hundred commanded men, may have their <hi>ultima linea rerum.</hi> This is our
<hi>Rubrick,</hi> (the Scholars) the letter which doth immortalize, or rather <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize</hi>
us. A vengeance take all Gunnes, Bullets, Powder, and the Authors
of them. Printing and they were about an age, and the Devill knows
which is the worst. They were made for dispatches, very right, the one
makes the quarrell, and the other defends it, and both sides rue it. And
yet you Scholars say, that the Sword was more destructive then the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Herquebuzze, or any Powder Engine. The noise forsooth, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
the suddaine dispatch of a party, saves the rest of an Army sometimes,
and induces a summons to a Treaty; as King Henry with his letherne guns
obtain'd it before <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> whereas, when the matter was disputed by the
Sword and Javelin, a major part must be slaine, before the Generals could
tell which side had the better: No, Sophister, no such matter, the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was effected with lesse blood, or at least, blood of lesse moment. In
the antient wars, before these Bombards, Blunderbushes, Petars, or salt
Peter, (the Devils Ale-Tubs were ever tapt.) The very name of <hi>Caesar, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi>
or any famous Officer, routed a wing, a Legion, as soon as it was
heard they were in the Field: And therefore contend no more for your
two black coats, the <hi>Monke</hi> and the <hi>Devill,</hi> who were the contrivers of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57130:129"/>
these murderous Engines, whereby an <hi>Alexander,</hi> an <hi>Achilles,</hi> a <hi>Solyman</hi> or
a <hi>Solomon</hi> either; the wise man and the valiant fall undistinguish'd without
knowing their enemy, or shewing any experiment of their undoubted
strength, or subtle stratagems in war; so it may befall our selfe (<hi>dread Queen,</hi>)
at the siege of the chiefe Castle, that some misguised Bullet (which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
forefend) may deprive you of the man, who slew indeed the <hi>Gyant,</hi>
and laid all wast before him, conquering by his high fame, as much as his
known prowesse, and yet behold the Heros, how he lyes, the Triumph,
and the spoile of a piece of Lead!</p>
                  <p>I have a whole Field to expatiate in the praise of this Antient and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
profession, which throughout the world is formidable; what Land
can you come into, but you shall finde the Monuments of some great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
surviving in Stones, Cuts, and works in the ground, Pillars, Coynes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,
Arms with Bodies, of an incredible weight and stature buried, and
commonly found? What hath set your braines on worke more, then the
Histories of fighting Princes, the <hi>Greeks</hi> and Trojan war, the Field of <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia,</hi>
enobled by our Country man <hi>Lucan,</hi> and the like; when all the stock
of wit was vented, in flattering the victorious side, although in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
you were for the beaten party. <hi>Pro Verre,</hi> or <hi>contra Verrem;</hi> 'tis
all alike to you, you turne as round as a Pigg, in all disturbances for the
successe: We fight it, you enjoy the profits of it. It were good policy, in
my Imagination, to change and shift callings, and sometimes the Souldier
should spend a yeare or two in a Gowne, enjoy a Government, a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and others, while the Scholar doth lead a Company, traile a Pike, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

they may experimentally and judiciously discourse of the severall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
paines, and labours of both these professions. How many bloody
rounds are there to be clim'd in the scale of military honour, before you
are at the top of preferment? and how many brave soules perish in the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up, every step being under-watch'd with Dragons, Lyons, Tygers and
old <hi>Mors</hi> himselfe. If a Scholar obtain not his desires, it is his own fault, very
few miscarry, if they will make themselves able, and apply to the right way;
study, and be thrifty, take heed of <hi>Alla: To:</hi> and especially have a care, when
they are young students, not to intoxicate their noddles with hot loaves and
butter, pudding Pies, and penny Custards, which make dunces, and clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates.
And thus I have discharg'd this undertaking of the preeminency of
Arts and Armes, which later doth as much exceed the other, as a sword doth

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57130:133"/>

and naked, as the Crow, or Chaugh despoil'd of his borrowed Feathers.</p>

                     <p>Keep the cloth, your Liveries, and your Ceremonies, and they will
keep you from vulgar insolencies; Round Caps, and obedience to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
went out about a time. <hi>Square</hi> Caps and <hi>Logick, Wigs</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi>
wing'd <hi>Gownes</hi> and <hi>good Divinity,</hi> like <hi>Astraea,</hi> (Mr Justices pretended mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse)
flew away together. Worthy was the Policy of the <hi>Roman Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
who being vanquish'd by the <hi>Galli Senones,</hi> fled to the Capitol, and
there sate in their <hi>Patrician</hi> Robes, full of gravity and majesty, which struck
more awe into the Barbarous Souldiers, then their Ensignes, or their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines:
Insomuch, that they took them for gods at first, untill their officers
made them plunder them like men. What regard would be given to a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
without his trapping'd horse, the Gold Chain, and the Cap of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?
Even the Bedel of the beggars without his blew Jump, and silver head
tipstaffe, loses reputation among the boyes and vagrants. Upon this very
reason it was, that <hi>Philosophers</hi> of old, and our <hi>Moderne</hi> Divines nourish'd
Beards, (like wandring Greeks or Jews) not that they were a jot the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
for the Bush, but it gain'd an estimate and reverence. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
depart not from distinctions of Orders, Garbs, Habits, Punctilios, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
Circumstances, and have the reputation of the wisest men in the
world. If Mr Justice had come in <hi>Querpo,</hi> mine Hostesse would ne'r have
left her lodging for his sake; but now shee doth Idolize his broad sleeves,
and resigns her owne chamber to the long robe, which had not been so
well swept in a yeare as it was with the trailing of his Worships train.</p>

                        <hi>To all which the Iudge was so attentive, as in all his life, he never listned to

which most commonly your Spanish Judges take most of their <hi>Charge,</hi> and
are as much beholding to Mr Curates adviso's from the Pulpit, as he was

curtly, succinctly, and concisely <hi>Anacephalyz'd,</hi> Analyz'd and Epitomiz'd
the long story of the Captive, that if his afternoone Repetitions were
with halfe that paines and method summ'd up <hi>ad populum,</hi> they would
keep waking the best part of his Auditory after a full meale. 'Tis a good
character of a Judge to be attentive to heare <hi>ambabus auribus,</hi> on both sides,
and both sides, (as they say) without interposing or troubling witnesses,
or suffering the Councill to doe it, and so in his instructions to the Jury,
to lay open the Law, not his <hi>affections</hi> to them, which is the cause many
times, that those honest men and true, swai'd by hints and girds to the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>The Curate took him fast by the other hand, and marched over with both them
unto the Iustice.</hi>] Had this been in England now, it had been a wedding; but
the Spanish Curates will not easily part with so beneficiall a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as
Matrimony to Lay-Hucksters; Marriage and flesh (being Quadragesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall

more considerable then petty Tithes, and made the Curate more blith and
bonny, then an Arch-Deacons visitation, where beside the danger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
he paid for his owne dinner, and his visitors. If all hits right,
and that this learned contrivance of Mr Curates could worke in <hi>Zoraidas
Inchristianation,</hi> with the solemnity and rights belonging to it; and the
<hi>gaudia magna</hi> of her after-marriage with the Captive, to be the reward
of this service, (as it deserv'd it) how soone might he expect a change of his
small Vicaridge, for <hi>uberius beneficium?</hi> and admire himselfe in his long
Cassock, broad Hat, and divinity Belt, the advanc'd creature of the times;
nothing being a surer step to preferment, then the joyning great persons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

How proper physick he finds out for a mad man? watching being the only
meanes to tame frenzy, had it been confin'd to a close room; but this new
humor of being <hi>grand round</hi> to the Castle, makes him more wild then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and subjects him totally to 'the cold influences of the Moon, which
was the Predominant <hi>Planet</hi> in his <hi>Pericranium.</hi> Could he not remember
what befell him, when upon the entrance of his adventures this <hi>vertigo</hi> of
<hi>noctivagation,</hi> and watching his Armes, seizd him: How dismall was that
nights Guardian-ship, wherein was more want of discretion, then sleep,
when the Carriers had almost laid him stone dead? and yet the bold and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Knight, alone, not as in other adventures attended by <hi>Sancho Pancha,</hi> (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and partner of his sufferings) he will react this solitary incounter. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing but the spangled Coverlid of Heaven over him, and poor
<hi>Rosinant</hi> under, whose paines and <hi>Tantalizations</hi> in this nights round, were
more irksome to the beast, then all his other out-ridings, which were ever
(though somewhat long first) gratified with the welcome rest of an Inne;
but now he is dizzed with the continuall circuits of the Stables, which are
ever approached, and never enter'd, beside the unsupportable torment of
feeding horses, the noise of grinding the beloved Corne, the smell of hay
and litter, (and nothing but the smell and noise of it) which made <hi>Rosinant</hi>
thinke (if ever his imagination was discovered) that he was in <hi>Limbo Equo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and condemnn'd with <hi>Tantalus</hi> Horses to the same flying Provender,

our transported <hi>Don;</hi> who inchanted with his owne fancies, is brought

in <hi>effigie,</hi> which had been disgrace enough) but in <hi>persona,</hi> corporally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the view of all people. <hi>Tom Coriat</hi> upon the barrell at <hi>Hiddleberg,</hi>

to his dishonour; who ever beholding this figure, will not call to
mind the story of the abused Judge, whose patient Mule was better then

dreame of remaining manicled to the window, vanished into a hideous
swing, (upon the motions of <hi>Rosinante</hi>) and new torment. Poor Knight
unhors'd, but not alighted, how he hangs, paine and torture, as from <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi>
Bull! Expresse noise and out-cries from him, more then humane;
his voice is all he can trust to now; if his Lungs faile him, the rope will
not, which he hop'd would sooner break then his voice: had he been
rotten, it had been but an arme lost; but fighting hardened his flesh,
and kept his parts compact together; so that this firmnesse of body was
the increase of his torment. How happy might he have now been, if he
had any the least skill in dancing of the ropes, or could have throwne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
heels over head, or cast himselfe into a hoope, or into the hole whence
his Ladiships bracelet, and the glorious chaine was bestowed upon him?
But he cannot vault nor skip, nor mount, nor doe any thing but raise a
note or two higher, which wak'd the Dogs, which wak'd the Maids,
whÃ³ sensible of their roguish cruelty, relent, and at last relaxe the rope,
whereby the <hi>Don</hi> is once more a Knight of this world; into which
he is no sooner dropt, but fresh adventures bury the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the old ones, and remounted upon <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante,</hi>
he defies all dangers; which were as
sure to seize him, as he was sure
to provoke them.</p>
                     <l>Nothing can hold him, now the rope is broke,</l>
                     <l>He will subdue, who late was under yoake.</l>

it cannot well be called a defeat) should be published to the world. In
strange disputes with himselfe our Knight was; what should be done to
an enemy that would doe nothing? what said to a silent foe? language
was unfit for mutes, and action for men of no spirit: Never was <hi>Heros</hi> so
becalm'd. The businesse (the challenge once over) was a dumbe shew,

of Beards, &amp;c.] Sancho</hi> begins to be undeceived, and the imposturage
will no longer last, nothing is more violent then abus'd simplicity, when
it once discovers the cheat; True <hi>Sancho,</hi> Beards are but bushes, and good
wine needs none; cofeners goe, mask'd and in Visards: But old time will
pluck off those disguises, and render every thing in its own likenesse. He
is very pressing upon Mr Curate also, who had a main hand in these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
and by whose authority and credit, the whole design was brought
about, and leaves the matter to his Conscience, which he hopes will
perplex him one day, as much as his delusions have confounded them;
and for his confederate the Barber, the forge of this Inchantment, he wishes
the next generation may be <hi>Eunuchs;</hi> that there may not be a Beard to
turne up, or a good face to wash, as long as the world stood. So indignely
did <hi>Sancho</hi> take these affronts, that in despight to the Curate, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd

                     <p>
                        <hi>Verily Mr Curate, I doe find by experience, that bookes of Chivalry are very
prejudiciall to well govern'd Common-wealths.</hi>] Mr Canon in this discourse
seems to weaken the credit and use of writings of this nature, and to prefer
and commend <hi>Aesops Fables,</hi> and <hi>Alciats</hi> Emblems, wherein the Morall may
be for instruction, though the story be of a Cock and a Bull; but it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
that this age hath more abounded with Romances then any other,
upon what reason is not hard to conjecture; and yet no man dare say, but
here is a well govern'd Common-wealth; but what prejudice I pray, when
the subjects are known to be fabulous and figments? no man's faith is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled,
nor any perswaded to believe them as a truth; rather on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
where the minds of the vulgar are not busied in some such pleasant
arguments, they fall upon matters which lesse concerne them, and become
troublesome Judges of the State and Church wherein they live; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it hath been accounted great policy to divert those mens fancies, by
licensing Plaies, sports, and divers recreations from businesses above their
capacity, and not of common ventilation. For want of these <hi>chimera's,</hi>
(which had no more harm in them, then their impossibility) reall phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes,
and strong delusions have succeeded and possessed not a few, who
transported with their owne imaginations, doe not write Romances, but
act them, and fill the world with substantiall Tragaedies.</p>

the three <hi>London Apprentises,</hi> which commonly ends in six acts, the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
frequently mounting the stage, and making a more bloody Catastrophe
amongst themselves, then the Players did. I have known upon one of these
<hi>Festivals,</hi> but especially at <hi>Shrove-tide,</hi> where the Players have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,

sometimes the Jew of <hi>Malta,</hi> and sometimes parts of all these, and
at last, none of the three taking, they were forc'd to undresse and put off
their Tragick habits, and conclude the day with the merry milk-maides.
And unlesse this were done, and the popular humour satisfied, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it so fortun'd, that the Players were refractory; the Benches, the
tiles, the laths, the stones, Oranges, Apples, Nuts, flew about most liberally,
and as there were Mechanicks of all professions, who fell every one to his

Images of voluptuousnesse.</hi>] The Spanish stage indeed, as well as the French
and English, have been much corrupted, partly through the effeminacy
of the times, but chiefly by unskilfull Authors; for, the French are so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene,
that <hi>Aretines</hi> pictures may be represented without any offence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
their loose and apish gestures render them very ridiculous, and the
permission of women, personally to act, doth very much enervate the
Auditory, and teacheth lust, while they would but feigne it. The Spanish
scene is much of it Legend, or some fictions upon Hereticks, and as they
did render their persons and visages to be most horrid, odious, and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
to the People of their Countrie, so they never bring any of these
sects upon the stage, but they have a Hell, furies, and strange torments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for them. But it fell out once, that at the representation of such a
<hi>Tragi-Comaedy</hi> before some strangers, not Roman Catholicks, the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
of Cardinals, Fryars and Jesuites, (who were to condeme the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
party to <hi>Tophet</hi>) being very burthensome, broke the judgement
seat, and fell all into Hell before they had arraign'd the schismaticks,
as they call them, which caus'd such a laughter amongst the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the contrary opinion, that their mirth prov'd almost matter for the
Inquisition; nor are the incongruities and absurdities of our owne stage any
lesse or more excusable, it being a long time us'd to historicall arguments,
which could not be dispatched but by <hi>Chorus,</hi> or the descending of some
god, or a Magitian: As in the playes of <hi>Bungy, Bacon,</hi> and <hi>Vandarmast,</hi>
the three great Negromancers, Dr <hi>Faustus, Chinon</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the
like. Every act being supported by some long narrative, which was the
Apology for the soloecisticall appearances of children, become men in an
instant, within the space of two musicks, infants, and great Commanders:
and sometimes without any regard to the credit of their Histories) as in
the play of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>) the good grandam is brought in with two or
three waiting maides attending her, and in Paradise too, when there
were but two in all the world. So at <hi>Madrid</hi> in the divine Comaedies;
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> is presented with a Crosse triumphant in his hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Masters passion, many a yeare. And in the Tragaedy of <hi>Babel,</hi> an

was impossible but he must have had many motions, (before the starting of
this question) by reason of the continuall joggings of the Cart, which is
very provoking, both to Urine and siege, and happily <hi>Sancho</hi> following
close to the Cage, must smell out the condition his master was in, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cunningly puts the question in the <hi>Dieureticall</hi> instance, which was not
so evident, and so bewraies all the whole businesse. And though hence he
cannot enfeeble the <hi>Don's</hi> reason for his Inchantment, yet he doth absolutely

As for the Crosse, it is believ'd to be but one piece of timber, (nor
would the Jewes, who did all in disgrace of the <hi>blessed Patient</hi>) make it of
the best wood; and yet you shall find many crucibles, (which we confide
were snattocks of that very Crosse) to be of Cedar some, some of Juniper,

whereas the nailes were but foure or five, which were first canonized,

of all sorts and sizes, and so many Napkins, that it will require a society
of Linnen-drapers to furnish us with the Napery: I desire but faire play,

they wrote, as well as yours; which granted, can you imagine that men

acts, and since the defeat of that strange Dragon, which was then preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

heard of in the Country; as there are no spiders in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ever since St

a season both; though no doubt if he would have applyed his mind to those
abandon'd Philosophers, he might sooner have learn'd how to governe,
then his Lord got the government for him. The frame of his body much
agreeing with sitting and sleeping in Judicature, and that mind, that was

able to informe that body would take informations at leisure. The power
and the reward was the thing <hi>Sancho</hi> look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> for. The abilities and execution
you might goe look. The place should qualifie the man; it was hard to
judge by outsides: <hi>Aesop</hi> was an ugly fellow, but very witty, and seldome
any naturall defects, but there were great supplies of inward faculties. <hi>Galba</hi>
was very bald on the head, but it was well lin'd within. <hi>Cicero</hi> had a
wenne on his nose, but yet smelt out <hi>Catilin's</hi> conspiracy; <hi>Caesar</hi> had none
and could not discover that against himselfe; <hi>Vitellius</hi> had a great Paunch,
yet was an Emperor, and became the chaire of State, better then spruce
<hi>Otho.</hi> Who then looking upon <hi>Sancho,</hi> but would say, there was enough in
him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then did the</hi> Goat-herd <hi>arrive, and laying hold of her, said unto her; O you
wanton Ape, you spotted elre.</hi>] It was very strange, that the <hi>Don</hi> upon these
words, was not incited to a rescue, and supposing the speckled Goat to
be a beauty-speckt Lady inchanted, instantly had not started to his Arms:
Upon lesse provocation, he assaulted the flock of sheep. How easily might
the odour and graine of the creature have been mistook for hers of <hi>Toboso,</hi>
surely the Knight was dull after dinner, or else this could not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
lesse then an adventure, but especially, when in his passionate rebuke,
the Goat-herd proceeds to taunt her, with <hi>how can it be other, then that you
are a female; and therefore can never be quiet, turne back love, turne back.</hi> Could
the defender of the sex heare this, and not be unmov'd? Of all the quarrels
he undertook, there was not so much ground for one, as here; besides, had
there been no other reason, but that it was a Goat-Errant, by his order he
was to succour her, and have said to her bold pursuer; Inchanted Lady,
(for by this miscreants words, I guesse you to be such) unsold the cause of
this your flight, and change. I am not ignorant of the like mutation in your
sexe, some being turn'd into Trees, some into Spiders, some into Birds,
some into Beasts, some into Streames. I my selfe but lately was inchanted,
and I know not how soon returnable unto that condition. Speak quickly,
while my Knightly capacity lasts, that I may restore your haires into the
silken robes you use to weare; your goodly beard into your fanne; your
spots into curious specks; your stately hornes into the Persian <hi>Tiara;</hi> or
the knots wherein you twist your delicate haire; all which shall be effected,
if I may have but one word from you, to shew your desire to be relieved by
my hand. How this fancy scap'd him, is almost a miracle, and but that
his wooden studdy infus'd no glorious freaks into him, it had been impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I accept mine, quoth</hi> Sancho, <hi>for I will goe with this Pastie.</hi>] It is no time of
adventuring, but preparing for adventures I perceive: <hi>Knight-Errants</hi> and
their Squires, like Ships, must be victuall'd, and <hi>Sancho</hi> was providing for
a long voyage. The Cloak-bag in his belly, was of more capacity then
that on his Ass; a corner of which, the whole Pye would not well fill. While
the <hi>Don</hi> is held by the eare, the Squire will be held by the teeth; Mutton is
preferr'd with him before Goat, and one single sheep intrench'd and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in good crust-work, was a more considerable adventure to him, then
sharing the whole flock.</p>
                     <l>

                     <l>Who could forbeare to like and love her?</l>

Canons provision. But it is a <hi>Lapithaean</hi> feast, where there was more
meat then manners, more stomack then feeding; not like <hi>Tantalus</hi> his fare,

'twas kiss'd, and the salutations so pestilent and close, that they drew blood
at billing: Insomuch, that though the meat was well drest, the guests were
all raw, and blood runne about their mouths, as if they had been <hi>Cannibals,</hi>

instrument, recall'd shame into the combatants, who full of flesh-wounds,
cross'd the cudgels the right way, and fell to picking quarrels
with their teeth, their bellies being the only sufferers, and not easily after
so great a spoyle, to be satisfied; But as the <hi>Fool thinketh, so the bell tinketh.</hi>
The <hi>Don</hi> conceits this Trumpet sounds for his assistance; the Lady <hi>Micomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conas</hi>
Trumpet upon his life, who having join'd battell with <hi>Pandafiland</hi>
her mortall foe, sent this summons for the restorer of her Kingdome; or
else <hi>Dulcineas</hi> Trumpet at her dinner of Beanes, and gray Pease; or else
Fames Trumpet, to blow him honourably home after his many victories.
But it was not so, nor so, nor so. But a Trumpet it was, and a Ladies Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet

Trumpet, sounding dolefully before an armory of Prayers and teares, to
remove a great drought from the Land, but it prov'd <hi>Quixot's day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Trumpet,</hi>
after the dismall sounds, whereof he was carried to the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>

accomplished in his departure? Or were there any more to follow? But
<hi>Sancho</hi> was over-joy'd at the sight of his revoked Lord, and forgot to
move the question. And the <hi>Don</hi> (as all recoveries and victories, are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the soveraigne aspects of their Ladies, so their defeats and crosses
to their aversions, or some obnoxious interpositions) <hi>Knight-Errant</hi> like

                        <hi>Sancho,</hi> replied <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> thou speakest reasonably, and it will be great

other for his unwearied Errantry on dayes: Insomuch, that if the number
ever be augmented amongst them, he is in election to make the eight Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:
What influence the <hi>septentriones</hi> had upon him at present, is to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
guess'd, for he is upon his second hoyst into the Cart, and but that the

only envyed him this cushion, who for the present, wish'd to change pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

indeed deserv'd a more <hi>Sella Curulis;</hi> but his vast knowledge in the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of his predecessors, made him slight these present indignities: For
when he considered <hi>Marius</hi> in a Lake, (as good a place as <hi>Tom Turds</hi> field)
<hi>Orlando</hi> in Bedlam, <hi>Amadis du Gaul</hi> in a Dungeon, and he of <hi>Greece</hi> in

at the Carts taile, but not like <hi>Sancho</hi> with his shirt on, he play'd a
little with the hay he sate upon, (the emblem of humane frailty) and after
that (as if he eat it chopt) he said nothing but this,

                     <p>Which some thought, he spoke, alluding to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who was in this

might well, who expected the title of a Queen at least; but she is but <hi>Ione

an old Physitian, who had in his custody a leaden box, &amp;c.</hi>] Who this old Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian
should be, is very hard to conjecture, for he was a great Antiquary
beside, as will appeare by his delight in these monuments, and rare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of the <hi>Don;</hi> Unlesse it should be <hi>Iohn Dellues,</hi> I know not whom he
meanes: For <hi>Iohn</hi> having liv'd famous throughout all <hi>Spaine</hi> for mighty
cures, at last fell sick, and being neer his end, some friend desir'd that he
would not bury with him the meanes whereby he grew so eminent; <hi>Iohn</hi>
told his friend all, that it was true, a great fame liv'd with him, and would
follow him; but for the criticall knowledge and successe in his cures, it was
thus: He had a fortune Physick book, wherein the names of most diseases
were wrote, and as Patients came for his opinion, he withdrew for a season,
and in that intervall, threw the dice, and upon what disease the chance fell,
that was the patients sicknesse, then he threw againe for the cures, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
followed those medicines, on which the dice rested. This was
his directory for diseases and remedies, which he made use of to his end,
and the end of many; but the number of his cures surmounting his losses,
his bad casts went for nothing. By this easie way of practice, (for illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and inspired physick he detested, as also all counsels with other Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians)
he had the more leisure for the enquiry into these old records; and
amongst many, he at last happened upon those of the <hi>Mancha;</hi> out of
which he gathered some few Epitaphs, Elegies, and fancies, upon <hi>Don Quixot,
Dulcinea of Toboso,</hi> and in the praise of <hi>Rosinante</hi> and <hi>Sancho Pancha;</hi> With
which we shall conclude, desiring you to doe the <hi>Don</hi> this last honour, to see
him in his urne, and heare what is said over his ashes.</p>
