            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>From hence they write, that the Catholicke Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie vnderſtanding of the pacification of the troubles in this Kingdome, and accuſtomed to performe all the duties of a noble Prince in gratifying, or at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compencing the ſeruices of his worthy Captaines, Gouernours, and Souldiers, hath granted an annuall penſion of ſixty thouſand crownes to <hi>Aadiuta de Ciſta</hi> Duke of <hi>Brattana,</hi> and a preſent disburſement of a 100000. crownes, both for money laid out for the

prouiſion of corne in the time of famine, and disburſed to ſouldiers in the tumults of that Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that there are certaine directions for the leuying of two thouſand men at his Maieſties charge of <hi>Spaine</hi> to paſſe into the <hi>Valtoline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that diuers ſouldiers were leuyed about <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronto</hi> and <hi>Brindiſi</hi> in <hi>Apulta,</hi> but the <hi>Venetians</hi> would not let them paſſe ouer the gulph to land either in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia</hi> or <hi>Hiſtria.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, that the Pope hath created foure Cardinals, two of <hi>Spaine,</hi> one of <hi>Italie,</hi> and one of <hi>Poland,</hi> who hath commiſſion to determine the controuerſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Ieſuites and the Nobilitie.</p>

               <p n="4">4 That there are certaine letters writ from <hi>Naples</hi> vnto his Holineſſe, about the dangerous ſickeneſſe of the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Montelione,</hi> who is very importunate for the prayers of the Church and the Popes bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That by reaſon of the want of corne in <hi>Naples,</hi> there was a great impoſition on all the Popes territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and they that could not ſpare their graine, were contented to disburſe their money: ſo that at laſt <hi>Arni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Antonio</hi> Captaine of the foote did conuey much corne to <hi>Abruzza,</hi> for the releefe of that Cittie, and countrey.</p>

               <head>From Venice.</head>
               <p>Becauſe commonly our Poſt lettters of <hi>Italy</hi> come from <hi>Venice,</hi> or at leaſt thoſe of <hi>Venice</hi> make mention of the affaires of the petty Prouinces, eſpecially <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine</hi>: I haue therefore thought it conuenient to put in the Items of Italian affaires into this ſection of <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſo make vp as it were one bundle in this matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is written from <hi>Millaine,</hi> that the Duke <hi>de Feria, Leopoldus</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the <hi>Switzers</hi> haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon a treatie of peace, and appointed a place of meeting at <hi>Loudray,</hi> the better to accommodate the company, which muſt needes be very great, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there is expectation of ſeuerall Emboſſadours from <hi>France, Venice,</hi> the Archduke <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> the the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and the <hi>Grizons,</hi> who ſhall bee commiſſioned to treat of conditions betweene <hi>Millaine</hi> and them: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the expectation of this faire weather, euery day almoſt hath had his interpoſition of clouds, &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke preparations: for there is nothing but killing, and intercepting of paſſages among the <hi>Grizons,</hi> and preparing of ſouldiers in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> ſo that they haue ſtill an army on foote of ſeuen thouſand, as reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to defend their countrey againſt the vſurpation of ſtrangers, whoſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1895:5"/>Secondly, That though the Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> bee gone himſelfe to recouer his Townes in <hi>Alſatia</hi>; yet haue his ſouldiers forraged the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and the Valleyes of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> as farre as <hi>Tiroll,</hi> with the taking of 500 Head of Cattell, and ſtill and ſtill encreaſeth his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as if he meant to ſubiugate that Countrey wholly to the vſe of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That for all this faire ſhew of Pacification, they write from <hi>Venice,</hi> That the <hi>Spaniard</hi> will haue no Peace, but are reſolued to continue the Warre, till ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by force they make their owne way, or by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition free the Countrey, that his Armies may paſſe from <hi>Millan</hi> into <hi>Germanie,</hi> without interception.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That whereas there was a payment of 25000 Crownes yeerely disburſed to the <hi>Valtolina,</hi> the Gouernor of <hi>Millan</hi> hath denyed the ſame, &amp; ſtopped it in his Chamber of Accounts, by directions from <hi>Spaine</hi>; and therefore they ſuppoſe thoſe propoſitions of Peace to be in vaine, conſidering there is an Armie muſtring in <hi>Millan.</hi>

                  <hi>Bauaria</hi> on the other ſide was not ſo confident of his ſecurity, but that he fortified his owne Townes, putting certaine Cannons into <hi>Mriken,</hi> which he had taken from <hi>Amberg,</hi> and were once the <hi>Switzers,</hi> called <hi>the man and the woman,</hi> being Peeces of principall account: but when hee had ſalued this ſore of the diffidence of his owne Countrey and people, hee ſent the reſt of his forces to <hi>Tilly</hi> and <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> who were now marched from <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberg</hi> by <hi>Spiers</hi> to take in the Caſtle of <hi>Magdenburg</hi>

               <p>THE laſt Letters vvere altogether about a Myne, or if you will, two Mynes; the one made out of the Raueling into <hi>Spinolas</hi> Campe, which blew vp the mount, that ſo annoyed their Courts of guard, to which was added (after the blow was paſt) a ſalley from the towne, wherein many of the contrary ſide were ſlaine: the other was attempted by <hi>Spinola</hi> himſelfe againſt the towne, wherein hee had laboured aboue fiue weekes with exceſſiue paines, and charges, they will haue it ſo great and effectuall, that if it had taken, it would not onely haue giuen him enterance into the Rauelings, but blowne vp a great part of the wall, whereby it doth appeare, that they were almoſt in deſpaire of taking the towne any other way then by a Stratagem, which is the laſt act of the Tragedy of warre, and doth commonly bring with it all rerror and confuſion: But the God of mercy, who ſtayeth the rages of men, and with-holdeth the fury of bloody Souldiers, preuented this likewiſe; and it proued like <hi>Perillus</hi> Bull, to the deuiſer; for they within <hi>Bergen,</hi> as cautelous, and euery way as reſolute as themſelues, countermined and ſtopped them as it were in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, before they had placed any powder: only they had brought certaine barrels to the mouth of the Myne, which vpon the alarum of the enemies being in the earth, were at laſt by the haſty comming in of the Souldiers, ſet on fire, ſo that the blow was ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and impetuous, that in a moment it deſtroyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 1200 perſons which was both lamentable and fearfull for the time.</p>
               <p>But ſee the miſery of warre, and the dangers and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1895:15"/>
turmoiles this occupation is accompanied with; no ſooner was this ſmoake as it were ouerblowne, but they of the towne made a ſalley, and vvere ſo glorious in their forwardneſſe euen farre into the Campe, that beſides the ſlaughter of many Souldiers, they killed 40. principall officers, and commanders, amongſt vvhom the brother of the Duke of <hi>Aſcot</hi> vvas ſhot in the cheekes, ſo that the bones vvere broken, and the bullet made his vvay by ſliding by, not killing him out right.</p>
               <p>In this ſalley many of the Earle of Argiles, and the Lord <hi>Vaux</hi> his Regiment vvere ſlaine; but there vvas a commandement preſently, that all ſhould bee kept from the knowledge of the other ſide of the Campe, eſpecially that they in <hi>Antwerpe</hi> tooke no notice of the ſame, leſt the Souldiers might be altogether diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and the towne diſtracted, vvho vvere more and more in continuall feares: yet it ended not thus nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for the great Generall <hi>Spinola</hi> vvas ſo incenſed vvith this diſaſterous chance, that hee not onely laid the blame of the misfortune on the ignorance or haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the principall enginer, but preſently comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be hanged vp, notvvithſtanding hee had performed his endeuor, and had formerly been a vvell deſeruer.</p>
               <p>Novv you muſt conſider, that all this buſineſſe and hurli-burly vvas done and ouerpaſſed before the rumor vvas that the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and brought his armies to <hi>Spinolas</hi> quarters, or if you vvill, by vvay of interception to lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveene them and ſuch places, as vvere appointed to ſupply the vvants of the Campe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1895:16"/>But now that it was ſuſpected that <hi>Mansfield</hi> was come and <hi>Brunſwicke</hi> in the field, the Souldiers incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and euery one ready to play their part, <hi>Spinola</hi> knew not what to ſay, or to doe, conſidering the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial court dibated the particulars of the buſineſſe in this manner:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that whereas they expected the comming downe of <hi>Mounſeur Tilley</hi> out of the Palatinate, the Letters came to Bruſſels to the contrary, that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they intended the ſiege of Manheim, and that many towns in the Biſhoprick of Spiers and Worms, would not yeeld to <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> he could not be ſpared; beſides; the Germans were loath (winter coming on) to take ſo long a iourney, after their great toyle, but cried out already for reſt, and a Garriſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the towne of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> from whence they had their greateſt ſuppliment, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt weary of the warre, and beganne to finde fault with the enterprize, either that <hi>Spinola</hi> had ouerpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed himſelfe in a preſumptuous reſolution to get the towne, or vnderualued the States, as weake and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſiſt the forces; or was not well informed of the ſtrength and ſituation of the place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the ſlaughters were ſo great of his armies, and decay of his ſouldiers, that although it might be paſſed ouer with the chance of warre, and malignity of circumſtances, yet time would conſume them more and more; and which way could the wit of man inuent how other Souldiers ſhould come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as their enemies lay to affront them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the wants of the Campe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, as enduring famine, and cold, euen to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1895:16"/>
eating of horſes, yea many other inconueniences which muſt needs be aggrauated and increaſed both with the time, and diuers other circumſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſaw no prevenſion, as the caſe now ſtood.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, that if the States armies were rayſed, then would the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> lye on one ſide, and <hi>Count Mansfield</hi> on the other, who meant not to fight with them but when they liſt, and then vpon great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, but were ſure to conſume them, and weary them out, or torment them with daily eruptions and encombrances, and that without any manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention.</p>
               <p>All which conſidered, the Councell thought it meet by one meanes or other to raiſe the ſiege, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaue the liues of ſo many braue men, who might in ſome other proiect, and at ſome other time reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this loſſe, and reintegrate their fortunes; then to endure a certaine deſtruction, and irrecouerable wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe; and although the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that his honour was ſo farre ingaged, that he had rather periſh in the misfortune, then endure the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of being thus diſappointed; yet they anſwered, neceſſity was a commanding miſtreſſe, and there was no withſtanding of Fate and Deſtiny, yea there was iudgement and reaſon in enduring ſome inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rather then a miſchiefe or aſſured deſtruction.</p>
               <p>As for the honour hee enterpoſed, what was it more to him, then to the former Duke of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, who had raiſed his ſiege in the ſame place, after hee had layen there with 32000. men almoſt halfe a yeare: yea the great Turke went from Vienna and Malta, diſappointed; and diuers other Princes haue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1895:17"/>
beene enforced to caſt vp another accompt with the diſpoſing of a higher power, then their owne preſumptions at the beginning: whereupon when hee ſaw there vvas no remedie, hee vvith much adoe condiſcended to their importunities, and ſo taking the aduantage of a darke night, raiſed his campe indeed very couertly, the particulars you ſhall now knovv more at large.</p>

            <p>Whereupon, both this Impoſition and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the buſineſſe, with other malignant circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, led him out of the wilde fields of peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and preſumption, into the orderly bounds of ſafety and ſecuritie; ſo that hee lay in waite for an opportunitie to paſſe quietly without interception; which (as it ſhould ſeeme) he effected in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: When he perceiued that his Excellency did not riſe, or was not ready, on Sunday our 22 of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> he made a fayre ſhew of his Army before the out-workes of the Towne, both Horſe and Foot, yet ſomewhat more remote then hee was accuſtomed when hee determined any On-ſet: whereby, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared afterward, his whole campe was blinded from the diſcouery of the Courts of Guard, and the Town, who prepared to defend themſelues, and thought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing leſſe then an eſcape.</p>
            <p>This done, by twy-light his Cariages were ready, which ſtill kept the left hand of the march; within them went the Ordnance which hee meant to conuey with the Army, and here attended the Pioners, the Camp-followers, and all ſuch vnneceſſary people, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1895:18"/>
belongs to ſuch a buſineſſe. When they were ready, and the ſcoutes brought word the coaſt was cleere; for all it ſeemed a windy and duskiſh night, he ſeemed to welcome the opportunity, and ſet forward the munition with great ſilence, and taciturnity, allowing them a ſufficient conuoy of horſe, and the pioners conuenient armes for their purpoſe: they marched very neere ſix houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſtird, comming cloſe by the wet ground, and drownd land, on the eaſt ſide of <hi>Bergen,</hi> where as they ſay they met with <hi>Gonzales de Cordua,</hi> and that other part of his Armie, which lay betweene <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Bergen:</hi> Thus they goe on, and before noone the next day came within ſixe Engliſh mile of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> having ſpent aboue eighteene houres in the trauell.</p>
            <p>By that time the Armie was thus rid of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, and all this while heard not of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and that the great Generall conceiued they had overgone their affrightings betweene midnight and one a clocke in the morning, the horſeboies and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine men appointed of purpoſe, ſet fire on all their quarters, and burned thoſe things which were left, which made ſo great a ſmoake and ſmother for the time, that nothing was perceiued till the Army was very forward, and then the fire had ouergone the moiſture, making all things combuſtible, ſo that the flame ſhewed the glory of her brightneſſe, and the neighbour places ſaid apparantly, he was departed: this was the light that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in <hi>Zealand,</hi> ſo that the pinckes and paſſengers in the ſea, without ſearching further after particulars, only coniectured the ſiege was raiſed, and ſo gaue it forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1895:19"/>To this, may be added, that of a hundred peeces of ordnance, he caried away but 30, and what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the reſt, time will diſcouer, thoſe which he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, are now brought to <hi>Antwerp</hi>: beſides they ſay, that having many wounded and diſeaſed people, he proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for all manner of nations, but Scots and Engliſh, whom he left to the furie of the fire, and terror of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, but that ſome recouered and creeped as it were to the towne, where they found a ſanctuary contrary to expectation, and the towne heard ſtrange things of them, not to be beleeued in the report. Laſt of all they relate, he was not fully 18000 horſe and foote: for hauing loſt very neere 10000 by one meanes or other, it was a good account to bring his <hi>Items</hi> to ſuch a reckoning; and thus much for the riſing of the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> before <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.</hi> The next thing (as I ſuppoſe) will be the ſearches of his Campe place, the demoliſhing of his mounts, and fortifications, the refreſhing of the towne, the repairing of the decaied places, the watching of the Enemies acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the muſtering of new forces, the prouiding of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if the winter make much haſte, the Gariſoning of ſouldiers on all ſides; but as yet the eies of iealouſie are in euery corner, and therefore I beleeue they will bee ſure of <hi>Spinolaes</hi> ſetling his Army, before the <hi>States</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue theirs.</p>
