            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Authors Preface to this BOOKE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AN can undertake nothing from the beginning of his youth, nor in the whole courſe of his Time in this world, that is more profitable and neceſſary for him, than to learne to know himſelfe; What he is, out of what, from whence, and for what, he is Created, and what his <note n="a" place="margin">Duty, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment or buſineſſe is.</note> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is; In ſuch a ſerious Conſideration he will preſently finde, that he and all the Creatures that are, come all from God: he will alſo finde, among all the Creatures, that he is the moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature of them all; from whence he will very well perceive how Gods intent is towards him: in that he hath made him Lord over all the Creatures of this world, and hath endued him with <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
               </note> Minde, Reaſon, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, above all the reſt of the Creatures, eſpecially with Speech or Language, ſo that he can diſtinguiſh every thing that ſoundeth, ſtirreth, moveth, or groweth, and judge of every things vertue, effect, and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall: and that all is put under his hand, ſo that he can bend them, uſe and mannage them according to his will, as pleaſeth him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Moreover, God hath given him higher and greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than this, in that he can penetrate into the Heart of every thing, and diſcerne what Eſſence, vertue and property it hath, both in the Creatures, in Earth, Stones, Trees, Hearbs, in all moveable and immoveable things; alſo in the Starres and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo that he knoweth what ſubſtance and vertue they have, and that in their vertue, all naturall ſenſibility, <note n="c" place="margin">Growing.</note> vegetation, <note n="d" place="margin">Propagation or encreaſe.</note> multiplication, and life, doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:57651:3"/>
3. Above all this, God hath given him the underſtanding and perception to know God his Creatour; What and whence Man is, how he is, and where he is, and out of what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, or was created; and how he is the Image, <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>Being.</hi>
               </note> ſubſtance, <note n="f" place="margin">Inheritance or poſſeſſion.</note> propriety, and childe of the Eternall uncreated and infinite God: and how he is created out of the ſubſtance of God, in which God hath his own ſubſtance and propriety, in whom he liveth and governeth with his Spirit, by which God manageth his own work, and loveth him dearely as his own Heart and ſubſtance: for whoſe ſake he created this world, with all the Creatures that are therein, which for the moſt part, without the Reaſon and Government of Man, could not live in ſuch a <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or manner of Life.</hi>
               </note> Condition [as they doe].</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Divine Wiſdome it ſelfe ſtandeth in ſuch a high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and hath neither number nor end; and therein is the Love of God towards Man knowne, in that Man knoweth what his Creator is: and what he would have him doe and leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; and it is the moſt profitable thing for Man in this world, that he can ſearch for, and ſeek after; for heerein he learneth to know himſelfe, what matter and ſubſtance he is of; alſo from whence his underſtanding [cogitation, perceptibility] and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility is ſtirred, and how he is created out of the <note n="h" place="margin">Eſſence or Being.</note> Subſtance of God, and as a Mother bringeth forth a Childe out of her own ſubſtance, and nouriſheth it therewith, and leaveth all her Goods to it for its own, and maketh it the poſſeſſour of them: ſo doth God alſo with Man, his Childe, he hath created him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him, and made him heire to all his Eternall Goods. In and by this Conſideration the Divine knowledge buddeth and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Man, and the Love towards God, as of a Childe to its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſo that Man loveth God his Father, for that he knoweth that he is his Father, in whom he liveth, is, and hath his being, who nouriſheth him, preſerveth him, and provideth for him; for thus ſaith Chriſt our Brother, (who is begotten of the Father, to be a Saviour, and ſent into this world.) <hi>This is the Eternall Life, that they know thee to be the onely true God, and whom thou haſt ſent Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:57651:3"/>
5. Now ſeeing wee our ſelves know, that wee are created out of Gods own ſubſtance, and made his Image, ſubſtance and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Inheritance; it is therefore equall that wee ſhould live in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him, and follow him, ſeeing he leadeth us as a Father doth his Children. And wee have alſo his Promiſe, that if wee follow him, wee ſhall obtaine the light of the Eternall Life: without ſuch a Conſideration as this, wee are altogether blinde, and have no knowledge of God; but we run on, as dumb Beaſts, and wee look upon our ſelves and upon Gods Creation as Heifers look upon a <note n="i" place="margin">Which being ſtrange, they ſtart backe at it, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to goe into their own Lodging.</note> new Doore made to their Stalls, and ſet our ſelves againſt God and his will, and ſo live in oppoſition, and enmity, to the perdition of body and ſoule, and of Gods Noble Creatures: wee fall into this terrible and abominable Darkneſſe, becauſe wee will not learne to know our ſelves, what wee are, of what <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>matter.</hi>
               </note> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, what wee ſhall be, whether wee are Eternall, or whether wee are wholy tranſitory, as the body is: or whether alſo wee muſt give an account of our <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
               </note> matters and doings, ſeeing wee are made Lords of all Creatures, and of the whole Creation, and have all this in our power to manage.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Even as wee ſee, know, and finde undeniably, that God will require an account of all our Doings, how wee have kept houſe with his <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note> works, and that when wee fall from him and his Commandements, he will puniſh us terribly, of which wee have fearefull Examples, from the beginning of the world, and among the Jewes, Heathens, and Chriſtians, eſpecially the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Flood, and in Sodome and Gomorrha; alſo in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, and ever ſince till this very Time: Therefore it is indeed moſt neceſſary that wee learne wiſdome, and learne to know our ſelves, how great vice and wickedneſſe we carry about us, how horrible Wolves are amongst us, which ſtrive againſt God and his will.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For there is none that can excuſe himſelfe, and plead ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, becauſe the will of God is put into, and written in our Minds, ſo that wee very well know what wee ſhould doe: and all the Creatures beare witneſſe againſt us: Moreover, wee have
<pb facs="tcp:57651:4"/>
Gods Law and Commandements, ſo that there is no excuſe, but onely our drowſie lazie negligence and careleſneſſe, and ſo wee are found to be ſloathfull unprofitable ſervants in the Lords Vineyard.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Laſtly, it is in the higheſt meaſure moſt needfull for us to learne to know our ſelves, becauſe the Devill dwelleth with us in this world, who is both Gods Enemy and ours, and daily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadeth us, and entrappeth us, as he hath done from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that wee might fall away from our God, and Father, that ſo he might enlarge his Kingdome, and bereave us of our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Salvation: as it is written; <hi>He goeth about as a roaring Lyon, and ſeeketh whom he may devour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Seeing therefore wee are in ſuch horrible danger in this world, that wee are environed with enemies on every ſide, and have a very unſafe Pilgrimage or Journey to walke, and above all, wee carry our worſt Enemy within us, which wee our ſelves hide, and deſire not to learne to know it, though <note n="n" place="margin">Viz. <hi>our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill &amp; corrupt nature &amp; will which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to all evill.</hi>
               </note> it be the most horrible Gueſt of all, which caſteth us headlong into the Anger of God; yea it ſelfe is the very Anger of God, which throweth us into the Eternall Fire of Wrath, into the Eternall unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable torment: therefore it is moſt needfull for us to learne to know this Enemy, what he is, who he is, and whence he is, how be cometh into us, and what in us is his proper own; alſo what right the Devill hath to us, and what acceſſe of entrance into us, how he is allyed with our own Enemy that dwelleth in us, how they favour and helpe one another, how both of them are Gods Enemies, and continually lay wait for us to murther us, and bring us to perdition.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Further, wee muſt conſider the great Reaſons why it is very neceſſary to learne to know our ſelves, becauſe wee ſee and know that wee muſt die and periſh for our own Enemies ſake, which is Gods Enemy and ours, which dwelleth in us, and is the very halfe of Man: and if he grow ſo ſtrong in us, that he get the upperhand; and be <note n="o" place="margin">The chiefe ruling part.</note> predominant, then he throweth us into the Abyſſe to all Devills, to dwell there with them Eternally,
<pb facs="tcp:57651:4"/>
in an Eternall unquenchable paine and torment, into an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Darkneſſe, into a loathſome houſe, and into an Eternall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of all Good, yea into Gods contending will, where our God and all the Creatures are our Enemies for ever.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Wee have yet greater Reaſons, to learne to know our ſelves, becauſe wee are in Good and Evill, and have the promiſe of Eternall Life, that (if wee overcome our own Enemy and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill) wee ſhall be the children of God, and live in his Kingdome, with and in him, among his holy Angels, in Eternall joy, <note n="p" place="margin">Clarity.</note> bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Glory, and welfare, in meekneſſe, and favour with him, without any touch of Evill, and without any knowledge of it, in God Eternally. Beſides, we have the Promiſe, that if wee overcome and burie our Enemy in the Earth, wee ſhall riſe againe at the Laſt Day in a new Body, which ſhall be without evill and paine, and live with God in perfect joy, lovelineſſe, and bliſſe.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Alſo wee know and apprehend, that wee have in us a Reaſonable Soule, <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>which God hath a love to.</hi>
               </note> which is in Gods Love, and is Immortall: and that if it be not vanquiſhed by its adverſary, but fighteth as a ſpirituall Champion againſt its Enemy, God will aſſiſt it with his holy Spirit, and will enlighten and make it powerfull, and able to overcome all its Enemies, he will fight for it, and at the Overcoming of the evill, will Glorifie it as a faithfull Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, and Crowne it with the <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>fayreſt.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing we are now to ſpeak of God, what he is, and where he is, we muſt ſay, that God himſelfe is the Eſſence of all Eſſences; for all is Generated or borne, Created and proceeded from him, and all things take their firſt beginning out of God: as the Scripture witneſſeth, ſaying; <hi>Through him, and in him are all things.</hi> Alſo, <hi>the Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens are not able to contain him:</hi> alſo, <hi>Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my footſtoole:</hi> and in <hi>Our Father</hi> is mentioned, <hi>thine is the Kingdome and the Power;</hi> underſtand All Power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But that there is yet this difference [to be obſerved,] that Evill, neither is, nor is called God; this is underſtood in the firſt Principle, where it is the Earneſt fountaine of the Wrathfulneſſe, according to which, God calleth himſelfe an Angry, Wrathfull, and Zealous God: for the Originall of Life and of all Mobilitie, conſiſteth in the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: yet if the [tartneſſe] be kindled with the Light of God, it is then no more tartneſſe, but the ſevere wrathfulneſſe is changed into Great Joy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now when God was to Create the world and all things therein, he had no other <note n="a" place="margin">Or materials, Materia.</note> Matter to make it of, but his own <note n="b" place="margin">Eſſence or ſubſtance.</note> Beeing, out of himſelfe. But now, God is a Spirit that is incomprehenſible, which hath neither beginning nor end, and his Greatneſſe and Depth is All: yet a Spirit doth nothing but aſcend, flow, move, and continually generate it ſelfe: and in it ſelfe hath chiefly a threefold manner of forme in its Generating or Birth, <hi>viz.</hi> Bitterneſſe, harſhneſſe, and <note n="c" place="margin">Or ſcorching.</note> heate, and theſe three manner of forms are neither of them the firſt, ſecond, nor third; for all theſe three are but one, and each of them <note n="d" place="margin">Begetteth, beareth, or bringeth forth.</note> Generateth the ſecond and third. For between <note n="e" place="margin">Aſtringency, or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ti acting.</note> Harſhneſſe and Bitterneſſe Fire is Generated: and the wrath of the Fire is the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſting it ſelfe, and the harſhneſſe is the ſtock or father of both theſe, and yet is generated of them both; for a Spirit is like a will fence, [or thought] which riſeth up, and in its riſing beholdeth, <note n="f" place="margin">Infecteth, impregnateth, or mixeth ſet'd in it ſelfe.</note> perfecteth, and generateth it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now this cannot be expreſſed or deſcribed, nor brought to the underſtanding by the Tongue of Man: for God hath no beginning: but I will ſet it down ſo as if he had a beginning, that it might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what is in the firſt Principle, whereby the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween-the firſt and ſecond Principle may be underſtood, and what God or Spirit is. Indeed there is no difference in God, onely when it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57651:7"/>
is enquired from whence evill and good proceed; it is to be known, what is the firſt and originall fountaine of Anger, and alſo of Love, ſince they both proceed from one &amp; the ſame original, out of one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are one thing: thus we muſt ſpeak after a creaturely manner, as if it took a beginning, that it might be brought to be underſtood.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For it cannot be ſaid that Fire, bitterneſſe, or harſhneſſe is in God, much leſſe that aire, water, or earth are in him; onely it is plain that all things have proceeded out of that [Originall]: neither can it be ſaid, that Death, Hell-fire, or ſorrowfulneſſe is in God, but it is known that theſe things have come out of that [Originall] For God hath made no Devill out of himſelfe, but Angels to live in Joy, to their comfort and rejoycing: yet it is ſeene that Devils came to be, and that they became Gods enemines; therefore the ſource or fountaine of the Cauſe muſt be ſought, <hi>viz.</hi> What is the <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> or firſt Matter of Evill, and that in the Originalneſſe of God as well as in the Creatures; for it is all but one onely thing in the Originalneſſe: All is out of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>de out of his <note n="g" place="margin">Being or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> Eſſence, according to the Trinitie, as he is one in Eſſence and Threefold in Perſons.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Behold, there are eſpecially three things in the Originalneſſe, out of which all things are, both ſpirit and life, motion and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibilitie; viz. <note n="h" place="margin">Wherein the kindling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</note> 
               <hi>Sulphur,</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">The Spirit of a ſubstance.</note> 
               <hi>Mercurius,</hi> and <note n="k" place="margin">Salt, body, or ſubſtantiality.</note> 
               <hi>Sal;</hi> but you will ſay that theſe are in Nature, and not in God: which indeed is ſo; but Nature hath its ground in God, according to the firſt Principle of the Father, for God calleth himſelf alſo an Angry Zealous God: which is not ſo to be underſtood, that God is angry in himſelfe; but in the Spirit of the [Creation or] Creature which kindleth it ſelfe; and then God burneth in the firſt Principle therein, and the Spirit of the [Creation or] Creature ſuffereth paine and not God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Now to ſpeak in a Creaturely way, <hi>Sulphur, Mercurius,</hi> and <hi>Sal,</hi> are underſtood to be thus. <hi>SUL</hi> is the Soule or the Spirit that is riſen up, or in a fimilitude, [it is] God: <hi>PHUR</hi> is the <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> or firſt Matter, out of which the Spirit is generated, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the <note n="l" place="margin">Aſtringency or attraction.</note> Harſhneſſe: <hi>Mercurius</hi> hath a fourfold forme in it <hi>viz.</hi> Harſhneſſe, bitterneſſe, fire, and water: <hi>Sal</hi> is the childe that is generated from theſe foure, and is harſh, eager, and a cauſe of the comprehenſibility.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <note n="m" place="margin">Obſerve or conſider.</note> Underſtand aright now what I declare to you: Harſhneſſe, bitterneſſe, and fire, are in the Originalneſſe, in the firſt Principle: the water-ſource is generated therein: and God is not called God according to the firſt Principle, but according to that he is called, wrathfulneſſe, angrineſſe, the earneſt [ſevere or tart] ſource, from which Evill, and alſo the woefull, tormenting, trembling, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath its Originall.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This is as was mentioned before; the harſhneſſe is the <hi>Prima
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57651:7"/>
Materia,</hi> or firſt matter, which is ſtrong, and very eagerly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly attractive, that is <hi>Sal:</hi> the bitterneſſe is <note n="n" place="margin">Generated.</note> in the ſtrong attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting: for the ſpirit ſharpeneth it ſelfe in the ſtrong attracting, ſo that it becometh wholly aking, [anxious or vexed.] For example, in man, when he is enraged, how his ſpirit attracteth it ſelfe, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him bitter [or ſoure,] and trembling; and if it be not ſuddenly withſtood and quenched, we ſee that the fire of anger kindleth in him ſo, that he burneth in malice, and then preſently a <note n="o" place="margin">An eſſentiall, reall, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> ſubſtance or whole eſſence, cometh to be in the ſpirit and minde, to be revenged.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Which is a ſimilitude of that which is in the originall of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating of Nature: yet it muſt be ſet down more intelligibly [and plainly.] Mark what <hi>Mercurius</hi> is, it is harſhneſſe, bitterneſſe, fire, and brimſtone-water, the moſt horrible <note n="p" place="margin">Being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or thing.</note> Eſſence; yet you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand hereby no <hi>Materia,</hi> matter, or comprehenſible thing; but all no other then ſpirit, and the ſource of the originall nature. Harſhneſſe is the firſt eſſence, which attracteth it ſelf; but it being a hard cold vertue or power, the ſpirit is altogether prickly [ſtinging] and ſharp. Now the ſting and ſharpneſſe cannot endure attracting, but moveth and reſiſteth [or oppoſeth,] and is a contrary will, an enemy to the harſhneſſe, and from that <note n="q" place="margin">Or, rigling.</note> ſtirring cometh the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which is the third form. Thus the harſhneſſe continually attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth harder and harder, and ſo it becometh hard and tart [ſtrong or fierce,] ſo that the vertue or power is as hard as the hardeſt ſtone, which the bitterneſſe, [that is, the harſhneſſes own ſting, or prickle] cannot endure: and then there is great anguiſh in it, like the horrible brimſtone ſpirit; and the ſting of the bitterneſſe: which rubbeth it ſelf ſo hard, that in the anguiſh there cometh to be a twinkling flaſh, which flieth up terribly, and breaketh the <note n="r" place="margin">Or, Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> harſhneſſe: but it finding no reſt, and being ſo continually generated from beneath, it is as a turning wheele, which turneth anxiouſly and terribly with the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling flaſh <note n="f" place="margin">Or, ſenſeleſly and madly.</note> furiouſly, and ſo the flaſh is changed into a pricking [ſtinging] fire: which yet is no burning fire, but like the fire in a ſtone.</p>
            <p n="11">11 But being there is no reſt there, and that the turning wheel runneth as faſt as a ſwift thought, for the prickle driveth it ſo faſt; the prickle kindleth it ſelfe ſo much, that the flaſh (which is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between the aſtringency and bitterneſſe) becometh horribly fiery, and flieth up like a horrible fire, from whence the whole <hi>Materia</hi> or matter is terrified, and falleth back, as dead, or overcome, and doth not attract ſo <note n="t" place="margin">Or, eagerly.</note> ſtrongly to it ſelfe any more, but each yeeldeth it ſelfe to go out one from another, and ſo it becometh thinne; for the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaſh is now predominant, &amp; the <hi>Materia,</hi> or matter which was ſo very harſh [aſtringent or attracting] in the originalneſſe, is now feeble, and as it were dead, and the fire flaſh henceforth getteth ſtrength

therein, for it is its mother: and the bitterneſſe goeth forth up in the flaſh together with the harſhneſſe, and kindleth the flaſh, for it is the father of the flaſh, or fire, and the turning wheel henceforth ſtandeth in the fire flaſh, and the harſhneſſe remaineth overcome and feeble, which is now the water-ſpirit; and the <hi>Materia,</hi> or matter of the harſhneſſe, henceforth is like the brimſtone ſpirit, very thin, raw, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, vanquiſhed, and the ſting in it is trembling: and it drieth and ſharpneth it ſelfe in the flaſh; and being ſo very dry in the flaſh, it becometh continually more horrible and fiery, whereby the harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or aſtringency is ſtill more overcome, and the water-ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually greater: and ſo it continually refreſheth it ſelf in the water-ſpirit, and continually bringeth more matter to the fire-flaſh, whereby it is the more kindled; for (in a ſimilitude) that is the <note n="u" place="margin">Or, wood.</note> fewell of the flaſh or fire-ſpirit.</p>

3. This the Devils alſo ſee and know; for they alſo are out of the firſt Principle of God, which is the ſource of Gods originall nature: they wiſh alſo that they might not ſee nor feel it: but it is their own fault, that the ſecond Principle is ſhut up to them, which is called, and is, God, one in eſſence, and threefold in perſonall diſtinction, as ſhall be mentioned hereafter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But the ſoul of Man, which is enlightned with the holy Spirit of God, (which in the ſecond Principle proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne in the holy Heaven, that is, in the true divine Nature, <note n="c" place="margin">Viz. <hi>the holy Ghost.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. Therefore if I ſhould ſpeak and write that which is pure hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and altogether of the clear Deity; I ſhould be as dumb to the reader, which hath not the knowledge and the gift [to underſtand it.] Yet I will ſo write in a Divine and alſo in a creaturely way, that I might ſtirre up any one to deſire and long after the conſideration of the high things: and if any ſhall perceive that they cannot do it, that at leaſt they might ſeek and knock in their deſire, and pray to God for his holy Spirit, that the door of the ſecond Principle might be opened to them; for Chriſt biddeth us to pray, ſeek, and knock, and then it ſhall be opened unto us. For he ſaith, All that you ſhall aſk the Father in my name, he will give it you: Aſk and you ſhall teceive; ſeek, and you ſhall finde; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Seeing then that my knowledge hath been received by ſeeking and knocking; I therefore write it down for a memoriall that I might occaſion a deſire in any to ſeek after them, and thereby my talent might be improved, and not be hidden in the earth. But I have not written this for thoſe that are wiſe aforehand, that know all things, and yet know and comprehend nothing, for they are <note n="g" place="margin">That is, wiſe in their own conceit, and in their blindneſſe think they ſee well enough.</note> full ſatisfied already, and rich; but I have written it for the ſimple, as I am, that I may be refreſhed with thoſe that are like my ſelfe.</p>

               <p n="9">9.

REader, underſtand [and conſider] my writings aright, we have no power or ability to ſpeak of the birth of God [or the birth of the Deity] for it never had any beginning from all eternity: but we have power to ſpeak of God our Father, what he is, and how he is, and how the eternall <note n="a" place="margin">Nativity, birth, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or working.</note> geniture is.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And though it is not very good for us to know the auſtere, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt [ſtrong, fierce, ſevere] and originall birth, into the knowledge, feeling and comprehenſibility of which our firſt parents hath brought us, through the <note n="b" place="margin">Mixture; poyſoning, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noming, or temptation.</note> infection [inſtigation] and deceit of the Devil; yet we have very great need of this knowledge, that thereby we may learn to know the Devill, who dwelleth in the moſt ſtrong [ſevere or cruell] birth of all: and [that we may learn to know] our own enemy <hi>Self,</hi> which our firſt parents <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>rouſed up.</hi>
                  </note> awakened and purchaſed for us, which we carry within us, and which we our ſelves now are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And although I write now, as if there were a beginning in the eternall Birth, yet it is not ſo: but the eternall Nature thus beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth [or generateth] it ſelf without beginning; my writings muſt be underſtood in a creaturely manner, as the birth of man is, who is a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of God: although it be juſt ſo in the eternall Being [eſſence or ſubſtance] yet that is both without beginning and without end: and my writing is onely to this end, that Man might learn to know what he is, what he was in the beginning, how he was a very glorious eternall holy man, that ſhould never have known the Gate of the ſtrong [or auſtere] birth in the eternity, if he had not ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to luſt after it through the <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

Man, (which is like the firſt Man before the fall,) in Chriſt our <note n="g" place="margin">Who bringeth us forth out of the Wrath into the Love of God.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generator.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For though I ſhould ſpeak or write never ſo much of the Fall, and alſo of the Regeneration in Chriſt; and did not come to the root and ground, what the fall was, and by what it was we come to periſh, and what that property is which God abhorreth, and how that was effected, contrary to the command and will of God: What ſhould I underſtand of the thing? juſt nothing! and then how ſhould I ſhun or avoyd that which I have no knowledge of: or how ſhould I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to come to the New birth, and give my ſelfe up into it, if I knew not how, wherein, nor wherewith to doe it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is very true, the world is full of Books, and Sermons of the Fall, and of the New birth. But in moſt part of the Books of the <note n="h" place="margin">Theologie.</note> Divines, there is nothing but the Hiſtory that ſuch a thing hath been done, and that we ſhould be regenerated in Chriſt, but what doe I underſtand from hence? nothing: but onely the Hiſtory, that ſuch a thing hath been done, and done againe, and ought to be done.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our <note n="h" place="margin">Theologie.</note> Divines ſet themſelves hand and foot with might and main, with their utmoſt endeavour, by perſecution and reproach, againſt this [and ſay] that men muſt not [dare to] ſearch into the deep Grounds, what God is, men muſt not ſearch nor curiouſly pry into the Deity: but if I ſhould ſpeak plainly what this trick of theirs is? it is the dung and filth wherewith they cover and hide the Devill, and cloake the injected malice and wickedneſſe of the Devill in Man, ſo that neither the Devill, nor the anger of God, nor the <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>Evill will,</hi>
                  </note> Evill Beaſt in Man, <note n="k" place="margin">But remaine hidden and undiſcovered.</note> can be diſcerned.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And this is the very reaſon, becauſe the Devill ſmelleth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore he hindereth it, that his kingdome might not be revealed, but that he might continue to be the Great Prince [of the world ſtill]: for otherwiſe, if his kingdome were knowne, men might flie from him; where is it more needfull for him to oppoſe, than on that part where his Enemy may break in? He therefore covereth the hearts, minds, thoughts, and ſenſes of the Divines, he leadeth them into covetouſneſſe, pride, and wantonneſſe, ſo that they ſtand amazed with feare and horror at the Light of God, and therefore they ſhut it up, for they are naked, nay they grutch the light to thoſe that ſee it; this is rightly called the ſervice and worſhip of the Devill.</p>

               <p n="9">9. The Birth of the Eternall Nature, is like the [thoughts or] ſenſes in Man, as when a [thought or] ſenſe is generated by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and afterwards propagateth it ſelf into infinite many [thoughts] or as a roote of a Tree generateth a ſtock and many buds and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as alſo many roots, buds, and branches from one roote, and all of them from that one firſt roote. Therefore obſerve what is mentioned before: whereas nature conſiſteth of ſix formes [or properties]: ſo every forme generateth againe a forme out of it ſelfe of the ſame quality and condition of it ſelfe, and this forme now hath the quality and condition of all the formes in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it aright.</hi>
                  </note> obſerve it well: the firſt of the ſix formes generateth but one <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Budding property.</hi>
                  </note> ſource like it ſelfe, after the ſimilitude of its own fountaine Spirit, and not like the firſt Mother the harſhneſſe, but as one twig or branch in a Tree, putteth forth another ſprout out of it ſelfe. For in every fountaine-Spirit, there is but one centre wherein the fire-ſource or fountaine ariſeth, and the light ariſeth out of the flaſh of the fire, and the firſt ſix-fold forme is in the <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>Springing property.</hi>
                  </note> ſource or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But mark the depth, in a ſimilitude which I ſet down thus; the harſh-ſpring in the Originall, is the Mother out of which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five Springs are generated, <hi>viz.</hi> Bitterneſſe, fire, love, ſound, and water. Now theſe are members of this Birth [of their Mother] and without them there would be nothing but an anguiſhing dark vale [or <hi>vacuum]</hi> where there could be no mobility, nor any light or life: But now the life is borne in her by the kindling of the light, and then ſhee rejoyceth in her own property, and laboureth in her owne tart, ſoure quality to generate againe, and in her own quality there riſeth a life againe, and a centre openeth it ſelfe againe, and the life cometh to be generated againe out of her in a ſix-fold forme, yet not in any ſuch anguiſh as at the beginning, but in great joy.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For the Spring of the great anguiſh, which was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before the light, in the [tart] harſhneſſe, from which the bitter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57651:12"/>
ſting or prickle is generated; that is now in the ſweet fountaine of the love in the light, changed from the water-ſpirit, and from bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or pricklineſſe is now become the fountaine or ſpring of the joy in the light. Thus now henceforth the fire-flaſh is the father of the light, and the light ſhineth in him, and is now the onely cauſe of the moving Birth, and of the birth of the love; that which in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>Lake of Torment.</hi>
                  </note> aking ſource, is now <hi>SUL,</hi> or the oyle of the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſant fountaine, which preſſeth through all the fountaines, ſo that from hence the light is kindled.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And the ſound or noiſe, in the turning wheele, is now the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarer, or pronouncer in all the fountaines, that the beloved childe is borne; for it cometh with its ſound before all Doores, and in all Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences; ſo that in its awakening, all the vertues or powers are ſtirring, and ſee, feele, have ſmell, and taſte one another in the light, for the whole Birth nouriſheth it ſelfe in its firſt mother, <hi>viz.</hi> the <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>Soure, tart ſpringing ſubſtantiality.</hi>
                  </note> harſh eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; being now become ſo thin [or pure] meek, ſweet, and full of joy, and ſo the whole birth ſtandeth in very great joy, love, meekneſſe, and humility, and is nothing elſe than a meere pleaſing taſte, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting ſight, a ſweet ſmell, a raviſhing ſound to the hearing, a ſoft touch, beyond that which any tongue can utter or expreſſe, how ſhould there not be joy and love, where, in the very midſt of death the Eternall Life is generated, and where there is no feare of any end, nor can be?</p>
               <p n="14">14. Thus in the harſhneſſe there is a new birth againe: underſtand, where the tart [ſoure aſtringency] is predominant in the Birth, and where the fire is not kindled according to the bitter ſting or prickle, or from the beginning of the anguiſh: But the rifing [or exulting] Joy, is now the Centre and kindling of the light, and the tartneſſe [or aſtringency] hath now <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>for.</hi>
                  </note> in its own quality the SUL, Oyle, and Light of the Father: Therefore now the Birth out of the Twig or Branch of the firſt tree is qualified altogether according to the <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>tart, ſoure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi>
                  </note> harſh fountaine: and the fire therein is a tart [or ſoure] fire, and the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, a tart bitterneſſe: and the ſound a tart ſound: and the love a tart love, but all in meere perfection, and in a totally glorious love and joy.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And thus alſo the firſt bitter ſting or prickle, or the firſt bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (after the Light is kindled, and that the firſt Birth ſtandeth in perfection) generateth againe out of its own quality an <note n="ſ" place="margin">Twig or branch.</note> eſſence, wherein there is a Centre, where alſo a new fountaine or ſource ſpringeth up in a new fire or life, having the condition and property of all the qualities, and yet the bitterneſſe in this new ſprout is chiefeſt among all the qualities: ſo that there is a bitter bitterneſſe, a bitter tartneſſe, a bitter water-ſpirit, a bitter ſound, a bitter fire, a bitter love, yet all perfectly in the <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>exulting great Joy.</hi>
                  </note> riſing up of Great Joy.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57651:13"/>
16. And the fire generateth now alſo a fire, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of every quality, in the tart ſpirit it is tart; in the bitter, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in the love, it is a very hearty yearning, kindling of the love, a totall, fervent, or burning kindling, and cauſeth very vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; in the ſound, it is a very ſhrill tanging <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>life.</hi>
                  </note> fire, wherein all things are very clearly and properly diſtinguiſhed, and where the ſound in all qualities telleth or expreſſeth, as it were with the lips, or tongue, whatſoever is in all the fountain ſpirits, what joy, vertue, or power, eſſence, ſubſtance, or property, [they have] and in the water it is a very drying fire.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The propagation of the Love is moſt eſpecially to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for it is the lovelieſt, pleaſanteſt, and ſweeteſt fountain of all, when the love generateth again a whole birth, with all the fountains of the original eſſences out of it ſelf, ſo that the love in all the <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>well-ſpring.</hi>
                  </note> ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veins in that new birth be predominant and chiefe, ſo that a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ariſeth therein, then the firſt eſſence, viz. the Tartneſſe, is wholly deſirous or longing, wholly ſweet, wholly light, and giveth it ſelf forth to be food to all the qualities, with a hearty affection towards them all, as a loving mother hath towards her children; and here the Bitterneſſe may be rightly called Joy; for it is the riſing or moving [thereof:] what joy there is here, there is no other ſimilitude of it, than when a man is ſuddenly and unexpectedly delivered out of the pain and torment of hell, and put into the light of the Divine Joy.</p>
               <p n="18">18. So alſo the ſound, where the Love is predominant, it bringeth moſt joyfull tidings, or newes into all the forms of the Birth, as alſo the fire in the love, that kindleth the love rightly in all the Fountain-ſpirits, as is mentioned above; and the Love kindleth Love in its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. When the Love is predominant in Love, it is the ſweeteſt, meekeſt, humbleſt, lovingeſt fountain of all that ſpringeth in all the fountains: and it confirmeth and fixeth the heavenly birth, ſo that it is a holy divine Eſſence or Subſtance.</p>
               <p n="19">19. You muſt alſo mark the form of the Water-ſpirit, when that generateth its like, ſo that it is predominant in its regeneration or ſecond birth, and that a center be awakened in it, (which it ſelf in its own eſſence doth not awaken, but the other fountain-ſpirits do it therein) it [the Water-ſpirit] is ſtill and quiet as a meek mother, and ſuffereth the other to ſow their ſeed into it, and to awaken the center in it, ſo that the fire riſeth up, from whence the life <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>beginneth to ſtirre.</hi>
                  </note> is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. In this [form] the fire is not a hot burning [ſcorching] fire, but cool, milde, ſoft and ſweet: and the bitterneſſe is no bitterneſſe, but cool, milde, budding, and flowing forth, from whence the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [or figuring and beauteous ſhape] in the heavenly glory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, and is a moſt beautifull ſubſtance; for the ſound alſo in this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57651:13"/>
birth, floweth forth moſt pleaſantly and harmoniouſly, all as it were palpably or feelingly; or in a ſimilitude, as a word that cometh to be an eſſence, or a comprehenſible ſubſtance. For in this regeneration that is brought to paſſe in the water-ſpirit, (that is, in the true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the regeneration of all the fountain-ſpirits) all is as it were comprehenſible or ſubſtantiall; although no comprehenſibility muſt be underſtood here, but ſpirit.</p>

               <p n="2">2. I know very well, and my ſpirit and minde ſheweth me as much, that many will be offended at the ſimplicity and meanneſſe of the Anthour, for offering to write of ſuch high things; and many will think, (with themſelves) he hath no authority to do it, and that he doth very ſinfully in it, and runneth clean contrary to God and his will, in preſuming, being but a man, to goe about to ſpeak and ſay what God is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For it is lamentable, that ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> we ſhould be ſo continually cheated and befooled by the Devill, to think that we are not the children of God, nor of his <note n="a" place="margin">Subſtance, or off-ſpring.</note> eſſence. He continually putteth the monſtrous ſhape or form into our thoughts, as he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our mother <hi>Eve,</hi> which ſhe gazed too much upon, and by her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting it in her imagination, ſhe became a childe of this world, wholly naked and vain, and void of underſtanding: And ſo he doth to us alſo continually ſtill; he would bring us into another I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57651:14"/>
as he did <hi>Eve,</hi> that we might be aſhamed to appeare in the preſence of the Light and power of God, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were, when they hid themſelves behinde the trees, (that is, behinde the monſtrous ſhape or form,) when the Lord appeared in the centre of the birth of their lives, and ſaid, Where art thou <hi>Adam?</hi> And he ſaid, I am naked, and am afraid; which was nothing elſe, but that his beliefe [or faith] and knowledge of the holy God, was put out: for he beheld the monſtrous ſhape which he had made to himſelfe by his imagination and luſt, by the Devils [inſtigation] repreſentation, and falſe perſwading, to eat of the third Principle wherein <note n="b" place="margin">Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or perdition</note> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption was.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And now when he ſaw and knew by that which God had told him, that he ſhould die and periſh, if he did eat of the knowledge of good and evill: it made him continually imagine that he was now no more the child of God, and that he was not created out of Gods own eſſence or ſubſtance, out of the firſt Principle: he conceived that he was now but a meere child of this world, when he beheld his corruptibility, and alſo the monſtrous image which he <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>carried about him.</hi>
                  </note> was in; and that the Paradiſicall <note n="d" place="margin">Wit, reaſon, or skill.</note> underſtanding, delight and joy was departed from him, ſo that his ſpirit and perfection was driven out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, (that is, out of the ſecond Principle of God, where the Light or the Heart of God is generated from eternity to eternity, and where the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne) and that he now lived no more meerly by the word of God, but did eat and drink, viz,, the <note n="e" place="margin">Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> birth of his life henceforward conſiſted in the third Principle, that is, in the [Region, Kingdome, or dominion of the Starres and Elements, and he muſt now eat of the vertue and fruit thereof, and live thereby: and thereupon he then ſuppoſed, that he was paſt recovery, and that the noble image of God was deſtroyed. And beſide, the Devill alſo continually repreſented his corruptibility and mortality to him, and himſelfe could ſee nothing elſe, being he was gone out of paradiſe, that is, out of the incorruptible holy <note n="f" place="margin">Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture [or operation] of God; wherein he was Gods holy image and childe, in which God created him to continue therein for ever. And if the mercifull love of God had not appeared to him again in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the birth of his life, and comforted him; he would have thought that he were wholly departed, or quite ſeparated from the eternall Divine birth, and that he were no more in God, nor God any more in him, and that he were no more of Gods eſſence.</p>

the Divine root, but that he was ſtill the childe of God, and repented him of his firſt evill luſt: and thereupon the Lord ſhewed him the treader upon the Serpent, who ſhould deſtroy his monſtrous birth; and ſo he ſhould from the monſtrous birth be regenerated anew, in the ſhape, form, power and vertue of the treader upon the Serpent, and be brought with power again into Paradiſe, into the holy birth, and eat of the <note n="i" place="margin">Verbum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> Word of the Lord again, and live eternally, in ſpite of all the <note n="*" place="margin">Or; <hi>power.</hi>

If you lift up your thoughts and minds, and ride upon the Chariot of the ſoule, as is before mentioned, and looke upon your ſelfe, and all creatures, and conſider how the Birth of life in you tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its Originall, and the light of your life, whereby you can behold the ſhining of the Sunne; and alſo looke with your Imagination, without the light of the Sunne, into a huge vaſt ſpace, to which the eyes of your body cannot reach: and then conſider what the cauſe might be that you are more Rationall than the other Creatures, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you can ſearch what is in every thing: and conſider farther, from whence the Elements, Fire and Aire take their Originall, and how the Fire cometh to be in the Water, and generateth it ſelfe in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and how the light of your body generateth it ſelfe in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="25">25. And then if you be borne of God, you attaine to what God
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57651:17"/>
and the Eternall Birth is: for you ſee, feele, and finde, that all theſe muſt yet have a higher roote, from whence they proceed, which is not viſible but hidden: eſpecially if you look upon the ſtarry Heaven which endureth thus unchangably, therefore you ought to conſider from whence it is proceeded, and how it ſubſiſteth thus, and is not corrupted, nor riſeth up above, nor falleth downe beneath, though indeed there is neither above nor beneath there. Now if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what preſerveth all thus, and whence it is: then you finde the Eternall Birth that hath no beginning, and you finde the Originall of the Eternall Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> the eternall indiſſoluble Band: and then ſecondly, you ſee the ſeparation; in that the materiall world, with the Starres and Elements, are out of the firſt Principle, which containeth the outward and third Principle in it: for you finde in the Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kingdome or Dominion, a cauſe in every thing, wherefore it is, generateth and moveth as it doth: but you finde not the firſt cauſe, from whence it is ſo: there are therefore <note n="q" place="margin">Viz. <hi>The firſt and the third Principle.</hi>
                  </note> Two ſeverall Principles; for you finde in the viſible things a corruptibility, and perceive that they muſt have a beginning, becauſe they have an end.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And thirdly, you finde in all things a glorious power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is the life, growing and ſpringing of every thing, and you finde that therein lyeth its beauty and pleaſant welfare, from whence it ſtirreth. Now look upon an hearb or plant, and conſider it, what is its life which makes it grow? and you ſhall finde in the Originall, harſhneſſe, bitterneſſe, fire, and water, and if you ſhould ſeparate theſe foure things one from another, and put them together againe, yet you ſhall neither ſee nor find any growing, but if it were ſevered from its own mother that generated it at the beginning, then it remaineth dead; much leſſe can you bring the pleaſant ſmell, nor colours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Thus you ſee that there is an Eternall Roote, which affordeth this; and if you could bring the colours and vegetation or growing into it, yet you could not bring the ſmell and vertue into it: and thus you will finde in the Originall of the ſmell and of the taſte, there muſt be another Principle, which the ſtock it ſelfe is not, for that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath its originall from the light of Nature.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Now look upon the humane life a little further, you neither ſee, finde, nor apprehend any more by your ſight, than fleſh and bloud, wherein you are like other Beaſts: ſecondly, you finde the Elements of aire and fire which <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>Mingle themſelves.</hi>
                  </note> worke in you, and that is but an animall or beaſtiall life, for every beaſt hath the ſame in it, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the luſt to fill them, and to propagate themſelves, as all plants, hearbs, and graſſe, and yet you finde no true underſtanding to be in all theſe living creatures; for although the Starres or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations doe operate in <note n="ſ" place="margin">Animall or Beaſtiall man.</note> Man, and afford him the ſenſes, yet they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57651:17"/>
are onely ſuch ſenſes as belong to nouriſhment and propagation, like other Beaſts.</p>
               <p n="29">29. For the Starres themſelves are ſenſleſſe, and have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or perception, yet their ſoft operation in the water maketh a ſeething flowing forth, or boyling up one of another, and in the tincture of the bloud, they cauſe a riſing, ſeeing, feeling, hearing, and taſting. Therefore conſider from whence the tincture proceedeth, wherein the noble life ſpringeth up? That thus becometh ſweet from harſhneſſe, bitterneſſe, and fire, and you ſhall certainly finde no other cauſe of it than the light: but whence cometh the light, that it can ſhine <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>upon a dark place.</hi>
                  </note> in a dark body? If you ſay it cometh from the light of the Sunne, then what ſhineth in the night, and enlighteneth your <note n="u" place="margin">Inward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or thoughts</note> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and underſtanding ſo? that though your eyes be ſhut, you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and know what you doe?

                  </note> ſenſes make the minde ſtirring; and that is alſo true. But whence come they both? What is their birth or off ſpring? Why is it not ſo with the Beaſts?</p>
               <p n="30">30. My deare Reader, if you be able, <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>anſwer this queſtion.</hi>
                  </note> breake open all, and looke into the pith, yet you ſhall not finde it, though you ſhould ſeek in the Deepe, in the Starres, in the Elements, in all living Creatures, in Stones, Plants, Trees, and in Metalls; alſo in Heaven and Earth, you ſhall not finde it. Now you will ſay, Where then ſhall I finde it? Deare Reader, I cannot ſo much as lend you the Key that will lead you to it. But I will direct you where you ſhall finde it; it lyeth in the third Chapter of the Evangeliſt S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John;</hi> in theſe words; <hi>You muſt be borne anew by water and by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This Spirit is the Key, when you attaine it, receive it, and goe before the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, out of which this world and all Creatures are created, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the firſt roote, from which ſuch viſible and ſenſible things did ſpring.</p>
               <p n="31">31. But you will ſay, this is onely God, and he is a ſpirit, and hath created all things out of nothing. Tis very true, he is a Spirit, and in our ſight he is as nothing: and if wee had not ſome knowledge of him by the Creation, wee ſhould know nothing of him at all; and if he himſelfe had not been from all Eternity, there could nothing have ever been.</p>
               <p n="32">32. But what doe you thinke there was before the times of the world, out of which the Earth and Stones proceeded, as alſo the Starres and Elements? That out of which theſe proceeded was the Roote: But what is the Roote of theſe things? Looke, what doe you finde in theſe things? Nothing elſe but fire, bitterneſſe, and harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, [or aſtringent ſourneſſe] and theſe three are but one thing, and hence all things are generated. Now this was but a Spirit before
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57651:18"/>
the times of the world, and yet you cannot finde God in theſe three formes: the pure Deity is a light which is incomprehenſible, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceivable, alſo allmighty and all powerfull, where is it then that men may finde God?</p>
               <p n="33">33. Here open your noble minde, ſee and ſearch further; ſeeing God is onely Good, from whence cometh the Evill? And ſeeing alſo that he alone is the life, and the light, and the holy power, as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably true, from whence cometh the anger of God? From whence cometh the Devill, and his [evill] will; alſo Hell-fire, from whence hath that its Originall? Seeing there was nothing before the time of this world, but onely God, who was and is a Spirit, and continueth ſo in Eternity: From whence then is the firſt <hi>Materia,</hi> or matter of Evill? For reaſon giveth this judgement, that there muſt needs have been in the Spirit of God, a will to generate the ſource or fountaine of Anger.</p>
               <p n="34">34. But now the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Devill was a holy Angel:</hi> and further, it ſaith: <hi>Thou art not a God that willeth evill:</hi> and in <hi>Ezekiel: As ſure as I live, I will not the death of a ſinner:</hi> this is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Gods earneſt ſevere puniſhing of the Devils, and all ſinners, that he is not pleaſed with death.</p>
               <p n="35">35. What then moved the Devill to be angry, and evill? What is the firſt matter [of it] in him, ſeeing he was created out of the Originall Eternall Spirit? Or from whence is the Originall of Hell, wherein the Devils ſhall remaine for ever, when this world, with the Starres, and Elements, Earth, and Stones, ſhall periſh in the end.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Beloved Reader, Open the eyes of your minde here; and know, that no other [anguiſh] ſource will ſpring up in him [and torment him] than his own <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>working propertie.</hi>
                  </note> quality: for that is his Hell out of which he is created and made: and the light of God is his eternall ſhame, and therefore he is Gods enemy, becauſe he is no more in the light of God.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Now you can here produce nothing more, that God ſhould ever uſe any matter out of which to create the Devill, for then the Devill might juſtifie himſelfe, that he made him evill, or of evill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for God created him out of nothing, but meerly out of his owne Eſſence or Subſtance, as well as the other Angels: As it is written; <hi>Through him, and in him, are all things:</hi> and his onely is the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> and the <hi>Glory;</hi> and all in him, as the holy Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth: and if it were not thus, no ſinne would be <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>accounted ſinne.</hi>
                  </note> imputed to the Devill, nor men, if they were not eternall, and both in God, and out of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="38">38. For to a Beaſt, (which is created out of matter) no ſinne may be imputed; for its Spirit reacheth not the firſt Principle; but it hath its originall in the third Principle in the Elementary and ſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57651:18"/>
kingdome, in the corruptibility, and it reacheth not the Deity, as the Devil and the ſoul of man doth.</p>
               <p n="39">39 And if you cannot beleeve this, take the holy Scripture before you, which telleth you, that when man was fallen into ſinne, God ſent him his own heart, life or light, out of himſelf into the fleſh, and opened the gate of the birth of his life, wherein he was united with God, and being broken off in the light [part] (yet continued in the originall of the firſt Principle) he hath kindled that light, and ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to man again.</p>
               <p n="40">40. If the ſoul of man were not [ſprung] out of God the Father out of his firſt Principle, but out of another matter, he could not have beſtowed that higheſt earneſt or pledge of his own heart and light upon him, as himſelf witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>I am the light of the world, and the life of Man:</hi> but he could very well have redeemed or helped him ſome other way.</p>
               <p n="41">41. But what do you think that he brought to man into the fleſh when he came? Nothing elſe but what <hi>Adam</hi> and our mother <hi>Eve</hi> had loſt in Paradiſe: the ſame did the treader upon the Serpent bring again to the monſtrous birth, and delivered man out of that Elementary and Sydereall houſe of fleſh, and ſet him again in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: of which I will write at large hereafter.</p>
               <p n="42">42 If therefore you will ſpeak or think of God, you muſt conſider that he is all: and you muſt look further into the three Principles, wherein you will finde what God is, you will finde what the Wrath, the Devill, Hell and Sinne are, alſo, what the Angels, Man and Beaſts are, and how the ſeparation or variation followed, from whence all things have thus proceeded, you will finde the creation of the world.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Onely (Reader) I admoniſh you ſincerely, if you be not in the way of the prodigall, or loſt ſonne, returning to his father again, that you leave my book, and read it not, it wil do you harm: for the <note n="b" place="margin">Satan.</note> great Prince will not forbear to deceive you; becauſe he ſtandeth naked in this book before the children of God, and is exceedingly aſhamed, as a man that is put to open ſhame before all people for his miſdeeds: therefore be warned. And if you love and ſavour the tender delicate fleſh ſtill, do not read my book: but if you will not take warning, and a miſchief befall you, I will be guiltleſſe, blame no body but your ſelf: for I write down what I know at preſent, for a memoriall to my ſelfe; yet God knoweth well what he will do [with it] which in ſome meaſure is hid from me.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Seeing now that we can finde nothing in all Nature, of which we may ſay, This is God, or here is God, from whence we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God might be ſome ſtrange thing; and ſeeing himſelf witneſſeth, that his is the kingdome and the power from eternity to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57651:19"/>
eternity; and that he calleth himſelf Father (and the Sonne is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of the loyns of his Father,) therefore we muſt ſeek for him in the originall, in the Principle out of which the world was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <note place="margin">In principio.</note> and created in the beginning: and we can ſay no otherwiſe but that the firſt Principle is God the Father himſelf.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Yet there is found in the originall the moſt horrible and [fierce or] ſtrong birth, viz. the Harſhneſſe, Bitterneſſe, and Fire; of which we cannot ſay, that it is God: and yet it is the moſt inward firſt <note n="d" place="margin">Wel-ſpring or fountain.</note> ſource of all, that is in God the Father; according to which, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelf, an Angry, Zealous, [or Jealous] God: and this ſource (as you finde before in the firſt three chapters concerning the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the eternall Birth) is the firſt Principle, and that is God the Father in his originality, out of which this world hath its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p n="46">46. But the Angels and the Devils, as alſo the ſoul of man, are meerly and purely, <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p n="47">47. Yet in this Principle there is nothing elſe but the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible begetting, the greateſt anguiſh and hoſtile quickning, like a Brimſtone-ſpirit, and is ever the gate of Hell, and the Abyſſe wherein Prince Lucifer (at the extinguiſhing of his light) continued; and wherein (viz. in the ſame abyſſe of Hell) the ſoul continueth, which is ſeparated from the ſecond Principle, and whoſe light ([which ſhineth] from the heart of God) is extinguiſhed, and for which cauſe alſo, at the end of this time, there will be a ſeparation or parting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder of the Saints of light from the damned, whoſe <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>working fountain of their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a boyling ſpringing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> ſource will be without the light of God.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Now we have here ſhewed you the firſt Principle, out of which all things take their beginning: and muſt ſpeak ſo of it, as if there were a place, or a ſeparable eſſence, where there is ſuch a kinde of ſource; to the end that the firſt Principle might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſo that the eternity, as alſo the anger of God, ſinne, eternall death, the darkneſſe, (which is ſo called in reſpect of the extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the light) alſo hell-fire, and the Devill might be known and underſtood [what they are.]</p>
               <p n="49">49. So I will now write of the ſecond Principle, of the cleare pure Deity, of the <note n="h" place="margin">That is, the power, glory, or luſtre of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ather.</note> heart of God. In the firſt Principle (as I have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57651:19"/>
mentioned above) is <note n="i" place="margin">The attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, aſtringent, ſoure, tart, ſmartneſſe.</note> Harſhneſſe, Bitterneſſe, and Fire; and yet they are not three things, but one onely thing, and they one generate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: Harſhneſſe is the firſt Father, which is ſtrong, [fierce or tart] very ſharp and attracting to it ſelf; and that attracting is the [ſting] or prickle, or bitterneſſe, which the harſhneſſe cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and it will not be captivated in death, but riſeth and flieth up like a ſtrong fierce ſubſtance, and yet cannot remove from off its place: And then there is a horrrible anguiſh, which findeth no reſt: and the birth is like a turning wheel, twitching ſo very hard, and breaking or bruiſing as it were furiouſly, which the harſhneſſe cannot endure, but attracteth continually more and more, harder and harder; as when ſteel and a flint are ſtruck one againſt another, from which the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling flaſh of fire proceedeth: and when the harſhneſſe perceiveth <note n="k" place="margin">The flaſh of fire.</note> it, <note n="†" place="margin">The harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> it ſtarteth and ſinketh back, as it were dead and overcome: and ſo when the flaſh of fire cometh into its mother, the harſhneſſe, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her thus ſoft and overcome, then it is much more terrified [than the harſhneſſe] and becometh in the twinkling of an eye white and clear: And now when the harſh tartneſſe attaineth the white clear light in it ſelf, it is ſo very much terrified, that it [falleth or] ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth back as if it were dead and overcome, and expandeth it ſelf, and becometh very thin and [pliable or] vanquiſhed: For its own ſource was dark and hard, and now is become <note n="l" place="margin">As when the the rayes of the ſun which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the hard cold ice into thin fluid water.</note> light and ſoft; therefore now it is firſt rightly become as it were dead, and now is the water-ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Thus the birth getteth an eſſence that hath ſharpneſſe from the harſhneſſe, and ſweetneſſe, thinneſſe, and expanſion from the light: and now when the flaſh of fire cometh into its mother, and findeth her ſo ſweet, thin and light, <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>can work no more.</hi>
                  </note> then it loſeth its own proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the qualification, and flieth aloft no more, but continueth in its mother, and loſeth its fiery right [or propriety] and trembleth and rejoyceth in its mother.</p>
               <p n="51">51. And in this joy, in the water-ſpring, [or ſource] the pleaſant <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſtream.</hi>
                  </note> ſource of the <note n="o" place="margin">Unſearchable, unfathomable, or inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> bottomleſſe love riſeth up, and all that riſeth up there, is the ſecond Principle: for the whole begetting or generating, falleth into a glorious love; for the harſhneſſe now loveth the light dearly, becauſe it is ſo refreſhing, chearly and beautifull: for from this pleaſant refreſhing it becometh thus ſweet, <note n="p" place="margin">Gentle, or friendly.</note> courteous and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble [or lowly] and the bitterneſſe now loveth the harſhneſſe, becauſe it is no more dark, nor ſo ſtrongly [eagerly or fiercely] attractive to it ſelfe, but is ſweet, milde, pure, and light.</p>
               <p n="52">52. And here beginneth the taſte, whereby one continually [tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, taſteth and] proveth the other, and with great deſire mingle one within another, ſo that there is nothing but a meer courteous em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing; thus the bitterneſſe now rejoyceth in its mother, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57651:20"/>
ſtrengtheneth it ſelf therein, and for great joy riſeth up through all the eſſences, and declareth to the ſecond Principle, that the loving childe is <note n="q" place="margin">Begotten.</note> born; to which then all the eſſences give heed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at that dear childe: from whence the hearing ariſeth, which is the ſixth form where the wheel of the birth ſtandeth in triumph. And in this great joy the birth cannot contain it ſelf [within its bounds,] but expandeth it ſelf, flowing forth very joyfully, and every eſſence [or ſubſtance] generateth now again a centre in the ſecond Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
               <p n="53">53. And there beginneth the unfathomable [or unſearchable] multiplication; for the flowing and ſpringing ſpirit, that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the firſt and ſecond Principle, confirmeth, fixeth and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth all; and in the whole birth it is as a growing or multiplying in one will: and the birth attaineth here the ſeventh form, viz. the multiplication <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>in.</hi>
                  </note> into an eſſence of love: and in this form conſiſteth Paradiſe, or the Kingdome of God, or the numberleſſe divine birth, out of one onely eſſence, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Or, <hi>in all things.</hi>
                  </note> into all eſſence.</p>
               <p n="54">54 Although here the tongue of man cannot utter, declare, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe nor fathome this great depth, where there is neither number nor end; yet we have power to ſpeak thereof as children talk of their father: but to dive into the whole depth, that troubleth us, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbeth our ſouls: for God himſelf knoweth neither beginning nor end in himſelf.</p>
               <p n="55">55. And now being to ſpeak of the holy Trinity, we muſt, firſt ſay, that there is one God, and he is called the Father and creator of all things, who is Almighty; and All in All, whoſe are all things, and in whom and from whom all things proceed, and in whom they remain eternally. And then we ſay, that he is three in perſons, and hath from eternity generated his Sonne out of himſelfe, who is his Heart, Light, and Love: and yet they are not two, but one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eſſence. And further we ſay, as the holy Scripture telleth us, that there is a holy Ghoſt, which proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne, and that there is but one eſſence in the Father, Sonne, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which is, rightly ſpoken.</p>
               <p n="56">56. For behold, the Father is the originall eſſence of all eſſences: and if now the ſecond Principle did not break forth and ſpring up in the birth of the Sonne, then the Father would be a dark <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or <hi>valley of darkneſſe.</hi>
                  </note> valley. And thus you ſee, that the Sonne (who is the Heart, the Love, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and the milde <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>Satiating.</hi>
                  </note> rejoycing of the Father) [in whom he is well pleaſed] openeth another Principle in his birth, and maketh the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and wrathfull Father (as I may ſay, as to the originality of the firſt Principle) reconciled, pleaſed, loving, and as I may ſay, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and he is another [manner of] perſon than the Father: for in his, <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>ground.</hi>
                  </note> centre there is nothing elſe but meer joy, love, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57651:20"/>
pleaſure: And yet you may ſee that the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne; for when the heart or light of God is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Father; then there ſpringeth up (in the kindling of the light in the fift forme) out of the <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>Welſpring of water,</hi> wch <hi>is the ground of Humility.</hi>
                  </note> Water-ſource in the light, a very pleaſant ſweet ſmelling and ſweet taſted Spirit: and this is that Spirit which in the Originall was the bitter ſting or prickle in the harſhneſſe [or tartneſſe]; and that maketh now in this Water-ſource, many thouſand <note n="z" place="margin">Centra.</note> Centres without number or end; and all this in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Water.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Now you may well perceive that the birth of the Sunne ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth its Originall in the fire; and attaineth his perſonality and name in the kindling of the ſoft, white, and cleere light, which is himſelfe, and himſelfe maketh the pleaſant ſmell, taſte, and ſatisfaction [or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and well-pleaſing] in the Father; and is rightly the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers heart; and another perſon: for he openeth and produceth the ſecond Principle in the Father; and his own Eſſence is the power or vertue and the light: and therefore his is rightly called the power or vertue of the Father.</p>
               <p n="58">58. But the Holy Ghoſt is not <note n="a" place="margin">Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or manifeſt, as the aire is not knowne or breathed forth in the originall of the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the light be kindled.</note> knowne in the Originall of the Father before the light [breake forth]; but when the ſoft fountaine ſpringeth up in the light, then he goeth forth as a ſtrong allmighty Spirit in great joy, from the pleaſant ſource of water, and [from] the hight, and he is the power and vertue of the ſource of water, and of the light; and he maketh now the forming [ſhaping figuring] and Images [or ſpecies,] and he is the centre in all Eſſences; in which [Centre] the light of life, in the hight of the Sunne, or heart of the Father taketh its originall. And the Holy Ghoſt is a ſeverall Perſon, becauſe he proceedeth (as a living power and vertue) from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne, and confirmeth the <note n="b" place="margin">Begetting, generating, or working.</note> Birth of the Trinity.</p>
               <p n="59">59. Now wee pray thus: <hi>Our Father [which are] in Heaven, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,</hi> (or ſanctified) <hi>be thy Name;</hi> and in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis</hi> it is written; <hi>God created the Heaven out of the midſt of the Water:</hi> by which is [meant or] underſtood the Heaven of the third Principle: and yet indeed he hath created it out of his own Heaven wherein he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. Thus you may eaſily finde, that the Birth of the Holy Deity ſtandeth in the ſource of Water, and the powerfull Spirit is moreover the former, framer, and faſhioner [or moulder] therein.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Thus now the Heaven in this forming or framing, and the framing and generating out of it in <hi>infinitum,</hi> or endleſly, is the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of God: as the highly worthy <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth: The Spirit of God moved upon the Water, in the framing [forming or faſhioning] of the world: This is and continueth ſo in its Eternity, that the Spirit of God (in the birth of the Sonne of God) moveth upon the Water; for he is the vertue, or power, and out flowing in the Father, out of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57651:21"/>
the kindled <note n="c" place="margin">Light water.</note> light, [a] water, out of the water and light of God.</p>
               <p n="61">61. Thus God is one onely undivided Eſſence, and yet threefold in perſonall diſtinction, one God, one will, one heart, one deſire, one pleaſure, one beauty, one almightineſſe, one fullneſſe of all things, neither beginning nor ending, for if I ſhould goe about to ſeeke for the beginning or ending of a [ſmall dot point <hi>punctum]</hi> or of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Circle, I ſhould miſſe and be confounded.</p>
               <p n="62">62. And although I have written here, as if it tooke a beginning (writing as it were of the beginning [and firſt ſpringing] of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle, and the <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all operation.</hi>
                  </note> birth of the divine Eſſence) yet you muſt not underſtand it as having any beginning: for the eternall birth is thus, [without beginning or end,] and that in the Originalneſſe: but I write to the end that man might learne to know himſelfe, what he is, and what God, Heaven, Angels, Devils, and Hell are, as alſo what the wrath of God and Hell-fire is. For I am permitted to write as far as of the Originalneſſe.</p>
               <p n="63">63. Therefore O childe of Man, conſider what thou art in this time, eſteeme not ſo ſleightly or poorly of thy ſelfe, but conſider that you remaine in Paradiſe, and put not out the divine light in you; or elſe you muſt hereafter remaine in the Originall of the ſource of anger or wrath in the valley of darkneſſe; and your noble Image out of God, will be turned into a Serpent and Dragon.</p>
               <p n="64">64. For you muſt know, that as ſoone as the divine light went out in the Devils, they loſt their beauteous forme and Image, and became like Serpents, Dragons, Wormes, and evill Beaſts; as may be ſeene by <hi>Adams</hi> Serpent; and thus it is alſo with the damned ſoules. For this wee know in the Originall of the firſt Principle very well. If you aske how ſo; reade this following.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A deſcription of a Devill, how he is in his own proper forme, and alſo how he was in the Angelicall forme.</head>
               <p n="65">65. Behold O childe of Man. All the Angels were created in the firſt Principle; and by the <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>moving working.</hi>
                  </note> flowing Spirit were formed, and bodified in a true Angelicall and ſpirituall manner, and enlightened from the light of God, that they might encreaſe the Paradificall joy, and abide [therein] eternally: but being they were to abide eternally, they muſt be figured [or formed] out of the indiſſoluble Band; out of the firſt Principle, which is an indiſſoluble Band: and they ought to looke upon the heart of God, and feed apon the Word of God; and this food would be their holy preſervation, and would make their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage cleere and light; as the heart of God in the beginning of the ſecond Principle, enlighteneth the Father, (that is the firſt Principle;) and there the Divine Power, Paradiſe, and kingdome of Heaven, ſpringeth up.</p>
               <p n="66">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57651:21"/>
66. Thus it is with thoſe Angels that continued in the kingdome of heaven in the true Paradiſe, they ſtand in the firſt Principle in the indiſſoluble Band, and their food is the divine Power, and their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination (or Imagining) [in their thoughts and minde] is the will of the holy Trinity in the Deity: the confirmation [or eſtabliſhing] of their life, will, and doings, is the power of the Holy Ghoſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that doth in the generating of Paradiſe, the Angels rejoyce at, and they fing the <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs.</hi>
                  </note> joyfull ſongs of Paradiſe, concerning the pleaſant ſaving fruit, and eternall birth: all they doe is an increaſing of the heavenly Joy, and a delight and pleaſure to the heart of God, a holy ſport in Paradiſe, a [ſatisfying of the deſire or] will of the eternall Father: to this end their God created them, that he might be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and rejoyce in his Creatures, and the Creatures in him, ſo that there might be an eternall ſport of love, in the centre of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying (or eternall Nature) in the indiſſoluble eternall Band.</p>
               <p n="67">67. This [ſport of love] was ſpoiled by Lucifer himſelfe, (who is ſo called, becauſe of the extinguiſhment of his light, and of being caſt out of his Throne) who was a Prince and King over many Legions, but is become a Devill, and hath loſt his beautifull, [faire, bright,] and glorious Image. For he as well as other Angels, was created out of the Eternall Nature, out of the eternall indiſſoluble Band, and [hath alſo] ſtood in Paradiſe, alſo felt and ſeene the <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>working.</hi>
                  </note> Birth of the holy Deity, the birth of the ſecond Principle, of the heart of God, and the confirmation of the Holy Ghoſt: his food ſhould have been of the Word of the Lord, and therein he ſhould have continued an Angel.</p>
               <p n="68">68. But he ſaw that he was a Prince, ſtanding in the firſt Principle, and ſo deſpiſed the birth of the heart of God, and the ſoft and very lovely <note n="h" place="margin">Working or influence.</note> qualification thereof, and meant to be a very potent and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Lord in the firſt Principle, and would qualifie [or work] in the ſtrength of the Fire: he deſpiſed the meekneſſe of the heart of God: he would not ſet his imagination therein [or his thoughts upon it] and therefore he could not be fed from the Word of the Lord, and ſo his light went out; whereupon preſently he became a loathſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Paradiſe, and was ſpewed out of his princely Throne, with all his Legions that ſtuck to him [or depended on him].</p>
               <p n="69">69. And now when the heart of God departed from him, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle was ſhut up to him, and ſo he loſt God, the kingdome of heaven, and all Paradiſicall knowledge, pleaſure, and joy; he alſo preſently loſt the Image of God, and the confirmation of the holy Ghoſt; becauſe he deſpiſed the ſecond Principle, wherein he was an Angel and Image of God: thus all things departed from him, and he remained in the <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>Valley of Darkneſſe.</hi>
                  </note> dark valley: and could no more raiſe his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion up into God, but he continued in the foure Anguiſhes of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginalneſſe.</p>
               <p n="70">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:57651:22"/>
70. And when he raiſed up his Imagination, then he kindled to himſelfe the ſource or roote of the fire, and then when the roote of the fire did ſeeke for the water <hi>(viz.</hi> the true Mother of the eternall Nature) it found the ſterne [or tart aſtringent] harſhneſſe, and the mother in the aking death: and the bitter ſting [or prickle] formed the birth to be a fierce raging Serpent, very terrible in it ſelfe, riſing up in the indiſſoluble Band, an eternall Eternity, a will ſtriving againſt it ſelfe, an eternall deſpaine of all good [the bitter ſting alſo formed] the minde to be [as] a breaking ſtriking wheele, having its will continually aſpiring to the ſtrength of the fire, and to deſtroy the heart of God, and yet could never at all be able to reach it.</p>
               <p n="71">71. For he is alwayes ſhut up in the firſt Principle (as in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Death) and yet he raiſeth himſelfe up continually, thinking to reach the heart of God, and to domineere over it: for his bitter ſting in the birth, climeth up thus eternally in the <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>Roote.</hi>
                  </note> ſource of the fire, and affordeth him a proud will to have all [at his pleaſure] but he attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, his food is the <note n="l" place="margin">Fountaine of poyſon.</note> fource of water, <hi>viz.</hi> the Brimſtone-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the moſt aking mother; from which the indiſſoluble band is fed and nouriſhed: his refreſhing is the eternall <note n="m" place="margin">Viz. <hi>the cold fire.</hi>
                  </note> fire, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall freeſing in the harſh mother: an eternall hunger in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, an eternall thirſt in the ſource of the fire: his climeing up is his fall, the more he climeth up in his will, the greater is his fall: like one that ſtanding upon a high clift, would caſt himſelfe downe into a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, he looketh ſtill further, and he falleth in further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet can finde no ground.</p>
               <p n="72">72. Thus he is an eternall enemy to the heart of God, and all the holy Angels: and he cannot frame any other will in himſelfe. His Angels and Devils are of very many ſeverall ſorts, all according to the Eternall Firth: For at the time of his Creation he ſtood (in the kingdome of Heaven) in the point, <hi>Locus,</hi> or place (where the holy Ghoſt in the birth of the heart of God, in Paradiſe, did open infinite and innumerable Centres) in the eternall Birth; in this ſeate or place, he was <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>Created.</hi>
                  </note> bodified, and hath his beginning in the opening of the <note n="o" place="margin">In the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ground, as a building from the Earth.</note> Centres in the Eternall Nature.</p>
               <p n="73">73. Therefore (as is mentioned before in the third Chapter) when the Birth of life ſprung up, every Eſſence had againe a Centre in it ſelfe, according to its owne property or quality, and figureth a life according to its Eſſence, <hi>viz.</hi> Harſhneſſe, bitterneſſe, fire, and ſound: and all further according to the ability of the eternall birth, which is <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>

               <p n="74">74. Seeing then that they ſtood in Heaven in the time of their Creation, therefore their quality was alſo manifold; and all ſhould have been and continued Angels, if the great fountaine Lucifer (from whence they proceeded) had nor deſtroyed them: and ſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57651:22"/>
now alſo every one in his fall continueth in his own Eſſences, onely the ſecond Principle is extinguiſhed in them: and ſo it is alſo with the ſoule of man, when the light of God goeth out in it: but ſo long as that ſhineth therein, it is in Paradiſe, and eateth of the word of the Lord, whereof ſhall be clearly ſpoken in its due place.</p>

            <p n="1">1. BEcauſe I may happen not to be underſtood clearly enough by the deſirous Reader; and ſhall be as one that is altogether dumb to the unenlightned, (for the eternall and indiſſoluble band, wherein the Eſſence of all Eſſences ſtandeth, is not eaſily nor in haſte to be underſtood;) therefore it is neceſſary that the deſirous Reader do the more earneſtly conſider himſelf what he is, and from whence his Reaſon and <note n="a" place="margin">Inward ſenſes, or thoughts.</note> Senſes do proceed, wherein he findeth the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of God, eſpecially if he conſider and meditate what his Soul is, which is an eternall uncorruptible Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if the Reader be <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>be in true reſignation.</hi>
               </note> born of God, there is no neerer way for him to come to the knowledge of the third Principle; then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the new Birth, how the ſoul is new born by the love of God, in the light; and how it is tranſlated out of the priſon or dungeon of darkneſſe into the light by a ſecond birth. And now if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that darkneſſe wherein it muſt be without the new birth; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the Scripture ſaith, and what every one findeth by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that falleth into the wrath of God; and whereof there are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible examples; that the ſoul muſt endure irkſome torment in it ſelf, in the birth of the life of its own ſelf, ſo long as it is in the wrath of God: and then that if it be born again, exulting great joy ariſeth in it: and thus you finde very clearly and plainly two Principles, as alſo, God, Paradiſe, and the kingdome of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For you finde in the root of the originall of the ſpirit of the ſoule, in it ſelf, in the ſubſtance of the eternall birth and uncorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eternall band of the ſoul, the moſt exceeding horrible inimiciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous irkſome <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>torment, or working property.</hi>
               </note> ſource, wherein the ſoul (without the light of God) is like all Devils, wherein their eternall ſource conſiſteth, being an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in it ſelf, a will ſtriving againſt God [and goodneſſe,] it deſireth nothing that is pleaſant or good, it is a climbing up of pride in the ſtrength of the fire, a bitter, [fierce, odious malice, or] wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57651:23"/>
againſt Paradiſe, againſt God, againſt the kingdome of heaven, alſo, againſt all creatures in the ſecond and third Principle, lifting up themſelves alone, [againſt all this] as the bitterneſſe <note n="d" place="margin">In wrath, or anger doth.</note> in the fire doth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now the Scripture witneſſeth throughout, and the new-born man findeth it ſo, that when the ſoul is new born in the light of God, then on the contrary it findeth, how very humble, meek, courteous, and cheerly it is, it readily beareth all manner of croſſes and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, it turneth the body from out of the way of the wicked, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth no reproach, diſgrace, or ſcorn put upon it from the Devill, or Man, it placeth its confidence, refuge, and love in the heart of God; it is very cheerfull, it is fed by the word of God, in which there is a Paradiſicall exulting and triumph, it cannot be [hurt, or ſo much as] touched by the Devill: for it is in its own ſubſtance (wherein it ſtands in the firſt Principle of the indiſſoluble band) enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the light of God; and the holy Ghoſt, who goeth forth out of the eternall <note n="e" place="margin">Generation, begetting, or working.</note> birth of the Father in the heart, and in the light of the heart of God, he goeth forth in it, and eſtabliſheth it the childe of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Therefore all that it doth (ſeeing it liveth in the light of God) is done in the love of God: the Devill cannot ſee that ſoul, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle wherein it liveth, and in which God and the kingdom of heaven ſtandeth, as alſo the Angels, and Paradiſe, is ſhut up from him, and he cannot get to it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In this conſideration you may finde what I underſtand by a Principle: For a Principle is nothing elſe but a new birth, a new life; beſides, there is no more than one Principle wherein there is an eternall life, that is, the eternall Deity: and that would not have been manifeſted, if God had created no creatures in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (viz. Angels and Men) who underſtand the eternall and indiſſoluble band, and <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
               </note> how the birth of the eternall light is in God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thus now herein is underſtood, how the divine Eſſence in the divine Principle, hath wrought in the root of the firſt Principle, which is the begettreſſe, matrix, or genetrix in the eternall birth in the <note n="g" place="margin">Limbus, <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a ſeed, or concretion of matter.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Limbus,</hi> or in the originall water-ſpirit: by which operation at laſt, the earth and ſtones come forth. For in the ſecond Principle, (viz. in the holy birth) there is onely ſpirit, light, and life; and the eternall wiſdome hath wrought in the eternall <note n="h" place="margin">Inſenſible, dumb, ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</note> inanimate, genetrix which is void of underſtanding (viz. in her own property) before the originall of the light; out of which came the <note n="i" place="margin">Duſt, dirt, or mud.</note> dark Chaos, which in the elevation of Lord <hi>Lucifer</hi> (when the light of God departed from him, and the fierceneſſe of the ſource of the fire was kindled) became hard matter (viz. ſtones and earth,) whereupon followed the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57651:23"/>
gathering together of the earth, as alſo the ſpewing out of <hi>Lucifer</hi> from his Throne, and the creating of the third Principle: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followed, that he was ſhut up in the third Principle as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, expecting henceforth the [judgement or] ſentence of God. Now whether it be not a ſhame, diſgrace, and irkſomneſſe to him to be ſo impriſoned between Paradiſe and this world, and not to be able to comprehend either of them, I propound it to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Thus now if we will ſpeak of the third Principle, viz. of the beginning and birth of this world; then we muſt conſider the root of the genetrix, or begettreſſe, ſeeing every Principle is another birth, but out of no other eſſence; and ſo we may finde, that in the firſt Principle in the indiſſoluble band (which in it ſelf is inanimate, and hath no true life, but the <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>working property.</hi>
               </note> ſource of the true life is born by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpirit of God, which from eternity hath its originall in the firſt Principle, and goeth forth from eternity in the ſecond Principle, as in the birth of the heart or Sonne of God) the matrix of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrix is ſet open, which is originally the <note n="l" place="margin">Aſtringency, or tartneſſe.</note> harſhneſſe; yet in the light it is the ſoft mother of the water ſpirit. Thus it is ſeen &amp; found clearly and plainly before our eyes, that the Spirit of God hath wrought there in the matrix, ſo that out of the incomprehenſible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, (which is but a Spirit) the comprehenſible and viſible water is proceeded.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Secondly, you [may] thus ſee the ſeparation clearly by the ſtarres and fiery Heaven, that the eternall ſeparation [or diſtinction] is in the eternall matrix: for you may ſee that the ſtarres and the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heaven, and the watery, the aiery, and earthly, are generated out of one mother, that they qualifie with, [or have influence upon] one another, and that the birth of their ſubſtance is in one another, alſo that one is the caſe or veſſell to hold the other in, and yet they have not one and the ſame [property] qualification [or condition.] Thus here in the ſeparation you [may] know, that the eternall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix hath a ſeparation in it ſelfe, as is mentioned before in the third chapter concerning the eternall birth of the four anguiſhes, where the fire is generated between Harſhneſſe and Bitterneſſe, and the light in the flaſh of fire, and ſo every ſource retaineth its, own due.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Underſtand it thus, as the Spirit moved this Matrix, ſo the matrix wrought, and in the kindling from rhe Spirit of God in the fift form of the matrix, the fiery heaven of the Conſtellations did exiſt, which is a meere <hi>Quinta eſſentia,</hi> or <hi>Quinteſſence,</hi> born in the fifth form of the matrix, in which place the light hath its originall: out of which at laſt the Sunne is born [or brought forth,] wherewith the third Principle becometh opened and manifeſted, which [Sun]
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57651:24"/>
now is the life in the third Principle, and the opener of the life of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very life in the matrix, in this place, or <hi>Locus;</hi> as the heart of God in Paradiſe in the immateriall heaven and birth, openeth the eternall power of God, wherein the eternall life continually ſpringeth up, and wherein the eternall wiſdome continually ſhineth. Thus alſo the light of the Sunne (which is ſprung up in the inanimate matrix) by the [flowing, hovering, or] moving ſpirit in the matrix, openeth the third principle of this materiall world, which is the third and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Principle; which as to this forme taketh an end, and returneth into its <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the moſt pure elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aire.</hi>
               </note> Ether in the end of this <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>finiſhing of its time.</hi>
               </note> enumeration, as the Scripture witneſſeth.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And then all in this third Principle remaineth again in the firſt matrix; onely that which hath been ſown in this Principle, and that hath its originall out of Paradiſe, out of heaven, and out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle (viz. Man) that continueth eternally in the matrix. And if he have in this [lifes] time atrained the ſecond Principle, ſo that he is born therein; it is well with him: but if he have not, then he ſhall remain ſtill eternally in the matrix, yet not <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>Attain.</hi>
               </note> reach the light of God.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Now I know very well, that I ſhall not onely in part be as it were dumb or obſcure to the deſirous Reader, but alſo tedious, and he will be ſomewhat troubled at me; in that I have written of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall mother (wherein the divine eſſence ſtandeth;) and that I now write, that this matrix is <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>dumb.</hi>
               </note> inanimate and void of underſtanding, out of which alſo a Principle void of underſtanding is generated; as is plain before our eyes, that in this world there is no true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding either in the Starres or in the Elements; and alſo in all its creatures there is but an underſtanding to qualifie [or to operate] to nouriſh it ſelf, and to increaſe, as the matrix in it ſelf is.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Hereupon you are to know, that the matrix in the ſecond Principle (which yet hath its originall and eternall root in the firſt Principle,) is but meerly an eternall, beginningleſſe, ſoft [or meek] ſpirit, which hath no ſuch fiery <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>light that cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, as is in the matrix of the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
               </note> intolerable light, but all there is pleaſant and cheerfull, and the eternall originall matrix is not known there; but the ſoft light of the heart of God, maketh all courteous and cheerfull.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Therefore alſo the ſpirit which goeth forth in the ſoft matrix, is the Holy Ghoſt: and God dwelleth in himſelf, and he calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Angry, Zealous [or Jealous] God, onely according to the moſt originall matrix, which is not manifeſted in Paradiſe: and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning alſo it was forbidden to man, to eat of the fruit [of] good and evill, from the moſt originall matrix: neither ſhould man have known this moſt originall matrix, if he had not imagined [thought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57651:24"/>
or longed] after it, and eaten of the fruit thereof, whereby the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix preſently took hold of him, captivated him, [acteth or] quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in him, nouriſheth and alſo driveth him, as is plaine before our eyes.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And thus you are to know, that the ſecond Principle hath it [in its power,] and there onely is wiſdome and underſtanding; alſo therein now is the omnipotence [almightineſſe]: and this third Principle is the ſeconds proper own, not ſeperate, but one eſſence in it [and with it] all over, and yet there is a birth between them, as may be ſeen, by the Rich Man and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Luk. 16. the one being in Paradiſe, and the other in the moſt Originall Matrix, or Hell.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And therefore God [created or] generated the third Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he might be <note n="r" place="margin">Made known to Angels and men.</note> manifeſted by the materiall world: he having created the Angels and Spirits in the ſecond Principle in the Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall world; they could thereby underſtand, the eternall <note n="ſ" place="margin">Generating, working, or begetting.</note> Birth in the third Principle, alſo the wiſdome and omnipotence of God, wherein they could behold themſelves, and ſet their Imagination meerly <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>Into.</hi>
               </note> upon the heart of God, in which <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </note> forme they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in Paradiſe, and continue to be Angels: which the Devils have not done, but they meant to riſe up in the Matrix, and domineere in great power over Paradiſe, and all Angelicall <note n="u" place="margin">Principalities Thrones and Dominions.</note> Regions, upon which they fell out of Paradiſe: and beſides were driven out of their place (or <hi>Locus)</hi> into <note n="x" place="margin">Narrowneſſe, or a Corner.</note> reſtraint, ſo that the Matrix of this world alſo hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them captive.</p>
            <p n="17">17. For the <note n="y" place="margin">The univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall place of this world as farre as the creating word Fiat ſpreads it ſelfe.</note> 
               <hi>Locus</hi> or ſpace of this world was their Angelicall [Dominion or] Kingdome where they were, in the place of this world.</p>
            <p n="18">18. But though wee ſpeake of the Paradiſicall Eſſence, and alſo of the principle of this world, of its power and wonderfull birth, and what the Divine and Eternall Wiſdome is, yet it is impoſſible for us to utter and expreſſe it [all]: for the <note n="z" place="margin">Fountaine or Well-ſpring.</note> Lake of the Deepe can be comprehended in no Spirit (whether it be Angel or Man): there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the innumerable Eternall <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>Working.</hi>
               </note> Birth and Wiſdome maketh a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull eternall joy in Paradiſe. This innumerable power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may now alſo be knowne by us men, in the third Principle; if we will take it into our conſideration; if we looke upon the Starry Heaven, the Elements and living Creatures, alſo upon trees, hearbs, and graſſe, wee may behold in the materiall world, the ſimilitude of the Paradiſicall incomprehenſible world: for this world is proceeded out of the firſt roote, wherein ſtand both the materiall, and alſo the Paradiſicall ſpirituall world, which is without beginning or tranſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe.</p>
            <p n="19">19. And now if wee meditate and conſider of the Originall of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57651:25"/>
foure Elements, wee ſhall cleerly finde, ſee, and feele the Originall in our ſelves, if we be men and not beaſts, full of malice and gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt God and the <note n="b" place="margin">Mother, the Eternall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Roote.</note> Matrix of this world: for the Originall is as well knowne in man, as in the Deepe of this world: although it ſeemeth wonderfull to the unenlightened Man, that any ſhould [be able] to ſpeake of the originall of the Aire, Fire, Water, and Earth, as alſo of the Starry Heaven: he ſuppoſeth this impoſſible to be knowne: thus he <note n="c" place="margin">Glideth away in his thoughts imperceptibly.</note> ſwimmeth in his own Mother, and deſireth not to know it: neither was it good for man to know it: but ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> hath caſt us headlong into it, it is highly neceſſary for us to know it, that wee may flie from the beaſtiall Man, and learne to know the true Man.</p>
            <p n="20">20. And if you open the eyes of your minde, you will ſee that fire is in water, as may be ſeene in a ſtorme of Lightening, and yet it is no durable fire, though it be true fire, which ſetteth houſes on fire, and burneth them: ſo alſo you may ſee that there goeth forth from it a mighty forcible aire, and that they are in one another, and beſides you ſee that water is generated in the ſtorme.</p>
            <p n="21">21. But you will not finde this roote here, you muſt looke into the <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>womb. The temporary Matrix is the temporary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Eternall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </note> Matrix, and there it is wholly manifeſt, and you may know it in all things, for the Matrix of this world ſtandeth in the eternall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, from which, Paradiſe and the kingdome of Heaven hath its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall. Now as the Eternall Matrix is a Birth that goeth forth, where, in the Originall there is harſhneſſe, darkneſſe, hardneſſe, and anguiſh: ſo you may ſee, that when the Spirit of God hath <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </note> kindled the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Matrix, then it becometh ſtirring, working, and active.</p>
            <p n="22">22. For there is in the Originall, firſt, <note n="f" place="margin">Aſtringent attraction.</note> harſhneſſe, which attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhutteth up, maketh darkneſſe, and ſharpe cold: but the tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot endure the attracting: for the attracting in the cold, maketh in the bitterneſſe a ſting [or prickle] which rageth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth againſt the hard death, but not being able to come away out of the tartneſſe, (being its Mother wherein it ſtandeth) therefore it rageth very horribly, as if it would breake the harſhneſſe [in pieces]: it flieth out upwards and ſidewayes, and yet findeth no reſt, till that the Birth of the harſhneſſe fall into an aking horrible eſſence, like a Brimſtone Spirit, very rough, hard, ſtinging in it ſelfe [or kindling in it ſelfe] like a whirling wheele, and that the bitterneſſe flie up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſwiftly, from whence proceedeth a twinckling flaſh; at which the darke harſhneſſe is terrified, and ſinketh backe as vanquiſhed. And ſo when the bitterneſſe findeth the mother overcome, and as it were halfe dead, or ſoft, [or meeke,] it is terrified more than the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But the skreek or terrour being paſt in the harſh mother, which is now halfe dead or ſoft, [pliable or meeke] then the bitterneſſe looſeth its terrible right [or property] and becometh white, light,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57651:25"/>
and cleere: and thus is the kindling and birth of the Fire, as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Deare Reader, account not this ridiculous; that this birth (which alſo is juſt ſo in the <note n="g" place="margin">In the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb.</note> beginning of your life) may not trouble or confound you: and obſerve it further.</p>
            <p n="24">24. When God in the firſt Matrix moved himſelfe to create, and created the Angels, he created them in Paradiſe, in the light holy Matrix, (which is this and no other) but the Matrix with its fiery, dark, and harſh bitter property, remained altogether hidden: for the light of God from eternity preſerved it, and kept it pleaſant, cleare, and bright: But when God moved himſelfe to create, then it became manifeſted: for the Angels were created out of the indiſſoluble Band, out of the Matrix, and were bodified from the moving Spirit of God.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Now when God had created great potent princely Angels, and that in the place of the fourth forme in the Matrix, where the ſource of Fire hath its originall; they ſtood not, neither did they caſt their <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>Their minds into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation.</hi>
               </note> imaginations forward into the fift forme, wherein the ſprouting forth of Paradiſe conſiſteth; but they caſt their Imaginations back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, and formed [or created] a will [or purpoſe] in the Matrix, to domineere in the fire over the light of God and Paradiſe. For the fiery Matrix <hi>(viz.</hi> the abyſſe of Hell) moved it ſelfe in the creation ſo hard, that Lucifer (that great Prince) hath formed his will out of it, and is continued therein, ſuppoſing that ſo he ſhould be a Great and terrible Lord in his whole place [of Dominion.]</p>
            <p n="26">26. Thus the Devill moved the Matrix, and the fiery forme mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Devill; for <note n="i" place="margin">The fiery forme would have a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its own.</note> that alſo would be creaturely, as [well as] all the other formes in the Matrix, which yet was oppoſite to the fift forme in the Matrix, where in the meeke and cleere light, the pleaſant ſource of love ſpringeth up, wherein the ſecond principle ſtandeth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p n="27">27. When this ſtorme was in the Creation (in the firſt Principle) the Matrix became very big [or much impregnated] and kindled: and every forme in the Matrix wrought [ſtirred or acted]. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the anger and the wrath had there elevated it ſelfe, and that this place could not thus ſubſiſt in Paradiſe, therefore God moved this place yet more in the Matrix, which was yet the more kindled, where then is to be the Devils Bath, [repoſitory or dwelling place], and the fourth forme ſtood in the flaſh of the fire, which reflected back into the mother, and <note n="k" place="margin">Felt or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> found the Spirit of God in the forming [or creation], where in a moment [that fourth forme] loſt its wrathfull [ſmart, fierce property, authority, or] right, and became in great joy, white, cleere, and <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>Bright.</hi>
               </note> light; and in this place [or thing conſiſteth or] ſtandeth the Fiat, by which God created Heaven and Earth: for before the fiat, the third Principle was not manifeſted,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57651:26"/>
but there was meerly Paradiſe in the place of this world.</p>
            <p n="28">28. But God ſeeing that the great Prince Lucifer would domineere in the Matrix, in the ſtrength of the fire in his place, therefore he ſhut up the fift forme in the Matrix of Paradiſe from him, for it is ſhut up both in its inward corporeall forme, and outwardly alſo.</p>
            <p n="29">29. For when the Matrix became thin again, dead and vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">

            <p n="30">30.

and life: without whoſe light and vertue, <note n="c" place="margin">The ſtarres.</note> they could neither act nor effect any thing, but remain in the hard dark death; and this world would be nothing (but a fierce rough hardneſſe.) And further, if we conſider the elements of fire and water, [and obſerve] how they continually generate one in another, and then how the conſtellations doe rule in them, as in their own propriety: and alſo conſider what the mother is, from whence all theſe things muſt proceed, then we ſhall come to ſee the ſeparation, and the eternall mother, the <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>bringer forth.</hi>
               </note> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix of all things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay, we have it clearly and plainly to be ſeen in our ſelves, and in all things, if we would not be ſo mad, blinde, and ſelf-conceited, and would not be ſo drawn and led by a <note n="e" place="margin">Outward Reaſon.</note> School-boy; but did ſtick cloſe to the Schoolmaſter himſelfe, who is the maſter of all maſters; for we ſee indeed that all things ſpring out of the eternall mother: and as ſhe is in her own birth, ſo ſhe hath generated this world, and ſo is every creature alſo generated. And as that [mother] is in her ſpringing forth in multiplication, where every fountain [or ſource] hath another centre in it from the genetrix, and a ſeparation [or diſtinction] but undivided and not aſunder: ſo alſo this world is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated out of the eternall mother, which now is ſuch another gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, and yet is not ſeparated [or ſundred] from the eternall <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </note> mother, but is come to be in a materiall manner, and it hath through the Sun attained another light and life, which [light and life] is not the wiſe maſter himſelfe, but the wiſe maſter (who is God) he keepeth that light and life, ſo that it ſtandeth and continueth in the eternall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, and yet it is not the eternall wiſdome it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now becauſe this birth [of the Sun] hath a beginning through the will of God, and entreth again into its <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>repoſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </note> Ether, therefore it hath not the vertue or power of the wiſdome; but it continually <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>buildeth.</hi>
               </note> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to its kinde, it vivifieth and killeth: what it doth it doth, [not regarding whether it be] evill, crooked, lame, or good, beautifull or potent, it cauſeth to live and to dye, it affordeth power and ſtrength, and deſtroyeth the ſame again; and all this without any premeditated wiſdome: whereby it may be perceived, that it is not the divine providence and wiſdome it ſelf, as the heathens did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and did fooliſhly relye upon the vertue thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if we would ſee the ground thereof, we muſt onely look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt mother in her birth, and ſo we ſhall ſee and finde it all: For as the firſt mother (conſidering her in the originall without the light) is ſoure, [or harſh] dark, hard, and cold, and yet there is the <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſpirit of the water.</hi>
               </note> water-ſpirit in the bringing forth: Thus you may finde (when the materiall world ſprung up) that God then on the firſt day created the heaven and the earth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Now the heaven cometh out of the ſoure matrix, which in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57651:27"/>
Paradiſicall [heaven] is the water-ſpirit: and out of that Paradiſicall [water-ſpirit, or matrix] the materiall [heaven or matrix] is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth, that the heaven was created out of the midſt of the waters: and it is very right. And alſo in that very houre the earth and the ſtones, and all metals (the matrix of this world being yet dark) were generated out of the matrix.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For when the matrix was ſtirred, and that Lord Lucifer would domineere in the fire, then the dark matrix attracted all that was wrought in the <note n="k" place="margin">Out-birth.</note> birth, together; from whence earth, ſtones, metals, brimſtone and ſalt did proceed: hereby the kingdome of Prince Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer was ſhut up, and he remained in the inward centre captivated in the outward.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But the vertue which was in the matrix, was that which could effect ſuch things in the matrix: for a ſtone is nothing elſe but a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note n="l" place="margin">The originall Text Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> mercury, ſalt, and brimſtone, wherein an oyle is hidden. Now the birth of the matrix hath ſuch a form in its eternall Eſſence, and <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</hi>
               </note> birth of its life. For firſt, there is the harſhneſſe [or ſourneſſe] fierceneſſe [or eager ſtrongneſſe] and hardneſſe, from whence the cold proceedeth. Now the ſourneſſe [or harſhneſſe] attracteth and ſharpneth the cold; and in its attracting it maketh the bitter ſting [or prickle] which pricketh and rageth, and cannot endure the hard attracting, but vexeth like a furious madneſſe, it riſeth up and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, and becometh like a brimſtone-ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And in this form in the wrath [or fierce ſtrongneſſe] in the watry ſoure mother, the ſoure bitter earth, brimſtone and ſalt, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, before the kindling of the Sunne in the matrix that is void of underſtanding. But the ſeparation that is in it, is cauſed from the births ſtanding in great anguiſh, and from its deſiring the ſeparation in the birth: for the bitterneſſe agreeth not with the harſhneſſe [or ſourneſſe,] and yet they are as mother and ſonne, and as members one <note n="n" place="margin">In</note> of another: and it muſt be ſo, or elſe nothing could be; for it is the eternall band, and the originall of life.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Moreover, when the bitterneſſe rageth, riſeth up, and <note n="o" place="margin">Aketh.</note> vexeth in the [ſoure] harſh mother, then it falleth into a glimmering flaſh moſt terribly: in this form the Mercurius, or venome, or poyſon, is generated. For when the matrix perceiveth this flaſh of fire in its dark ſoure form, then it is terrified, and becometh dead in her hard ſoure property. And in this place death, poyſon, <note n="p" place="margin">Falling away or decaying &amp; deſtruction.</note> withering and corruption are generated in the matrix, and alſo the noble life in the Mercurius, and in the ſpringing up of the third Principle.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And further, when the horror [or crack or ſkreek] of the fire is come into its harſh mother, and hath thus overcome its mother, then it ſelfe is much more terrified, for there it loſeth its fierce or ſtrong property, becauſe the mother [hath] attained another <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>root.</hi>
               </note> ſource;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57651:27"/>
and out of the horror of the fire a <note n="r" place="margin">Glance, or luſtre.</note> brightneſſe is come to be; in which in the inanimate matrix, the <hi>Materia,</hi> [or matter] in the midſt of the horror [or crack] is come to be a ſoft and bright <note n="s" place="margin">Or, <hi>concrete.</hi>
               </note> mixt matter, <hi>viz.</hi> from the crack of the light [is prococeeded] Gold, Silver, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Tin Lead,, &amp;c. according as every place in the matrix ſtood in the wraſtling centre.</p>
            <p n="11">11. For the birth in the whole ſpace of this world (as farre as Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifers kingdome did reach) was thus; and therefore there is much <note place="margin">Note.</note> different kinde of earth, metals, and other things in one place than in another. And it is plain before our eyes, that all metals are mixt, which proceedeth from the <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>out-birth.</hi>
               </note> bringing forth <hi>in infinitum;</hi> which we well underſtand and ſee, but cannot utter, nor dare we ſpeak it, for it troubleth us, and it reacheth into the Deity, which is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and eternall: therefore the creature muſt let it alone upon pain of the loſſe both of its reaſon and ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But to declare this further; when the matrix ſtood thus in the birrh, where the matter of the earth was generated, then the matrix with the kindling, became water: you muſt underſtand it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, not wholly in ſubſtance, but it hath generated the earth, ſtones, and metals, and yet the matrix continueth ſtill, ſo alſo the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtill continueth in the killing and overcoming; whereby the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall world took beginning, where the globe of the earth was drawn together in this moving, and ſtandeth in the middle of the Circle from above and from beenath as a point [or <hi>punctum.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. And there in the centte in the Paradiſicall matrix, and in the Paradiſicall heaven, the Spirit of God ſtood in his own eternall ſeat, <note place="margin">Note.</note> neither did it depart from thence; and moved upon the materiall water with the <hi>Fiat,</hi> and there formed the heaven, which was created out of the midſt of the watry matrix, and he ſeparated the root of the darkneſſe from the light in the matrix; in which darkneſſe the Devils remained, and they have not comprehended the matter in the matrix, nor the new light, which ſprung up in the matrix, and ſo with this creation and ſeparation, the length of one day was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and out of beginning and end, and morning and evening was the firſt day, as <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But that we may ſo ſpeak of the heaven, that the reader might come to underſtand what that [heaven] is which God then created; [conſider] what <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth of it: God made a Firmament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the waters, and ſeparated the water beneath the Firmament from the waters above the Firmament, and the Firmament he called Heaven, which is very right: but hitherto it hath been very ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Now obſerve, the Heaven is the whole Deep, ſo farre as the <hi>Ethera,</hi> or Skies have <note n="u" place="margin">Expanded, or ſpred.</note> given up themſelves to the birth of this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57651:28"/>
world, and that heaven is the matrix, out of which earth, ſtones, and the materiall water is generated. And there God ſeparated the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall water from the matrix: and here it is very plainly diſcerned, that the materiall water is as it were deaded, or hath death in it: for it could not abide in the <note n="x" place="margin">Viz <hi>the Aire.</hi>
               </note> moving mother, but was created [to be] upon the globe of the earth, and God called it Sea: <hi>[Méer:]</hi> in which [word] is underſtood in the language of Nature, as it were a ſpringing [or growing] in death, or a life in <note n="y" place="margin">The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility.</note> corruption: <note n="z" place="margin">That is, the reader wil not underſtand it.</note> although nerein I ſhall be as one that is dumb to the Reader, yet I <note n="†" place="margin">Or, <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi>
               </note> know it very well, and I am very well ſatisfied therewith: but becauſe the beſtiall man is not worthy to know it, therefore I will not here caſt the Pearle before the Swine: but for the children of God, which will he benefited by it; the Spirit of God will certainly teach and inſtruct them in it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Now when the heaven became cleare [or pure] and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the earth and the dark miſt [or duſt] in the concretion [or driving together,] then in the matrix of the heaven there was the three Elements, Fire, Aire, and Water, which are three in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in one mother; and that mother is here called the Heaven, therefore henecforward in my writing, I ſhall uſe the word <hi>Heaven</hi> in ſtead of the word <hi>Matrix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. For the Heaven is the Matrix, and is called Heaven, becauſe of the ſeparation; becauſe the fifth eſſence of Heaven is ſevered, and ſet in the higher Heaven, where the Matrix is more firery, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, underſtood in the language of Nature, and is plain before our eyes. But here the quality, birth and property of the heaven ought to be deſcribed, becauſe the foure Elements ſprung out of it, as out of their mother; and becauſe the vertue of every life conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therein, therefore the originall of the foure Elements muſt be deſcribed, wherein it will firſt truly be underſtood what the Heaven is.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57651:28"/>
for any Spirit in its own naturall power, to look into another principle, and behold it, except it be regenerated therein: But the Naturall man, who in his fall was captivated by the matrix of this world, whoſe naturall ſpirit <note n="a" place="margin">Wavereth.</note> moveth between two principles, <hi>viz.</hi> between the Divine and the Helliſh, and he ſtandeth in both the gates, into which principle he falleth, there he cometh to be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, whether it be as to the Kingdome of Heaven, or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Hell: and yet he is not able in this [life] time to ſee either of them both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is in his own eſſence and ſubſtance a twofold man: For his ſoule (in its own ſubſtance) is out of the firſt Principle, which from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity hath no ground nor beginning; and in the time of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man in Paradiſe, or the kingdome of heaven, the ſoule was truly <note n="b" place="margin">Bodily crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or corpori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> bodified by the <hi>Fiat</hi> in a ſpirituall manner; but with the firſt vertue [or power] which is from eternity, in its own firſt vertue or power it hath remained inſeparably in its firſt root, and was illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted [or made ſhining bright] by the ſecond principle, <hi>viz.</hi> by the heart of God: and therewith ſtanding in Paradiſe, was there by the moving Spirit of God, breathed into the matrix of the third Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, into the ſtarry and Elementary man; and now therefore he may underſtand the ground of heaven, as alſo of the elements and of hell, as farre as the light of God ſhineth in him; for if that light be in him, he is born in all the three Principles: but yet he is onely a ſpark riſen from thence, and not the great ſource, or fountain, which is God himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And therefore it is that Chriſt ſayth: <hi>If you had faith as a grain of Mustard-ſeed, you might ſay to the mountain, Caſt thy ſelfe into the ſea, and it ſhall be done.</hi> And <note n="c" place="margin">Note the power by which the holy men raiſed the dead.</note> in this power men have raiſed the dead, and healed the ſick, by the word, and the vertue and power of the Spirit, or elſe they could not have been able to have done ſuch things, if they had not ſtood in the power of all the three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p n="4">4 For the created Spirit of man, which is out of the matrix of this world, that ruleth (by the vertue of the ſecond principle in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the light) over and in the vertue of the ſpirit of the ſtarres and elements very mightily, as in that which is its proper own. But in the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> we loſt this great power, when we left Paradiſe, and went into the third Principle, into the matrix of this world, which preſently held us captive in reſtraint: But yet we have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge [of that power] by a glance [or glimmering] and we ſee as through a dim or dark glaſſe, the eternall <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>operative propagation.</hi>
                  </note> birth.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And although we move thus weakly or impotently in all the three births, and that the gate of Paradiſe is ſo often darkned to us, and that the Devill doth ſo often draw us into the helliſh gate, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57651:29"/>
that alſo the elements do cover the <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the ſtars.</hi>
                  </note> ſydereall gate, and wholly cloud them, ſo that we oftentimes move in the whole matrix, as if we were deafe, dumb, or half dead, yet if the Paradificall light ſhineth to us, we may very well ſee into the mother of all the three principles: for nothing can hinder us, the threefold ſpirit of man ſeeth every form and quality in its mother.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Therefore though we ſpeak of the creation of the world, as if we had been by at preſent, and had ſeen it, none ought to marvell at it, nor hold it for impoſſible. For the Spirit that is in us, which one man inherits from the other, that was breathed out of the eternity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſame ſpirit hath ſeen it all, and in the light of God it ſeeth it ſtill: and there is nothing that is farre off, or unſearchable: for the eternall birth, which ſtandeth hidden in the centre of man, that doth nothing [that is] new, it knoweth, worketh and doth even the ſame that ever it did from eternity: it laboureth for the light and for the darkneſſe: and wotketh in great anguiſh: but when the light ſhineth therein, then there is meere joy and knowledge in its working.</p>
               <p n="7">7 So that when the heaven, and the birth of the elements are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, it is not a thing afarre of, or that is diſtant from us, that is ſpoken of; but we ſpeak of things that are done in our body and ſoule: and there is nothing nearer us than this birth: for we live and move therein, as in the houſe of our mother, and when we ſpeak of heaven, we ſpeak of our native countrey, which the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned ſoule can well ſee, though indeed ſuch things be hidden from the body.</p>
               <p n="8">8 For as the ſoule of man moveth and ſwimmeth between the vertue of the Starres and Elements, ſo the created heaven alſo moveth between Paradiſe and the kingdome of Hell, and it ſwimmeth in the eternall matrix: its limit reacheth as farre as the <hi>Ethera</hi> [ſkies or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle] hath yeelded it ſelfe up to the creation, ſo farre as the kingdome of Luciſer did reach, where yet no end is to be found: for the vertue or power of God is without end; but our ſenſe reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely to the fiery heaven of the Starres, which are a <note n="f" place="margin">Or, out birth, iſſue, or off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</note> propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the fifth form of the eternall Mother (or a <hi>Quinta eſſentia)</hi> wherein the ſeparation in the time of the third Principle (or in the beginning of this world) the vertue or power of the matrix was <note n="g" place="margin">Gr, <hi>divided into parts, or varyed.</hi>
                  </note> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, where now the ſeparation is thus movind: and then every eſſence in the propagation in the manifold centres of the Starres, have a <note n="h" place="margin">Attracting.</note> longing deſire one after the other, and a continuall will to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect [impregnate or mix influences:] and the one eſſence, or vertue, is the <note n="i" place="margin">Food.</note> meat and drink, as alſo, the cheſt [caſe or] receptacle of the other.</p>
               <p n="9">9 For as in the Paradificall principle the holy Ghoſt in the Trinity
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57651:29"/>
of the Deity, continually goeth forth, &amp; floweth very ſoftly, immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and imperceptably, as to the Creature, and yet formeth and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioneth all in the Paradiſical matrix, ſo alſo doth the third Principle. After that the Matrix became viſible and materiall, every vertue in the matrix hath had a great attractive longing towards one another, a continuall ſpringing, bloſſoming, and fading again like a bud, or ſome boyling ſeething matter, wherein the ſourneſſe, coldneſſe, and [eager fierce] ſtrongneſſe attract without ceaſſng; and this attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prickle [or ſting] ſtirreth alwayes without ceaſing, and ſtriveth [or reſiſteth] ſo, that the ſoure matrix, (becauſe of the inward, helliſh, or moſt originall matrix) ſtandeth continually in anguiſh, with a great deſire of the light, which it eſpyeth in the root of the fire, and is continually affrighted at it, and becometh milde, ſoft, and materiall: whereby the Elementary water is continually ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated.</p>
               <p n="10">10 In this manner you muſt underſtand the foure elements, which yet are not foure divided things, or eſſences, but one onely eſſence: and yet there are foure differences, or diſtinctions, in this birth; and each element lieth in the other as in a cheſt, and it is its receptacle, alſo it is a member therein.

               <p n="11">11 Now the ſourneſſe (in its luſt or great longing [or panting] af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the light) attracteth continually, and in its own ſubſtance it is nothing elſe but a vehement hunger very dry, and as [a <hi>vacuum</hi> or] nothing at all, a deſiring will, as the darkneſſe after the light: and its hunger, or attracting, maketh the bitterneſſe; the woe [or lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it cannot be ſatiated or mollified, from whence the anguiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth, ſo that the will, or prickle [or ſting] is rub'd [or <note n="l" place="margin">As ſteel and a flint ſtrike fire</note> ſtruck] in it ſelfe, from the luſt of the deſiring, and it will not yeeld it ſelfe to the dark nothing, or dead will; but ſetteth its deſire and anguiſh, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo its [eager or] ſtrong will ſo very hard towards the hidden light of God, that thereby the will becometh a twinkling flaſh, like a ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or <note n="m" place="margin">As when ye throw water into the fire.</note> crackling fire, whereby the ſourneſſe, that is ſo very aking, is continually filled, and as it were deadned, whereby the ſoure ſpirit cometh to be ſoft, ſweet, and materiall, even water.</p>
               <p n="12">12 But the bitterneſſe being ſo very much aſſrighted at the flaſh

of fire in the ſourneſſe, it catcheth its mother (the ſourneſſe) which is become materiall from the crack, and flieth out, and is clouded or <note n="n" place="margin">Impregnated.</note> ſwelled from the materiall ſourneſſe, as if it alſo were materiall, and moveth, and ſtrenghtheneth it ſelfe continually in the mother: and that is the element called Aire in this world, which hath its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall in the watry mother; and the water hath its originall from the aire, and the fire hath its originall from the longing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; and the earth and ſtones took their beginning in the ſtrong at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction at the fall of Lucifer, when the ſourneſſe was ſo fierce, ſtrong, riſing and attractive, which attraction is ſtopped again by the light in the third principle.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Thus it may very plainly be underſtood, that the light of God is a cauſe of all things, and you may hereby underſtand all the three Principles: For if the power, vertue, and light of God were not, then there would be alſo no attractive longing in the dark eternity, and alſo the ſoure deſire (which is the mother of the Eternity) would be nothing at all; and it may be underſtood, that the Divine vertue ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in every thing, and yet it is not the thing it ſelfe, but the Spirit of God in the ſecond principle; and yet the thing is his Ray [glance or luſtre] which thus proceedeth from the longing, or attracting will. But now the Heart of God is in the Father [in] the firſt will, and the Father is the firſt deſiring or longing after the Soone, and the Sonne is the vertue and <note n="o" place="margin">Luſtre, or brightneſſe.</note> light of the Father, from whence the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall nature becometh alwayes longing; and ſo from the heart of God, in the eternall dark matrix [it] generateth the third principle. For <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>thereby.</hi>
                  </note> ſo God is manifeſt, but otherwiſe the Deity would remain hidden eternally.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Now therefore we ſay (as the Scripture informeth us) that God dwelleth in heaven: and it is the truth. Now mark, <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth, that God created the heaven out of the midſt of the waters, and the Scripture ſayth, God dwelleth in heaven; therefore we may now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the water hath its originall from the longing of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Nature after the eternall light of God; but the eternall Nature is made manifeſt by the longing after the light of God, as is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before: and the light of God is preſent every where, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth hidden to Nature: for Nature receiveth onely the vertue of the light, and the vertue is the Heaven wherein the light of God dwelleth and is hidden, and ſo ſhineth in the darkneſſe: The water is the <hi>Materia,</hi> or matter that is generated from the heaven, and therein ſtandeth the third, which again generateth a life and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible eſſence, or ſubſtance, out of it ſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> the elements and other creatures.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Therefore, O noble Man, let not Antichriſt and the Devill be foole you, who tell you that the Deity is afarre off from you, and

               <p n="16">16 O that I had but the pen of man, and were able therewith to write down the Spirit of knowledge: I can but ſtammer of the great myſteries like a childe that is beginning to ſpeak; ſo very little can the earthly tongue expreſſe what the Spirit comprehendeth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth; yet I will venture to try whether I may procure ſome to goe about to ſeek the pearle, whereby alſo I might <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>work.</hi>

               <p n="17">17 Now if we will lift up our mindes, and ſeek after the heaven wherein God dwelleth; we cannot ſay that God dwelleth onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſtarres, and hath incloſed himſelfe with the firmament which is made out of the waters, into which none can enter except it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened (like a window) for him; with which thoughts men are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether befooled [and wilderd:] neither can we ſay (as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that God the Father and the Sonne are onely with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in the uppermoſt incloſed heaven, and rule onely here in this world by the holy Ghoſt, who proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne.

               <p n="20">20. If you will <note n="z" place="margin">Think, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding any thing of God.</note> meditate on God, take before you the eternall Darkneſſe, which is without God; for God dwelleth in himſelfe, and the Darkneſſe cannot in its own power comprehend him: which Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath a great [deſire of] longing after the Light, cauſed by the Lights <note n="a" place="margin">Speculate as in a glaſſe.</note> beholding it ſelfe in the Darkneſſe, and ſhining in it: and in this longing or deſiring, you finde the <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>active property.</hi>

               <p n="21">21. Thus you [may] ſee how God created all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but onely out of himſelfe: and yet the <note n="d" place="margin">

               <p n="22">22. You have a ſimilitude [of this] in your ſelfe: your ſoule which is in you, giveth reaſon to you, whereby you think [conſider and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive]: that repreſenteth God the Father: The light which ſhineth in your ſoule, whereby you know the vertue [or power in you] and leade [and direct or order] your ſelfe with, that repreſenteth God the Sonne, or the Heart, the eternall power and vertue: and the minde in which the vertue of the light is, and that which proceedeth from the light wherewith you governe your body, that repreſenteth the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

that is the firſt Principle: the vertue or power of the light which is in you, whereby you can ſee in your minde without [bodily] eyes, that is the ſecond Principle: and the longing power or] vertue, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the minde, and attracteth and filleth [or impregnateth] it ſelfe, from whence the materiall body groweth, that is the third Principle. And you [may] underſtand very exactly, how there is an incloſure [ſtop or knot] between each Principle; and how God is the beginning and the firſt vertue [or power] in all things: and you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that in this groſſe [ſluggiſh or dull] body, you are not in <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>in the Divine joy, wherein God and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels dwell.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="24">24. Now mark, when God would manifeſt himſelfe by the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall world, and the Matrix ſtood in the anguiſhing birth, wherein the Creator moved the firſt Principle to the creating of Angels; then the Matrix ſtood undivided in the inward <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>
                  </note> Eſſence: for there was then no comprehenſibility, but ſpirit onely, and the vertue of the ſpirit: The Spirit was God, and the vertue was Heaven, and the ſpirit wrought in the vertue, ſo that thereby the vertue became attracting and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for the Spirit beheld it ſelfe in the vertue: and therein the Spirit created the vertue from whence the Angels came to be: and thus the vertue became the dwelling of the Angels, and the Paradiſe wherein the Spirit wrought: and the Spirit longed after the light, and the light ſhone in the vertue: ſo there is a Paradiſicall joy, and pleaſant ſport therein: and thus God is manifeſted.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Now thus the eternall light, and the vertue of the light, or the heavenly Paradiſe moveth in the eternall Darkneſſe; and the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot comprehend the light; for they are two ſeverall Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and the darkneſſe longeth after the light, becauſe that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit beholdeth it ſelfe therein, and becauſe the divine vertue is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in it: but though it hath not comprehended the Divine vertue and light, yet it hath continually with great luſt lifted up it ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, till it have kindled the roote of the fire in it ſelfe, from the beames of the light of God: and there aroſe the third Principle: and it hath its originall out of the firſt Principle out of the dark Matrix, by the <note n="i" place="margin">Beholding, imagining, or reflection.</note> ſpeculating of the vertue [or power] of God: But when the kindled vertue in this ſpringing up [of the third Principle] in the darkneſſe became fiery; then God put the Fiat therein, and by the moving Spirit, which goeth forth in the vertue of the light, created the fiery ſource in a bodily manner, and ſevered it from the Matrix: and the Spirit called the fiery created properties, ſtarres, for their qualitie.</p>
               <p n="26">
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:57651:32"/>
26. Thus it is plaine to our fight, how the ſtarry heaven (or as I may better render it to the enlightened Reader) the Quinteſſence (or the fift forme in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th) is ſevered from the watery Matrix; or elſe there would have been no ceaſing from the generating of ſtones and earth, if the fiery <note n="k" place="margin">Propertie or kinde.</note> nature had not been ſevered: but becauſe the eternall Eſſence <hi>(viz.</hi> God) would manifeſt himſelfe in the dark Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix; and [hath deſired] to make the nothing ſomething; therefore he hath ſevered the kindled vertue, and made the Matrix cleere or pure.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And thus now the Matrix ſtandeth incomprehenſibly, and longeth after the fiery nature [or condition] and the fiery nature longeth after the Matrix: For the Spirit of God (which is a Spirit of meekneſſe,) <note n="l" place="margin">Speculateth, on imagineth.</note> beholdeth it ſelfe in the watery Matrix; and the Matrix receiveth vertue from thence: thus there is a conſtant will to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and work: and the whole nature ſtandeth in a great longing and anguiſh, willing continually to generate the Divine vertue; God and Paradiſe being hidden therein: but it generateth after its kinde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its ability.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Now when God had ſevered the Matrix with [or from] its fiery forme, and would manifeſt himſelfe with this world; then he put the Fiat into the Matrix, and ſpake out of himſelfe: [ſaying,] <hi>Let there be Hearbs, Graſſe, Trees, and Beaſts, every one according to their kinde:</hi> This ſpeaking, was the heart, or the vertue [or power] of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father: But the Spirit which had the Fiat, went from the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father (in the vertue of the heart of God) forth with the will (and the will was the Fiat) and <note n="m" place="margin">Created.</note> made the Out-Birth in the third Principle, materiall, viſible, and comprehenfible, each according to its Effence: as the vertue was, ſo was alſo its body. For there the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Matrix, or the Conſtellation, gave its vertue to the Fiat; and the watery Matrix with the Elements received the vertue, and ſo were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, and each Element generated its own creatures out of it ſelfe: as alſo each forme in the fiery and watery Nature out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and yet it became no ſeperable Effence, but onely every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſeperated according to its kinde, according to the Eternall vertue, which aroſe in the longing by the luſt, and became the third Principle, which was not before Time [began].</p>
               <p n="29">29. Thus the ſtarry Heaven ruleth in all creatures, as in its proper own: it is the [husband or] Man, and the Matrix, or the watery forme is its [wife or] Woman, which it continually impregnateth, and the Matrix is the genetrix, which bringeth forth the childe which the Heaven <note n="n" place="margin">Maketh, or formeth.</note> begetteth: and that is the created Heaven in the third Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, from whence the Elements are proceeded; <hi>viz.</hi> the watery Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, out of which the viſible water generated it ſelfe, and ſtill alwayes doth generate it ſelfe in the anguiſh.</p>

Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth; That, <hi>God created the Heaven out of the midſt of the waters;</hi> [This you muſt] underſtand [to be] out of the eternall watery Matrix, which is but a Spirit, wherein the Paradiſe is, and the holy Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine vertue, which the dark Matrix luſted after in its hunger, out of which the viſible Matrix of the foure Elements is proceeded, out of which, the Eſſence of all Eſſences that now are, were created by the Fiat through the eternall Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="31">31. For every forme in the Matrix hath its viſible creatures, and ſuch as are inviſible to humane eyes: which creatures in part as to us are as it were but meere <note n="o" place="margin">Shapes and formes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</note> figured Spirits: as the fire hath ſpirits and creatures that are inviſible to our materiall eyes, and wee cannot ſee them: there are alſo in the Aire inviſible ſpirits, which wee ſee not; for the Aire being immateriall, ſo are alſo the ſpirits thereof: The water hath materiall creatures, which are not viſible to us: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not out of the fire nor aire, they are of another <note n="p" place="margin">Property.</note> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and are hidden [as] to the fiery and airey [ſpirits] except they will manifeſt themſelves.</p>

IN the beginning of the laſt fore-going Chapter, it is mentioned, that it is not ſtrange for a man to write, ſpeak, and teach of the Creation of the world, though he was not preſent when it was doing, if he have but the knowledge in the Spirit: For there he ſeeth in the Mother, as in a glaſſe, the genetrix of every thing; for one thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lyeth in another, and the more is ſought, the more is found, and there is no need to caſt the minde beyond this world; for all is to be found in this world, yea in every thing that liveth and moveth.

We muſt not <note n="e" place="margin">Or, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</note> think with our underſtanding and skill, of Gods making or creating, as of a man that maketh ſomewhat, as a Potter maketh a veſſell of a lump of clay, or a Stone-cutter, or Carver maketh an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage after his pleaſure; and if it doth not pleaſe him, then he break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it again: No, the works of God in the creation of the world, were altogether fix and ſtedfaſt, good and perfect, as <hi>Moſes</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: <hi>And</hi> GOD <hi>ſaw all that he had made, and behold, it was very good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 For he took not one lump after another, or many lumps toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made beaſts of them, that is not likely; and it is much more a beſtiall than a humane thought. But as is mentioned before, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Devil was fallen with his legions, (who had his throne <note n="f" place="margin">In loco.</note> in the place of this world, ſtanding bodily after the manner of a Spirit, in the firſt Principle, and <note n="g" place="margin">With luſtre or brightneſſe.</note> throughly enlightned all over with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle, truly dwelling in Paradiſe, and in the divine vertue [or power,] and yet with pride fell from the light of God, and catched at his own mother the root of the fire, thinking to domineere over the meekneſſe of the heart of God) then his dwelling continued
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57651:33"/>
to be the firſt Principle in the fiery dark Matrix; and God created the Out-birth out of the matrix, for a Principle: and in the eternall matrix, in the longing will opened the centre or birth of life; and there (after the manner of the Deity, as the eternall Deity from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath alwayes generated) aroſe [and ſprung up] the third Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in which the Deity ſtandeth as it were hidden; yet forming, imagining, or imprinting it ſelfe powerfully in all things: which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible and unprofitable for the Devill.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Yet the third Principle is a ſimilitude of the Paradiſicall world, which is ſpirituall, and ſtandeth hidden therein. And thus God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelfe, and ſeeing the ſpirituall world of the Angels in the place of this world continued not, therefore he gave another Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this place, wherein a light ſpringeth up ſtill, and where there is a pleaſant refreſhment: for the purpoſe of God muſt ſtand, and the firſt creatures muſt continue in darkneſſe rather [than that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God ſhould faile.]</p>
            <p n="5">5 So the matter of this world, as alſo the Starres and Elements muſt not be looked upon, as if God were not therein: his eternall wiſdome and vertue [or power] hath formed it ſelfe with the <hi>Fiat</hi> in all things, and he himſelfe is the Maſter-workman; and all things went forth in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> every thing in its own eſſence, vertue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. For as every ſtarre in the Firmament hath a property diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the other; thus is it with the mother alſo, out of which the fifth <note n="h" place="margin">Subſtance, or forme.</note> eſſence of the ſtars went forth. For when the fiery form of the ſtarres was ſeparated from her, ſhe was not preſently ſevered from the firſt eternall Birth-right; but ſhe kept her firſt eternall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Onely the riſing power of the fire is ſevered from her; ſo that ſhe is become a pleaſant refreſhment, and a kinde mother to her children.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now when God on the firſt day had gathered together the lump of the earth in the great deep of this world, then the deep became purified, yet [the deep between the firmament and the earth though it was cleanſed from dregges, was] dark, and had no light in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix; but the fifth eſſence, that is, the fifth form in the matrix, ſhined as a fire, wherein the Spirit of God with the <hi>Fiat,</hi> moved upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try matrix: and the earth was naked, bare, and void, neither had it ſo much as one ſpile of graſſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now, ſayth <hi>Moſes, And</hi> GOD <hi>ſayd, Let there be light, and there was light.</hi> This light now was the fifth form in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix: For the fifth eſſence was not yet created in the matrix, nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated till the fourth day, when God created the Sunne and Starres out of it, and ſeparated the light from the darkneſſe; where then the light got the vertue of the glance, or ſplendor into it ſelfe for its own, and the root of the fire in the centre remained hidden in the darkneſſe.</p>

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57651:34"/>
8 On the ſecond day God created the Firmament of the heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtrong encloſure [fence or ſtop] to the darkneſſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall matrix, that it might no more kindle it ſelfe, and generate earth and ſtones. And therefore he made the encloſure or firmament out of the midſt of the waters, which ſtayeth the might [force or power] of the fire, and became the viſible heaven, whence the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are proceeded, whereout now the Elements, Fire, Aire, and Water proceed.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The third day God, by the <hi>Fiat,</hi> divided the waters upon the earth, and created them for ſeveral places, that there might be a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the earth, and ſo the earth became dry. Now when this was done, then God did ſeek the creature, and the eternall Father ſayd, (that is, he wrought through the Sonne, who is his heart and glance) [or luſtre] in the <hi>Fiat</hi> in the earth: and there budded the life through death, and graſſe, hearbs, and all manner of trees and plants ſprung up, every one according to the eternall <note n="i" place="margin">Fountain.</note> ſource, as it had been before. Thus every eſſence became viſible, and God manifeſted his manifold vertue with the manifold hearbs, plants and trees, ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that doth but look upon them, may ſee the eternall power, vertue, and wiſdome of God therein; if he be born of God he may know in every ſpile of graſſe, his Creator in whom he liveth.

And to be for lights in the Firmament of heaven, to ſhine upon the earth, and it was ſo. And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the leſſer light to rule the night: Alſo, he made the Starres. And God ſet them in the Firmament of heaven, that they might ſhine upon the earth, and rule the day and the night, and ſeparate the light from the darkneſſe.</hi>

            <p n="15">15 And though <hi>Moſes</hi> hath written very rightly, that they ſhould govern the day and the night, and ſhould ſeparate the light from the darkneſſe, and make times and ſeaſons, yeares and dayes, yet is it not plain enough to be underſtood by the deſirous Reader. For there is

found a very high thing in the vertue and power of the ſtars; [which is] that every life, growth, colour and vertue, thickneſſe and thinneſſe, ſmalneſſe and greatneſſe, good and evill, is moved and ſtirred by their power. For this cauſe the wiſe Heathens did relye upon them, and honoured them as Gods: therefore I will write ſomewhat of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, as farre as is permitted to me at this time, for their ſakes that ſeek and deſire the Pearle. But I have written nothing for the ſwine, and other beſtiall men, who trample the Pearle into the dirt, and ſcorn and contemn the ſpirit of knowledge; ſuch as they, may, with the firſt world, expect a deluge, or flood, of fire: and ſeeing they will beare no Angelicall image, therefore they muſt beare the images of Lions, Dragons, and other evill beaſts, and worms [or creeping things:] and if they will not admit of good counſell that God may help them, then they muſt look to finde by experience whether the Scriptures of Propheſie doe lie to them, or no.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The Evangeliſt S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John</hi> writeth of the originality of the eſſence and creatures of this world, ſo very highly and exactly, as may be read in no other place of Scripture in the Bible: <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God: This was in the beginning with God, all things were made by it, and without it was nothing made that was made. In it was the life, and the life was the light of men, and the light ſhone in the darkneſſe, and the darkneſſe hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehended the light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. Mark what <hi>John</hi> ſaith: <hi>In the beginning of the Creation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the times of the world, was the Word, and the Word was God, and in the Word was the light, and it ſhone in the Darkneſſe, and the Darkneſſe could not comprehend the light.</hi> Wherein may be clearly underſtood, that the Eternall Light is God; and that it hath its eternall Originall in the eternall vertue or power; and that it is the eternall Word, which ſhone in the Darkneſſe. Seeing then that Word created all things in all places, therefore it alſo was in all places, for without it was nothing made.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Now that Word had no matter out of which it made any thing, but it created all things out of the Darkneſſe, and brought them to light, that it might ſhine forth, appeare, and preſent it ſelfe. For in it was the life, and it gave the life to the creature, and the creature is out of its vertue, and the vertue became materiall, and the light ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therein, and the materiall vertue cannot comprehend it, for that is in Darkneſſe: but ſeeing the materiall vertue cannot comprehend the light, which from eternity ſhineth in the darkneſſe; therefore God hath given that [materiall vertue] another light, which proceedeth out of the vertue, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Sunne) which ſhineth in the creature, that ſo the creature is manifeſted in the light.</p>
            <p n="19">19. For as the Deity is the vertue [or power] and light of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57651:35"/>
in the ſecond Principle: ſo the Sunne is the vertue [or power] and light of this materiall world in the third Principle: and as the Deity ſhineth in the darkneſſe in the firſt Principle, ſo the Sunne ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the darkneſſe in the third Principle. And as the Deity is the eternall vertue and the ſpirit of the eternall life; ſo the Sunne is the Spirit and the vertue in the <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory life.</hi>
               </note> corruptible life.</p>
            <p n="20">20. So now a Spirit is nothing elſe but a ſpringing will, and in the will there is the anguiſh to the birth, and in the anguiſh the fire gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth it ſelfe, and in the fire the light, and from the light the will becometh friendly, pleaſant, milde, and ſweet, and in the ſweet will the kingdome and the glory generateth it ſelfe. Thus the light keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the might [or power]; and if that be put out, then the vertue [or power] and glory ceaſeth, and the kingdome alſo.</p>
            <p n="21">21. God, who is the eternall light, he is the eternall will, he ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Darkneſſe, and the Darkneſſe hath comprehended the will: and in that will (which hath comprehended the Darkneſſe) the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh riſeth up, and in the ſoure [harſh] anguiſh the fire, and in the fire the light, and out of the light [cometh] the vertue [or power] and out of the vertue the kingdome. So now out of the fire [came] the Conſtellations, and moreover the Sunne, and out of the vertue came the Heaven; and the kingdome is Gods. All this was in the firſt will in the Creation, one with another: wherein God ſevered the fiery will, from the milde will of the light, and called the fiery [will] Starres, and the milde [will] Heaven, in reſpect of the vertue of each of them.</p>
            <p n="22">22. The Sun is the <note n="o" place="margin">Petty God.</note> Goddeſſe in the third Principle; in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted world (underſtand, in the materiall vertue) it went forth out of the darkneſſe in the anguiſh of the will, in the way and manner of the eternall Birth. For when God ſet the Fiat in the Darkneſſe, then the darkneſſe received the will of God, and was impregnated <note n="p" place="margin">To.</note> for the Birth. The will, cauſeth the [ſoure] harſhneſſe, the harſhneſſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the attracting, and the ſtirring of the attracting to mobility cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the bitterneſſe, which is the woe: and the woe cauſeth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh: and the anguiſh cauſeth the moving, breaking, and riſing up. Now the ſoure harſhneſſe cannot endure the jirking, and therefore attracteth the harder to it ſelfe: and the bitterneſſe or the attracting will not endure to be ſtayed, but breaketh and ſtingeth ſo very hard in the attracting, that it ſtirreth up the heate, wherein the flaſh ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, and the darke [ſoureneſſe or] harſhneſſe is affrighted by the flaſh, and in the skreeke the fire kindleth, and in the fire the light. Now there would be no light if the ſkreek in the harſhneſſe had not been, but there would have remained nothing but fire; yet the ſkreek in the harſhneſſe of the fire killeth the hard harſhneſſe, ſo that it ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down as it were to the ground, and becometh as it were dead and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57651:36"/>
ſoft; and when the flaſh perceiveth it ſelfe in the harſhneſſe, then it is affrighted much more, becauſe it findeth the mother ſo very milde, and halfe dead in weakneſſe: and ſo in this ſkreek its fiery property becometh white, ſoft, and milde, and it is the kindling of the light, wherein the fire is changed into a white clarity [glance, luſtre, or brightneſſe.]</p>
            <p n="23">23 In ſuch a maner as this the Sunne roſe up in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> and out of the Sunne (in its firſt kindling) [aroſe] the other Planets, <hi>viz.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, out of the raging bitterneſſe <hi>Mars</hi> [aroſe] which the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the Sunne ſtayed [or upheld] when it diſcovered <note n="q" place="margin">Mars.</note> it: and out of the vertue of the Sunne, which raiſed it ſelfe higher [aroſe] <hi>Jupiter</hi> impriſoned in the centre of the <hi>Fiat;</hi> and out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of anguiſh [aroſe] <hi>Saturnus:</hi> and downwards <hi>Venus</hi> [aroſe] from the ſoft mildneſſe, when the harſhneſſe was overcome, and that it was ſoft, ſweet, and ſinking down like water. And when the light kindled, then out of the ſoure harſh wrath came Love and Humility to be, running downwards: and out of the overcome vertue in the ſoure harſhneſſe [aroſe <hi>Mercurius)</hi> wherein ſtandeth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what was in the Originall before the light: But when the light made the vertue in the place of the Sun materiall; as it were in an earthly manner [aroſe] the Moone.</p>
            <p n="24">24 This the world comprehendeth not, but ſcorneth it, therefore I will here no further caſt the Pearle before the ſwine: for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth another light to this knowledge; therefore I will paſſe that by, and goe on.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Out of the anguiſh of Darkneſſe (when God ſpake the [word] Fiat therein) came forth all things: The anguiſh hath its Originall in the Fiat, and the Fiat [hath its Originall] in the will, and the will is eternall without Originall: for it is (in God) the Matrix of the Genetrix.</p>
            <p n="26">26. God is inviſible, and the will is alſo inviſible, and the Matrix alſo is inviſible, and yet they are in ſubſtance, and are from eternity, and continue in eternity: and the Word is the vertue of the will; and the vertue [or power] maketh the Fiat, and the Fiat maketh the kingdome, and it is all alike eternall in one onely ſubſtance: The will hath generated the Word from eternity; and the Word the vertue, and the vertue the ſpirit, and in the ſpirit is the light, and in the light is the power, underſtanding, and knowledge; otherwiſe it were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether nothing.</p>
            <p n="27">27. That light hath wrought in the knowledge, and in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and generated a ſimilitude of its ſubſtance: and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which wrought was the Fiat, and the Fiat formed the ſimilitude which was generated out of the will, and made it viſible: and the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude was generated out of the darkneſſe, out of the eternall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57651:36"/>
and yet ſomewhat was there, <hi>viz.</hi> the originalneſſe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, out of which the eternall will <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>taketh its eternall origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>
               </note> generateth it ſelfe from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Now the ſimilitude alſo hath received ſuch a will out of the Fiat, as the eternall will is; and it hath generated the vertue [or power,] and the vertue is the Heaven; and the light which is become ſhining in the vertue, is the Sun: and that worketh in the vertue; ſo that there is underſtanding and knowledge; or elſe all in this world would be an immoveable ſubſtance, and all would lie ſtill, and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearb nor graſſe would grow.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Therefore in the Fiat is ariſen out of the anguiſh, the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the knowledge and underſtanding; and that is the Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is the fift forme of the Birth in the Fiat, and the Fiat hath ſevered the formes in the birth, ſo that every eſſence is ſeverall; as hard, ſoft, thick, thin, hot, cold, bitter, tart, ſoure, ſweet, and ſo forth as we ſee: and the ſpirit continued in the matrix of Heaven, which goeth out from thence, <hi>(viz.</hi> the aire) and the Spirit receiveth the underſtanding from the Conſtellation; for it is a member of the other in one onely Mother.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Now the Matrix <hi>(viz.</hi> the created Heaven) in the Fiat, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſtarres, is the ſimilitude of all that was from eternity: though not viſible: and the Fiat is in the ſimilitude: and the Paradiſe wherein the Angels dwell, is hidden in the Matrix: and God is ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Paradiſe, and yet incomprehenſible; as the glanſe [or lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre] of the Sunne cannot be comprehended.</p>
            <p n="31">31. And God is immenſe [immeaſurable], and the ſimilitude is alſo immeaſurable: he is in the ſimilitude and the ſimilitude compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth him not: the ſimilitude is his worke, and he is the Maſter workman thereof; the Conſtellation is his inſtrument, and the <note n="ſ" place="margin">The created Heaven.</note> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix with the Elements, are the <hi>Materia,</hi> [matter or materialls] out of which the <note n="t" place="margin">The Fiat.</note> Maſter cutteth and faſhioneth his work.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Now the Maſter alwayes worketh on and on, without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, what he lighteth upon that he maketh: for the conſideration is in the worke. And therefore it is that the whole nature ſtandeth in anguiſh and longing, to be freed from the vanity; as alſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture witneſſeth. Becauſe it taſteth the Paradiſe in it ſelfe, and in the Paradiſe the perfection, and therefore it groaneth and lifteth it ſelfe up towards the light of God and Paradiſe; and ſo bringeth forth in its anguiſh alwayes ſomewhat that is fairer, higher and new; as may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently be found and underſtood in the minde of man; and is very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to a ſmall underſtanding: that in workes alwayes ſome ſpecial thing is brought to light, and if you be not blinde, you may ſee this in Men, Beaſts, yea even in hearbs and graſſe.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Thus on the fourth day, by the Fiat, out of the vertue, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57651:37"/>
the ſimilitude of his ſubſtance [and fitted it] to be a Matrix, which ſhould generate all whatſoever was a ſimilitude of his ſubſtance, out of the wiſdome which was in him from eternity: that ſo all formes might be brought forth and become viſible, which were from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Matrix; and the ſimilitude of the unſearchable manifold va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties and vertues, are the ſtarres, which altogether give [or ſend] their vertue into the matrix of the Heaven, and the Heaven giveth that ſame ſpirit to the Creatures.

            <p n="39">39 Now then if the Beaſts [or Animals nature] were meerly out of a lump of earth, then they would eat earth; but ſeeing <note n="e" place="margin">The beſtiall nature.</note> it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of the Matrix of the earth by the <hi>Fiat,</hi> therefore it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth alſo ſuch food as the matrix affordeth out of its own eſſence: and that is not earth, but fleſh: yet this fleſh now is a <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

            <p n="40">40 For in the beginning of the creation, at the time when the earth became materiall, all was generated out of one onely ſubſtance, and there was no more done but a ſeparation made of one <note n="i" place="margin">Part.</note> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: therefore in every ſeparation there muſt needs be alwayes a vehement hunger of one <note n="k" place="margin">Part.</note> after another: An example whereof you have in propagation; for the ſake whereof the ſeparation was ſo made: For you ſee that there is a male and a female; and that the one continually deſireth copulation with the other, that they may <note n="l" place="margin">Engender.</note> generate.

               <p n="41">41 Obſerve, as hath been often mentioned, that as in the <hi>Fiat</hi> in the aking matrix, <hi>(viz.</hi> the dark harſhneſſe [or ſourneſſe]) the fire roſe up in the breaking wheele in the kindling; and that in the fiery, the light of the Sunne and of all the Starres [ſprung up (which is [done] in the harſh matrix, which from the light is become thin, lowly, and materiall water) and the pleaſant ſource of love [ſprung up] ſo that one form vehemently loverh the other, in reſpect of the kinde, meek light, which was come into all formes. So now the ſoft meekneſſe was become a new childe, which was not the dark original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the anguiſhingneſſe. But this childe was the Paradiſe, yet being it ſtood not in the <hi>Materia</hi> [or matter] therefore the matrix of the harſhneſſe could not comprehend it; but <note n="n" place="margin">The matrix.</note> it yeelded it ſelfe forth very deſirouſly, and longing with great earneſtneſſe (according to the fire and bitterneſſe) to comprehend the pleaſant ſource of love, and yet could not comprehend it, for <note n="o" place="margin">The ſource of love.</note> it was Patadiſicall; and thus it ſtill ſtood in great longing and generated water.</p>
               <p n="42">42 But now God ſeparated the fire <hi>(viz.</hi> the fifth eſſence or form) from the water, and out of that made the ſtarres: and the Paradiſe is hid in the matrix. Therefore now the mother of the water deſireth with great earneſtneſſe the mother of the fire, and ſeeketh the childe of love; and the mother of the fire ſeeketh it in the mother of the water, where it was generated, and there is between them a continuall vehement hunger one after another to copulate.</p>
               <p n="43">43 Now God ſayd, <hi>Let all manner of beaſts come forth, every one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its kinde:</hi> and ſo there came forth out of the eſſence of every ones kinde, a male and a female. And thus the Spirit of the Starres, or the Spirit in the form of Fire, had now by its longing copulated with the watry [Spirit,] and two Sexes ſprung out of one eſſence; the one according to the <hi>Limbus</hi> in the forme of fire, and the other according to the Aquaſter [or ſpirit of the water] in the watry form: yet ſo [blended or] mixed, that they were alik as to the body; and ſo the Male was qualified according to the <hi>Limbus,</hi> or form of fire, and the female according to the Aquaſter in the watry forme.</p>
               <p n="44">44 And ſo now there is a vehement deſire in the creatures. The Spirit of the male ſeeketh the loving childe in the female, and the female in the male; for the irrationality of the body in the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures, knoweth not what it doth; the body would not if it had reaſon, move ſo eagerly towards propagation; neither doth it know any thing of the impregnation [or conception,] onely its ſpirit doth ſo burne in deſire after the childe of love, that it ſeeketh love,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57651:38"/>
(which yet is Paradiſicall) and it cannot comprehend it; but it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſowing of ſeed.</hi>
                  </note> ſemination onely, wherein there is again a centre to the birth. And thus is the originall of both Sexes, and their propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet it doth not attain the Paradiſicall childe of love; but it is a vehement hunger, and ſo the propagation is acted with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe.</p>
               <p n="45">45 But that I now write, that the ſtarres doe rule in all Beaſts, and other creatures; and that every creature received the Spirit of the ſtarres in the creation, and that all things ſtill ſtand in the ſame Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this the ſimple will hardly beleeve; though the Doctor knoweth it well, and therefore we direct them to Experience. Behold, a Male and Female beget young ones, and that often: now they come forth out of one onely body, &amp; yet are not of one kinde, [nor of the ſame] colour and vertue, nor [ſhape or] form of body.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Paradiſe hath another Principle: for it is the Divine and Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall joy, yet not without the <note n="d" place="margin">Extra locum.</note> place of this world.

               <p n="6">6 When God had created the Beaſts, he brought them to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he ſhould give them their names, every one according to their eſſence and kinde, as they [the beaſts] were qualified, [or according to the quality and condition they were of.] Now <hi>Adam</hi> was in the Garden of Eden in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and alſo in Paradiſe at once, yet no beaſt can come into Paradiſe: for it is the Divine <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
                  </note> joy, wherein there is no unclean thing, alſo no death or corruptible [or tranſitory] life: <note n="i" place="margin">Therefore the garden of Eden is not Paradiſe.</note> much leſſe is there the knowledge of Good and Evill; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth of it, that in the Garden of Eden there was the tree of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

               <p n="7">7. But the Paradiſe is ſomewhat elſe; and yet no other place, but another Principle, where God and the Angels dwell, and where there is perfection, where there is meere love, joy, and knowledge; where no miſery is: which [Paradiſe] neither death nor the Devils doe touch, neither doe they know it: and yet it hath no wall of earth or ſtones about it, but there is a great Gulfe [or cliffe] between Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe and this world, ſo that they who will paſſe from hence thither, cannot; and they who would come from thence to us, cannot neither: and the Hell and the kingdome of darkneſſe is between them: and none can come therein but by a new Birth: which Chriſt ſpake of to <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> The ſoules of the Saints [holy] and regenerate, muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it (by the death of Darkneſſe,) whom the Arch-Shepherd, with the Angels, bringeth thereinto upon his <note n="l" place="margin">Note, the Bride-Chariot is the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation into the boſome of the Father.</note> Bride-chariot: of which you ſhall finde [an expoſition] in its proper place in order.</p>

               <p n="9">9. Therefore I will not neglect my Day labour; but will labour as much as I can on the way; and although I ſhall ſcarce be able to <note n="m" place="margin">Much leſſe to ſpell or reade.</note> tell the Letters, in this ſo high a way; yet it <note n="*" place="margin">My labour.</note> ſhall be ſo high, that many will have enough to learne in it all their life long: he that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that he knoweth it very well; he hath not yet learnt the firſt letter of Paradiſe; for no Doctors are to be found on this way in this Schoole; but onely <note n="n" place="margin">Children go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſchoole.</note> ſchollers [or learners.]</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57651:42"/>
it: and the attracting in the will, is the [ſting or] prickle, which the deſirouſneſſe attracteth, and the firſt ſtirring [or moving]. Now the prickle cannot endure the attracting in the will, but reſiſteth, flieth up, and yet cannot get away from thence: for it is generated in the attracting; but becauſe it cannot remove from thence, nor can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the attracting, therefore there is a great anguiſh, a deſirouſneſſe [or longing] after the light, like a furiouſneſſe, and like a breaking whirling wheele: and the anguiſh in the bitterneſſe riſeth up in the <note n="k" place="margin">Fierceneſſe.</note> wrath after the light, but cannot get it, being deſirous in the anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to lift up it ſelfe above the light, yet doth not overcome, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected [impregnated or mingled] with the light, and attaineth a twinckling flaſh: and as ſoone as the harſhneſſe, or the hardneſſe, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Darkneſſe) getteth the ſame into it, it is terrified and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly goeth away into its <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>receptacle.</hi>

And in this horrour [terrour or skreeke] the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or harſhneſſe becometh milde, ſoft, [ſupple] and thin; and the flaſh is made in the bitterneſſe, which flieth up thus in the prickle: thus the prickle diſcovereth it ſelfe in the Mother, which ſo terrifieth the mother with the flaſh, that ſhee yeeldeth her ſelfe to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: and when the prickle ſtrengtheneth it ſelfe in the mother, and findeth her ſo milde, then that is much more terrified, and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its [fierce, ſtrong] wrathfull propriety, and in the twinckling of an eye becometh white, cleere, and bright, and flieth up very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, trembling with great delight, [luſt] and deſire; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of harſhneſſe, from the light cometh to be ſweet, milde, thin, and materiall, even water.

Behold thou reaſonable ſoule; to thee I ſpeake, and not to the body, thou onely apprehendeſt it: When the Birth is thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually generated, then every forme hath a centre to the Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the whole divine eſſence [or ſubſtance] ſtandeth in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and in eternall <note n="s" place="margin">Working.</note> generating (but unchangeably) like the minde of Man, the thoughts being continually generated out of the minde, and the will and deſirouſneſſe out of the thoughts, out of the will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirouſneſſe [is] the work [generated] which is made a ſubſtance, in the will, and then the mouth and hands, goe on to performe what was ſubſtantiall in the will.</p>

If you be borne of God, then you [may] thus underſtand, God, Paradiſe, the kingdome of Heaven and Hell, and the entrance in, and end of the Creatures, [and] the creation of this world: but if not: then the vaile is as well before your eyes, as it was upon <hi>Moſes.</hi> Therefore ſaith Chriſt; <hi>Seek, and you ſhall finde; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you: No ſonne asketh his Father for an egge, that he ſhould give him a ſcorpion: Alſo my Father will give the Holy Ghoſt to them that aske it.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I Have peruſed many Maſter-pieces of writing, hoping to finde the <note n="b" place="margin">The high and deep wiſdome of God.</note> Pearle of the ground of Man: but I could finde nothing of that which my ſoule luſted after. I have alſo found very many contrary opinions: and partly I have found ſome who forbid me to ſearch [or ſeeke] but I cannot know with what ground or underſtanding, except it be that the blinde doe grutch at the eyes of them that ſee. With all this my ſoule is become very diſquiet within mee, and hath been as full of [pain and] anguiſh as a woman at her travaile, and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was found in it, till I followed the words of Chriſt; when he ſaid: <hi>You muſt be borne anew, if you will ſee the kingdome of God:</hi> Which at firſt ſtopped up my heart, and I ſuppoſed that ſuch a thing could not be done in this world, but [that it ſhould firſt be done] at my departure out of this world: and then my ſoule firſt was in anguiſh to the birth, and would very willingly have taſted the Pearle: and gave it ſelfe up in this way more vehemently to the Birth, till at laſt it obtained a Jewel. According to which [received Jewel] I will write, for a memoriall to my ſelfe, and for a light to them that ſeeke. For Chriſt ſaid; <hi>None lighteth a Candle and putteth it under a Buſhell, but ſetteth it upon a Table, that all that are in the houſe may ſee by the light thereof:</hi> And to this end he giveth the Pearle to them that ſeeke, that they ſhould impart it to the poore, for their health, as he hath very earneſtly commanded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth: <hi>That God made Man of the duſt of the Earth:</hi> and that is the opinion of very many: and I ſhould alſo not have known how that were to be underſtood, and I ſhould not have learned it out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor out of the <note n="c" place="margin">Expoſitions or interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it.</note> Gloſſes which are made upon it: and the vaile would have continued ſtill before my eyes, yet in great trouble. But when I found the Pearle, then I looked <hi>Moſes</hi> in the face: and found that <hi>Moſes</hi> had written very right, and that I had not rightly underſtood it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For after the Fall God ſaid alſo to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve; Earth thou art, and to Earth thou ſhalt returne againe:</hi> and if I had not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <note n="d" place="margin">The power, or the eternall ſubſtantiality.</note>

blinde ſtill: that <hi>[Limbus]</hi> ſhewed me the Ground of what <hi>Adam</hi> was before and after the Fall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For no ſuch Earth or fleſh as wee carry about us, can ſubſiſt in the light of God: Therefore alſo Chriſt ſaid; <hi>None goeth to Heaven, but the Sonne of Man who is come from Heaven, and who is in Heaven.</hi> Thus our fleſh before the Fall, was heavenly, out of the heavenly <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi> but when diſobedience came, in the luſt of this world, to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it ſelfe in <note n="e" place="margin">That is, to feed it ſelfe and live through the word of God.</note> another Centre, then it [the fleſh] became earthly: for by the biting of the earthly Apple in the Garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> the earthly Dominion [or kingdome] tooke its beginning: and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the great world inſtantly tooke the <note n="f" place="margin">Man.</note> little world into its power [or vertue] and made it to be of a Beaſtiall <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>property</hi>

                  </note> within it, then <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have continued to be an unreaſonable Beaſt: but being the ſoule out of the <hi>Limbus</hi> had been breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now the <note n="k" place="margin">Barmhorts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit.</note> mercifulneſſe <hi>(viz.</hi> the heart of God) muſt doe its beſt againe, and bring againe the Centre out of the heavenly <hi>Limbus,</hi> and himſelfe become fleſh, and by the Fiat generate the New Man in the ſoule, which is hidden in the Old: for the Old belongeth onely to the corruptibility, and goeth into its Ether, and the New remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever. But how this came to paſſe, you have the following fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall information of it, wherein if you be regenerated from God, you may ſee the old and new man into the very heart, becauſe you have the Pearle: but if not; then you ſhall ſcarce ſee here the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and you ſhall not ſo much as looke upon the New.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The vaile of <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be done away, and you muſt look <hi>Moſes</hi> in the face, if you will behold the New Man: and without the Pearle, you ſhall not be able to take away the vayle, nor know [what] <hi>Adam</hi> [was] before his Fall. for <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe after the Fall, did no more know the firſt Man: and therefore he was aſhamed of his mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous forme [or ſhape] and did hide himſelfe behinde the Trees in the Garden: for he looked on himſelfe and ſaw that he had a beaſtiall forme: and thereupon he gat inſtantly beaſtiall members for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which the Fiat in the third Principle created on him, through the Spirit of the Great world.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Men muſt not thinke that Man before his fall, had beaſtiall members to propagate with, but heavenly [members] nor no <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>Gutts.</hi>
                  </note> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes; for ſuch a ſtinck and [filthy] ſource [or property] as man hath in his body, doth not belong to the holy Trinity in Paradiſe, but to the Earth, it muſt goe againe into its Ether; but Man was created immortall, and alſo holy, like the Angels; and being he was created out of the <hi>Limbus,</hi> therefore he was pure. Now in what manner he is, and out of what he was made it followeth further.</p>

                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57651:45"/>
8. Behold when God had created the third Principle, after the fall of the Devils, when they fell from their Glory (for they had been An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſtanding in the place of this world) yet nevetheleſſe he would that his will and purpoſe ſhould ſtand; and therefore he would give to the place of this world an Angelicall <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Company.</hi>
                  </note> Hoaſt againe, which ſhould continue to ſtand for ever. And now he having created the Creatures, whoſe ſhadows after the changing of the world ſhould continue for ever; yet there was no creature found that could have any joy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in [in the ſhadowes] neither was there any creature found that might mannage the Beaſts in this world: therefore God ſaid; <hi>Let us make Man an Image like unto us; which may rule over all the Beaſts, and creatures upon the Earth; and God created Man to be his Image, after the Image of God created he him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Now the Queſtion is; What is Gods Image? Behold, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Deity, and then you will light upon it: for God is not a Beaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Man; but Man ſhould be the Image and ſimilitude of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſhould dwell. Now God is a Spirit, &amp; all the three Principles are in him: and he would make ſuch an Image, as ſhould have all the three Principles in him, and that is rightly a ſimilitude of God; <hi>And he created him,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby <hi>Moſes</hi> may be rightly underſtood, that God created him, and not made him of a lump of Earth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But the <hi>Limbus</hi> out of which he created him, is the Matrix of the Earth: and the Earth was generated out of it: yet the <hi>Materia</hi> [or matter] out of which he created him was a <hi>Maſſa,</hi> a <hi>Quinta Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia,</hi> out of the Starres and Elements; which inſtantly became earthly, when Man awakened the earthly centre, and did inſtantly belong to the earth and corruptibility.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But yet this <hi>Maſſa</hi> was out of the heavenly Matrix, which is the roote of the <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>progene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </note> Out-birth, or [the roote] of the Earth. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Centre ought to remaine <note n="o" place="margin">Stedfaſt, chiefe, Maſter, or predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> fixed; and the earthly ought not to be awakened: and in this vertue [and power] he was Lord and ruler over the Starres and Elements: and all creatures ſhould have ſtood in awe of him, and he ſhould have been uncorruptible, he had the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and properties of all manner of Creatures in him: for his vertue was out of the vertue [or power] of the underſtanding. Now then he ought to have all the three Principles, if he were to be the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of God, <hi>[viz.]</hi> the <note n="p" place="margin">Working pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie.</note> ſource of the Darkneſſe, and alſo of the Light, and alſo the <note n="p" place="margin">Working pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie.</note> ſource of this world: and yet he ſhould not live and <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>qualifie.</hi>
                  </note> act in all three, but in one of them onely, and that in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſicall [property] in which his life [quickned] aroſe [or did exiſt].</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now that this is demonſtratively and certainly thus, [appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] in that it is written: <hi>And God breathed into him the</hi>

                  <hi>Limbus</hi> by the Fiat, in all thoſe, the will in the Fiat had awakened the ſpirit in their Centre, and every creatures ſpirit, went forth out of the eſſence and property of its own ſelfe; and mixed afterwards with the ſpirit of the great world, of the Starres and Elements, and that ought not to have been in Man, his ſpirit ought not to have mixt it ſelfe [or been united] with the ſpirit of the Starres and Elements: the two Principles <hi>(viz.</hi> the Darkneſſe and the Spirit of the Aire) ought to have ſtood ſtill in ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance [as ſhould be the Image of God]; and therefore he breathed into him the <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>Breath of life.</hi>
                  </note> living breath: underſtand Gods breath, that is, the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſicall Breath or Spirit, <hi>[viz.]</hi> the Holy Ghoſt; that ſhould be the Breath of the Soule, in the Centre of the Soule: and the Spirit which went forth out of the <hi>Limbus,</hi> or out of the <hi>Quinta Eſſentia</hi> (which is of the <note n="u" place="margin">Kinde, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> condition of the Starres) that was to have power over the fift Eſſence of this world: for Man was in one onely Eſſence [or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance] and there was alſo but one onely Man that God thus created: and he could have lived for ever: and although God had brought the Starres againe into their Ether, and alſo had withdrawn the matrix of the Elements, and the Elements alſo, back into the nothing; yet Man would have continued ſtill. Beſides, he had the Paradiſicall Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre in him, and he could have generated againe out of himſelfe, out of his will, and have awakened the Centre; and ſo ſhould have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in Paradiſe, to generate an Angelicall <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>company.</hi>

               <head>The deep Gate of the Soule.</head>
               <p n="13">13. THe ſoule of Man, which God hath breathed into him, is out of the Eternall Father: yet underſtand it aright: there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference [to be obſerved; you muſt] underſtand [that it is] out of his unchangeable will, out of which he generateth his Sonne and Heart from Eternity, out of the divine Centre, from whence the Fiat goeth forth, which maketh ſeparation; and hath in <note n="y" place="margin">The ſoule.</note> it all the Eſſences of the Eternall Birth: [or all manner of things which are in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Birth:] onely the Birth of the Sonne of God, that very Centre, which the Sonne of God himſelfe is; he hath not; for that Centre is the end of Nature, and not creaturely: That is the higheſt centre of the Fire burning love and mercy of God, the perfection [or fulneſſe]: out of this centre no creature cometh, but it appeareth [or ſhineth] in the Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> in Angels, and in the ſoules of holy Men: for the Holy Ghoſt, and the Omnipotence [or Almightineſſe] which frameth

the Eternall will in the Eternall Father, that goeth forth out of this [Centre].</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now therefore the ſoule ſtandeth in two Gates; and toucheth two Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eternall Darkneſſe, and the Eternall light of the Sonne of God, as God the Father himſelfe doth. Now as God the Father <note n="z" place="margin">Keepeth or retaineth.</note> holdeth his unchangeable Eternall will, to generate his heart and Sonne, ſo the Angels and ſoules keepe their unchangeable will in the heart of God. Thus it [the ſoule] is in Heaven and in Paradiſe, and enjoyeth the inutterable joy of God the Father which he hath in the Sonne, and it heareth the inexpreſſible words of the heart of God, and rejoyceth at the Eternall, and alſo at the created Images, which are not in eſſence [or ſubſtance] but in figure.</p>
               <p n="15">15. There the ſoule eateth of all the words of God; for the ſame are the food of its life; and it ſingeth the Paradiſicall <note n="a" place="margin">Halelujahs.</note> ſongs of Praiſe, concerning the pleaſant fruit in Paradiſe, which groweth in the divine vertue [or power] of the divine <hi>Limbus,</hi> which is the food of the <note n="b" place="margin">The heavenly and Eternall paradiſicall body.</note> body, for the body eateth of the <hi>Limbus,</hi> out of which it is, and the ſoule eateth of God and of his word, out of which it is.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Can this be no joy and rejoycing? and ſhould not that be a pleaſant thing, with the many thouſand ſorts of Angels to eate hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bread, and to rejoyce in their communion and fellowſhip? What can be poſſibly named which can be more pleaſant? Where there is no feare, no anger, no death: where every voyce and ſpeech is; Salvation, power, ſtrength, and might, be to our God; and this voyce going forth into the Eternity. Thus with this ſound the divine vertue of Paradiſe goeth forth: and it is a meere growing in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Centre of the fruits in Paradiſe. And there is the place where S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> heard words inutterable, that no man can expreſſe. Such a man was <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall: and that you may not doubt, that this is very ſure and moſt truly thus, look upon the Circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="17">17. When God had created <hi>Adam</hi> thus, he was then in Paradiſe in the joyfulneſſe: and this clarified [or <note n="c" place="margin">Illuſtrious or ſhining.</note> brightened] Man was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beautifull, and full of all manner of knowledge: and there God brought all the Beaſts to him, (as to the Great Lord in this world) that he ſhould look upon them, and give to every one their Name, according to their Eſſence and vertue; as the Spirit of every one was figured in them. And <hi>Adam</hi> knew all what every Creature was, and he gave every one their Name according to the quality [or working property] of their Spirit. As God can ſee into the heart of all things, ſo could <hi>Adam</hi> alſo doe, in which his perfection may very well be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And <hi>Adam</hi> and all men ſhould have gone wholly naked, as he then went: his clothing was the clarity [or brightneſſe] in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue [or power]: no heat nor cold touched him: he ſaw day and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57651:47"/>
night [cleerly] with open eyes; in him there was no ſleepe, and in his minde there was no night: for the divine vertue [and power] was in his eyes: and he was altogether perfect: he had the <note n="d" place="margin">The ſeede.</note> 
                  <hi>Limbus,</hi> and alſo the <note n="*" place="margin">The womb.</note> Matrix in himſelfe: he was no [male] or Man, nor [female or] Woman; as wee in the Reſurrection ſhall be [neither]: though indeed the knowledge of the marks [of diſtinction will] re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the figure, but the <hi>Limbus</hi> and the Matrix not ſevered, as now [they are].</p>
               <p n="19">19. Now Man was to dwell upon the Earth as long as it was to ſtand, and manage [rule and order] the beaſts, and have his delight and recreation therein: but he ought not to have eaten any earthly fruit, wherein the corruptibility [or tranſitorineſſe] did ſtick: it is true he ſhould have eaten, but onely with the mouth, and not into the body: for he had no [entrailes, ſtomack, or] guts, nor any ſuch hard dark fleſh, it was all perfect: for there grew Paradiſicall fruit for him, which afterwards <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>diſappea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>

               <p n="20">20. If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in innocency, then he ſhould in all fruits have eaten Paradiſicall fruit, and his food ſhould have been hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and his drink [ſhould have been] out of the mother of the heavenly water of the ſource [or fountaine] of the Eternall life.

               <p n="21">21. This muſt be <hi>Adams</hi> condition: and thus he was a true and right Image and ſimilitude of God: he had no ſuch hard bones in his fleſh [as wee now have] but they were ſtrength, and ſuch [a kinde of] vertue: alſo his bloud was not out of the tincture of the <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>watery Mother.</hi>
                  </note> aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſh Matrix, but it was out of the heavenly Matrix.

               <p n="22">22. And when God had created Man, then he planted a Garden in <hi>Eden</hi> towards the Eaſt, and placed him therein: and cauſed to ſpring up and grow all manner of fruit, delightfull to behold, and all ſorts of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57651:47"/>
Trees good to eate of: and the Tree of Life in the midſt of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evill: and when God had placed Man in the Garden, he commanded him, and ſaid; <hi>You ſhall eate of every Tree in the Garden, but of the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evill thou ſhalt not eate; for in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die the Death.</hi> Here the vaile lieth upon <hi>Moſes;</hi> and they muſt be ſharp [or piercing] Eyes that can behold the face of <hi>Moſes:</hi> God hath not without cauſe let <hi>Moſes</hi> write this ſo very myſtically [hidden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and obſcurely].</p>
               <p n="23">23. For what needed God to care ſo much for the biting of an Apple, as to deſtroy ſo faire a creature for it? Doth he not forgive many greater ſinnes? And he ſo exceedingly loved Man, that he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his onely Sonne, but let him become Man, and gave him unto Death: and could he not forgive a ſmall ſinne? ſeeing he was omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient, [or knew all things] therefore why did he let the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evill grow?</p>
               <p n="24">24. Reaſon judgeth thus, that if God would not have had it ſo, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſhould not have eaten of it, or elſe he ſhould not have forbidden that Tree onely, ſure he made it for a ſtumbling ſtock to him. Thus the Reaſon of one [ſort] or party judgeth. The Reaſon of the other party will mend the matter, which is indeed ſomewhat the wiſer, but not much: They ſay, God tempted <hi>Adam,</hi> [to try] whether he would continue in his obedience or not: and when he became diſobedient, then God threw mighty anger and wrath upon him, and curſed him to Death; and that his wrath could not be quenched, except he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in ſuch a manner. This Reaſon of this party, maketh God to be a meere unmercifulneſſe, like an evill man of this world, who yet will be reconciled, when he hath once revenged himſelfe ſufficiently; and this Reaſon hath no knowledge at all God, nor of Paradiſe.</p>
               <p n="25">25. O beloved ſoule! it is a very <note n="i" place="margin">For which the Curſe came.</note> heavy buſineſſe, at which the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heavens might well ſtand amazed: in this Temptation there is a very great matter hidden in <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the unenlightened ſoule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth not; God did not regard a bit of an Apple or Peare, to puniſh ſo faire a Creature for it: The puniſhment cometh not from his hand, but from the <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Spiritus major is mundi,</hi> from the Spirit of the great World, from the third Principle. God intended moſt merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards Man, and therefore he ſpared not his own heart, but let it become Man, that he might deliver Man againe. You ought not to have ſuch thoughts. God is love, and the Good, in him is no angry thought, and Mans puniſhment was not but from himſelfe, as you ſhall [finde or] reade in its due place.</p>

               <p n="27">27. The minde ſearcheth, wherefore man muſt be tempted, whereas God had created him perfect: and ſeeing God is omniſcient, [and knoweth all things] the minde therefore alwaies layeth the blame upon God: and ſo doe the Devils alſo: for the minde ſaith, If the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evill had not ſprung up, then <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen.</p>
               <p n="28">28. O beloved Reaſon! If you underſtand no more than ſo, then ſhut up the eyes [of your minde] quite, and ſearch not; continue under patience in hope, and let God alone [he will doe well enough] or elſe you will fall into the greateſt unquietneſſe, and the Devill will drive you into deſpaire, who continually [pretendeth or] giveth it forth <note n="l" place="margin">The Devill ſaith it in the minde.</note>, that God did will evill, [and that] he willeth not that all men ſhould be ſaved, and therefore he created the Tree of Anger.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Beloved Minde, put ſuch thoughts away from thee, or elſe thou wilt make of the kinde and loving God, an unmercifull and hoſtile will, but leave off ſuch thoughts of God, and conſider thy ſelfe what thou art: in thy ſelfe thou ſhalt finde the Tree of the Temptation, and alſo the will to have it, which made it ſpring up: yea the ſource [luſt or quality] whence it ſprung up, ſtandeth in thee, and not in God: [this muſt be underſtood] that when we will ſpeak of the pure Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which manifeſteth it ſelfe in the ſecond Principle through the heart of God) it is thus and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="30">30. But when wee conſider [or meane] the originall of the firſt Principle, then wee finde the [nature, propertie, or] ſpecies of the Tree, and alſo the will to the Tree: wee finde there the abyſſe of Hell and of anger [and wrath]: and moreover wee finde the will of all the Devils: we finde the envious will of all the Creatures of this world, wherefore they all are the enemies one of another, and doe hate, bite, worry, kill and devour one another.

Thus the minde careleſly paſſeth it over, like a whirlwinde or ſtreame of water; concerning which Chriſt ſaid; The Devill ſtealeth the Word out of their hearts, that they doe not apprehend it, nor beleeve it, that they might be ſaved; ſo that it taketh no roote.</p>

Or elſe if the Pearle ſhould grow, and the Lilly bud forth; <note n="r" place="margin">The Devill.</note> he ſhould be revealed, and then every one would flie from him, and he ſhould ſtand in great ſhame. This Trade he hath driven ever ſince the beginning of the world: and though he reſiſt never ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet a Lilly ſhall grow in his ſuppoſed Kingdome, whoſe ſmell reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the Paradiſe of God, in ſpite of all his raging and tyranny; this the Spirit of God doth witneſſe.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Behold thou childe of Man, if thou wilt eaſily draw neere to this knowledge, take but thy minde before thee, and conſider it, and therein thou wilt finde all. You know that out of it proceedeth joy and ſorrow, laughter and weeping, hope and doubting, wrath and love, luſt to a thing, and hate of the thing: you finde therein wrath and malice, alſo love, meekneſſe, and well-doing.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Now the Queſtion is, May not the minde ſtand in one onely will, <hi>(viz.</hi> in meere love) like God himſelfe? Here ſticks the mark, the ground, and the knowledge: behold, if the will were in one onely Eſſence, then the minde would alſo have but one quality that could give the will to be ſo, and it ſhould be an immovable thing, which ſhould alwayes lie ſtill, and ſhould doe no more but that one thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies: in it there would be no joy, no knowledge, alſo no art or skill of any thing at all, and there would be no wiſdome in it: alſo if the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57651:49"/>
quality were not <hi>in infinitum,</hi> it would be altogether a Nothing, and there would be no minde nor will to any thing at all.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Therefore it cannot be ſaid, that the totall God in all the three Principles is in one onely will and eſſence: there is a diſtinction [or difference to be obſerved]: though indeed the firſt and the third Principle be not called God, neither are they God, and yet are his eſſence [or ſubſtance], out of which from eternity the light and heart of God is alwaies generated, and it is one eſſence [or being] as body and ſoule in Man are.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Therefore now if the Eternall minde were not, out of which the Eternall will goeth forth, then there would be no God. But now therefore there is an Eternall minde, which generateth the Eternall will, and the Eternall will generateth the Eternall heart of God, and the heart generateth the light, and the light the vertue, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the Spirit, and this is the Almighty God which is one unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will. For if the minde did no more generate the will, then the will would alſo not generate the heart, and all would be a nothing. But ſeeing now that the minde thus generateth the will, and the will the heart, and the heart the light, and the light the vertue, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the Spirit, therefore now the Spirit againe generateth the minde: for it hath the vertue, and the vertue is the heart: and it is an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble Band.</p>

               <p n="38">38. BEhold now, the minde is in the Darkneſſe, and it conceiveth its will to the light, to generate it: or elſe there would be no will, nor yet any <hi rend="sup">ſ</hi>

               <p n="39">39. Now behold deare ſoule, that is the Deity, and that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth in it the ſecond or the middlemoſt Principle. Therefore God is onely Good, the love, the light, the vertue [or power]. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if the minde did not ſtand in the darkneſſe, there would no ſuch eternall wiſdome and skill be: for the anguiſh in the will to generate, ſtandeth therein: and the anguiſh is the quality: and the quality is the <note n="t" place="margin">Plurality.</note> multiplicity [or variety] and maketh the minde, and the minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine maketh the multiplicity [or plurality].</p>
               <p n="40">40. Now deare ſoule, ſee all over round about you, in your ſelfe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57651:49"/>
and in all things, what finde you therein? you finde nothing elſe but the anguiſh, and in the anguiſh the quality, and in the quality the minde, and in the minde the will to grow and generate, and in the will the vertue [or <note n="u" place="margin">Faculty or ability.</note> power], and in the vertue the light, and in the light its forth-driving Spirit: which maketh againe a will to generate a twig [bud or branch] out of the Tree like it ſelfe; and this I call in my Booke the <hi>Centrum</hi> [the Centre] where the generated will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh an Eſſence [or ſubſtance] and generateth now againe ſuch [another] Eſſence: for thus is the Mother of the Genetrix.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Now the anguiſh hath the firſt Principle <note n="x" place="margin">Under its power.</note> in poſſeſſion; ſeeing it ſtandeth in the Darkneſſe, it is another eſſence, than the eſſence in the light is, where there is nothing elſe but meere love and meekneſſe, where no ſource [or torment] is diſcovered, and the quality which is generated in the Centre of the Light, is now no quality, but the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſkill and wiſdome, of whatſoever was in the anguiſh before the Light [brake forth]: this wiſdome and ſkill, now alwaies cometh to helpe the conceived will in the anguiſh, and maketh in it ſelfe againe the Centre to the Birth, that ſo the ſprout may generate it ſelfe in the quality, <hi>viz.</hi> the vertue, and out of the vertue the fire, and out of the fire the Spirit, and the Spirit maketh in the fire the vertue againe, that thus there [may] be an Indiſſoluble Band: and out of this minde, which ſtandeth in the darkneſſe, God generated the Angels, which are flames of fire, yet <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>throughly enlightened.</hi>
                  </note> ſhining through and through with the divine light: for in this minde a Spirit can and may be generated, and not elſe: for before it in the heart and light of God, there can no Spirit be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, for the heart of God is the end of Nature, and it hath no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: therefore alſo nothing cometh out of it more, but it continueth unchangeably in the Eternity, and it ſhineth in the minde of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the darkneſſe, and the darkneſſe cannot comprehend it.</p>
               <p n="42">42. Now therefore in the anguiſhing minde of the darkneſſe, is the inexpreſſible [or unutterable] ſource [quall, or riſing property] from whence the name quality, exiſteth, as from many qualls [or ſources, or Wells] into one quall [or ſource] and out of theſe many ſources [running] into one ſource, ſpringeth forth the plurality of skill, ſo that there is a multiplicity, [or variety of it]: and the Spirit of God out of the light, cometh to helpe every skill, [or ſcience, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge], and in every skill of the ſources [or quals] in the quality (by its kinde <note n="z" place="margin">Infuſion.</note> infecting of the love) it maketh againe a centre and in the centre a ſource [or quall, or ſpring] is generated againe, as a twig out of a Tree, where againe there ſpringeth forth a minde in the anguiſh: and the Spirit of Love with its infecting [or infuſing] of kindneſſe maketh all, every thought in the will, and [that] eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.</p>
               <p n="43">43. For the will in the Centre climeth aloft till it generateth the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57651:50"/>
fire, and in the fire is the ſubſtance and eſſentiality generated: for it is the ſpirit thereof, and the end of the will in the dark minde, and there can be nothing higher generated in the anguiſh than the fire, for it is the end of nature, and it generateth againe the anguiſh and the ſource, as may be perceived. Now therefore the dark anguiſhing [aking or anxious] minde hath not onely one ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> one being [or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence] in it ſelfe, but many; or elſe no quality could be generated, and yet it is truely but one [being, eſſence, or] ſubſtance, and nor many.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Thou deare ſoule, thus ſaith the high Spirit to thee; yeeld up thy minde here, and I will ſhew it thee. Behold, what doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend thy will, or wherein conſiſteth thy life? If thou ſayeſt, in water and fleſh: No, it conſiſteth in the fire, in the warmth: if the warmth were not, then thy body would be ſtiff [with cold], and the water would dry away; therefore the minde and the life conſiſteth in the fire.</p>
               <p n="45">45. But what is the fire? Firſt, there is the Darkneſſe, the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the eternall cold, and the Drineſſe, where there is nothing elſe but an eternall hunger. Then how cometh the fire to be? Deare ſoule; here [in the fires coming to be] the Spirit of God <hi>(viz.</hi> the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Light) cometh to helpe the hunger; for the hunger exiſteth alſo from the Light: becauſe the divine vertue beholdeth it ſelfe in the darkneſſe, therefore the darkneſſe is deſirous [and longing] after the Light: and the deſirouſneſſe is the will.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Now the will or the deſirouſneſſe in the drineſſe cannot <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>attaine.</hi>
                  </note> reach the Light: and therein conſiſteth the anguiſh in the will [longing] after the Light; and the anguiſh is attractive, and in the attracting is the woe, and the woe maketh the anguiſh greater; ſo that the anguiſh in the <note n="b" place="margin">Soureneſſe, or aſtringency.</note> harſhneſſe attracteth much more, and this attracting in the woe, is the bitter [ſting or] prickle, or the bitternes of the woe: and the anguiſh reacheth after the [ſting or] prickle, with attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet cannot <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>catch it.</hi>
                  </note> comprehend it, becauſe it reſiſteth, and the more the anguiſh attracteth, the more the [ſting or] prickle raveth and rageth.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Now therefore the anguiſh, bitterneſſe, and woe in the [ſting or] prickle, are like a brimſtone ſpirit, and all ſpirits in Nature are Brimſtone: they [torment or] cauſe the anguiſh in one another, till that the light of God cometh to help them; and then there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be a flaſh, and there is its end, for it can clime no higher in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this is the fire, which becometh ſhining in the flaſh, in the ſoule, and alſo in the minde. For the ſoule reacheth the vertue of the light, which doth put it into meekneſſe; and in this world it is the burning fire: in Hell it is immateriall, and there it is the Eternall fire, which burneth in the <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>property.</hi>

Here Lucifer was very <note n="e" place="margin">Careleſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate.</note> heedleſſe, and became ſo very proud: that when this Brimſtone Spirit in the will of the minde of God was created, then he would faine have fline out above the end of nature, and would drive the fire out above the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he would faine have had all burne in the fire, he would have ruled [or domineered]: the ſparks of fire in the Brimſtone Spirit, did elevate themſelves too high: and theſe Spirits pleaſed not the Creator, or the Spirit in the Fiat, and [therefore] were not [eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed] Angels, although in the firſt minde (when the Centre was opened to the [creation of the] Spirits) he came to helpe them, and [<note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>reflected on them.</hi>
                  </note> beheld] them as well as the other Angels: but they indeed generated a fiery will, when they ſhould have opened their Centre to the regeneration of their mindes, and ſo ſhould have generated an Angelicall will.</p>
               <p n="49">49. The firſt will, out of which they were created, that was Gods, and that made them good, and the ſecond will, which they (as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient [children]) ſhould have generated out of their Centre in meekneſſe, that was evill: and therefore the <note n="g" place="margin">The Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for the will which he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</note> Father for generating ſuch a childe, was thruſt out from the vertue of God, and ſo he ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Angelicall kingdome, and remained in the ſource of the fire: and becauſe the <note n="h" place="margin">The will that was borne out of their minde.</note> evill childe of their minde did turne away from the meekneſſe, therefore they <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>came to be</hi>
                  </note> attained what they deſired. For the minde is the God and the Creator of the will, that is free from the Eternall Nature, and therefore what it generateth to its ſelfe, that it hath.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Now if you aske; Wherefore came not the Love of God to helpe them againe? No, friend, their minde had elevated it ſelfe, even to the end of Nature, and it would faine have gone out above the Light of God: their minde was become a kindled ſource of fire in the fierce wrath, the meekneſſe of God cannot enter into it, the Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone Spirit burneth eternally: in this manner he is an enemy to God, he cannot be helped: for the Centre is burning in the flaſh: his will is ſtill, that he would faine goe out above the meekneſſe of God; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he get [frame, or create] any other [will], for his ſource hath revealed the end of Nature in the fire, and he remaineth an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable ſource of fire: the heart of God in the meekneſſe, and the Principle of God, is cloſe ſhut up from him, and that even to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
               <p n="51">51. To Conclude, God will have no fiery Spirit in Paradiſe, they muſt remaine in the firſt Principle, in the Eternall Darkneſſe, if they had continued as God had created them (when the meekneſſe ſhined [or appeared] to them) and had put the Centre of their mindes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meekneſſe, then the light of God ſhould for ever have <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>throughly enlightened them.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of all Circumſtances of the Temptation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. NOw the Higheſt Queſtion is, What that is, which cauſed the minde of the Devill, ſo to elevate it ſelfe, and that ſo great a number of them are fallen in the high mindedneſſe [or pride]? Behold, when God ſet the Fiat in the will, and would create Angels, then the Spirit firſt ſeparated all qualities, after that manner, as now you ſee there are many kinds of Starres, and ſo the Fiat created them [ſeverall]: Then there were created the Princely [Angels] and the Throne-Angels, according to every Quality, (as, hard, ſoure, bitter, cold, fierce, ſoft, and ſo forth <note n="m" place="margin">In the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſſentiall powers.</note> in the Eſſences, till to the end of Nature) out of the ſource of the fire, a ſimilitude whereof you have in the Starres, how different they are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now the Thrones and Princely Angels, are every one of them a great fountaine: as you may perceive the Sunne is, in reſpect of the Starres, as alſo in the bloſſoming Earth. The great fountaine veine [or Well-ſpring] in the ſource, was in the time of the Fiat in the dark minde, the Prince or Throne-Angel: There out of each foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine came forth againe a Centre in many thouſand thouſands; for the Spirit in the Fiat manifeſted it ſelfe in the nature of the Darkneſſe, after the manner of the Eternall Wiſdome: Thus the manifold vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous properties that were in the whole nature, went forth out of one onely Fountaine, according to the ability of the eternall wiſdome of God; or as I may beſt render it to be underſtood by a ſimilitude; as if one Princely Angel had generated out of himſelfe, at one time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Angels: whereas yet the Prince doth not generate them, but the Eſſences: and the qualities goe forth with the Centre in every Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, from the Princely Angels, and the Spirit created them <note n="n" place="margin">By.</note> with the Fiat, and they continue ſtanding eſſentially: Therefore every <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>Company.</hi>
               </note> Hoſt (which proceeded out of one [and the ſame] fountaine) gat a will in the ſame fountaine which was their Prince (as you ſee, how the Starres give all their will into the vertue [or power] of the Sun)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57651:51"/>
of this, much muſt not be ſaid to my <note n="p" place="margin">The learned in Reaſon.</note> Maſter in Arts, he holdeth it impoſſible to know ſuch things, and yet in God all things are poſſible, and to him a thouſand yeares are as one day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now of theſe Princely Angels One is fallen (for he ſtood in the fourth forme of the Matrix of the Genetrix in the dark minde, in that place in the minde where the flaſh of fire taketh its originall) with his whole hoſt that was proceeded from him: Thus the fiery kinde [con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or property] moved him to goe above the end of Nature, <hi>(viz.</hi> above the heart of God) that kinde ſtood ſo <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>fiercely.</hi>
               </note> hard kindled in him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For as God ſaid to the Matrix of the Earth, Let there come forth all kinds of Beaſts: and the Fiat created Beaſts out of all the Eſſences: and firſt divided the Matrix, and after that, the eſſences and qualities; and then he created them out of the divided Matrix, male and female. But becauſe the creatures were materiall, therefore every kinde [ſpecies or generation] muſt thus propagate it ſelfe from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eſſence: but with the Angels not ſo: but [their propagation was] ſudden and ſwift, as Gods thoughts are, ſo were they.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But this is the Ground: every quality or quall [or ſource, would be creaturely, and the fiery [property] elevated it ſelfe too mightily, into which Lucifer had brought <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſet his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it.</hi>
               </note> his will; and ſo it went with <hi>Adam</hi> as to the Tempting Tree; as it is written: And God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all ſorts of Trees to ſpring up in the Garden of <hi>Eden:</hi> and in the midſt of the Garden, the Tree of Life, and of the knowledge of Good and Evill.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith: God ſuffered to ſpring up out of the Earth, all ſorts of Trees pleaſant to look upon, and good for food. But here is the vaile in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet in the Word it is bright, cleere, and manifeſt, that the fruits were pleaſant to behold, and good to eate, wherein there was no death, wrath, or <note n="s" place="margin">Corruption.</note> corruptibility, but [it was] Paradifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call fruit, of which <hi>Adam</hi> could live in clarity [or brightneſſe] in the will of God, and in his love in perfection in Eternity, onely the Death ſtuck in the Tree of knowledge of good aod evill, that onely was able to bring man into another Image.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Now wee muſt needs cleerely [conceive or] think, that the Paradiſicall fruit which was Good, was not ſo very earthly, for (as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> himſelfe ſaith;) they were of two ſorts; the one good to eate, and pleaſant to behold, and the other had the death and corruptibility in it: in the Paradiſicall fruit, there was no death nor corruptibility: for if there had been any death or corruptibility therein, then <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten death in all the fruits: but ſeeing there was no death there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, therefore the fruit could not be ſo altogether earthly; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it ſprung out of the earth, yet the divine vertue of the ſecond Principle was imprinted therein, and yet they were truly in the third
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57651:52"/>
Principle, growne [or ſprung] out of the earth, which God curſed as to the earthly food, that no Paradiſicall fruit did grow any more out of the earth.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Beſides, if <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten earthly fruit, he muſt then have eaten it into his body, and have had gut [or entrailes]: and how could ſuch a ſtinck [and dung] (as wee now carry in the body) have been in Paradiſe in the holineſſe of God? Moreover, he ſhould by eating earthly food, have eaten of the fruit of the Starres and Elements, which would preſently have infected [or qualified] in him, as was done in the fall: alſo ſo his feare over all the beaſts would have cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For the eſſences of the Beaſts would preſently have been like the humane eſſences in vertue [and power]; and <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would have domineered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
               </note> one would have domineered more ſtrongly over the other.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Therefore it was cleane otherwiſe with <hi>Adam:</hi> he was a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradiſicall Man, he ſhould have eaten of the heavenly Paradiſicall fruit, and in the vertue [or power] of that [fruit] he ſhould have ruled over all Beaſts [or living creatures] alſo over the Starres and Elements: no cold nor heat ſhould have touched him; or elſe God would not have created him ſo naked, but like all Beaſts with a rough [or hairy] skin [or hide].</p>
            <p n="10">10. But the Queſtion is; Wherefore grew the earthly Tree of the knowledge of good and evill? for if that had not been, <hi>Adam</hi> had not eaten of it; or wherefore muſt <hi>Adam</hi> be Tempted? Hearken, Aske your minde about it, wherefore it ſo ſuddenly generateth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth in it ſelfe a thought of anger, and then of love? Doeſt thou ſay [it cometh] from the hearing and ſeeing of a thing? Yes that is true, this God alſo knew very well; and therefore he muſt be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For the Centre of the minde is free, and it generateth the will, from hearing and ſeeing, out of which the imagination and luſt doth ariſe.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Seeing <hi>Adam</hi> was created an image and whole ſimilitude of God, and had all three Principles in him like God himſelfe, therefore alſo his minde and imagination ſhould meerly have looked into the heart of God, and ſhould have ſet his luſt and [deſire or] will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and as he was a Lord over all, and that his minde was a threefold Spirit, in three Principles, in one onely Eſſence, ſo his Spirit alſo, and the will in the Spirit, ſhould have ſtood open [or free] in one onely Eſſence, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Paradiſiciall heavenly [eſſence]: and his minde and ſoule ſhould have eaten of the heart of God, and his body [ſhould have eaten] of the heavenly <hi>Limbus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. But ſeeing the heavenly <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>vertue, or power.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Limbus</hi> was manifeſted through the earthly, and was in the fruit in one onely Eſſence; and <hi>Adam</hi> ſo too, therefore it behoved <hi>Adam</hi> (having received a living ſoule out of the firſt Principle, and breathed in from the Holy Ghoſt, and enlightened
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57651:52"/>
from the light of God ſtanding in the ſecond Principle) not to reach after the earthly Matrix.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Therefore God here alſo gave him the Command, not to luſt after the earthly Matrix, nor after her fruit, which ſtood in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility, and tranſitorineſſe, but the Spirit of Man <note n="x" place="margin">Not in the corruptibility.</note> not. He ſhould eate of the fruit, but no otherwiſe than of the Paradiſicall kinde and property; [and] not of the earthly Eſſences. For the Paradiſicall Eſſences had imprinted themſelves in all fruits, therein they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good to eate of, after an Angelical manner, and alſo pleaſant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or corporeall, as <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo ſaith.</p>
            <p>Now it may be asked, What then was properly the Tempting in <hi>Adam?</hi>

               <head>The Gate of Good and Evill.</head>
               <p n="14">14. Wee have a very powerfull teſtimony hereof, and it is knowne in Nature, and in all her children, in the Starres and Elements, in the Earth, Stones, and Metalls; eſpecially in the living creatures, as you ſee, how they are evill and good, <hi>viz.</hi> lovely creatures, and alſo veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous evill beaſts; as Toads, Adders, and Serpents, [or Wormes]: ſo alſo there is poyſon and malice in every ſort of <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>living thing.</hi>

               <head>The Depth in the Centre.</head>
               <p n="15">15. As is mentioned before, the eternall minde ſtandeth thus <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>unknown:</hi>
                  </note> in the Darkneſſe, and vexeth it ſelfe, and longeth after the light, to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate that, and the anguiſh is the ſource, and the ſource hath in it many formes, till that it reacheth the fire in its ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> [it hath] bitter, ſoure, hard, cold, ſtrong, darting forth, or flaſhing, in the roote of it ſelfe ſticketh the joy and paine alike; <hi>viz.</hi> when it cometh to the roote of the fire, and can reach the light, then out of the wrath [or ſternneſſe] cometh the great joy: for the light putteth the ſterne forme into great meekneſſe: on the contrary, that forme which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely to the roote of the fire, that continueth in the <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>grimneſſe, fierceneſſe.</hi>
                  </note> wrath.</p>
               <p n="16">16. As wee are to know, that when God would manifeſt the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Minde in the Darkneſſe, in the third Principle <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>by.</hi>
                  </note> with this world, then firſt all formes in the firſt Principle till fire, were manifeſted, and that forme now which comprehended the light, that became Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Paradiſicall; but that which comprehended not the light, that remained to be wrathfull, murtherous, ſoure and evill, every one in its own forme and eſſence: for every forme deſired alſo to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted; for it was the will of the Eternall Eſſence to manifeſt it ſelfe. But now one forme was not able to manifeſt it ſelfe alone in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57651:53"/>
Birth, for the one is the member of the other, and the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other would not be.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Therefore the Eternall Word, or heart of God, wrought thus in the dark and ſpirituall Matrix (which in it ſelfe, in the Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without the light would be [as it were] dumb [or ſenſleſſe]) and hath generated a corporeall and palpable [or comprehenſible] ſimilitude of its eſſence, in which all the formes were brought forth out of the Eternall formation, and brought into Eſſence: for out of the ſpirituall forme, the corporeall [forme] is generated, and the eternall Word hath created it by the Fiat, to ſtand thus.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Now then, out of theſe formes, out of the Matrix of the earth, by the Fiat, in the Word, went forth all the Creatures of this world: alſo Trees, hearbs, and graſſe, every one according to its kinde: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Wormes, evill and good, as every forme in the Matrix of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix had their originall; and thus it was alſo with the fruits in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of this world in the Garden of <hi>Eden:</hi> when the Word was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, let there come forth all ſorts of Trees and hearbs; then out of all formes [or the Genetrix or womb] Trees and hearbs came forth and grew, which were altogether good and pleaſant: for the word in the Fiat, had <note n="c" place="margin">Imaged or Imagined.</note> imprinted it ſelfe in all the formes.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But then the Darkneſſe and Quall [ſource or paine] were in the middeſt in the Centre, wherein Death, the wrathfulneſſe, decay, and the corruptibility did ſtick: and if that had not been, this world would have ſtood for ever, and <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not have been tempted: <note n="d" place="margin">The darkneſſe, and ſource, or paine.</note> they alſo like a <note n="e" place="margin">Mors.</note> Death, (or a corrupting worme of the Quall [or ſource]) did work together, and generated the Tree of Good and Evill in the midſt of its ſeate [or place] becauſe Death ſtuck in the midſt of the Centre, by which this world ſhall be kindled in the fire at the end of the dayes. And this Quall [or ſource] is even the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, which by the heart or light of God in the Eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is continually put into the meekneſſe: and therefore the Word or heart of God is called the Eternall Mercifulneſſe of the Father.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Seeing then all the formes of the Eternall Nature were to come forth, [it is ſo come to paſſe] as you may ſee in Toads, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Wormes, and evill Beaſts: for that is the forme which ſticketh in the midſt in the birth of all Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> the poyſon [venome] or Brimſtone Spirit; as wee ſee that all Creatures have poyſon and gall: and the life of the Creatures ſticketh in the power [or might] of it [the poyſon]: as you may finde before in this booke in all the Chapters, how the Eternall Nature taketh its Originall, how it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and how [or after what manner] its Eſſence [being or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance] is.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Now thus the Tree of the ſtrong [tartneſſe or wrath] (which is in the midſt of Nature) grew alſo in the midſt of the Garden of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57651:53"/>
and was (according to the ability of its own forme, which it hath from the eternall quality, in the Originalneſſe) the greateſt and the mightieſt [Tree]. And here it may be ſeene very cleerly, that God would have preſerved and had Man to be in Paradiſe, for he forbad him this Tree, and cauſed other fruit enough [beſides] to grow in the formes and Eſſences.</p>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>God foreſaw</hi> [or elected] <hi>Man, before the ground</hi> [or foundation] <hi>of the world was laid:</hi> Here we finde the ground ſo very [plaine or] faire, that wee have a delight to write on, and to ſeeke the <note n="f" place="margin">Wiſdome.</note> Pearle; for behold, in the eternall wiſdome of God, before the Creation of the world, the fall of the Devils, and alſo of Man, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Eternall Matrix, and was ſeene; for the Eternall Word in the Eternall Light knew very well, that if it came to manifeſt the fountaine of the Eternall Birth, that then every forme ſhould breake forth: yet it was not the will of the love in the word of the Light, that the formes of the tart [ſoure ſtrong wrath] ſhould elevate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above the meekneſſe; but it had ſuch a mighty [or potent] forme, that it is ſo come to paſſe.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Therefore the Devill alſo (in regard of the might of the tart [ſtrong fierce wrath] was called a Prince of this world in the [an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſtrong] fierceneſſe, of which you ſhall finde [more] about the Fall. And therefore God created but one Man: for God would that Man ſhould continue in Paradiſe, and live eternally: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the ſternneſſe [or ſtrong fierce wrath] would tempt him [to trie] whether he would put his imagination and will wholly into the heart of God, and into Paradiſe, wherein he was.</p>
               <p n="24">24. And becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was drawne forth out of the ſtrong [ſterne ſoure] Eſſences, therefore he muſt be tempted [to try] whether his Eſſences (out of which his imagination and luſt proceeded) could ſtand in the heavenly quality, or whether he would eate of the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Domini,</hi> [the Word of the Lord] and [to try] which eſſence, (whether the Paradiſicall, or the ſtrong [fierce wrathfull] would overcome in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. And this was the purpoſe of God, therefore to create but one Man, that the ſame might be tempted, [and tried] how he would ſtand, and that upon his Fall he might the better be helped: and the heart of God did before the foundation of the world in his love fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend [or prepurpoſe] to come to help [him]; and when no other remedy could doe it, the heart of God himſelfe would become Man, and regenerate Man againe.</p>
               <p n="26">26. For Man is not fallen of ſtrong [fierce angry] pride, like the Devill; but his earthly Eſſences have overcome his Paradiſicall Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

and brought them into the earthly luſt, and in that regard he hath Grace againe beſtowed upon him.</p>

               <p n="32">32. Now what oppoſed him, or what drew him from Paradiſe to diſobedience, ſo that he paſſed into another Image [forme or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion]? Behold thou childe of Man, there was a threefold ſtrife in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> without <hi>Adam,</hi> and in all whatſoever <hi>Adam</hi> beheld? Thou wilt ſay, What was it? It was the three Principles; firſt, the Kingdome of Hell, the power of the wrath; and ſecondly, the Kingdome of this world, with the Starres and Elements; and thirdly, the Kingdome of Paradiſe, that deſired to have him.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Now theſe three Kingdomes were in <hi>Adam,</hi> and alſo <note n="q" place="margin">Extra.</note> without him: and in the <note n="r" place="margin">The eſſentiall vertues or powers that went forth from the three Principles.</note> Eſſences there was a mighty ſtrife, all drew as well in <hi>Adam,</hi> as without <hi>Adam,</hi> and would faine have him: for he was a Great Lord [come] out of all the [powers or] vertues of Nature: the heart of God deſired to have him in Paradiſe, and [would] dwell in him; for it ſaid, it is my image and ſimilitude. And the Kingdome of wrath [and of the fierce Tartneſſe] would alſo have him: for it ſaid, he is mine, and he is [proceeded] out of my fountaine, out of the eternall minde of the Darkneſſe, I will be in him, and he ſhall live in my might, for he is generated out of [that which is] mine, I will, through him, ſhew great and ſtrong power. The Kingdome of this world ſaid, he is mine; for he beareth my Image, and he liveth in [that which is] mine, and I in him: he muſt be obedient to me, I will tame him and compell him, I have all my members in him, and he in mee: I am greater than he, he muſt be my <note n="s" place="margin">Or, <hi>Stewart.</hi>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57651:55"/>
and vertues, he ſhall keepe and manage my herds, I will cloath him with my faire Glory; as now it is to be ſeene.</p>
               <p n="34">34. But when the Kingdome of the fierceneſſe, of the wrath, of Death, and of Hell ſaw, that it had loſt; and could not keepe Man, then it ſaid, I am <note n="t" place="margin">Mors.</note> Death, and a Worme, and my vertue [or power] is in him, and I will grinde him and breake him to pieces, and his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit muſt live in mee: and although thou world ſuppoſeſt that he is thine, becauſe he beareth thy Image, yet his Spirit is mine, generated out of my kingdome; therefore take what is thine, from him, I will keep that which is mine.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Now that did the vertue in <hi>Adam,</hi> in this ſtrife? It flattered with all the three [Kingdomes]. It ſaid to the Heart of God, I will ſtay in Paradiſe, and thou ſhalt dwell in me: I will be thine, for thou art my Creator, and thou haſt thus concreted [or extracted] mee out of all the three Principles, and created mee: thy refreſhment is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and thou art my Bridegroom, I have received of thy fulneſſe, and therefore I am impregnated [or with childe], and I will bring forth a virgin, that my kingdome may be great: and that thou mayeſt have meere joy in mee: I will eate of thy fruit, and my ſpirit ſhall eate of thy vertue [or power]: and thy Name in mee ſhall be called <hi>IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANuEL,</hi> God with us.</p>
               <p n="36">36. And when the Spirit of this world perceived that; then is ſaid; Wherefore wilt thou onely eate of that which thou compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeſt not, and drinke of that which thou feeleſt not: thou art not yet meerely a Spirit, thou haſt from me all the kindes of comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility in thee: behold, the comprehenſible fruit is ſweet and good, and the comprehenſible drink is <note n="u" place="margin">Powerfull and full of vertue or ſtrength.</note> mighty and ſtrong, eate and drinke from mee, and ſo thou ſhalt come to have all my vertue and beauty, thou mayeſt in mee be mighty [and powerfull] over all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for the kingdome of this world ſhall be thy owne, and thou ſhalt be Lord upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And the vertue in <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid: I am upon Earth, and dwell in this world, and the world is mine, I will uſe it according to my luſt, [will, and pleaſure]: then came the Command of God <note n="g" place="margin">Encloſed, conceived, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</note> (which was received in the Centre of God, out of the Circle [or Circumference] of the Eternall life,) and ſaid: <hi>In the day that thou eateſt of the earthly fruit, thou ſhalt die the Death:</hi> This Command was comprehended or encloſed (and hath its originall in the Eternall Father) in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, where the Eternall Father continually from Eternity generateth his heart or ſonne.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Now when the Worme of darkneſſe ſaw the command of God, it thought with it ſelfe, here thou wilt <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe.</hi>
                  </note> not prevaile, thou art ſpirit without body, and contrariwiſe, <hi>Adam</hi> is corporeall, thou haſt but a third part in him, and beſides, the Command is in the way, thou wilt

Here now the Legat [or Embaſſadour] the Devill was very willing [and ready] at this, eſpecially becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, was in his place, where he ſhould have been; and thought with himſelfe, now thou haſt an opportunity to be revenged: thou wilt mingle lyes and truth ſo together, that <hi>Adam</hi> may not [obſerve or] underſtand it [the treachery], and ſo thou wilt tempt him.</p>

But this Tree ſtanding thus in the Garden, and of all the Trees that onely did beare earthly fruit; therefore <hi>Adam</hi> looked ſo often upon it, becauſe he knew that it was the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evill, and the vertue of the Tree preſſed him to it ſo very hard (which vertue was alſo in him) that the one luſt infected [poyſoned or mingled with] the other: and the Spirit of the great world preſſed <hi>Adam</hi> ſo very hard, that he became infected, and his vertue [or power] was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; here the Paradiſicall man was undone, and then ſaid the heart of God, it is not good, that man [ſhould] be alone, wee will make him a help, [or conſort] to be with him.</p>

                  </note> burning Buſh, he ſaid, <hi>Pull off thy ſhooes; for here is a holy place:</hi> What was that? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: God ſhewed <hi>[Moſes]</hi> thereby his earthly Birth: For he would give him a Law, wherein Man ſhould live, (if it were poſſible) and attaine ſalvation: But who was it that gave the Law, and commanded Man to live therein? Anſwer. It was God the Father, out of his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and therefore it was done with fire and thunder: for there is no fire and thunder in the heart of God, but kinde love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hereupon Reaſon will ſay, is not God the Father one [and the ſame] Eſſence with the Sonne? Anſwer. Yes, [they are] one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and will. By what meanes then did he give the Law? Anſwer. By the Spirit of the great world: becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> after the Fall, and all men, lived <note n="f" place="margin">In the Spirit of the great world.</note> therein, therefore it muſt be tried, whether man could live <note n="g" place="margin">In the Law.</note> therein, in confidence towards God: therefore he eſtabliſhed it with great wonders [or miracles], and gave <note n="h" place="margin">The Law.</note> it clarity] ſhining brightneſſe or glory]: as may be ſeene in <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had a [glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bright] ſhining face: and when he had choſen to himſelfe this people, he deſtroyed the children of unbeliefe: and brought <note n="i" place="margin">His choſen.</note> them
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57651:56"/>
out with wonders, into the Wilderneſſe: and there it was tried whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men could live in perfect obedience under this clarity [Glory or brightneſſe].</p>
               <p n="5">5. What was done there? Anſwer. <hi>Moſes</hi> was called by God (out from [among] the children of <hi>Iſrael)</hi> up into Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſtayed there forty dayes: and then he would trie the people whether it were poſſible for them to put their truſt [or confidence] in God: that they might be fed with <note n="k" place="margin">Manna.</note> heavenly Bread: that ſo they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perfection. And there now ſtood the minde <hi>Majoris mundi,</hi> of the <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme.</hi>
                  </note> great world; and on the contrary, the eternall minde of God, in ſtrife one againſt another; God required obedience, and the minde of this world required [or deſired] the pleaſure of this tranſitory life, as, eating, drinking, playing, dancing: therefore they choſe them moreover their Belly-God, a Golden Calfe, that they might be free and live without Law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Here you ſee againe, how the three Principles ſtrove one againſt another about Man: The Law that was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> brake forth againe, and deſired to have obedience; in like manner alſo, the Spirit of ſtrong [fierceneſſe or] wrath brake forth againe in the falſe fruit and voluptuouſneſſe, and ſought the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life. And this ſtrife now laſted forty dayes, before they ſet up the Calfe, and fell [wholly like <hi>Adam]</hi> from God, ſo long the ſtrife of the three Principles continued.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But now when they were fallen away from God [as <hi>Adam</hi> was] then came <hi>Moſes</hi> with <hi>Joſuah,</hi> and ſaw the apoſtacie [or falling away], and brake the Tables in pieces, and led them in the Wilderneſſe: where they muſt all die except <hi>Joſua</hi> and <hi>Caleb:</hi> for the clarity [or brightneſſe] of the Father in the fire, in the firſt Principle, could not bring them into the promiſed Land: and although they did eate Manna, yet it did not helpe [in] the triall, onely <hi>Joſua</hi> and at length <hi>JESUS</hi> muſt doe it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And when the time came, that the true Champion, [or Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our] returned againe out of Paradiſe, and became the childe of the Virgin, then the ſtrife of the three Principles <note n="m" place="margin">Was renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> came againe. For there he was againe ſet before the tempting Tree, and he muſt endure the hard brunt before the tempting Tree, and ſtand out the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the three Principles, which was not poſſible for the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to doe. And there the ſtrife continued forty dayes and forty nights, juſt ſo long as the ſtrife with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe continued, and not an houre longer; and then the Champion [or Saviour] overcame; therefore open your eyes aright, and look upon the Scripture aright: although it be briefe and obſcure [to reaſon] yet it is very true.</p>
               <p n="9">9. You finde not in <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> was driven out of Paradiſe the firſt day: the temptation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of Chriſt, informeth us
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57651:57"/>
quite otherwiſe: for the temptation of Chriſt, is to a tittle (in all Circumſtances) the ſame with the temptation of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. For <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted forty dayes in Paradiſe, in the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> before the tempting Tree; [and tried] whether he could ſtand, whether he could ſet his inclination on the heart of God, and onely eate of the <hi>Verbum Domini</hi> [the Word of the Lord], and then [if he had ſtood] God would have given him his body (the heavenly <hi>Limbus)</hi> to eate, that he ſhould eate it in his mouth, not into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: he ſhould have brought forth the childe of the Virgin out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for he was neither Man nor Woman [male nor female]: he had the Matrix, and alſo the Man [or maſculine nature] in him, and ſhould have brought forth the Virgin full of modeſty and chaſtity out of the Matrix, without rending of his body.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And here is the ſtrife in the Revelation of <hi>John,</hi> where a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man brought forth a ſonne, which the Dragon and the <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>Serpent.</hi>
                  </note> Worme would devour: and there ſtood the Virgin upon the earthly Moone, and deſpiſeth the earthineſſe, and treadeth it under feet. And ſo ſhould <hi>Adam</hi> alſo have troden the earthineſſe underfoot, but it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him: therefore afterwards the childe of the Virgin (when it had overcome the tempting Tree) muſt alſo enter into the firſt death of the ſtrong [fierce] wrath, in the death, and overcome the firſt Principle.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For he ſtood forty dayes in the Temptation in the Wildernes, where there was no bread nor drink, then came the Tempter, and would have brought him from obedience: and ſaid, <hi>He ſhould out of the ſtones make Bread;</hi> which was nothing elſe, but that he ſhould leave the heavenly bread, (which man receiveth in Faith and in a ſtrong confidence in God) and put his imagination into the Spirit of this world, and live therein.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But when the childe of the virgin laid the heavenly bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſaid; Man liveth not onely <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>by, or of.</hi>
                  </note> from this world, <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>by, or of.</hi>
                  </note> from the earthly eating and drinking, then came the ſecond way [or kinde] of Temptation forth, <hi>viz.</hi> the might [power, dominion, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity] of this world; the Prince of the wrath [or ſtrong fierceneſſe] would give him all the power of the Starres and Elements, if he would put his imagination into him, and pray to [or worſhip] him: that was the right ſcourge [or whip] wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> was <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>driven on with.</hi>
                  </note> ſcourged <hi>[viz.]</hi> with the might, riches, and beauty of this world, after which at laſt <hi>Adam</hi> luſted, and was taken; But the childe of the Virgin laid before him, that the kingdome was not his <hi>[viz.]</hi> belonging to the Prince of the [fierce, ſtrong] wrath, but [it belonged] to the word and heart of God, he muſt worſhip God, and ſerve him onely.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The third Temptation was the ſame into which the Devill alſo was fallen <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>out of</hi>
                  </note> with high mindedneſſe [or pride], when he [Chriſt]
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57651:57"/>
was tempted to have fline from above from the pinnacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſhould have elevated himſelfe above humility and meekneſſe: for the meekneſſe maketh the angry Father, in the Originalneſſe, ſoft and joyfull, ſo that the Deity [thus] becometh a ſoft and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But Lord Lucifer would (in the Creation) have faine been above the meekneſſe of the heart of God, above the end of nature: therefore he would faine alſo have perſwaded the ſonne of the virgin to flie without wings, above the end of nature, in pride; of which ſhall be handled in its due place at large. I have brought this in thus, but in briefe, that my writing may be the better underſtood, and how it ſtands with [or upon] the ground, [or foundation] of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is not any new thing, neither ſhall there be any thing new [in them]; but onely the true knowledge, in the holy Ghoſt, of the Eſſence of all Eſſences.</p>

But the living Creatures, as, Men, Beaſts, and fowles, have the tincture in them, for in the beginning they were an Extraction [taken] from the quality of the Starres and Elements by the Fiat: and in the tincture [there] ſtandeth the continuall kindling fire, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually draweth the vertue or <hi>Oleum</hi> [the Oyle] out of the Water; from whence cometh the bloud, in which the noble life <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>is.</hi>

               <p n="22">22.

The Starres [or Conſtellations] and the Sun are the fire of the Tincture, and the Tincture is the fire of the body, and ſo all are ſeething: and therefore when the Sunne is underneath, ſo that its beames [or ſhining] is no more [upon a thing;] then the Tincture is weaker, for it hath no kindling from the vertue of the Sunne: and although the vertue of the Starres and the quality are kindled from the Sunne, yet all is too little, and ſo it becometh fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble [or as it were dead]: and when the Tincture is feeble, then the vertue in the bloud (which is the Tincture) is wholly weake and finketh into a ſweet reſt, as it were dead or overcome.</p>

Then the fourth forme in the Centre of the ſoule brake forth there where the ſpirit of the ſoule was created <hi>[viz.]</hi> between the fourth and the fifth forme in the Centre, <note n="c" place="margin">Next to</note> neere the heart of God: and ſo the fourth forme was in the glance in the darkneſſe; out of which the world was created, which in its forme parteth it ſelfe in its Centre into five parts, in its riſing till [it attaine] to the light of the Sunne. For the Starres alſo in their Centre are generated betwixt the fourth and the fifth forme, and the Sunne is the <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>fountain.</hi>
                  </note> ſpring of the fift forme in the Centre; as in the eternall Centre, the heart and light of God [is,] which hath no ground; but this [Centre,] of the Starres and Elements, hath its ground in the fourth forme in the dark minde, in the riſing up of the awakened [or kindled] flaſh of the fire.</p>
               <p n="51">51. Thus the ſoule is generated between both the Centres, between the Centre of God (underſtand [between the Centre] of the heart or light of God, where it is generated out of an eternall Place) and alſo between the [propagated or] out-ſprung Centre of this world: and it [the ſoule] hath its beginning from both, and qualifieth with both; and therefore thus it hath all three Principles, and can live in all three;</p>
               <p n="52">52. But it was the law and will of the virgin, that as God ruleth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all things, and <note n="e" place="margin">Mouldeth or Imageth.</note> imprinteth himſelfe every where, and giveth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57651:62"/>
and life to all, and yet the thing comprehendeth him not, although he be certainly there; ſo alſo ſhould the ſoule <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in true Reſignation.</hi>
                  </note> ſtand ſtill, and the forme of the virgin ſhould governe in the ſoule, and crowne it with the divine light, the ſoule ſhould be the comely young man which was created, and the vertue [or power] of God [ſhould be] the faire virgin: and the light of God [ſhould be] the faire [orient] Pearle and Crowne, wherewith the virgin would adorn the young man.</p>
               <p n="53">53. But the young man deſired to have the virgin to be his own, which could not be, becauſe ſhee was a degree higher in the birth than he: for the virgin was from Eternity, and the Bridegroom was given to her, that ſhee ſhould have joy and delight with him in God.</p>
               <p n="54">54. But now when the young man could not obtaine this of the virgin, then he reached back after the Worme in his own Centre. For the forme of this world preſſed very powerfully upon him, which alſo was in the ſoule, and [this forme] would faine have had the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be its own, that he might make her his <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>Woman.</hi>
                  </note> wife (as was done in the Fall: yet the wife was not from the Pearle, but out of the ſpirit of this world:) for it <hi>(viz.</hi> the nature of this world) continually groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth [or longeth] after the virgin; that it might be delivered from vanity: and it meaneth to qualifie [or mingle] with the virgin; but that cannot be, for the virgin is of a higher <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>deſcent.</hi>
                  </note> Birth.</p>
               <p n="55">55. And yet when this world ſhall breake in pieces, and be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the vanity of the Worm, it ſhall not obtaine the virgin; but <note n="i" place="margin">This world.</note> it muſt continue without ſpirit and <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſoule.</hi>
                  </note> Worme, under its own ſhadow, in a faire and ſweet reſt, without any wreſtling [ſtrugling] or deſiring: for thereby it cometh into its higheſt degree and beauty: and ceaſeth [or reſteth] eternally from its labour. For the Worme which here tormenteth it, goeth into its owne Principle, and no more toucheth the ſhadow nor the figure of this world to eternity, and then the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin governeth with her Bridegroom.</p>
               <p n="56">56. My beloved Reader, I will ſet it you downe more plainely: for every one hath not the <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>the light of the wiſdome.</hi>
                  </note> Pearle, to apprehend the virgin: and yet every one would faine know, how the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was. Behold, as I mentioned even now; the ſoule hath all the three Principles in it; <hi>viz.</hi> the moſt inward, [which is] the Worme or Brimſtone ſpirit, and the ſource according to which it is a Spirit: and then [it hath] the divine vertue, which maketh the Worme meeke, bright and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, according to which the Worm or Spirit, is an Angel, like God the Father himſelfe (underſtand, in ſuch a manner and birth:) and then alſo it hath the Principle of this world; wholly undivided in one another, and yet none [of the three Principles] comprehendeth the other, for they are three Principles, or three Births.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Behold, the Worme is the eternall, and in it ſelfe peculiarly [a Principle], the other two [Principles] are given to it, each by a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57651:62"/>
Birth: the one to the right, the other to the left. Now it is poſſible for it to looſe both the formes and Births that are given to it: for if it reach back into the ſtrong [or tart power or] might of the Fire, and become falſe to the virgin, then ſhee departeth from it, and [ſhee] continueth as a figure in the Centre, and then the doore of the <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Wiſdome of God.</hi>
                  </note> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is ſhut.</p>
               <p n="58">58. Now if thou wilt [turne] to the virgin againe; then thou muſt be borne anew through the Water in the Centre and [through] the Holy Ghoſt; and then thou ſhalt receive her againe with greater honour and joy: of which Chriſt ſaid: <hi>There will be more joy in heaven for one ſinner that repenteth, than for ninety and nine righteous, who need no repentance;</hi> ſo very gloriouſly is the poore ſinner received againe of the virgin, that <note n="n" place="margin">The conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoule.</note> it muſt no more be a ſhadow, but a living and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Creature, and [an] Angel of God. This joy none can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, onely a regenerate ſoule knoweth it: which the body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not: but it trembleth, and knoweth not what is done to it.</p>
               <p n="59">59. Theſe two formes, or Principles, the Worme looſeth at the departing of the body: although indeed it continueth in the figure, which yet is but of a Serpent, and it is a <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>gnawing.</hi>
                  </note> torment to it, that it was an Angel, and is now a horrible fierce poyſonous Worme and Spirit; of which the Scripture ſaith: <hi>That the Worme of the wicked dyeth not, and their plague</hi> [torment or ſource] <hi>continueth eternally.</hi> If the Worme had had no Angelicall and humane forme, then its ſource [torment or plague] would not have been ſo great: but that cauſeth it to have an eternall anxious deſire, and yet it can attaine nothing: it knoweth the ſhadow of the Glory [it had] and can never more live therein.</p>
               <p n="60">60. This therefore in briefe is the Ground of what can be ſpoken of the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the higheſt Depth. <hi>Adam</hi> hath loſt the <note n="p" place="margin">Divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by his luſt, and hath received the <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>Wife.</hi>
                  </note> Woman in his luſt, which is a <note n="r" place="margin">Subject to corruption and mingled with it.</note> Cagaſtriſh perſon, and the virgin waiteth ſtill continually for him, [to ſee] whether he will ſtep againe into the new Birth, and then ſhe will receive him againe with great Glory: therefore thou childe of man, conſider thy ſelfe; I write here what I certainly know, and he that hath ſeene it, witneſſeth it; or elſe I alſo ſhould not have knowne it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Can ſcarce write for griefe, but ſeeing it cannot be otherwiſe, therefore wee will for a while weare the Garment of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but yet live in the virgin: and although wee receive [or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57651:63"/>

                  <note place="margin">With fragility or with the earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</note> Woman till we ſend her to the Grave; and then ſhee ſhall be a ſhadow and a figure: and the virgin ſhall be our Bride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Crowne: ſhee will give us her <note n="u" place="margin">The divine brightneſſe.</note> Pearle and Crowne, and cloath us with her ornaments; for which wee will give the venter for the  Lillies ſake.

               <p n="2">2. Now when <hi>Adam</hi> was thus in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and the three Principles having produced ſuch a ſtrife in him; his Tincture was quite wearied, and the virgin departed. For the Luſt-Spirit in <hi>Adam</hi> had overcome, and therfore he ſunk down into a ſleep. The ſame houre his heavenly body became fleſh and bloud, and his ſtrong vertue [or power] became bones: and then the virgin went into her Ether and ſhadow, yet into the heavenly Ether, into the Principle of the vertue [or power,] and there waiteth upon all the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> [ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting] whether any will receive her for their Bride againe, by the <note n="x" place="margin">Regeneration.</note> New Birth.</p>
               <p>But what now was God to doe? He had created <hi>Adam</hi> out of his eternall will: and becauſe it could not now be, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate out of himſelfe the virgin in a Paradiſicall manner, therefore God put the Fiat of the great world into the midſt. For <hi>Adam</hi> was now falne <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>into the boſome of the Fiat.</hi>
                  </note> home againe to the Fiat as a halfe broken Perſon. Now therefore ſeeing he was halfe killed by his own luſt and imagination, that he might live, God muſt help him againe: and if he be now to generate a Kingdome, then there muſt be a Woman, as all other Beaſts [have a Female] for propagation: The Angelicall kingdome in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was gone: therefore now there muſt be <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>a propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </note> a kingdome of this world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then what was it that God now did with <hi>Adam? Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>When Adam ſlept, he took one of his ribs, and</hi> [made or] <hi>built a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of it, (viz.</hi> of the rib which he took from Man) <hi>and cloſed up the place with fleſh.</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> hath written very right: but who is it that can underſtand him here: If I did not know the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in his virgin like forme in Paradiſe; then I had been at a ſtand, and ſhould have known no other than that <hi>Adam</hi> had been made fleſh and bloud of a lump of Earth, and his wife <hi>Eve,</hi> of his rib and hard bones; which before the time [of my knowledge] hath oft ſeemed very ſtrange and wonderfull to my thoughts, when I have read the <note n="a" place="margin">Expoſitions, and Marginall notes.</note> Gloſſes upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> that ſo [high or] deep learned men ſhould write ſo of it: <note n="b" place="margin">Damaſcenus.</note> ſome of them will dare to tell of a Pit in the [Orient or] Eaſt Countrey, out of which <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be taken and made as a Potter maketh a veſſell or Pot.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:57651:63"/>
5. If I had not conſidered the Scripture, which plainly ſaith, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is borne of fleſh is fleſh;</hi> Alſo, <hi>Fleſh and bloud ſhall not inherit the kingdome of Heaven:</hi> Alſo, <hi>None goeth into Heaven but the ſon of Man, (viz.</hi> the pure virgin) <hi>which came from Heaven, and which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> which was very helpfull to mee [to think] that the childe of the virgin was the Angel, which hath reſtored againe all that which was loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> for God brought againe in the Woman (in her virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like body) the virgin childe, which <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould generate. And now if I had not conſidered the Text in <hi>Moſes,</hi> (where God ſaith, <hi>It is not good that man ſhould be alone, wee will make a helpe for him)</hi> I ſhould yet have ſtuck in the <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>in the earthly thoughts.</hi>
                  </note> will of the Woman.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But that Text ſaith; <hi>God looked upon all that he had made, and behold, it was all very good;</hi> Now if it were good in the Creation, then it muſt needs have become evill when God ſaid [afterward] <hi>it is not good for Man to be alone.</hi> If God would have had them like all beaſts to have a beaſtiall propagation, he would at one and the ſame inſtant [at firſt] have made a Man and a Woman. But that God did abominate [the beaſtiall propagation] it appeared plainly in the firſt childe of the Woman, <hi>Cain</hi> the murtherer of his brother, alſo the fruit [or the curſe] of the earth ſheweth it plainly enough. But what ſhall I ſpend the time for, with theſe teſtimonies? the proofe of it will cleerly follow? And it is to be proved, not onely in the Scripture (which yet maketh a cover [over it]) but in all things, if we would take time to doe it, and ſpend our labour about vaine and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now thus ſaith Reaſon: What are then the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Woman? to which I ſay; <hi>Moſes</hi> hath written right, but I (living thus <note n="d" place="margin">In the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe.</note> in the Woman) underſtand it not right. <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed had a brightened [or glorified face or] countenance, but he muſt hang a vaile before it, ſo that none could ſee his face. But when the ſonne of the virgin (<note n="e" place="margin">The Eternall wiſdome of the Father.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the virgin [wiſdome]) came, he looked him in the face, and did the vaile away.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Then Reaſon asketh: What was the rib [taken] out of <hi>Adam</hi> to be [made] a Woman? The Gate of the Depth. Behold, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſheweth us this, that when <hi>Adam</hi> was overcome, and the virgin paſſed into her Ether, then the Tincture (wherein the faire virgin had dwelt) became earthy, weary, feeble, and weake: for the powerfull roote of the Tincture, from whence it had its potency without any ſleepe or reſt <hi>(viz.</hi> the heavenly Matrix, which <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>is the foundation of.</hi>
                  </note> containeth Paradiſe and the Kingdome of Heaven) withdrew in <hi>Adam,</hi> and went into its <note n="g" place="margin">Aire or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle.</note> Ether.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Keader underſtand [and conſider] it aright: the Deity <hi>(viz.</hi> the faire virgin) is not <note n="h" place="margin">Broken.</note> deſtroyed and come to nothing: that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; onely ſhee is remaining in the divine Principle: and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57651:64"/>
or the ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi> is with its own proper Worme remaining in the third Principle of this world: But the virgin <hi>(viz.</hi> the divine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue [or power] ſtandeth in Heaven, and in Paradiſe, and beholdeth her ſelfe in the earthly quality of the ſoule, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <note n="i" place="margin">In the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not in the earthly part thereof.</note> Sunne, and not in the Moone (underſtand in the higheſt point of the Spirit of this world, where the Tincture is nobleſt and moſt cleare, from whence the minde of man doth exiſt).</p>
               <p n="10">10. And ſhee would faine returne againe into her place to her Bridegroome, if the earthly fleſh, with the earthly minde and ſenſes [or thoughts did not hinder or] were not in the way, for the virgin doth not goe into them, ſhee will not be bound [to or] in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Centre: ſhee finiſheth the whole time (while the Woman liveth in her ſtead) of her ſpeculation with longing and much calling, admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearty ſeeking: but [to] the regenerate ſhee appeareth in a high triumphing manner, in the Centre of the minde; [ſhee] alſo often diveth into the Tincture of the bloud of the heart, whereby the body, with the minde and ſenſes, come to tremble and triumph ſo highly, as if it were in Paradiſe, it alſo preſently getteth a Paradiſicall will.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And there the noble Graine of Muſtard-ſeed is ſowne, of which Chriſt ſaith; <hi>That it is at firſt ſmall, and afterwards groweth to be like a great Tree,</hi> ſo far [or ſo long] as the minde perſevereth in the will, but the noble virgin ſtayeth not continually: for her Birth is [of a] higher [deſcent]: and therefore ſhee dwelleth not in earthly veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; but ſhee ſometimes viſiteth her Bridegroom at a time when he is deſirous of her: although ſhee alwaies with obſervancy preventeth and calleth him, before he [calleth] her, which is onely underſtood in the Lilly, this the Spirit ſpeaketh in a high and worthy ſeriouſneſſe, therefore obſerve it ye children of God, the Angel of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell cometh in the valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> with a Golden Charter, which he ſelleth for Oyle without Money, whoſoever cometh ſhall have it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now when the Tincture was become thus earthy and feeble, by the overcoming of the Spirit of the great world, then it could not generate [in a] heavenly [manner], and was alſo poſſeſſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability: and then the Counſell of God ſtood there, and ſaid: Seeing he is become earthly, and is not able [to propagate] wee will make a help for him: and the Fiat ſtood in the Centre, and ſevered the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix from the <hi>Limbus:</hi> and the Fiat took a rib in the midſt of <hi>Adam</hi> out of his right ſide, and created a Woman out of it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But you muſt cleerly underſtand [or conceive]: that when the Fiat to the creating [of the woman] was in <hi>Adam,</hi> in his ſleepe, his body had not then ſuch hard grisſles and bones: O no: that came to paſſe firſt when Mother <hi>Eve</hi> did bite the Apple, and alſo gave to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> onely the infection and the earthly death, with the fainting and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57651:64"/>
mortall ſickneſſe ſtuck in them: the bones and ribs were yet ſtrength and vertue, from which the ribs ſhould come to be.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But you muſt highly and worthily underſtand [and conſider] how it was taken out [of his ſide]: not as a ſpirit, but wholly in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: thus it may be ſaid, that <hi>Adam</hi> did get a rent; and the Woman beareth <hi>Adams</hi> ſpirit fleſh and bones: yet there is ſome difference in the Spirit: for the Woman beareth the Matrix, and <hi>Adam</hi> the <hi>Lambus</hi> or Man: and they two are one fleſh, undivided in nature, for now they two together muſt generate one man againe, which one alone could doe before.</p>

Therefore <hi>Eve</hi> was for certaine created out of all <hi>Adams</hi> Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo <hi>Adam</hi> thereupon had a great Rent, and ſo likewiſe the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might come to her perfection to [be] the Image of God; and this againe ſheweth a great myſtery, wherehy the virgin very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly witneſſeth againe, that the ſonne of the virgin hath not onely ſuffered his ſide to be pierced through, and ſhed his bloud out of the hole of his ſide, but he hath alſo ſuffered his hands and feete to be ſtruck through, and a Crowne of thornes to be preſſed upon his head, ſo that the bloud guſhed out from thence; and in his body he endured to be whipped, ſo that his bloud run down all over. So very lowly hath the Sonne of the virgin debaſed himſelfe, to <note n="n" place="margin">To heale.</note> help the ſick and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Adam</hi> and his weak and imperfect <hi>Eve,</hi> to repaire them and bring them againe into the firſt Glory.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Therefore you muſt know for certain, that <hi>Eve</hi> was created out of all <hi>Adams</hi> Eſſences: but there were no more ribs nor members broken from <hi>Adam:</hi> which appeareth by the feebleneſſe and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Woman, and alſo by the Command of God, who ſaid: <hi>Thy will ſhall be in ſubjection under thy Man</hi> [or husband], <hi>and he ſhall be thy Lord</hi> [or Ruler]: becauſe the Man is whole and perfect, except a Rib, therefore the Woman is a help for him, and muſt help him to doe his work in humility and ſubjection: and the Man muſt know that ſhee is very weak, being out of his Eſſences: he muſt help her in her weakneſſe, and love her as his own Eſſences: in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Woman muſt put her Eſſences and will into [the Eſſences and will] of the Man, and be friendly towards her Man [or husband]: that the Man may take delight in his own Eſſences in the Woman: and that they two might be but one only will. For they are one fleſh, one bone, one heart, and generate children in one [onely] will, which are neither the Mans nor the Womans alone, but of both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if they were from one onely body. And therefore the ſevere commandement of God is ſet before the children, that they ſhould with earneſtneſſe and ſubjection honour their father and mother, upon paine of temporary and eternall puniſhment: <note n="o" place="margin">Note. <hi>The Author lived not ſo lang to performe his purpoſe upon the Book of</hi> Exodus.</note> of which I will write concerning the Tables of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

               <p n="21">21. The minde hath from the beginning of the world had ſo very

much to doe about this gate, and hath continually ſo ſearched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that I cannot reckon the weariſome heap of writers [about it]: but in the time of the Lilly this Gate ſhall flouriſh as a Bay-tree [or Lawrell tree]: for its branches will get ſap from the virgin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be greener than <note n="p" place="margin">

               <p n="22">22. Seeing then the myſtery preſenteth it ſelfe to us, therefore we will open the bloſſome of the Sprout: yet wee would not have our Labour given to the Wolves, Dogges, or Swine, which roote in our Garden of delight, like [wilde] Boares, but to thoſe that ſeek, that the ſick <hi>Adam</hi> may be comforted.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Now if wee will ſearch after the Tincture, what it is in its higheſt degree: wee ſhall finde the <note n="q" place="margin">Spiritum.</note> Spirit: for wee cannot ſay, that the fire is the Tincture, nor the aire neither; For the fire is wholly contrary to the Tincture: and the aire doth ſtifle it: it is a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </note> refreſhment: its roote out of which it is generated, is indeed the fire: but if I may rightly mention the ſeate where it ſitteth, I cannot ſay otherwiſe but that it is between the three Principles <hi>(viz.</hi> [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween] the Kingdome of God, the Kingdome of Hell, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world) in the midſt, and [it] hath none [of the three] for its own, and yet it is generated from all three: and it hath as it were a ſeverall Principle, which yet is no Principle, but a bright plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant habitation: neither is it ſelfe the Spirit, but the Spirit dwelleth in it, and it ſo reneweth the Spirit, that <note n="ſ" place="margin">The Spirit.</note> it becometh cleere and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: its true name is wonderfull, and none can name [that Name] but he to whom it is given, he nameth it onely in himſelfe, and not without [or outwardly], it hath no place of its reſt in the ſubſtance, and yet reſteth continually in it ſelfe, and giveth vertue and beauty to all things, as the <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>Sunſhine.</hi>
                  </note> Glance of the Sunne giveth light, vertue, and beauty to all things in this world, and it is not the thing it ſelfe, though indeed it worketh in the thing, and maketh the thing grow and bloſſome; and yet it is found really [to be] in all things, and it is the life and heart of all things, but it is not the Spirit which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated out of the Eſſences.</p>
               <p n="24">24. The Tincture is the pleaſant ſweetneſſe and ſoftneſſe in a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant hearb and flower, and the Spirit thereof is bitter and harſh, and if the Tincture were not, the hearb would get neither bloſſom nor ſmell: it giveth to all Eſſences vertue to grow. It is alſo in metalls and ſtones: it maketh that the Silver and Gold doe grow, and without it [the Tincture] there is nothing in this world could grow: among all the children in Nature, it [onely] is a virgin, and hath never ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated any thing out of it ſelfe; neither can it generate, and yet it maketh that all things impregnate: it is the moſt hidden thing and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57651:66"/>
alſo the moſt manifeſt, it is a <note n="u" place="margin">Amica Dei. <hi>Friendeſſe, or ſhee-friend of God.</hi>
                  </note> friend of God, and a play fellow of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: it ſuffereth it ſelfe to be deteined by nothing: and yet it is in all things; but if any thing be done to it againſt the right of Nature, then it flyeth [away] and that very eaſily: it ſtandeth not faſt, and yet it continueth immovable: it continueth in no kinde of decaying of any thing; all the while that it ſtandeth in the roote of Nature, not altered nor deſtroyed, ſo long it continueth: it layeth no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon any thing, but it eaſeth the burthen in all things: it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that all things rejoyce, and yet it generateth no <note n="x" place="margin">Laughter, or out-cry.</note> ſhouting noyſe; but the voyce cometh out of the Eſſences and becometh loud in the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The way to it is very neere, whoſoever findeth that [way] dareth not to reveale it, neither can he, for there is no language that can expreſſe it: and although any ſeek long after <note n="y" place="margin">The Tincture.</note> it, if the Tincture will not, he cannot finde it; nevertheleſſe, it meeteth them that ſeek after it aright, in its own way [or manner] as its nature is, with a virgin-like minde, not being [prone] to covetouſneſſe and [wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe or] voluptuouſneſſe; it ſuffereth it ſelfe to be imprinted [repreſented or imagined] in a thing (where it was not before) by <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>Belieſe.</hi>
                  </note> Faith, if it be right in a virgin-like manner: it is powerfull, and yet doth nothing: when it goeth out of a thing, it cometh not into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but it ſtayeth in its <note n="a" place="margin">Aire, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle.</note> Ether, it never breaketh [or corrupteth] more, and yet doth grow.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Now you will ſay, this muſt be God! No it is not God, but it is Gods <note n="b" place="margin">Shee-friend.</note> friend. Chriſt ſaid; <hi>My Father worketh, and I work alſo;</hi> but it worketh not: it is in a thing imperceptably, and yet it may well be overpowred and uſed; eſpecially in Metalls, there it can (if it ſelfe be pure) make pure Gold of Iron, and of Copper: it can make a little grow to be a great deale, and yet it puts forth nothing. Its way is as ſubtile as the thoughts of a Man, and the thoughts do even ariſe from thence.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And therefore when a man ſleepeth, ſo that the Tincture reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, then there are no thoughts in the ſpirit: but the Conſtellation rumbleth in the Elements, and beateth into the braines, what ſhall (through their operation) come to paſſe, which yet is often broken againe by another <note n="c" place="margin">Aſpect of the Planets.</note> Conjunction, ſo that it cometh not to effect: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it can ſhew nothing exactly, except it come by a Conjunction of Planets and fixed Starres, and that onely goeth forward, but it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth all [in an] earthly [manner] according to the ſpirit of this world, ſo that where the <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſtarry Spirit.</hi>
                  </note> Sydereall Spirit ſhould ſpeake of Men, it often ſpeaketh of Beaſts, and continually repreſents the contrary; as the earthly ſpirit fancieth from the ſtarry ſpirit, ſo he dreameth.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Seeing now wee have ſpoken of the Tincture, as of the houſe of the ſoule, ſo wee will ſpeake alſo of the ſoule, what it is, and how it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57651:66"/>
can be propagated, wherein wee can the better bring the Tincture to <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</hi>
                  </note> light. The ſoule is not ſo ſubtile as the Tincture; but it is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and hath great might [or ability]: It can by the Tincture (if it ride upon the virgins <note n="f" place="margin">That is, upon true reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Bride Chariot in the Tincture) turne moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines upſide down; as Chriſt ſaid; which is done in the pure Faith, in the place where the Tincture is Maſter, which doth it, and the ſoule giveth the thruſt, whereas yet no power can be diſcerned. Even as the Earth <note n="g" place="margin">Schwebet.</note> moveth upon the heavenly Tincture, whereas there is not more than one onely Tincture in the Heaven, and in this world, yet [it is] of many ſorts, according to the Eſſence of every thing: in the beaſts it is not as in men, alſo not in fiſhes as in beaſts; alſo in ſtones and gemmes otherwiſe; alſo otherwiſe in Angels and in the ſpirit of this world.</p>
               <p n="29">29. But in God, Angels, and in virgin-like ſoules (underſtand pure ſoules) it is alike; where yet it is onely <note n="h" place="margin">On Gods ſide.</note> for God. The Devill hath alſo a Tincture, but a falſe one (and it ſtandeth not in the fire) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he can gripe that man in the heart, that letteth him in, as a [ſlie ſoothing] flattering falſe Theefe, that inſinuateth himſelfe, deſiring to ſteale, concerning whom Chriſt warneth us, that wee ſhould watch.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And now if wee will ſpeake of the ſoule, and of its ſubſtance and Eſſences, wee muſt ſay that it is the <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>Crudeſt, mos, indigeſt, or raw.</hi>
                  </note> rougheſt [thing] in man; for it is the originality of the other ſubſtances [or things]: it is fiery, harſh, bitter, and ſtrong, and it reſembleth a great [and] mighty Power, its Eſſences are like Brimſtone: its gate or ſeate out of the Eternall Originality is between the fourth and the fifth forme in the Eternall Birth, and in the <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Band.</hi>
                  </note> not beginning Band, of the ſtrong might of God the Father, where the eternall light of his heart (which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſecond Principle) generateth it ſelfe, and if <note n="l" place="margin">The ſoule.</note> it wholly looſe the beſtowed virgin of the divine vertue [or power] (out of which the light of God generateth it ſelfe, which is given to the ſoule to be its Pearle, as is mentioned above), then it becometh and is a Devill, like all other [Devils] in Eſſences, forme, and in <note n="m" place="margin">Active pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</note> quality alſo.</p>
               <p n="31">31. But if it put its will <note n="n" place="margin">Into true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation.</note> forward into meekneſſe <hi>(viz.</hi> into the obedience of God, then it is in the ſource [or of the quality and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty] of the heart of God, and receiveth divine vertue, and then all its rough Eſſences become Angelicall and joyfull; and then its rough Eſſences are very ſerviceable to it, and are better and more profitable to it, than that it were altogether ſweet in the Originality; in which [being ſweet] there would be no ſtrength, nor ſuch mighty power as in the harſh, bitter, and fiery [Eſſences].</p>
               <p n="32">32. For the fire in the Eſſence cometh to be a <note n="o" place="margin">Pleaſant or delightfull.</note> ſoft meeke light, and is nothing elſe but a zealous [or eagar] kindling of the Tincture, and the harſh eſſence cauſeth that the divine vertue can draw it to it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57651:67"/>
ſelfe, and taſte it, for in the [ſoure or] harſh eſſence the taſte doth conſiſt, in nature: in like manner the bitter eſſence ſerveth to [make] the moving riſing joy, fragrancy and growing; and out of theſe formes the Tincture goeth forth, and it is the houſe of the ſoule; as the Holy Ghoſt [goeth forth] from the Father and the Sonne, ſo alſo the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture goeth forth from the light of the fiery ſoule, and then alſo from its vertuous [or powerfull] Eſſences, and ſo it <note n="p" place="margin">Is like.</note> reſembleth the Holy Ghoſt, but yet the Holy Ghoſt of God is a degree higher: for he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth from the Centre of the light wholly in the fift forme, from the heart of God, at the end of Nature.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Therefore there is a difference between the Tincture in Man, and the Holy Ghoſt; and the beſtowed virgin of the divine vertue [or power], dwelleth in the Tincture of the ſoule [that is] if it be true and faithfull: but if [the ſoule be] not [faithfull] then <note n="q" place="margin">The virgin.</note> ſhee departeth into her Centre, which is not wholly ſhut up: for there is but halfe a Birth between, except the ſoule paſſe into the <note n="r" place="margin">Stock of a tree Which is grifted upon.</note> ſtocke of harſhneſſe and malice [evill or wickedneſſe] and then there is a whole birth between. For the harſhneſſe ſtandeth in the fourth forme of the Darkneſſe, and the bitterneſſe in the fire, between the fourth and fift forme, as is mentioned before.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Now [Reaſon's] queſtion is; How hath <hi>Eve</hi> received the ſoule from <hi>Adam?</hi> Behold, when Gods <note n="ſ" place="margin">Soure aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</note> harſh Fiat took the Rib <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>In.</hi>
                  </note> out of <hi>Adam,</hi> then it attracted out of all Eſſences alſo to it, and the Fiat Imaged [formed, imagined, or impreſſed] it ſelfe together therein, [that it might] continually and eternally ſtay therein. But now the Tincture in <hi>Adam</hi> was not yet extinguiſhed, but the ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi> ſate yet wholly with might and vertue [or power] in the Tincture: onely the virgin was departed: and therefore now the Fiat <note n="u" place="margin">Received.</note> took the Tincture, and the [ſoure] harſh Eſſences mingled [or qualified] with the [ſoure] harſh Fiat; for it, <hi>([viz.]</hi> the Fiat) and the [ſoureneſſe or] harſhneſſe in the Eſſences, are one kinde of Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Thus the Fiat inclined it ſelfe now to the heart of God, and the Eſſences received the divine vertue [or power]: and there ſprung up the bloſſome in the fire; and out of the bloſſome, [ſprung] a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the own [proper] Tincture, and thus <hi>Eve</hi> was a living ſoule: and the Tincture filled it ſelfe in the growth (even as it is a cauſe of all growing) ſo that <note n="x" place="margin">Suddenly.</note> inſtantly there was a whole body in the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. For that was poſſible, they were not yet fallen into ſinne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were there yet any hard grisſles and bones.</p>
               <p n="36">36. You muſt underſtand [or conceive] it aright: <hi>Eve</hi> gat not <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule, nor <hi>Adams</hi> body: but one onely Rib: but ſhee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the Eſſences, and gat her ſoule in her Eſſences [that were] given her, in the Tincture, and the body grew for [or to] her in her own ſprung up Tincture; yet in vertue [or power]; but the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57651:67"/>
Fiat had already formed [or made] her a Woman: indeed ſhee was not deformed, but altogether lovely: for ſhee was of a heavenly kinde, in Paradiſe, yet the <note n="y" place="margin">Of diſtinction of ſex.</note> Marks were already alſo ſet upon her by the Fiat of the <note n="z" place="margin">Macrocoſme.</note> Great world: and it could not otherwiſe be, ſhee muſt be a Woman for <hi>Adam:</hi> indeed they were in Paradiſe: and if they had not eaten of the Tree, and if they had returned againe to God, then they ſhould have continued in Paradiſe: but the propagation muſt now needs have been after a womanly manner; and ſhould not have ſtood [Eternally]: for Satan had brought it too farre, although he had not yet ſuffered himſelfe to be ſeene, onely he ſtrewed ſugar abroad in the ſpirit of this world, till at length the lovely beaſt, did lay it ſelfe forth upon the Tree as a flatterer and lyar.</p>

               <head>The Gate of our Propagation in the Fleſh.</head>
               <p n="37">37. As I have mentioned above: the noble Tincture is now hence-forth generated thus in a manly [or maſculine] and womanly [or femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine] kinde [or ſex] out of the ſoule; The Tincture is ſo ſubtile and mighty, powerfull, that it [can goe or] goeth into the heart of another, into his Tincture; which the devilliſh bewitching whores well know, yet they underſtand not the noble Art, but they uſe the [falſe] Tincture of the Devils, and <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>poyſon.</hi>
                  </note> infect many in [their] marrow and bones, by their <note n="b" place="margin">Exorciſmes, Conjuration, Adjuration.</note> Incantation, for which they ſhall receive their wages, with Lucifer, who would faine have raiſed his Tincture to be above God.</p>
               <p n="38">38. But know that the Tincture is in the menkinde ſomewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from that in the womenkinde; for the Tincture in the menkinde goeth out of the <hi>Limbus,</hi> or Man, and the Tincture in the women<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, goeth out of the Matrix. For the vertue of the ſoule frameth [imprinteth, faſhioneth or Imageth] it ſelfe not onely in the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but in the whole body: for the body groweth in the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
               <p n="39">39. But thus the Tincture is the longing, the great deſire after the virgin, which belongeth to the Tincture: for it is ſubtile without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but it is the divine inclination, and continually ſeeketh the virgin, [which is] its play-fellow: the <note n="c" place="margin">Manly.</note> maſculine ſeeketh her in the <note n="d" place="margin">Womanly.</note> feminine, and the feminine in the maſculine; eſpecially in the delicate complexion, where the Tincture is moſt noble, cleere, and vigorous: from whence cometh the great deſire of the maſculine and feminine ſex, ſo that they alwayes deſire to copulate, and the great burning love, ſo that the Tinctures mingle together and [try, prove, or] taſte one another with their pleaſant taſte; whereas one [ſex] continually ſuppoſeth that the other hath the virgin.</p>
               <p n="40">40. And the Spirit of the great world now ſuppoſeth that he hath gotten the virgin; he graſpeth with his clutches, and will mingle his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57651:68"/>
infection with the virgin, and he ſuppoſeth that he hath the prize, it ſhall not now run away from him, he ſuppoſeth now he will finde the Pearle well enough. But it is with him as with a Theefe, driven out of a faire Garden of Delight, where he had eaten pleaſant fruit, who cometh, and goeth round about the incloſed Garden, and would faine eate ſome more of the good fruit, and yet cannot get in, but muſt reach in with his hand, and yet cannot come at the fruit for all that; for the Gardiner cometh, and taketh away the fruit: and thus he muſt goe away empty, and his luſt is changed into diſcontent. Thus alſo it is with him <hi>[viz.</hi> with the ſpirit of this world]: he ſoweth thus in his fiery [or burning] luſt the <note n="e" place="margin">Graine, or Corne.</note> ſeede into the Matrix, and the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture receiveth it with great joy, and ſuppoſeth that to be the virgin: but the [ſoure] harſh Fiat cometh thereupon, and attracteth the ſame to it, while the Tincture is ſo well pleaſed.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Now then the feminine Tincture cometh in to ayd, and ſtriveth for the childe, and ſuppoſeth that it hath the virgin: and the two Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures wreſtle both of them for the virgin [and yet neither of them both hath her) and which of the two overcometh, according to that the fruit getteth the Mark of diſtinction of ſex]. But becauſe that the feminine [Tincture] is weake, therefore it taketh the bloud alſo to it in the Matrix, whereby it ſuppoſeth it ſhall retaine the virgin.</p>

                  <note n="k" place="margin">Imageth or repreſenteth himſelfe.</note> formeth or figureth himſelfe alſo in the Spirit of the great world, as [he did] in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and leadeth the ſoule: 1. in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, to eating and drinking [too much], and ſaith continually, thou ſhalt [want and] not have enough, get more for thy ſelfe how thou canſt, by hooke or by crooke, that thou mayſt alwayes have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough [to ſerve thy turne]. And 2. in the bitter forme he ſaith; thou art rich, and haſt much, aſpire and lift up thy ſelfe, thou art grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other people, the inferiour is not like thee [or ſo good a man as thou]. And 3. in the might or power of the fire, he ſaith: Kindle [or ſtirre up] thy minde, make it implacable and ſtout, yeeld to none, terrifie the ſimple, and ſo thou ſhalt be dreadfull, and make thy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority continue, and then thou mayſt doe what thou liſteſt, and all whatſoever thou deſireſt, will be at thy ſervice: and is not this a fine brave Glory? Art thou not indeed a Lord on Earth.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And as ſoone as this is <note n="l" place="margin">That the ſoule liſteneth and yeeldeth to the Devill.</note> brought to paſſe, then the Tincture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh wholly falſe: for as the Spirit in a thing is, ſo is alſo the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; for the Tincture goeth forth from the Spirit, and is the habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. Therefore O Man! whatſoever you ſow here, that you ſhall reape, for your ſoule in the Tincture, remaineth eternally: and all your fruits ſtand in the Tincture, manifeſted in the cleere light, and follow after you, this the virgin ſaith in ſincerity [for a warning], with great longing after the Lilly.</p>
               <p n="46">46. And now if wee conſider of the Tincture, [and ſearch] how various it is, and [that it is] many times ſo wholly falſe; then we may [be able] fundamentally to demonſtrate the falſhood of the many various Spirits, [and] how they are generated. Therefore wee will make a ſhort entrance, concerning the propagation of the ſoule, which wee will enlarge [when wee ſpeake] about the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the birth of <hi>Cain.</hi> For the ſeede (as is above mentioned) is ſowne in the luſt of the Tinctures, where the [ſoure or] harſh Fiat receiveth it, and ſuppoſeth that it hath received the virgin: there both the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures (the maſculine and the feminine) then ſtrive together about it, and there the Spirit of the great world <hi>(viz.</hi> the ſpirit of the Starres and Elements figureth [Imageth or imprinteth] it ſelfe alſo in it, and he filleth the Tinctures with his Elements, which the Tinctures in the Fiat receive with great joy, and ſuppoſe they have the virgin.</p>
               <p n="47">47. But being the Fiat is the mightieſt among them all, (for it is as it were a ſpirit, and although it be no ſpirit, yet it is the ſharpe Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence) therefore it attracteth the ſeed to it, and deſireth the <hi>Limbus</hi> of God in Paradiſe, out of which <hi>Adams</hi> body was created by the Fiat; and <note n="m" place="margin">Will.</note> would create an <hi>Adam</hi> out of a heavenly <hi>Limbus:</hi> and then the Spirit of the great world inſinuates himſelfe and ſuppoſeth [and ſaith] the childe is mine, I will rule in the virgin; and he alwayes filleth it with the Elements, from whence the Tincture becometh full and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

thick [groſſe, ſwelled, or impregnated]: and there then the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture getteth a loathing againſt the fulneſſe: for the Tincture it ſelfe is cleere, and the Fiat with the Elements is thick [groſſe and] ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; from whence Women (when they <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated or with childe.</hi>

                  </note> Ether, and cometh not againe.</p>
               <p n="48">48. And then the Spirit of the Sunne, Starres, and Elements of this world ſuppoſeth with it ſelfe [ſaying] now thou art in the right, the childe is thine, the foundation is laid, thou wilt bring it up, the virgin muſt be thine, thou wilt live therein, and have thy joy, [de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and habitation] in her, her ornament muſt be thine; and thus [he] attracteth alwayes to himſelfe in his great luſt, by the Fiat which in Eternity goeth not away; and [he] ſuppoſeth that he hath, the virgin.</p>
               <p>♄ <hi>Saturnus:</hi> this is done in the firſt Moneth.</p>
               <p n="49">49. And there the bloud of the Mother (wherein the Tincture of the Mother is) is drawne into the ſeede: and when the [ſoure] harſh Fiat hath tryed [and perceiveth] that to be ſweeter than its own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then it frameth [Imageth or repreſenteth] it ſelfe with great earneſtneſſe [or longing] therein, and becometh ſharp in the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and will create <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo ſevereth the <hi>Materia</hi> [or matter]; and then the Spirit of the Starres and Elements, is in the midſt, and ruleth mightily in the Fiat.</p>
               <p>♃ <hi>Jupiter:</hi> this is done in the ſecond Moneth.</p>
               <p n="50">50.

               <p n="51">51. Thus the matter (by the Fiat) is ſevered into Members: and now when the Fiat thus attracteth the bloud of the Mother into the matter, then <note n="p" place="margin">The bloud.</note> it is ſtifled [or choaked; and then the Tincture of the bloud becometh falſe, and full of anguiſh: for the [ſoure] harſh Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence <hi>(viz.</hi> the Fiat) is terrified, and all the joy (which the ſoure [harſh] Fiat gat in the Tincture of the bloud) withdraweth; and the Fiat beginneth to tremble in the terrour, in the ſoure [harſh] Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: and the terrour goeth away like a flaſh, and would faine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and fly away out of the Eſſence, and yet is withheld by the Fiat, which [terrour] is now turned hard and made tough by the Eſſence:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57651:69"/>
which now cloſeth the childe about (this is the skin of the childe): and the Tincture flieth ſuddenly, flaſhing upwards in the terrour, and would be gone; yet it cannot neither (for it ſtandeth in the Out-birth [or procreation] of the Eſſences) but <note n="q" place="margin">Stretcheth forth.</note> riſeth up ſuddenly in the terrour, and taketh the vertue [or power] of all the Eſſences with it. And there the Spirit of the Starres and Elements <note n="r" place="margin">Repreſenteth.</note> figureth it ſelfe alſo therein, and filleth it ſelfe alſo therein, in the flight, and ſuppoſeth that it hath the virgin, and will goe along with it: and the Fiat gripeth it all, and holdeth it [faſt], and ſuppoſeth that the <hi>Verbum Domini</hi> [the Word of the Lord] is there in the <note n="s" place="margin">Hurlyburly, or flying up.</note> uproare, that ſhall create the <hi>Adam,</hi> and it ſtrengtheneth it ſelfe in the ſtrong might of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and createth againe the uppermoſt [part] of the body <hi>(viz.</hi> the Head:) and from the hard terrour (which is continually depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and yet cannot) cometh the skull, which encloſeth the uppermoſt Centre: and from the departing out of the Eſſences of the Tincture with the terrour into the uppermoſt Centre, come the veines and the neck to be, going thus from the body into the head, into the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Centre.</p>
               <p n="52">52.

As it is mentioned above, ſo the life in the anguiſh with the kindling of the light, taketh its beginning from the glance of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, from the Spirit of the Starres and Elements in the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, where death and life wreſtle one with the other: for when man departed from Paradiſe into another Birth <hi>(viz.</hi> into the Spirit of this world, into the quality of the Sunne, Starres, and Elements) then the Paradiſicall [viſion or] ſeeing, ceaſed [or was extinguiſhed] where man ſeeth from the divine vertue, without [need of] the Sun and Starres; where the <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>there the life in the Holy Ghost buddeth forth in the place of the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </note> ſpringing up of the life is in the holy Ghoſt, and the light of God is the glance of the Spirit, from whence <note n="r" place="margin">Man.</note> he ſeeth; which went out: for the ſpirit of the ſoule went into the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of this world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt not ſo underſtand it, as if it were extinguiſhed in it ſelfe: No; but the ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi> went out, from the Principle of God, into the Principle of this world; and therein now the Spirit of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57651:71"/>
every ſoule is thus generated againe by humane propagation, as is mentioned before; and it cannot be otherwiſe: and therefore if wee would be fit for the kingdome of Heaven, wee muſt be regenerated anew in the Spirit of God, or elſe none can inherite the kingdome of God, as Chriſt taught us faithfully; of which I will write hereafter, that it may be a fountain for the thirſty, and a light to the noble way, in the bloſſome of the Lilly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And wee muſt here know, that our life (which wee get in our Mothers body [or womb] ſtandeth meerly and onely in the power of the Sunne, Starres, and Elements; ſo that they not onely figure [or faſhion] a childe in the Mothers body, and give it life, but alſo bring it into this world, and nouriſh it the whole time of its life, and bring it up, alſo cauſe fortune and miſ-fortune to it, and at laſt, death and corruption, and if our Eſſences (out of which our life is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) were not higher, in their firſt degree out of <hi>Adam,</hi> [than the Beaſts] then wee ſhould be wholly like the Beaſts.</p>

               <p n="6">6.

8. Our life in the Mothers body hath its beginning wholly, as is above mentioned: and ſtandeth there now in the quality of the Sun and Starres, where then, with the kindling of the light, a Centre ſpringeth up againe, where inſtantly the noble Tincture thus genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe (out of the light, out of the joyfull Eſſences of the [ſoure] harſh, bitter, and fiery kinde [or quality]) and ſetteth the Spirit of the ſoule in a great pleaſant habitation: and the three <note n="z" place="margin">Beeings or ſubſtances.</note> Eſſences <hi>(viz.</hi> harſhneſſe, bitterneſſe, and fire) are in the kindling of the life ſo very faſt bound one to another, that they cannot (in eternity) be ſeparated one from another, and the Tincture is their eternall houſe, wherein they dwell, which [houſe] they themſelves generate from the beginning unto eternitie, which againe giveth them life, joy, and luſt [or delight].</p>

               <p n="9">9. Behold, the three Eſſences, <hi>(viz.</hi> [ſoureneſſe or] harſhneſſe, bitterneſſe, and fire) are the Worme or Spirit [that dieth not] <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſoureneſs.</hi>
                  </note> Harſhneſſe is one Eſſence, and it is in the Fiat of God, out of Gods eternall will: and the attracting of the [ſoure] harſhneſſe is the ſting [or prickle] of the bitterneſſe, which the [ſoure] harſhneſſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure, but attracteth continually the more forcibly to it, from whence the prickle continually groweth greater, which yet the [ſoure] harſhneſſe holdeth <note n="b" place="margin">Captive.</note> priſoner; and this together is the great anxiety, which was there in the darke minde of God the Father, when the darkneſſe was anxious [or longed] after light; from whence in the anxiety (from the glance of the light) it attained the twinckling flaſh: out of which the Angels were created, which afterward were enlightened from the light of God (<note n="c" place="margin">By their long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, or imprinting the heart of God in their thoughts.</note> by their Imagination into the heart of God); and the other (like Lucifer) for their haughtineſſe [or prides] ſake, remained in the flaſh of fire and anxiety.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This Birth [or active property], with the Indiſſoluble Band, is generated in every ſoule: and there is no ſoule before the kindling of the light in the childe in the mothers body: for with the kindling, the eternall Band is knit [or tied] ſo that it ſtandeth eternally, and this Worme, of the three Eſſences, doth not die, nor ſever it ſelfe: for it is not poſſible, [becauſe] they are all three generated out of one [onely] fountaine, and have three qualities, and yet are but one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [or ſubſtance], (as the holy Trinity is but in one onely Eſſence [or ſubſtance]) and yet they have three Originalities in one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they are one [onely] being [or ſubſtance] in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus alſo (and not a whit leſſe) is the ſoule of man, but onely one degree in the firſt going forth: for it is generated out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eternall will (and not out of the heart of God) yet the heart of God is the neereſt to it of all.</p>

11. And now it may very exactly be underſtood by the Eſſences and property of the ſoule, that in this houſe of fleſh (where it is as it were generated) it is not at home: and its horrible fall may be alſo underſtood [thereby]: for it hath no light in it ſelfe of its own, it muſt borrow its light from the Sunne: which indeed ſpringeth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it in its Birth, but that is corruptible, and the Worme of the ſoule is not ſo: and is ſeene that when a man dyeth <note n="d" place="margin">The light of the Sunne, or a Mans facultie beholding of that light cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</note> it goeth out. And if then the divine light be not againe generated in the Centre, then the ſoule remaineth in the eternall Darkneſſe, in the eternall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing [ſource or] quality of the Birth, where nothing is to be found in the kindled fire, but a horrible flaſh of fire, in which [ſource property or] quality alſo the Devils dwell: for it is the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And the ſoule here in this world uſeth the light of the third Principle, after which the ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi> luſted, and thereupon was captivated by the Spirit of the great world. But if the ſoule be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Holy Ghoſt, ſo that its Centre to the regeneration ſpring forth <note n="e" place="margin">In true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation.</note>, then it ſeeth with two lights, and liveth in two Principles: and the moſt inward [Principle] <hi>(viz.</hi> the firſt) is ſhut up faſt, and hangeth but to it, in which the ſoule is tempted and afflicted by the Devill; and on the contrary the <note n="f" place="margin">The vertue or power of God.</note> virgin (which belongeth to [and is in] the Tincture of the Regeneration; and in the departure of the body from the ſoule, ſhall dwell [in the ſame Tincture]), is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſtrife and combate with the Devill, and trampleth upon his head in the vertue [and power] of the [ſoules] Prince and <note n="g" place="margin">Saviour, or Conquerour.</note> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, <hi>(viz.</hi> the ſonne of the virgin) when a new body (out of the vertue [or power] of the ſoule) ſhall <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</hi>
                  </note> ſpring forth in the Tincture of the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And that (when the ſoule is <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſeperated.</hi>
                  </note> departed from the body) it might no more be poſſibly tempted by the Devill and Spirit of this world, there is a quiet reſt for the ſoule included in its Centre in its own Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which ſtandeth in Paradiſe, betwixt the kingdome of this world and the kingdome of Hell, to continue untill God ſhall put this world into its <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi>

               <p n="14">14. And now when wee conſider how the temporary and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life is generated; we finde that the ſoule is a cauſe of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers [or faculties] of [or to] the life of Man, and without it there would not be one <note n="l" place="margin">Organs or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</note> member [to, or] of the life of man generated. For when wee ſearch [into] the beginning and kindling of life, wee finde ſtrongly with cleere evidences all manner of [faculties or] mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; ſo that when the cleere light of the ſoule kindleth, then the Fiat ſtandeth in very great joy, and in the twinckling of an eye doth in the Matrix, ſever the pure from the impure, of which the Tincture of the

ſoule in the light, is the <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.</hi>
                  </note> worker, which there reneweth it, but the Fiat createth it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And now when the [ſoure] harſh Matrix is [made] ſo very humble, thin, and ſweet, by the light, the [ſterne or] ſtrong horrour (which was ſo very poyſonous before the light [kindled].) flieth upward; for it is terrified at the meekneſſe of the Matrix; and it is a terrour of great joy, yet it retaineth its ſtrong [or ſterne] right [or property], and cannot be changed, neither can it get farre from thence (for it is withheld by the Fiat) but it raiſeth it ſelfe ſuddenly aloft, and the terrour maketh it a filme from the [ſoure or] harſh Fiat which holdeth the terrour faſt, and that is now the Gall <note n="n" place="margin">Above upon, about or neere the heart.</note> of the heart.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But when the Matrix (from which the terrour was gone forth) was thus looſed from the terrour of the anxiety, and became ſo very ſweet, like ſweet-water; then the ſpirit of the great world figured [or imprinted it ſelfe] inſtantly, in the Matrix, and filleth the foure Elements alſo within it; and thinketh with it ſelfe, now I have the ſweet virgin: and the Fiat createth <note n="o" place="margin">That which was brought in.</note> it, and ſevereth the Elements, which alſo are in ſtrife: and each of them would have the virgin, and are in a wreſtling, till they one overcome another, and that the fire (being the mightieſt and the moſt ſtrong) ſtay above and the water ſink down: and the earth, being a hard groſſe thing muſt ſtay below; But the fire will have a <note n="p" place="margin">Kingdome or Dominion.</note> Region of its own.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For it ſaith, I am the Spirit and the life, I will dwell in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: and the [ſoure] harſh Fiat attracteth all to it, and maketh it a Meſch <hi>[Maſſa</hi>

                  </note> Region: and the Fiat maketh all to be fleſh; onely the Aire would have no fleſh; for it ſaid, I dwell in no houſe, and the Fiat ſaid, I have created thee, thou art mine; and cloſed it in with an incloſure, that is the bladder.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Now the other Regions ſet themſelves in order; firſt the ſterne flaſh, that is the Gall: and beneath the flaſh, the fire, whoſe Region is the heart; and beneath the fire, the water, whoſe Region is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and beneath the water, the earth, whoſe Region is [in] the Lungs.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And ſo every Element qualifieth [or acteth] in its own ſource [or manner of operation], and one could doe nothing without the other, neither could one have any mobility without the other: for one generateth the other, and they goe all foure out of one Originall, and it is in its Birth, but one onely [thing or] ſubſtance, as I have mentioned before at large about the Creation, concerning the <note n="s" place="margin">Or, <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>

20. The [ſoure ſtrong or] bitter Gall <hi>(viz.</hi> the terrible poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous flaſh of fire) kindleth the warmth in the heart, or the fire, and is it ſelfe the cauſe, from whence all elſe take their Originall.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Here we finde againe, in our conſideration, the lamentable, and horrible fall, in the Incarnation, becauſe when the light of life riſeth up, and when the Fiat in the Tincture of the ſpirit of the ſoule reneweth the Matrix, then the Fiat thruſteth the death of the ſtifling [choaking, checking, or ſtopping] and periſhing, in the ſternneſſe <hi>(viz.</hi> the impurity of the ſtifled [or checked] bloud) from it ſelfe, out of its Eſſences, and caſteth it away: and will not endure it in the <note n="t" place="margin">Corpus.</note> body, but as a <note n="u" place="margin">Excrement.</note> ſuperfluity, the Fiat it ſelfe, driveth it out, and of its cough [glutinous] ſoureneſſe, maketh an encloſure round about it, <hi>viz.</hi> a filme, or gut, that it may touch neither the flaſh nor the ſpirit, and leaveth the nethermoſt port open for it, and <note n="x" place="margin">Condemneth.</note> baniſheth it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, becauſe that impurity doth not belong to this Kingdome: as it happened alſo to the earth: when the <note n="y" place="margin">At the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Fiat thruſt it out of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix in the middeſt in the Centre, upon a heape [as a lump], being it was unfit for heaven, ſo alſo <note n="z" place="margin">In the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> here.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And we finde greater myſteries yet in <note n="a" place="margin">Teſtimonie.</note> evidence of the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fall: for after that the foure Elements had thus ſet themſelves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in a ſeverall Region: then they made themſelves Lords over the ſpirit of the ſoule, which was generated out of the Eſſences, and they have taken it into their power, and qualifie with it. The fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the mightieſt of them, hath taken it into its <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </note> Region [or juriſdiction] in the Heart: and there it muſt <note n="c" place="margin">The Spirit muſt there be kept in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> keepe, and the bloſſom and light thereof goeth out of the heart, and moveth upon the heart, as the kindled light of a Candle: where the Candle reſembleth the fleſhly heart, with the Eſſences out of which the light ſhineth. And the fire hath ſet it ſelfe over the Eſſences, and continually reacheth after the light, and it ſuppoſeth that it hath the virgin, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine vertue [or power].</p>
               <p n="23">23. And there the holy Tincture is generated out of the Eſſences, which regardeth not the fire, but ſetteth the Eſſences <hi>(viz.</hi> the ſoule) in its pleaſant <note n="d" place="margin">Refreſhment, or habitation.</note> joy. Then come the other three Elements out of their Regions, and fill themſelves alſo by force therein, each of them would taſte of the virgin, receive her and qualifie [or mingle] with her: <hi>viz.</hi> the water, that filleth it ſelfe by force alſo therein, and it taſteth the ſweet Tincture of the ſoule: and the fire ſaith, I would willingly keepe the water, for I can quench my thirſt therewith, and refreſh my ſelfe therein. And the Aire ſaith; I am indeed the ſpirit, I will blow up thy heate and fire, that the water doe not choake thee. And the fire ſaith to the Aire, I will keepe thee, for thou upholdeſt my quality for mee, that I alſo goe not out. And then cometh the Element [of] (Earth) and ſaith, What will you three doe alone? you will ſtarve
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57651:74"/>
and conſume one another; for you depend all three on one another, and devour your ſelves, and when you ſhall have conſumed the water, then you extinguiſh; for the aire cannot move, unleſſe it have ſome water: for the water is the mother of the aire, which generateth the aire: Moreover, the fire becometh much too fierce [violent and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar] (if the water be conſumed) and conſumeth the body, and then our <note n="e" place="margin">Dominion or rule.</note> Region is out, and none of us can ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Then thus ſay the three Elements (the fire, the aire, and the water) to the Earth; Thou art indeed too dark, too rough, and too cold, and thou art rejected by the Fiat: wee cannot take thee in, thou deſtroyeſt our dwelling, and makeſt it dark and ſtinking, and thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteſt our virgin, which is our onely delight and treaſure wherein wee live. And the Earth ſaith; yet pray take my <note n="f" place="margin">Its fruits.</note> Children in, they are lovely, and of good eſteemes, they afford you meate and drinke, and cheriſh you that you never ſuffer want.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Hereupon, thus ſay the three Elements: but ſo they may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards get a dwelling in us, and may come to be ſtrong and great, and then wee muſt depart, or be in ſubjection to them: and therefore wee will not take them in neither, for they may come to be as rough and cold as thou art: yet this wee will doe: thou mayſt let thy children dwell in our <note n="g" place="margin">In the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and Gutts.</note> Courts and Porches, and wee will come and be their Gueſt, and eate of their <note n="h" place="margin">The vertue of their fruit.</note> fruit, and drinke of their drinke, elſe the water which is contained in the Element would be too little for us.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Now thus ſay the three Elements (fire, water, and aire,) to the Spirit, fetch us children of the earth, that they may dwell in our Courts, wee will eate of their <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>
                  </note> Eſſences, and make thee ſtrong. Here the Spirit of the ſoule (like a captive) muſt be obedient, and muſt reach with his Eſſences, and fetch them forth. And then cometh the Fiat, and ſaith, No: thou <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>mayeſt eſcape mee.</hi>
                  </note> mighteſt [ſo] out-run mee: and [the Fiat] created the reaching forth, and there came forth from thence, hands and all other eſſences and formes, as it is before our eyes, and the <hi>Aſtronomicus</hi> [Aſtronomer] knoweth it well, yet he knoweth not the ſecrefie of it, although he can expound the <note n="l" place="margin">Marks or tokens.</note> ſignes according to the Conſtellation and Elements, which qualifie [and mingle] to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Eſſences of the Spirit of the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And now when the hands (in the will) reach after the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Earth (which [reaching forth] yet, is no other than a will in the ſpirit of the childe in the Mothers body) then the Fiat is there, and maketh a great roome in the Courts of the three Elements, and a tough firme incloſure round about it, that they may not touch the fleſh: for the fleſh is afraid of the children of the earth, becauſe the earth is throwne away (for its rough ſtinking darkneſſe), and it trembleth for great ſeare: and it looketh ſtill about after the beſt [meanes] (leaſt the children of the earth ſhould be too rough for it,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57651:74"/>
and might cauſe a ſtinke) that ſo it might have an <note n="m" place="margin">Out-let.</note> opening, and might caſt away the ſtink and the ſuch, and [ſo] it maketh out of the Court (which is the maw [or ſtomack]) an outlet and Gate: and environeth the ſame with its tough [ſoure] harſhneſſe, and ſo there is a Gutt.</p>
               <p n="28">28. But becauſe the <note n="n" place="margin">The ſtinke.</note> Enemy is not yet in ſubſtance, but onely in the will of the Spirit, therefore it goeth away very ſlowly downwards, and ſeeketh for the Port, where it will make an outlet and Gate, that it may caſt away the ſtinke and filth, from whence the Gutts are ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long and <note n="o" place="margin">Vinding and bloubing like foulds.</note> crooked.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Now when this Conference (which is ſpirituall, between the three Elements, fire, aire, and water) was perceived by the Spirit of the earth <hi>(viz.</hi> the Eſſences in the Region of the Lungs) then <note n="p" place="margin">The ſpirit of the earth.</note> it cometh at laſt (when the habitation, or the Court was already built for the children of the earth) and ſaith to the three Elements, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will yee take the body for the Spirit?

I am their ſpirit, and am pure, I can ſtrengthen the Eſſences of the ſoule with my vertue and eſſences, and uphold them well, take mee in.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And they ſay, yes, wee will take thee in, for thou art a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our ſpirit, thou ſhalt dwell in us, and ſtrengthen the Eſſences of our ſpirit, that it may not faint; yet wee muſt alſo have the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the earth (for they have our quality alſo in them) that wee may rejoyce: and the Spirit of the Lungs ſaith; Then I will live in you wholly, and rejoyce my ſelfe with you.</p>

For the Eſſences of the ſoule are not this Kings own, he hath not generated them, nor they him; but he hath, by luſt, imprinted himſelfe alſo in its Eſſences, and kindled himſelfe in its fire-flaſh, of purpoſe to finde its virgin, and live in her; which is the amiable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vertue [or power:] becauſe the ſpirit of the ſoule is, out of the eternall, and had the virgin, before the Fall, and therefore now the Spirit of the great world continually ſeeketh the virgin in the Spirit of the ſoule, and ſuppoſeth that ſhee is there ſtill, as before the Fall, where the Spirit of the great world appeared in <hi>Adams</hi> virgin with very great joy, and deſired alſo to live in the virgin, and to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; becauſe he felt his corruptibility, and that he was ſo rough in himſelfe, therefore he would faine partake of the loving kindneſſe and ſweetneſſe of the virgin, and live in her, that ſo he might live eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not break [corrupt or periſh] againe.</p>
               <p n="33">33. For by the great longing of the Darkneſſe, after the light and vertue of God, this world hath been generated out of the Darkneſſe, where the holy vertue of God [ſhone or] beheld it ſelfe in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and therefore this great deſiring and longing after the divine vertue, continueth in the Spirit of the Sunne, Starres, and Elements, and in all things: All groane and pant after the divine vertue, and would fame be delivered from the vanity of the Devill: but ſeeing that cannot be, therefore all creatures muſt waite till their <note n="a" place="margin">Corruption.</note> Diſſolution, when they [ſhall] goe into their Ether, and get a place in Paradiſe, yet onely in the figure and ſhadow, and the Spirit [muſt] be <note n="a" place="margin">Corruption.</note> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, which here hath had ſuch luſt [or longing].</p>
               <p n="34">34. But now this luſt [or longing] muſt be thus, or elſe no good creature could be, and this world would be a meere Hell and wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. And now ſeeing the virgin ſtandeth in the ſecond Principle, ſo that the ſpirit of this world cannot poſſibly reach to her, and yet that the virgin doth continually behold her ſelfe [or appeare] in the Spirit of this world, to [ſatisfie] the luſt and longing in the fruit and growing of every thing, therefore <note n="b" place="margin">The ſpirit of the great world.</note> he is ſo very longing, and ſeeketh the virgin continually: he exalteth many a creature in great skill and cunning ſubtilty, and he bringeth it into the higheſt degree that he can; and continually ſuppoſeth that ſo the virgin ſhall againe be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for him; which he ſaw in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall; which alſo brought <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, in that <note n="c" place="margin">The ſpirit of the great world.</note> he would dwell in his virgin, and with his great luſt ſo <note n="d" place="margin">

himſelfe by force in <hi>Adams</hi> Tincture cloſe to the virgin, and would faine have qualified in her, and [mingled] with her, and ſo live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, whereby the Tincture grew weary, and the virgin withdrew.</p>
               <p n="35">35. And then <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and was feeble, which is called ſleepe: This was the <note n="e" place="margin">Adams <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tree of Temptation.</hi>
                  </note> Tree of Temptation [to try] whether it was poſſible for <hi>Adam</hi> to live eternally in the virgin, and to generate the virgin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain out of himſelfe, and ſo generate an Angelicall Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="36">36. But ſeeing it could not ſo be (becauſe of the ſpirit of this world) therefore was the outward Temptation firſt taken in hand by the Tree of the fruit of this world. And there <hi>Adam</hi> became <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>at length.</hi>

               <p n="37">37. Therefore he doth wreſtle in many a man (that is of a ſtrong Complexion, in whom the virgin doth often behold her ſelfe) ſo very hard, continually ſuppoſing he ſhall get the virgin, and that ſhee ſhall be generated for him: and the more the ſoule reſiſteth him, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neere to the heart of God, &amp; panteth to yeeld it ſelfe over there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (where the amiable virgin not onely freely looketh upon it, but dareth even for a long time even to fit in its neaſt, <hi>[viz.</hi> in] the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the ſoule,) the more ſtrong and [eagar or] deſirous doth the ſpirit of this world come to be.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Where then the King <hi>(viz.</hi> the light of the Sunne) is ſo very joyfull, in the Spirit, and doth ſo highly triumph, exult, and rejoyce, that he moveth all the Eſſences of the Starres, and bringeth them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their higheſt degree, to generate her; where then all Centres of the Starres flie open, and the loving virgin beholdeth her ſelfe in them.

Therefore ſeeing the myſtery in the light of the virgin thus wonderfully meeteth us, wee will here, for the ſeeking minde, (which in earneſt hope ſeeketh that it might finde the Pearle) open yet one Gate, as the ſame is opened to us in the virgin: For the minde asketh: ſeeing that the Sunne Starres and Elements were never yet in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle (where the virgin generateth her ſelfe out of the light) therefore how could they be able to know the virgin in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that they labour thus eagarly with longing after the virgin?</p>

Behold, thou ſeeking minde, that which thou ſeeſt before thy eyes, that is not the Element, neither in the fire, aire, water, nor earth: neither are there foure but one onely, and that is fix and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, alſo imperceptible: for the fire which burneth is no Element, but [it is] the fierce [ſterne wrath] which come to be ſuch in the kindling of the anger, when the Devils fell out of the <note n="l" place="margin">That one pure holy eternall Element.</note> Element: the Element is neither hot nor cold, but it is the inclination [to be] in God, for the heart of God is <hi>Barm</hi> [that is, warmth] and its <note n="m" place="margin">Riſing up.</note> aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is attractive and alwayes finding: and then the <hi>hertz</hi> [that is, the heart] is the holding the thing before it ſelfe, and not in it ſelfe: and then the <hi>ig</hi> [the laſt ſyllable of the German word <hi>Barm-hertz-ig,</hi> (that is, warme-hearted, or mercifull) expounded according to the Language of Nature] is the continuall diſcovering of the thing, and this is altogether <hi>Ewig</hi> [eternall;] and that is the ground of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Element, which maketh the anger ſubſtantiall, ſo that it was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and palpable, which [anger] Lucifer with his Legions did awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and thereupon he now remaineth to be Prince in the anger [or wrath] (in the kindled Element) as Chriſt (according to this forme) calleth him a Prince of this world.</p>
               <p n="42">42.

               <p n="43">43. Here obſerve: <hi>Adam</hi> was created out of the Element, out of the attracting of the heart of God, which is the will of the Father, and therein is the virgin of the divine vertue [or power] and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Regiment (which in the kindling parted it ſelfe into foure parts)

would faine have had the ſame [virgin] in it ſelfe; that is the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Devill would faine have dwelt in the heart of God, and have domineered over it, and have opened a Centre there, which the fierceneſſe without the light cannot doe, for every Centre was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and opened with the kindling of the light: thus the fierceneſſe would faine be over the meekneſſe, and therefore hath God cauſed the Sunne to come forth, ſo that it hath thus opened foure Centres, <hi>viz.</hi> the going forth out of the Element.</p>
               <p n="44">44. And when the light of the Sunne appeared in the fierce [ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or] harſhneſſe, then the harſhneſſe became thin and <note n="p" place="margin">Pleaſant.</note> ſweet, even water, and the fierceneſſe in the fire-flaſh was extinguiſhed by the water, ſo that the anger ſtood ſtill, yet the will could not reſt, but went forth in the mother, out of the water, and moved it ſelfe, which is the aire: and that which the fierce ſoureneſſe had <note n="q" place="margin">Coagulated.</note> attracted to it, that was thruſt out of the Element, in the water, as you ſee that earth ſwimmeth in the water.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Thus the evill childe panteth after the Mother, and would get to be in the Mother in the Element, and yet cannot reach her; but in <hi>Adam</hi> that [childe] did perceive the Element; and thereupon the foure Elements have drawne <hi>Adam</hi> to them, and ſuppoſed then that they had the mother; becauſe the virgin there ſhewed her ſelfe in the living ſpirit of <hi>Adam.</hi>

Hearken, thou noble and highly worthy Minde, it muſt all enter in, [and ſerve] to the glory of God, and praiſe God; as it is written, <hi>All tongues ſhall praiſe God;</hi> let it paſſe till the number, to the praiſe of God, be full, according to the eternall minde.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Thou wilt ſay, How great is that [number] then?

               <p n="49">49. Therefore it is that God keepeth it hidden ſo long (as to our ſight) that the number of the glory of his Kingdome may be great; but before him it is but as the twinckling of an eye: have but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, this world will moſt certainly be diſſolved, together with the fierceneſſe which muſt abide in the firſt Principle, therefore doe thou beware of that.</p>

My beloved Reader, I bring in my <note n="u" place="margin">Figures or Parables.</note> Types of the Eſſences of the Incarnation in the Mothers body, in a [Colloquie or] Conference of the Spirit with the Eſſences and Elements, <note n="x" place="margin">Note.</note> I cannot bring it to be underſtood in any eaſier way: onely you muſt know, that there is no conference, but it is done moſt certainly ſo in the Eſſences, and in the Spirit. Here you will ſay to mee, thou doeſt not dwell in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and ſee it: thou didſt once indeed <note n="y" place="margin">Wert incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb.</note> become man, but thou kneweſt not how, nor what [was done then]: neither canſt thou goe againe into thy mothers body [or womb] and ſee how it came to paſſe there.

               <p n="51">51. Thus now I live in the ſpirit of this world in my fleſh, and my fleſh ſerveth the ſpirit of this world: and my minde [ſerveth] God: my fleſh is generated in this world, and hath its <note n="z" place="margin">Kingdome or Dominion.</note> Region [or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment] from the Starres and Elements, which dwell in it, and are the maſter of the [outward] <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>body.</hi>

               <p n="52">52. For the virgin hath given mee her promiſe, not to leave mee in any miſery, ſhee will come to help me in the ſonne of the virgin: I muſt but hold to him againe: and he will bring mee well enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to her into Paradiſe; I will give the venture, and goe through the thiſtles and thornes, as well as I can, till I finde my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey againe, out of which my ſoule is wandred, where my deareſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin dwelleth, I rely upon her faithfull promiſe, when ſhee appeared to mee, that ſhee would turne all my mournings into great joy: and when I lay upon the mountaine towards the <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</hi>
                  </note> North, ſo that all the trees fell upon mee, and all the ſtormes and winds beate upon me, and Antichriſt gaped at mee with his open jawes to devour me; then ſhee came and comforted mee, and married her ſelfe to mee.</p>

Therefore I am but the more cheerfull, and care not for him, he ruleth [and domineeteth] over mee no further than over the <note n="d" place="margin">Over the tranſitory houſe of fleſh.</note> houſe of finne, whoſe Patron he himſelfe is; he may take that quite away, and ſo I ſhall come into my native Countrey: but yet he is not abſolutely Lord over it, he is but Gods Ape: for as an Ape (when its belly is full) imitateth all manner of tricks and prancks to make it ſelfe ſport, and would faine ſeeme to be the fineſt and the nimbleſt Beaſt [it can], ſo alſo doth he: <note n="e" place="margin">Note. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to write the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this yet.</hi>

               <p n="54">54. Now ſeeing I have ſhewed the Reader, how the true Element ſticketh wholly hidden in the outward kindled [Elements], for a comfort to him, that he may know what he [himſelfe] is, and that he may not deſpaire in ſuch an earneſt manifeſtation [or Revelation as this is] therefore now I will goe on with my Conference between the Elements, Sunne and Starres, where there is a continuall wreſtling and overcoming, in which the childe in the Mothers body [or womb] is figured: and I freely give the Reader to know, that indeed the true Element lyeth hidden in the outward man, which is the chiſt of the Treaſure [or cabinet of the precious gemme and jewell] of the ſoule, if it be faithfull, and yeeld it ſelfe up <note n="f" place="margin">In.</note> to God.</p>
               <p n="55">55. So now when the heart, liver, lungs, bladder, ſtomack, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, together with the other parts [or members] of the childe, are figured in the Mothers body, by the Conſtellation and Elements, then the Region or Regiment riſeth up, which at length figureth [faſhioneth or formeth] all whatſoever was wanting; And now it exceedingly concerneth us to conſider of the originality of ſpeech, minde, and <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>Senſes, inward ſenſes.</hi>
                  </note> thoughts, wherein Man is an image and fimilitude of God, and wherein the noble knowledge of all the three Principles doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="56">56. For every Beaſt alſo ſtandeth in the ſpringing up of the life (formerly mentioned) in the Mothers body; and taketh its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the ſame manner in the [Dammes or] Mothers body, and its Spirit liveth alſo in the Starres and Elements, and they have their [faculty of] ſeeing from the glance of the Sunne: and in the ſame [beginning of the life] there is no difference between Man and Beaſt. For a Beaſt eateth and drinketh, ſmelleth, heareth, ſeeth, and feeleth, as well as man: and yet they have no underſtanding in them, but onely to feed and multiply. Wee muſt goe higher, and ſee what the Image of God is, which God ſo dearly loved, that he ſpent his heart and ſonne upon it, and gave him to <note n="h" place="margin">To be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> become Man, ſo that he came to help Man againe after the Fall, and freed and redeemed him againe from the beaſtiall Birth, and brought him againe into Paradiſe, into the heavenly <note n="i" place="margin">Kingdome or Dominion.</note> Region.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Therefore wee muſt look after the ground [of it] how not

onely a beaſtiall man with beaſtiall qualifications [or condition] is figured [or formed] but alſo a heavenly, and an Image of God, to the honour of God and [the magnifying of] his deeds of wonder: to which end he ſo very highly graduated Man, that he had an eternall ſimilitude and Image of his own ſubſtance: for to that end, he hath manifeſted himſelfe by heaven and earth, and created ſome creatures to [be] eternall, underſtanding, and rationall Spirits, to live in his vertue and Glory, and ſome to [be] figures; ſo that (when their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit goeth into the Ether and diſſolveth) the Spirits which are eternall might have their joy and recreation <note n="k" place="margin">In.</note> with them.</p>
               <p n="58">58. Therefore wee muſt ſearch and ſee, what kinde of Image that is, and how it taketh its beginning ſo, that Man beareth an earthly Elementary, and alſo an heavenly Image. And not onely ſo, but he beareth alſo a helliſh [Image] on him, which is inclined [or prone] to all finnes and wickedneſſe: and all this taketh beginning together with the beginning of the life.</p>
               <p n="59">59. And further, wee muſt look, where then the own will ſticketh, [whereby] Man can in [his] own power, yeeld up himſelfe how he will [either] to the Kingdome of Heaven, or to the Kingdome of Hell. To this looking Glaſſe, wee will invite them that hungar and thirſt after the noble knowledge, and ſhew them the ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may in their minds be freed from the errours and contentious Controverſies in the Antichriſtian Kingdome.

[hidden] in the darkneſſe, and that ſame Eſſence hath longed from Eternity, and had it in the will to generate the light: and that long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the ſource [or eternall working propertie,] and that will is the ſpringing up, now the ſpringing up maketh the ſtirring and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the mobility maketh the attracting in the will, and the will maketh againe the longingneſſe, ſo that the will alwayes longeth after light: and this is an eternall Band, that is without beginning and without end: for where there is a willing, there is alſo deſiring, and where there is a deſiring, there is alſo in the wills deſiring, an attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which the will deſireth. Now the deſiring is ſoure, hard, and cold, for it draweth to it, and holdeth it: for where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, there the deſiring can hold nothing: and therefore if the will deſireth to hold any thing, the deſiring muſt be hard, that the will may comprehend it: and being there was nothing from eternity, therefore the will alſo could comprehend and hold nothing.</p>
               <p n="62">62. Thus wee finde now that the Three, from eternity are a not beginning and indiſſoluble band; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Attracting.</note> longing, willing, and deſiring, and the one alwayes generateth the other, and if one were not, then the other alſo would not be, of which none know what it is; for it is in it ſelfe nothing but a Spirit, which is in it ſelfe in the darkneſſe: and yet there it is no darkneſſe, but a nothing, neither darkneſſe nor light. Now then the <note n="p" place="margin">Attracting.</note> longing is an hunger [ſeeking] or an infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the deſiring, and the will is a retention in the deſiring: and now if the [deſiring] muſt retaine the will, then it muſt be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and there muſt not be one [onely] thing alone in the will, but two, now then ſeeing they are the two, therefore the attracting muſt be the third, which draweth that [which is] comprehenſible, into the will. Now this being thus from eternity, therefore it is found of it ſelfe, that from eternity there is a ſpringing and moving: for that [which is] comprehended, muſt ſpring and be ſomewhat, that the will may comprehend ſomewhat: and ſeeing that it is ſomewhat, therefore it muſt be ſoure and attractive, that it [may] come to be ſomewhat. And then ſeeing it is ſoure and attractive, therefore the attracting maketh the comprehenſibility, that ſo the will [may] have ſomewhat to comprehend and to hold, and then it being thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, therefore it is thicker [groſſer or darker] than the will, and it ſhadoweth the will, and covereth <note n="q" place="margin">Which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible.</note> that [which is attracted] and the will is in <note n="q" place="margin">Which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible.</note> that, and the longing maketh them both, and ſeeing now that the will is in that [which is] comprehenſible, therefore that [which is] comprehenſible, is the darkneſſe of the will: for it hath with its comprehenſibility incloſed the will: now the will not being <note n="r" place="margin">Gotten out.</note> out of that [which is] comprehenſible, it longeth continually after the light, that it might be delivered from the darkneſſe, which yet it ſelfe maketh with the longing and attracting.</p>

63. From whence now cometh the anxiety, becauſe the will is ſhut up in the darkneſſe: and the attracting of the will maketh the mobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that [which is] moveable maketh the wills riſing up out of the darkneſſe. Now therefore the riſing up is the firſt <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eſſentia. <hi>Proceeding vertue.</hi>
                  </note> Eſſence; for it generateth it ſelfe in the attracting, and is it ſelfe the attracting. And yet now the will cannot endure the attracting neither, for it maketh that darke with the attracted Eſſence [being or ſubſtance] which the will comprehendeth, and reſiſteth it, and the reſiſting is the ſtirring, and the ſtirring maketh a parting or breaking in that [which is] at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, for it ſevereth [it]: and this alſo the ſoureneſſe in the attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot endure, and the anguiſh in the will is [thereby] the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the attracting to hold the ſtirring [is] alſo the greater. So when the ſtirring is thus very hard knit together, and held by the ſoure attracting, then it eateth [gnaweth, preſſeth, or nippeth] it ſelfe, and becometh prickly, and ſtingeth in the ſoure anguiſh. And when the ſoureneſſe attracteth the more vehemently [or ſtrongly] to it, and then the prickle becometh ſo very great in anxiety, that the will ſpringeth up horribly, and ſet its purpoſe to flie away out of the darkneſſe.</p>
               <p n="64">64. And here the eternall minde hath its originall, in that the will, will [goe] out of that <note n="t" place="margin">Property, or activity.</note> ſource, into another <note n="u" place="margin">Flowing or working.</note> ſource of meekneſſe, and from thence the eternall <note n="t" place="margin">Property, or activity.</note> ſource in the anguiſh, hath alſo its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and it is the eternall Worme which generateth and eateth it ſelfe, and in its own fierceneſſe in it ſelfe liveth in the darkneſſe which it ſelfe maketh: and there alſo the eternall infection [or mixture] hath its originall, back from which there is no further to be ſearched into, <note n="x" place="margin">Then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Hell.</note> for there is nothing deeper, or ſooner, the ſame alwayes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſelfe from eternity, and hath no maker or creator: and it is not God, but Gods originall <note n="y" place="margin">Grim-ſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> fierceneſſe [or wrath] an anxiety [or aking anguiſh], generating in it ſelfe, and gnawing [eating or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancing] in it, and yet conſuming nothing, neither multiplying nor leſſening.</p>
               <p n="65">65. Seeing then the eternall will, which is thus generated, getteth in the anxiety, a minde after ſomewhat elſe, that it might eſcape the ſoureneſſe [or fierceneſſe], and exult in the meekneſſe; and yet it cannot otherwiſe be done than out of it ſelfe: therefore the minde generateth againe a will to live in the meekneſſe: and the Originality of this will ariſeth out of the firſt will, out of the anguiſhed minde, out of the darke ſoureneſſe, which in the ſtirring maketh a breaking wheele: where the re-comprehended will diſcovereth it ſelfe in the breaking wheele in the great anxiety, in the eternall minde, where ſomewhat [muſt] be which ſtood in the meekneſſe: and this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [or diſcovery] in the anxious breaking wheele, is a flaſh of a great ſwiftneſſe; which the anguiſh ſharpneeh thus in the ſoureneſſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57651:79"/>
ſo that the ſharpneſſe of the flaſh is conſuming, and that is the fire-flaſh, as it is to be ſeene in Nature, when one <note n="z" place="margin">A flint and a ſteele.</note> hard ſubſtance ſtriketh againſt another; how it [grindeth or] ſharpeneth it ſelfe, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth a flaſh of fire, which was not before.

                  </note> comprehendeth the flaſh, and diſcovereth it ſelfe now in the ſoureneſſe: and the flaſh with its ſtrong [or fierce] ſharpneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the comprehended ſoureneſſe, which holdeth it <hi>(viz.</hi> the will in the minde] captive in the darkneſſe; and now it is free from the darkneſſe.</p>
               <p n="66">66. Thus the ſoureneſſe receiveth the flaſh, and goeth in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour [ſhreek or crack] backwards, as it were overcome, and from the terrour [ſhreeke or crack] becometh ſoft: in which meekneſſe the flaſh diſcovereth it ſelfe, as in its own Mother: and from the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it becometh <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>bright.</hi>

As is mentioned above, ſo the Ground of the holy Trinity is in one onely divine and undivided Eſſence [being, or ſubſtance,] God, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt: from Eternity ariſing from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, alwayes generated from and out of it ſelfe from Eternity; not beginning nor ending; but dwelling in it ſelfe: comprehended by nothing, having neither beginning nor end, ſubject to no locality, nor limit [number] nor place: it hath no place of its reſt: But the Deepe is greater than wee [can perceive or] thinke, and yet it is no Deepe. But it is the unſearchable Eternity: and if any here will think [to finde] an end or limit, they will be confounded [or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed] by the Deity, for there is none: it is the end of Nature: and

whoſoever [goeth about to] thinke [or dive with his thoughts] <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>further.</hi>
                  </note> deeper, doth like Lucifer, who in [high mindedneſſe or] Pride, would flie out above the Deity, and yet there was no place, but he went on himſelfe, into the fiery fierceneſſe, and ſo he periſhed [wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered or became dry as] to the fountaine of the Kingdome of God.</p>
               <p n="85">85. Now ſee the Lilly, thou noble minde full of anguiſh and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of this world; behold the holy Trinity hath an eternall will in it ſelfe, and the will is the deſiring, and the deſiring is the eternall Eſſences, wherein then ſtandeth the ſharpneſſe <hi>(viz.</hi> the Fiat) which goeth forth out of the heart, and out of the mouth of God by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt [or Spirit] of God: and the will [that is] gone forth out of the Spirit, [that] is the divine vertue, which conceiveth [or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth] the will, and holdeth it, and the Fiat createth it <hi>[viz.</hi> that vertue] ſo that in it, as in God himſelfe, all Eſſences are, and [ſo that] the bloſſome of the light in it may ſpring up [and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome] out of the heart of God; and yet this is not God, but [it is] the chaſt virgin of the eternall wiſdome and underſtanding, of which I treate often in this Booke.</p>
               <p n="86">86. Now the virgin is [preſent] before God, and <note n="i" place="margin">Uniteth.</note> inclineth her ſelfe to the Spirit from which the vertue proceedeth, out of which ſhee <hi>(viz.</hi> the chaſt virgin) is: this is now Gods companion to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and joy of God: the ſame [appeareth] [or diſcovereth her ſelfe] in the eternall wonders of God: in the diſcovery, ſhee becometh longing after the wonders in the eternall wiſdome, which yet is her ſelfe, and thus ſhee longeth in her ſelfe, and her longing is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Eſſences, which attract the holy vertue to her, and the Fiat crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, ſo that they ſtand in [or become] a ſubſtance: and ſhee is a virgin, and never generateth any thing, neither taketh any thing into her: her inclination ſtandeth in the Holy Ghoſt, who goeth forth from God, and attracteth nothing to him, but <note n="k" place="margin">Hovereth.</note> moveth before God, and is the <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>Gods fruit.</hi>
                  </note> bloſſome [or branch] of the growth.</p>
               <p n="89">89. And ſo the virgin hath no will to conceive [or be impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with] any thing: her will is [onely] to open the wonders of God: and therefore ſhee is in the will in the wonders, to diſcover [or make] the wonders [appeare] in the eternall Eſſences; and that virgin-like will createth the ſoure fiat, in the Eſſences, ſo that it is [become] a ſubſtance, and ſtandeth eternally before God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the eternall wonders of the virgin of the wiſdome of God are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>

               </note> ſet it ſelfe [right] againſt the Image and ſimilitude, and they now which received the will, they became An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (for they ſet their imagination, in the will, in the heart of God, and they did eate of the <hi>Verbum Domini</hi> [of the Word of the Lord]) but they that ſet their Imagination in the darke minde, as Lucifer [did that he might] flie out above the Deity and meekneſſe in the might of the fire in the flaſh, in the ſharpe might of God, and be Lord alone, they became Devils: and they have that name from their being thruſt [or driven] out of the light; for they were in the light when the Fiat created them, for the Fiat which created them ſtood in the light.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thus the Devill is the fault, and guilty of his own fall, for he ſuffered himſelfe to be moved by the Matrix of the <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </note> ſternneſſe [fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſoureneſſe, or wrath] whereas he yet had his own will to take hold of Light or Darkneſſe: And Lucifer was a Throne (that is, a

            <p n="7">7. And there the Fiat (which created the fierce [wrathfull or grim] Devils, in hope that they would of Devills become Angels, who ſet their imagination therein, that thereby they might domineere over God and the Kingdome of Heaven) was infected in the figuring of the ſimilitudes: and ſo inſtantly kindled the Element in the ſimilitude <hi>(viz.</hi> in the out-Birth [or procreation]) in the ſpeculating [or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding], ſo that the Eſſence hath generated to the higheſt Eſſences, from whence goe forth the foure Elements of this world, of the third Principle: and the ſharp Fiat of God (which ſtood in the Out-Birth [or procreation]) hath created the out-Birth, out of which the earth and ſtones are proceeded.</p>
            <p n="8">8. For when the Fiat kindled the Element in the Out-birth, then the kindled <hi>Materia</hi> [or matter] became palpable [or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible] this was not now fit for Paradiſe, but it was ex-created: [or made externall]: yet that the Element with its out-Birth might no more generate thus, therefore God created the Heaven out of the <note n="m" place="margin">The one pure Element.</note> Element, and [cauſed or] ſuffered out of the Element, (which is the heavenly <hi>Limbus)</hi> the third Principle to ſpring up; where the Spirit of God againe diſcovered [or revealed] it ſelfe in the virgin, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Eternall Wiſdome: and found out, in the out-Birth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="9">9. But that the ſharp and ſevere Eſſence, with the attraction might ceaſe, therefore God generated a ſimilitude according to the fountain of the heart of God <hi>(viz.</hi> the Sunne) and herewith ſprung up the third Principle of this world, and that <hi>(viz.</hi> the Sunne] put all things into meekneſſe and <note n="n" place="margin">Well-doing, or kindneſſe.</note> well-fare.</p>
            <p n="10">10.

            <p n="11">11. And that there ſhould goe nothing in vaine out of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

            <p n="12">12. But ſeeing it was his will alſo in this Throne, in the eternall Element, to have creatures, that ſhould be in ſtead of the fallen De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and poſſeſſe the place [of them] in the Heaven in Paradiſe, therefore he created Man out of the <note n="o" place="margin">The eternall one Element.</note> Element.</p>

And there God manifeſteth himſelfe according to his eternall Will, in his eternall Wiſdome of the noble virgin, in the Element, which in Paradiſe ſtandeth in the ſharpneſſe of the divine vertue [or power]: and the Fiat created Man out of the Element in Paradiſe, for it attracted to it out of the Quinteſſence of the Sunne, Starres, and Elements in Paradiſe in the Element of the Originality, from whence the foure Elements proceed: and created Man to the Image of God (that is, to the ſimilitude of God) and breathed into him into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement of the body (which yet was nothing elſe but Paradiſicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) the Spirit of the Eternall Eſſences out of the Eternall Origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and there Man became a living ſoule, and an Image of God in Paradiſe.</p>
            <p n="15">15.

            <p n="16">16. For the fruits were alſo good, and their inclination [or that which made them to be deſired] proceeded out of the inward Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of the <note n="s" place="margin">The divine habitation.</note> Paradiſe: now <hi>Adam</hi> could eate of every fruit in

            <p n="17">17. But when the chaſt virgin found her ſelfe thus in <hi>Adam</hi> with great wiſdome, meekneſſe, and humility, then the outward Elements became luſting after the eternall, that they might <note n="u" place="margin">Diſcover or manifeſt.</note> raiſe themſelves up in the chaſt virgin, and <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>mix with her, or work in her.</hi>

            <p n="18">18. But the Spirit of the great world overcame <hi>Adam,</hi> and put it ſelfe in with force, <hi>in Quintam Eſſentiam,</hi> [into the Quinteſſence] (which there, is the fift forme, the extract out of the foure Elements and Starres:) and there muſt God create a Woman [or wife] for <hi>Adam</hi> out of his Eſſences, if he muſt be to fill the Kingdome, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the appearing [diſcovering, ſhining, or ſparkling] of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble virgin [with many thouſand thouſands] and build [or propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate] the ſame. And thus Man became earthly, and the virgin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him in Paradiſe; and there ſhee warned [called and told] him that he ſhould lay off the earthlineſſe, and then ſhee would be his Bride and loving Spouſe. And now it cannot be otherwiſe in this world with Man, he muſt be <note n="y" place="margin">Begotten, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, borne, nouriſhed, and preſerved.</note> generated in the vertue of the outward Conſtellation and Elements, and live therein till the earthlineſſe fall away.</p>
            <p n="19">19. And thus he is in this life threefold, and the threefold Spirit hangeth on him, and he is generated therein, neither can he be rid of it, except he [corrupt or] breake to pieces: yet he can be rid of Paradiſe, whenſoever his Spirit imagineth in the fierceneſſe [or wrath] and falſhood, and giveth up himſelfe thereto, that ſo he might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meekneſſe and righteouſneſſe in himſelfe, as a Lord like Lucifer [and] live in pride [and ſtatelineſſe]; and then Paradiſe <note n="z" place="margin">Ceaſeth, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeareth.</note> falleth [away], and is ſhut up: and he looſeth the firſt Image which ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the hidden Element in Paradiſe.</p>

28. For behold, when the Gate of this world in the childe is made ready, ſo that the childe is [become] a living ſoule out of the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and now [henceforth] ſeeth onely [by or] in the light of the Sunne, and not in the light of God: then cometh the true <note n="q" place="margin">The Maſter the Fiat.</note> Artificer, inſtantly in the twinckling of an eye (when the light of the life kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth) and figureth [that which is] his: for the centre breaketh forth in all the three Principles. Firſt, there are the foure Eſſences in the Fiat in the ſterne might of God, which there are the childes own, the Worme of its ſoule, which ſtandeth there in the houſe of the great anxiety, as in the Originality. For the ſeede is ſowne in the will, and the will receiveth the Fiat in the Tincture, and the Fiat draweth the will to it inwardly, and outwardly [draweth] the ſeede to a <note n="r" place="margin">Concretion, ſubſtance, or body.</note> Maſſe: for the inward and outward <note n="ſ" place="margin">Or, <hi>Maſter.</hi>
               </note> Artificer is there.</p>
            <p n="29">29. When the will thus draweth to it, then it becometh inwardly and outwardly impregnated, and is darkned, the will cannot endure this, <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſet in the darke, and therefore falls into great anxiety for the light: for the outward <hi>Materia</hi> [or matter] is filled with the Elements, and the bloud is choaked [checked or ſtopped]: and there then the Tincture withdraweth, and there is then the right A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſe of Death, and ſo the inward <hi>[Materia</hi> or matter] is filled from the Eſſences of the vertue, [or power,] and in the inward there riſeth up another will, out of the ſterne vertue of the eſſences [that it might] lift it ſelfe up into the Light of the meekneſſe, and in the outward ſtandeth the deſire to be ſevered, the impure from the pure, for that the outward Fiat doth.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Wee muſt conſider in the vertue [or power] of the virgin, that the will firſt is threefold, and each in its Centre is fix [ſtedfaſt or perfect] and pure, for it proceedeth out of the Tincture. In the firſt Centre there ſpringeth up between the Parents of the childe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination [or luſt] and the beaſtiall deſire to copulate, this is the outward Elementary Centre, and it is fix in it ſelfe. Secondly, there ſpringeth up, in the ſecond Centre the inclinable love to the copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and although they were at the firſt ſight angry and odious one to another, yet in the copulating the Centre of love ſpringeth up, and that onely in the copulating: for the one pure Tincture recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth [or catcheth] the other, and in the copulating the <note n="t" place="margin">Maſſa, <hi>or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</hi>

            <p n="31">31. Now thus the love qualifieth [or mixeth] with the inward [one] Element, and the Element, with the Paradiſe, and the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe is before [or in the preſence of] God: and the outward ſeede hath its Eſſences, which qualifie firſt with the outward Elements, and the outward Elements qualifie with the outward Starres, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Starres qualifie with the outward ſternneſſe [grimneſſe, fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, frowardneſſe] wrath and malice, and the wrath and malice in

the fierceneſſe [ſeverity or auſterneſſe] qualifieth with the Originall of the firſt fierceneſſe of the Abyſſe of Hell, and the Abyſſe qualifieth with the Devills.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Therefore O Man! Conſider what thou haſt received with thy beaſtiall body, to eate and to drinke of evill and good, which God did forbid.

                  </note> fiery, and that in the burning [or burnt] luſt [is] earthly and cold (for that muſt indeed keepe faithfull while it cannot be otherwiſe:) as is ſeene by experience in many, how afterwards in wedlock they hunt after whoredome, and ſeek after the Devils <note n="e" place="margin">Wanton luſt.</note> Sugar, which he ſtroweth in the noble Tincture, if Man will let him.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Whereby then you ſee here, that God hath not willed the earthly Copulation: Man ſhould have continued in the fiery love which was in Paradiſe, and generate out of himſelfe: But the <note n="f" place="margin">The divided nature in luſt and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> Woman was in this world in the outward Elementary Kingdome, in the infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the forbidden fruit, of which <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not have eaten.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57651:87"/>
And although now he hath eaten and thus deſtroyed us, therefore it is now with him [the Adamicall Man] as with a Theefe that hath been in a pleaſant Garden, and went out of it to ſteale, and cometh againe and would faine goe into the Garden, and the Gardiner will not let him in, he muſt but reach into the Garden with his hand for the fruit, and then cometh the Gardiner and ſnatcheth the fruit out of his hand, and he muſt goe away in his burning luſt and anger, and cometh no more into the Garden: and in ſtead of the fruit there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth his deſirous burning luſt with him, and that he hath gotten in ſtead of the Paradiſicall Fruit, of that wee muſt now eate, and live in the <note n="g" place="margin">In the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nature, and in the earthly tabernacle, and ſeed and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply therein.</note> Woman.</p>

               <p n="37">37. And then cometh the Woman with her ſtopped [or congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led] bloud, with the Starres and Elements, and ſetteth her ſelfe in [the Dominion.] And here is the Paradiſicall Death, where <hi>Adam,</hi> in the living body, dyed; that is, he dyed [as] to Paradiſe and the Element, and lived to the Sunne, Starres, and the outward Elements; concerning which, God ſaid to him, <hi>That day thou enteſt of good and evill, thou ſhalt dye the Death;</hi> and this is the Gate of the firſt Death in the Paradiſe, in which now Man liveth in the Elementary Woman of this world in the corruptibility.</p>
               <p n="38">38. And it highly concerneth us to know and apprehend, that when the ſeede is ſowne in the Matrix, and that it be drawne together by the Fiat (when the Starres and the outward Elements ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in [the dominion] and that the love and meekneſſe is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; for there cometh to be a fierce ſubſtance in the ſtopping [or congealing] of the Tincture) that before the kindling of the light of life, in the childe, there is no heavenly Creature: and although <note n="i" place="margin">The creature.</note> it be figured [or ſhaped] with all the formes [or parts] of the body,

yet for all that, the heavenly Image is not therein, but the beaſtiall, and if that body periſh [corrupt, or breake] before the kindling of the Spirit of the ſoule in the ſpringing up of the life, then nothing of this figure appeareth before God on the day of the Reſtitution but its ſhadow and ſhape; for it hath yet had no Spirit.</p>

               <p n="40">40. Thus now the Starres and the Elements (after the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the love in the Tincture) take the houſe into poſſeſſion, and fill it the firſt <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>Moone.</hi>

And thus the attracting filleth the will with the things which the will deſireth: and although it be pure, and deſireth nothing but the light, yet there is no light in the dark anxiety, that it can attract, but it draweth the Spirit of the Eſſences of the Starres and Elements into it ſelfe, and therewith the will of the divine vertue is filled, and the ſame is all rough and dark. And thus the will is ſet in the Darkneſſe, and this is done alſo in the heart.</p>

thoughts] not to continue in the anxiety: and the will [appeareth] diſcovereth it ſelfe in the Eſſences of the ſoureneſſe, as in the fierce hardneſſe of Death: and the glimps [or glance] breaketh through the Eſſences of the ſoure hardneſſe, as a ſwift [or ſudden] flaſh, and ſharpeneth it ſelfe in the ſoure hardneſſe, that it becometh [pale, white, or] <note n="r" place="margin">Text, Blanck.</note> glimmering like a flaſh of fire, and in its ſudden flight breaketh the ſoure darkneſſe: and there ſtandeth the hardneſſe and the harſh ſoureneſſe of Death like a broken turning wheele, which with the flaſh of the breaking flyeth ſwiftly as a thought; as alſo then the re-conceived will (which is the minde) appeareth ſo very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly: and ſeeing it cannot flie forward out of the Eſſences, it muſt goe into the turning wheele, (for it cannot get from that place) and ſo it breaketh the darkneſſe: and when the darkneſſe is thus <note n="ſ" place="margin">Or, <hi>diſpelled.</hi>
                  </note> broken, [then] the ſharp glance diſcovereth it ſelfe in the pleaſant joy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out [or beyond] the darkneſſe in the ſharpneſſe of the will <hi>(viz.</hi> in the minde) and findeth it ſelfe habitable therein, from whence the flaſh (or glance) is terrified, and flieth up with ſtrong might through the broken eſſences out of the heart, and would out at the mouth, and raiſeth it ſelfe farre from the heart, and yet is held by the ſoure [or harſh] Fiat, and yet then maketh it ſelfe a ſeverall Region <hi>(viz.</hi> the Tongue) wherein then ſtandeth the ſkreeke [or the crack] of the broken Eſſences: and ſeeing then it reflecteth [or recoileth] back againe into the heart, as into its firſt dwelling houſe, and findeth it ſelfe ſo very habitable and pleaſant (becauſe the Gates of the darkneſſe are broken) then it kindleth it ſelfe ſo highly in the loving will, by reaſon of the meekneſſe, and goeth no more like a ſterne [or fierce] flaſh through all Eſſences, but [it] goeth trembling with great joy: and the might of the joy is now many hundred times ſtronger, than firſt the flaſh [or glance] was, which yeelded [or diſcovered] it ſelfe through the ſoure harſh Eſſences of the Death, and goeth with ſtrong might out of the heart into the head, in the will [or purpoſe] to poſſeſſe the heavenly Region.</p>
               <p n="44">44. For <note n="t" place="margin">The Will.</note> it is Paradiſicall, and it hath its moſt inward roote there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: when <hi>Adam</hi> in ſinne, dyed the firſt Death, then ſaid God, <hi>The ſeed of the Woman ſhall</hi>

                  <hi>breake the Serpents head:</hi> the ſame word <note n="x" place="margin">Imagined, figured, or formed it ſelfe.</note> imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſelfe in <hi>Adam,</hi> in the centre of the ſpringing up of his life, and ſo forth, with the Creation of <hi>Eve</hi> in the ſpringing up of her life, and ſo forth, in all Men, ſo that wee can, in our firſt minde, through the word and vertue of God in the Treader upon the Serpent (who in the time became man [or was incarnate]) trample upon [or breake] the Head and will of the Devill, and if this might [or power] were not <note n="y" place="margin">Viz. <hi>in the place of the ſpringing up of the life.</hi>
                  </note> in this place, then wee were in the eternall Death. Thus the minde is its own, in the free will, and moveth in the vertue [or power] of God, and in his promiſe, in the Free ſubſtance [or beeing].</p>
               <p n="45">
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:57651:88"/>
45. Seeing then that the ſkreek of joy in the vertue of God (which breaketh the doores of the deep Darkneſſe) thus ſpringeth up in the heart, and flieth with its glimpſe [or ſparkling] into the Head; then the vertue of the joy ſetteth it ſelfe above, as being the ſtrongeſt, and the flaſh [or glance] beneath, as being the weakeſt: and ſo when the flaſh [or glance] cometh into the Head into its ſeate, then it maketh it ſelfe two open Gates: for it hath broken the doores of the deep Darkneſſe, and therefore it continueth no more in the Darkneſſe, but it muſt be free as a victorious Prince [or Conquerour], and will not be held captive: (and this ſignifieth to us, the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, who is now free, and will not be held [therein], which in its due place ſhall be very deeply deſcribed.) And thoſe Gates which the glance holdeth open, they are the eyes, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of joy is their roote, which [ſpirit] ſpringeth up at firſt in the kindling of the life.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Thus then the ſtrong re-conceived will, (to flie out from the Darkneſſe and to be in the Light in the Heart) generateth it ſelfe; and therefore wee cannot know [or apprehend] it to be any other than the noble virgin, the wiſdome of God; which thus ſpringeth up in joy, and in the beginning, marrieth her ſelfe with the ſpirit of the ſoule, and helpeth it to the light, which after the ſpringing up of the ſoule <hi>(viz.</hi> after the kindling of the vertue of the Sunne in the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) putteth her ſelfe into its Paradiſicall Centre, and continually warneth the ſoule, <note n="z" place="margin">Of the waies of the ungodly.</note> of the ungodly wayes, which are held before it, by the Starres and Elements, and brought into its Eſſences. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the virgin keepeth her Throne thus in the heart, and alſo in the head, that ſhee may defend and keep them off from the ſoule, all over.</p>
               <p n="47">47. And wee muſt further <note n="a" place="margin">Think, or conceive.</note> conſider, that when the skreek [or crack] maketh its dwelling houſe, in its ſtrong breaking through, out of the Gate of the anxious Darkneſſe, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Tongue) that the skreek [or crack] hath not then yet ſeene the virgin: but when it reflected [or ſhined] back again into the heart, into the opened dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and found her ſo habitable, there then firſt ſprung up its joy, habitableneſſe, and pleaſantneſſe, and it became Paradiſicall, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not [to goe] into the Tongue againe, but into the Head, and [deſired] there to have its Region out of the ſource of the Heart. Therefore the Tongue ought not in all [or altogether] to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for it ſitteth not in the heavenly Region, as the friendly pleaſant vertue [doth]: but it hath its Region in the crack and flaſh, and the flaſh is as neere the helliſh Region, as the crack is, for they are both generated in the <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſterne grim ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

               <head>The Life of the Soule. The Gate.</head>
               <p n="48">48. Thus now when the vertue of the life, and the Spirit of the ſecond Principle, <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>was.</hi>
                  </note> is generated in the firſt Originality of the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>(viz.</hi> in the Gate of the deep Darkneſſe, which the will of the vertue of the virgin, in the fierce earneſt flaſh of the fierce might of God, did breake, and ſet it ſelfe in the pleaſant habitation) then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the Eſſences of the Starres and Elements, in the flaſh of the ſpringing up of the life, preſſed in alſo; yet after the building of the pleaſant habitation firſt [made].</p>
               <p n="49">49. For the habitation is the Element, and the vertue of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Element, is the Paradiſicall Love, which the outward Elements (being generated out of the Element,) will have for their mother, and the ſharp Fiat bringeth them into the habitation: and there the light of the life becometh rightly kindled, and all Eſſences live in the habitation. For in the beginning of the life, each Principle <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>catcheth.</hi>
                  </note> taketh its Light.</p>
               <p n="50">50. The firſt Principle <hi>(viz.</hi> the Darkneſſe) taketh the fierce and ſudden fire-flaſh; and ſo when the <note n="f" place="margin">Re-conceived, or re-purpoſed.</note> re-comprehended will, in the firſt will of the firſt attracted darkneſſe of the harſhneſſe, diſcovereth it ſelfe, and breaketh the Darkneſſe in the flaſh, then the harſh dark fire-flaſh remaineth in the firſt will, and ſtandeth over the heart, in the Gall, and kindleth the fire in the Eſſences of the heart.</p>
               <p n="51">51. And the ſecond Principle retaineth its light for it ſelfe: which is the pleaſant <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>joy.</hi>
                  </note> habitation, which ſhineth there, where the darkneſſe is broken, [or diſpelled,] wherein the courteous loving vertue, and the pleaſantneſſe ariſeth, from whence the skreeke [or crack] in the ſtrong might becometh ſo very joyfull, and <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>alayeth it with trembling for joy.</hi>
                  </note> turneth its forcible ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, into a joyfull trembling: where then the fire-flaſh of the firſt Principle ſticketh to <note n="i" place="margin">The skreek or crack.</note> it, which cauſeth its trembling: but its ſource [or active property] is pleaſantneſſe, and joy, that cannot ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be deſcribed, happy are they that finde it, [by experience].</p>
               <p n="52">52. And the third Principle retaineth its light wholly for it ſelfe, which (as ſoone as the light of life ſpringeth up,) preſſeth into the Tincture of the ſoule, to the <note n="k" place="margin">The inward one Element.</note> Element; and reacheth after the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but it attaineth no more than to the light of the Sunne, which is proceeded, out of the <hi>Quinta Eſſentia,</hi> out of the Element: and thus the Starres and Elements rule in their light and vertue which is the Sunnes, and qualifie with the ſoule: and bring many diſtempers and alſo diſeaſes into the Eſſences, from whence come ſtitches, agues, ſwellings and [other] ſickneſſes [as] the Plague, &amp;c. into thoſe [Eſſences], and at laſt their corruption and death.</p>

53. And now when the light of all the three Principles ſhineth, then the Tincture goeth forth from all the three Principles, and it is highly [worthy] to be obſerved, that the middlemoſt Principle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth no light from Nature, but as ſoone as the darkneſſe is broken up, [or diſpelled,] it ſhineth in moſt joyfull habitableneſſe, and [hath] the noble virgin dwelling in the joy, <hi>viz.</hi> in that Tincture: and the Deity appeareth ſo very highly and powerfully in Man, that wee cannot finde it ſo, in any other thing, let us take what wee will elſe into our Conſideration.</p>
               <p n="54">54. In the firſt Principle is the fire-flaſh, and in the Tincture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the <note n="l" place="margin">The dazzling light of the Sunne.</note> terrible light of the Sunne, which hath its originall very ſharply out of the eternall Originalneſſe, out of the firſt Principle, with its roote out of the fift Eſſence, through the Element: which may be expounded in another place, it would be too long to doe it here. And beſides it ſhould be hidden, he that knoweth it, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it, as he would alſo [conceale] the ſpringing up of the Starres and Planets: for the cornered Cap will needs have it under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his Schoole learning, though indeed he apprehendeth little or nothing at all in the light of Nature: let it remaine [hidden] till the time of the Lilly, there it ſtandeth all <note n="m" place="margin">Free diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered or knowne.</note> open: and the Tincture is [then] the light of the world.</p>
               <p n="55">55. And it is here very exactly ſeene how the third Principle <note n="n" place="margin">Appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, or yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe up to it.</note> uniteth it ſelfe with the firſt, and how they have one [onely] will: for they proceed from one another: and if the ſecond Principle were not in the midſt [between them] then they were but one [and the ſame] thing. But ſpeaking here of the Tincture in the life, wee will therefore ſhew in the light of Nature, the true ground of all the three Births.</p>
               <p n="56">56. The noble Tincture is the dwelling houſe of the Spirit, and hath three formes, one is eternall, and uncorruptible: the other, is mutable [or tranſitory], and yet with the holy, [or Saints,] conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth eternally: but with the wicked, it is mutable [or tranſitorie] and flieth into the Ether: the third is corruptible <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>as in death.</hi>
                  </note> in Death.</p>
               <p n="57">57. The firſt Tincture of the firſt Principle is properly the <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment.</hi>
                  </note> habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the fire-flaſh: which is the ſource, [life, or active property,] in the Gall, which maketh the Brimſtone Spirit <hi>(viz.</hi> the indiſſoluble Worme of the ſoule, which ruleth powerfully in the ſharp Eſſences, and moveth and carrieth the body whither ſoever the minde, in the ſecond Centre, will:) to be its dwelling houſe; its Tincture is like the fierce [auſtere or grim] and ſharp might of God: it kindleth the whole body, ſo that it is warme, and that it grow not <note n="q" place="margin">Numb.</note> ſtiffe [or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealeth with cold] and upholdeth the wheele in the crack in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences, out of which the hearing ariſeth: it is ſharp, and proveth the ſmell of every thing in the Eſſences: it maketh the hearing, though it
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57651:90"/>
ſelfe is neither the hearing nor ſmelling: but it is the Gate that letteth in good and evill, as the tongue and alſo the eare [doth]: all which cometh from hence, becauſe that <note n="r" place="margin">The active life of the Gall.</note> its Tincture hath its ground in the firſt Principle: and the kindling of the life hapneth in the ſharpneſſe, in the breaking through the Gate of the eternall Darkneſſe.</p>
               <p n="58">58. Therefore are the Eſſences of the Spirit of the ſoule ſo very ſharp and fiery, and [therefore] the Eſſences goe forth out of ſuch a ſharp fiery Tincture: wherein now ſtand the five ſenſes <hi>(viz.</hi> ſeeing, hearing, ſmelling, taſting, and feeling:) for the fierce ſharpneſſe of the Tincture of the firſt Principle, proveth, in its own Eſſences [in or] of the ſoule, (or [in the Eſſences] of the Worme of the ſoule, in this place rightly ſo called) [proveth I ſay] the Starres, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>(viz.</hi> the out-birth out of the firſt Principle,) and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uniteth [or yeeldeth] it ſelfe to it, it taketh that into the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Worme of the ſoule; <hi>viz.</hi> all whatſoever is harſh [or ſoure] bitter, ſterne, [or fierce] and fiery: all whatſoever generateth it ſelfe in the fierceneſſe, and all whatſoever is of the ſame property with the Eſſences: all that which riſeth up along there, in the fiery ſource, and elevateth it ſelfe in the breaking of the Gate of the Darkneſſe, and boyleth [ſpringeth, or floweth up] above the meekneſſe: and all whatſoever is like the ſharp auſtere Eternity, and qualifieth [or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] with the ſharpneſſe of the fierce anger of the God of the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein he holdeth the Kingdome of the Devils Captive.</p>
               <p>O Man! conſider thy ſelfe here, it is the ſure Ground, knowne by the Author, in the light of Nature, in the will of God.</p>
               <p n="59">59. And in this Tincture of the firſt Principle, the Devill tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Man: for it is his ſource [well-ſpring, or property] wherein he alſo liveth. Herein he reacheth into the heart of Man, into his ſoules Eſſences, and leadeth him away from God, into the deſire to live in the ſharpe <hi>(viz.</hi> in the fiery) Eſſences, that it might be elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the humility and the meekneſſe of the heart of God, and above the love and meekneſſe of the Creatures, [of purpoſe to ſeeme] to be the onely faire and gliſtering Worme in the fire flaſh, and to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineere over the ſecond Principle: and [thus] he maketh the ſoule of Man ſo extreame proud, as not to vouchſafe himſelfe to be in the leaſt like any meekneſſe, but to be like all whatſoever liveth in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity [or property] contrary to it.</p>
               <p n="60">60. And in the bitter Eſſences <note n="s" place="margin">The Devill.</note> he maketh the Worme of the ſoule prickly, ſpitefull, envious, and malicious, grudging every thing to any: as the bitterneſſe indeed is friends with nothing, but it ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and grindeth, raveth and rageth like the Abyſſe of Hell, and it is the true houſe of Death as to the pleaſant life.</p>
               <p n="61">61. And in the ſoure [or harſh] Eſſence of the Tincture of the Worme of the ſoule, he infecteth the ſoure <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſubſtance.</hi>
                  </note> harſh Eſſence, whereb
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57651:90"/>
it becometh ſharply attractive, and getteth a will to draw all to it ſelfe, and yet is not able to doe it: for the conceived will, is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filled; but is a dry helliſh thirſty hunger to have all: and if it did get all, yet the hunger would not be the leſſe, but it is the eternall hunger and thirſt of the Abyſſe, the will of Hell-fire, and of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, who continually hunger and thirſt, and yet eate nothing; but it is their ſatiating, that they [ſuck or] draw into themſelves, the ſtrong ſource of the Eſſences of the harſh, bitter might of the fire, wherein conſiſteth their life and ſatiating, and the Abyſſe of the wrath and of Hell is alſo ſuch [a thing].</p>
               <p n="62">62. And this is the ſource of the firſt Principle, which (without the light of God) cannot be otherwiſe, neither can it change or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe; for it hath been ſo, from Eternity: and out of this ſource, the Eſſences of the Worme of the ſoule, in the time of its creating, were extracted by the Fiat of God, and created in Paradiſe, [and ſet] <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>for.</hi>
                  </note> before the light of God, which enlightened the fire-flaſh, and put it into very high meekneſſe and humility.</p>
               <p n="63">63. For becauſe Man was to be Eternall, therefore he muſt alſo come to be, out of the Eternall: for nothing is created out of the fountaine of the Heart of God: for that is the end of Nature, and hath no ſuch Eſſences; no comprehenſible [or palpable] thing entereth therein; otherwiſe it would be a filling and darkneſſe, and that cannot be: alſo from Eternity, there hath been nothing elſe but onely the ſource [or working property] where the Deity continually riſeth up, as is mentioned before.</p>
               <p n="64">64. And this ſource of the Spirit of the ſoule is Eternall, and its Tincture is alſo Eternall: and as the ſource is [in it] at all times <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>in.</hi>
                  </note> of this world, (while it ſticketh in the Elementary houſe of fleſh), ſo is the Tincture alſo, and the dwelling houſe of the ſoule, and in which ſource the minde inclineth it ſelfe, whether it be in the divine or hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, in that [ſource] the Worme liveth, and of that Principle it eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and is either an Angel or a Devill; although its judgement is not in this [lifes] time (for it ſtandeth in both the Gates, ſo long as it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in the fleſh) except it dive [or plunge it ſelfe] wholly into the Abyſſe, whereof (when I write of the ſinne of Man) I ſhall treate deeply and exactly, reade of it, concerning <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="65">65. The minde (which knoweth [or underſtandeth] nothing in the light of Nature) will marvell at ſuch writings, and will ſuppoſe that it is not true, that God hath extracted and created Man out of ſuch an Originall. Behold thou beloved Reaſon and precious Minde, bring thy five ſenſes hither, and I will ſhew thee whether it be true [or not]: I will ſhew thee [plainly] that thou haſt not the leaſt ſpark [of cauſe] to allow any other Ground [to build upon], ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that thou wilt let thy heart be imbittered by the Devill in beaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57651:91"/>
reaſon; and except thou wilt wilfully contemne the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſtandeth in the preſence of God: and indeed if thou art in ſuch a beaſtiall way, leave my writings, and reade them not, they are not written for ſuch ſwine, but for the children [of wiſedome] that are to poſſeſſe the kingdome of God, but I have written them for my ſelfe, and for thoſe that ſeeke, and not for the wiſe and prudent of this world.</p>
               <p n="66">66. Behold, what are thy five ſenſes? in what vertue doe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? or how come they in the life of Man? whence cometh thy ſeeing, that thou canſt ſee by the light of the Sunne, and not otherwiſe? conſider thy ſelfe deeply, if thou wilt be a Searcher into Nature, and wilt boaſt of the light of Nature? Thou canſt not ſay that thou ſeeſt onely by the light of the Sunne, for there muſt be ſomewhat which can receive the light of the Sunne, and which doth mix with the light of the Sunne (as the Starre doth which is in thine eyes) which is not the Sunne, but conſiſteth of fire and water: and its glance, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the light of the Sunne, is a flaſh, that ariſeth from the fiery ſoure and bitter Gall, and the water maketh it ſoft [or pleaſant]. Here you take the meaning to be onely, concerning the outward, <hi>viz.</hi> the third Principle, wherein the Sunne, Starres, and Elements are; but the ſame is alſo true in every the Creatures in this world.</p>
               <p n="67">67. Now what is it that maketh the hearing, that you can heare that which ſtirreth and maketh a noiſe? wilt thou ſay that it is cauſed by the noiſe of that outward thing which giveth the ſound? no! there muſt alſo be ſomewhat that muſt receive the ſound, and qualifie or mix with the ſound, and diſtinguiſh the ſound of what is played or ſung, the outward cannot doe that alone, the inward muſt receive and diſtinguiſh the noiſe; behold, here you finde the beginning of the life, and the Tincture wherein the life conſiſteth: for the Tincture of the crack in the ſpringing up of the life, in the breaking open of the dark Gate, ſtandeth in the ſounding, and hath its Gate open, (next the fire-flaſh neere the eyes), and receiveth the noiſe of whatſoever ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p n="68">68. For the outward ſounding qualifieth with the inward, and is ſevered [or diſtinguiſhed] by the Eſſences: and the Tincture recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all, be it evill or good; and thereby teſtifieth that it ſelfe, with its Eſſences that generate it, are not generated out of the Deity, elſe the Tincture would not let in the evill and [that which is] falſe into the Eſſences of the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="69">69. Therefore wee muſt conſider, that the noiſe in the Tincture of Man is [of a] higher [nature], than [that] in the Beaſts; for Man ſearcheth and diſtinguiſheth all things, which give a ſound, and knoweth from whence it cometh, and how it doth exiſt, which the Beaſts cannot doe, but ſtareth at it, and knoweth not what it is:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57651:91"/>
whereby it may be underſtood, that the Originall of Man, is out of the Eternall: becauſe he can diſtinguiſh all things, that in the Out Birth, came out of the Eternall: and hence it is, that the body, (being all things out of the Eternall nothing, are cauſed to be ſomething which is comprehenſible [or palpable], and yet there, that nothing, is not a meere nothing, but it is a <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>active property.</hi>
                  </note> ſource) after the corrupting ſhall ſtand in the Eternall Figure, and not in the Spirit, becauſe it is not out of the Eternall Spirit: for otherwiſe if it were out of the [Eternall] Spirit, then it ſhould alſo ſearch out the beginning of every thing, as [well as] Man, who in his ſound receiveth and diſtinguiſheth all things.</p>
               <p n="70">70. Thus now the habitation of Mans ſound, wherein the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is, muſt be from Eternity, although indeed in the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> Man hath ſet himſelfe in the corruptibility, and in great want of underſtanding, as ſhall follow here. In like manner alſo wee finde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſmelling: for if the Spirit did not ſtand in the ſound, then no ſmell of any thing would preſſe [or pierce] into the Eſſences: for the Spirit would be whole and ſwelled. But it ſtanding thus in the Gate of the <note n="z" place="margin">Diſrupt.</note> broken darkneſſe in the crack and in the ſound, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every vertue of all things preſſe in, into that Gate, and try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by one another, and what the Eſſences of the Spirit doe love, that it deſireth, and draweth the ſame into the Tincture: and then hands and mouth fall to it, and ſtuffe it into the ſtomack, into the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Atrium.</hi>
                  </note> outward Court of the foure Elements, from whence the earthly Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences of the Starres and Elements doe feede.</p>
               <p n="71">71. And the Taſt alſo is, a trying and attracting of the Tincture in the Eſſences of the Spirit. And ſo the feeling alſo: if the Spirit of Man with its Eſſences did not ſtand in the ſound, there would be no feeling; for when the ſoure Eſſences draw to them, then they awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the bitter prickle [or ſting] in the fire-flaſh, which ſtirreth it ſelfe, either by griping, thruſting, or ſtriking, and thereupon in all dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, the bitter prickle in the fire-flaſh is awakened: and therein ſtandeth the moving; [and] all in the Tincture.</p>

And although it hath nothing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for its labour, but ſcorne and contempt from the world, yet it muſt be obedient to its Lord, for its Lord is mighty, and it ſelfe is fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and its Lord leadeth [driveth] and preſerveth it, and yet in its [ignorance or want of] underſtanding, it knoweth nothing of what it doth, but it liveth like all the Beaſts: and yet its will is [not] to live thus, but it muſt follow the worthy minde, which ſearcheth after the wiſdome of God: and the minde muſt follow the light of Nature: for God manifeſteth [or revealeth] himſelfe in that light, or elſe wee ſhould know nothing of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And now when wee conſider our minde, in the light of Nature; and what that is, which maketh us zealous [or earneſt,] which burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there [in] as a light, and is deſirous [thirſty or covetous] like fire, which deſireth to receive from that place where it hath not ſowen,

and would reape in that Countrey where the body is not at home [or dwelleth not]; then the precious virgin of the Wiſdome of God meeteth us, in the middlemoſt ſeate in the Centre of the light of life, and ſaith: the light is mine, and the [power or] vertue and glory is mine, alſo the Gate of knowledge is mine, I live in the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and without mee you can neither ſee, know, nor underſtand any thing of my vertue, [or power].

There are three things which the minde hath in it, and doe rule it, yet the minde in it ſelfe, is the deſirous will: and thoſe three things, are three Kingdomes, or Principles: one is eternall, and the ſecond is eternall, but the third is corruptible: the one hath no beginning, the ſecond is without beginning, eternally generated: and the third hath a beginning and end, and corrupteth againe [or periſheth].</p>
               <p n="5">5. And as the eternall minde is in the great unſearchable Depth, and from Eternity, is the Indiſſoluble Band, and the Spirit in the <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all working property.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. My beloved Reader, juſt thus is our minde alſo: it is the Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble Band, which God by the Fiat in the moving Spirit breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> out of the Eternall Minde, [from whence] the Eſſences are a particular, or a ſparkle out of the Eternall Minde, which hath the Centre of the breaking, and in the breaking hath the ſharpneſſe in it ſelfe: and that will driveth [forth] the flaſh [or glimpſe] in the breaking, and the ſharpneſſe of the conſuming of the darkneſſe is in the glimpſe [or flaſh] of the willing, and the will is our minde: the glimpſe is the eyes in the fire-flaſh, which diſcovereth it ſelfe in our Eſſences <note n="g" place="margin">The glance of our eyes can look upon the evill and good both within and without us.</note> in us, and without us, for it is free, and hath both the Gates open, that [Gate] in the Darkneſſe, and that Gate in the Light. For although it doe continue in the darkneſſe, yet it breaketh the darkneſſe, and maketh all light in it ſelfe: and where it is, there it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: As our thoughts, they can <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſee into.</hi>
                  </note> ſpeculate a thing that is many miles off, when the body is far from thence, and it may be never was in that place; the diſcovery or glimpſe [or piercing ſight of the eye of the minde] goeth through wood and ſtone, through bones and marrow, and there is nothing that can <note n="i" place="margin">Let or hinder it.</note> withhold it, for it pierceth and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the darkneſſe every where without rending the body of any thing, and the will is its horſe whereon it rideth. Here many things muſt be concealed, becauſe of the Devilliſh Inchantment: (or elſe wee would reveale much more here) for the <hi>Nigromanticus</hi> [or Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancer] is generated here.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But now the firſt will in the minde is out of the ſoure anxiety, and its glimpſe [or diſcovery] in the Originall, is the bitter, ſtrong, [or ſource] fire-flaſh in the ſharpneſſe, which maketh the ſtirring and noiſe, and alſo the ſeeing in the Glance of the ſharpneſſe of the fire-flaſh, that ſo the reconceived Glimpſes [diſcoverings or Glances] in the thoughts] have a light in them from whence they ſee, when they run [along] like a flaſh.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57651:93"/>
Light, there is no ſource of anxiety, but onely meere friendly deſires: for the Glimpſe riſeth up out of the darkneſſe in it ſelfe, and deſireth the light: and the deſiring draweth the light into it ſelfe: and there the anguiſh becometh an exulting joy in it ſelfe, an humble cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a pleaſant habitation: for the re-conceived will in the light, is impregnated, and its fruit in the body, is vertue [or power] which the will deſireth to generate, and to live therein: and this deſiring bringeth the fruit out of the impregnated will, [and preſenteth it] before the will, and the will diſcovereth it ſelfe [glimmereth or ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] in the fruit in an infinite pleaſant number: and there goeth forth, in the pleaſant number, in the diſcovered [or manifeſted] will, the high Benediction [or Bleſſing] favour, loving kindneſſe, pleaſant inclination [or yeelding pliableneſſe], the taſt of joy, the well doing of meekneſſe [or affability], and [further] what my Pen cannot expreſſe: The minde would much rather be freed from vanity, and live therein without moleſtation or diſturbance.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now theſe two Gates are in one another, the nethermoſt goeth into the Abyſſe, and the uppermoſt goeth into Paradiſe: and a third Gate cometh to theſe two, out of the Element with its foure iſſues, and preſſeth in together with the fire, aire, water, and earth; and their kingdome is the Sunne and Starres, which <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>Mingle.</hi>
                  </note> qualifie with the firſt will: and their deſire is to be filled, to ſwell and to be great: theſe draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and fill the Chamber of the Deepe, <hi>[viz.]</hi> the free and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked will in the minde: they bring the Glimpſe [or Glance] of the Starres into the Gate of the Minde, and qualifie with the ſharpneſſe of the Glimpſe [or flaſh]: they fill the broken Gates of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with fleſh, and wreſtle continually with the firſt will (from whence they are gone forth) for the Kingdome [or Dominion], and yeeld themſelves up to the firſt will, as to their Father: which willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth their Region [or Dominion]: for he is obſcure and darke, and they are rough and ſoure, alſo bitter and cold: and their life is a ſeething ſource of fire, wherewith they governe in the Minde, in the Gall, Heart, Lungs, and Liver, and in all Members [or parts] of the whole body, and Man is <note n="m" place="margin">The foure Elements own.</note> their own, the Spirit which ſtandeth in the flaſh, bringeth the Conſtellation into the Tincture of its property, and infecteth the thoughts, according to the Dominion of the Starres: they take the body and tame it, and bring their bitter roughneſſe into it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now the Gate of the Light ſtandeth between both theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, as in one [onely] Centre incloſed with fleſh, and it ſhineth in the Darkneſſe in it ſelfe, and it moveth towards the might of the Darkneſſe and fierceneſſe, and ſheddeth forth its rayes, even unto the noiſe of the breaking through, from whence the Gates of ſeeing, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſmelling, taſting, and feeling, goe forth, and when theſe Gates
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57651:94"/>
apprehend the ſweet, loving, and pleaſant rayes of the Light, then they become moſt highly joyfull, and run into their higheſt Region into the heart (as into their right dwelling-houſe) into the Eſſences, of the Spirit of the ſoule, which receiveth it with joy, and refreſheth it ſelfe therein; and there its Sunne ſpringeth up <hi>(viz.</hi> the pleaſant Tincture in the <note n="n" place="margin">Element<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water.</note> Element of Water) and by the ſweet joy becometh bloud: for all Regions rejoyce therein, and ſuppoſe that they have gotten the Noble virgin againe, whereas it is but her Rayes, as the Sunne ſhineth upon the earth, from whence all Eſſences of the earth, rejoyce, ſpring, grow, and bloſſom. Which is the cauſe that the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture riſeth up in all hearbs and Trees.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And here wee muſt accurately conſider wherein every Region rejoyceth: for the Sun and Starres apprehend not the Divine Light, as the Eſſences of the ſoule [doe] (and yet onely that ſoule which ſtandeth in the new Birth:) but <note n="o" place="margin">The Sunne and Starres.</note> they taſt the ſweetneſſe which hath imprinted [or Imaged] it ſelfe in the Tincture: for the bloud of the heart, wherein the ſoule moveth, is ſo very ſweet, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be compared to it. Therefore hath God by <hi>Moſes</hi> forbidden Man to eate the fleſh in its bloud; for the life ſtandeth in it: For the beaſtiall life ought not to be in Man, that his Spirit be not infected therewith.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The three Regions receive every one of them their light, with the ſpringing up of the Tincture in the bloud: and each [Region] keepeth its Tincture. The Region of the Starres keepeth the light of the Sunne: and the firſt Principle, [keepeth] the <note n="p" place="margin">That is, the Tincture or kindling of the life of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſe.</note> fire-flaſh: and the Eſſences of the holy ſoules receive the moſt deare and precious light of the virgin; yet in this body, onely her Rayes, wherewith ſhee fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the minde againſt the crafty aſſaults of the Devill, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> witneſſeth: and although the Deare light ſtayeth for a while in many in the New-birth [or Regeneration], yet it is not ſteady in the houſe of the Starres and Elements, in the outward Birth, but it dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in its [own] Centre in the Minde.</p>

all unrighteous before God: but according to the Region of this world they are very firme: Thus they counſell the King, and the King giveth it to the Spirit of the ſoule, which gathereth up the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences, and falleth too with hands and mouth: But if they be words [that are to be expreſſed] then it bringeth them to the roofe of the mouth, and there the five Counſellours diſtinguiſh [or ſeparate] them according to the will of the minde: and further [the Spirit bringeth them upon the Tongue, and there the ſenſes [divide or] diſtinguiſh them in the flaſh [Glance, or in a Moment.]</p>
               <p n="23">23. And there ſtand the three Principles in ſtrife.

               <p n="26">26. And if the love of God (which ſo deerly loved the Image of Man, that it ſelfe is become Man) did not ſtand in the Centre of the minde in the [midſt or] <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>parting limit or mark.</hi>

               <p n="29">29. Every <note n="i" place="margin">Animall or living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> Beaſt hath a minde, <note n="k" place="margin">of.</note> having a will, and the five ſenſes therein, ſo that it can diſtinguiſh therein what is good or ill for it: But where remaine the ſenſes in the will [that come] out of the Gates of the Deepe, where the will diſcovereth it ſelfe [or glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth] in the firſt Principle <hi>in infinitum,</hi> [infinitely], out of which the underſtanding proceedeth, ſo that Man can ſee into all things into their Eſſences, how high they are graduated, whereupon followeth the diſtinction [or different articulation] of the Tongue? for if a Beaſt had them, then it could alſo ſpeake, and diſtinguiſh voices, and ſpeake of the things that are in ſubſtance [or beeing] and ſearch into the Originality: But becauſe it is not out of the eternall, therefore it hath no underſtanding in the light of Nature, be it never ſo nimble and crafty: neither doth its ſtrength and force availe to the lifting it up into underſtanding, no it is all in vaine.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Man onely hath underſtanding, and his ſenſes reach into the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57651:97"/>
Eſſences and qualities of the Starres and Elements, and ſearch out the Ground of all things in the Region of the Starres and Elements. And this now hath its Originall in Man, in the Eternall Element, he being created out of the [Eternall] Element, and not out of the Out-Births of the foure Elements: and therefore the Eternity ſeeth into the <note n="l" place="margin">Inceptive.</note> beginning Out-Birth in the corruptibility: and the <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Incepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

               <p n="31">31. But that Man is ſo very blinde and ignorant, or voyde of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is becauſe he lyeth captive in the Regiment [or Dominion] of the Starres and Elements, which many times figure [or faſhion] a wilde Beaſt in the minde of Man, a Lyon, a Wolfe, a Dog, a Fox, a Serpent, and ſuch like: though indeed Man getteth no ſuch body, yet he hath ſuch a minde; of which Chriſt ſpake to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and called ſome of them Wolves, Foxes, and Serpents: Alſo <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſaid ſo of the Phariſees, and wee ſee apparently, how, many men live wholly like Beaſts, according to their beaſtiall minde; and yet are ſo audacious, that they judge and condemne thoſe that live in the Image of God, and <note n="n" place="margin">Tame, or bring under ſubjection.</note> ſubdue their bodies.</p>
               <p n="32">32. But if he ſpeaketh or judgeth any thing well, he ſpeaketh not from the beaſtiall Image of the minde, wherein he liveth, but he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the hidden Man, which is hidden in the beaſtiall [Man], and judgeth againſt his own beaſtiall life; for the hidden Law of the eternall Nature ſtandeth hidden in the beaſtiall Man, and it is in a hard reſtraint, and judgeth [or condemneth] the [malicious] wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <note n="o" place="margin">Fleſhly.</note> carnall minde.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Thus there are three in Man that ſtrive againſt one another, <hi>viz.</hi> the eternall proud malicious anger, [proceeding] out of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginality of the minde. And ſecondly, the Eternall holy chaſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which is generated out of the Originality.

               <p n="34">34. And it is here with the Image of Man, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid; <hi>To whom you give your ſelves as ſervants in obedience, his ſervant you are, whether it be of ſinne unto Death, or of the Obedience of God unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> that driving [or property] you have. If a Man yeeld his minde up to malice, pride, ſelfe, power, and force, to the oppreſſing of the miſerable, then he is like the proud haughty Devill, and he is his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in obedience, and looſeth the Image of God, and out of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage cometh a Wolfe, Dragon, or Serpent to be, all according to his Eſſences, as he ſtandeth figured in the minde.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57651:97"/>
deceit, then the eternall minde figureth him alſo in ſuch an Image as is like an unreaſonable ugly Beaſt and Worme. And although he beare the Elementary Image in this life, yet he hath indeed the Image of an Adder, Serpent, and Beaſt, hidden therein, which will be manifeſted at the breaking [or deceaſing] of the body, and it belongeth not to the Kingdome of God.</p>
               <p n="35">35. But if he give himſelfe up to the Obedience of God, and <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>unite.</hi>

               <p n="36">36. And here in this life he muſt ſtick between the doore and the hinges, between the kingdome of Hell, &amp; the kingdome of this world, and the noble Image muſt ſuffer much wrong, [or to be wounded] for he hath not onely enemies outwardly, but alſo in himſelfe: he beareth the beaſtiall and alſo the helliſh Image of wrath in him, ſo long as this houſe of fleſh <note n="q" place="margin">Laſteth.</note> endureth. Therefore that cauſeth ſtrife and diviſion againſt himſelfe, and alſo without him, againſt the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of the world, which the Devill mightily <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>driveth.</hi>

               <p n="37">37. Now behold thou childe of Man (ſeeing thou art an eternall Spirit) thou haſt this to expect after the breaking [or deceaſing] of thy body; thou wilt be either an Angel of God in Paradiſe, or a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ugly Diabolicall Worme, Beaſt, or Dragon, all according as thou <note n="ſ" place="margin">Haſt behaved thy ſelfe.</note> haſt been inclined [or given] here in this life; that Image which thou haſt borne here in thy minde, with that thou ſhalt appeare: for there can no other Image goe forth out of thy body at the breaking [or deceaſing of it], but even that which thou haſt borne here, that ſhall appeare in Eternity.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Haſt thou been, a proud vain glorious, ſelfviſhly potent, and one that haſt for thy pleaſure ſake oppreſſed the needy, then ſuch a Spirit goeth forth from thee, and then ſo it is in the Eternity, where it can neither keep nor get any thing for [to feed] its covetouſneſſe, neither can it adorne its body with any thing, but with that which is there, and yet it climeth up eternally in its pride: for there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>working riſing proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                  </note> ſource in it, and thus in its riſing it reacheth unto nothing elſe but the ſterne might of the fire in its elevation: it inclineth its ſelfe in its will continually, in ſuch a purpoſe as it did in this world, as it

was wont to doe here, ſo all appeareth in its Tincture, therein it clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up eternally in the Abyſſe of Hell.</p>
               <p n="39">39. But haſt thou been a baſe ſlanderer, lyar, deceiver, falſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous Man, then ſuch a Spirit proceedeth from thee, and that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the Eternity nothing elſe but meere falſhood; it ſpitteth out from its fiery jawes, fiery Darts full of abomination and reproach, it is a continuall ſtirrer and breaker in the fierce ſternneſſe: devouring in it ſelfe, and conſuming nothing: all its [things, beeings, eſſences, works, or] <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath ever been.</hi>
                  </note> ſubſtances appeare in its Tincture: its Image is figured according as its minde hath been here.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Therefore I ſay, a Beaſt is better than ſuch a Man, who giveth himſelfe up into the helliſh Images: for a Beaſt hath no Eternall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, its Spirit is from the Spirit of this world, out of the <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>fragility.</hi>
                  </note> corruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and paſſeth away with the body, till [it come] to the figure without Spirit, that [figure] remaineth ſtanding: ſeeing that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall minde hath by the virgin of the Eternall wiſdome of God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it ſelfe in the Out-Birth, for the manifeſting of the Great Wonders of God, therefore thoſe [creaturely figures] and alſo the figured Wonders, muſt ſtand before <note n="y" place="margin">God, or the eternall minde.</note> him eternally; although no beaſtiall figure or ſhaddow ſuffereth or doth any thing, but is as a ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or painted figure [or limmed Picture].</p>
               <p n="41">41. Therefore in this world all things are given into Mans power, becauſe he is an Eternall Spirit, and all other creatures [are] no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a figure in the Wonders of God: and therefore Man ought well to conſider himſelfe, what he ſpeaketh, doth, and purpoſeth, in this world: for all his works follow after him, and he hath them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally before his eyes, and liveth in them; except it be, that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine new regenerated out of evill and falſhood, through the bloud and Death of Chriſt, in the water and the Holy Ghoſt, and then he breaketh forth out of the helliſh and earthly Image, into an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call [Image] and cometh into another kingdome, into which its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardneſſe [or vices] cannot follow, and that [untowardneſſe, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, or vice] is drowned in the bloud of Chriſt, and the Image of God is renewed out of the earthly and helliſh.</p>
               <p n="42">42. Thus wee are to conſider, and highly to know in the light of Nature, the ground of the Kingdome of Heaven, and of Hell, as alſo, [the ground] of the kingdome of this world, and how Man in the Mothers body inheriteth three kingdomes, and how Man in this life beareth a threefold Image, which our firſt Parents by the firſt ſinne <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
                  </note> inherited for us, therefore wee have need of the Treader upon the Serpent, to bring us againe into the Angelicall Image: and it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Man to tame his body and minde [or bring them under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection] with great earneſtneſſe [and labour], and to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe under the Croſſe: and not to hunt ſo eagarly after pleaſure, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57651:98"/>
and the bravery of this world, for therein ſticketh perdition.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Therefore ſaid Chriſt; <hi>A rich man ſhall b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="44">44. Now if the ſpirit of the ſoule remaine unregenerated in its firſt Principle (which it hath inherited out of the Eternity, with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of its life) then alſo (at the breaking [or deceaſing] of its body) there proceedeth out of its Eternall Minde, ſuch a creature, as its continuall will hath been here in this life.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Now if thou haſt had an envious [ſpitefull] dogged minde, and haſt grutched every thing to others (as a Dog doth with a bone, which himſelfe cannot eate) then there appeareth ſuch a doggiſh minde, and according to that ſource [or property], is its Worme of the ſoule figured, and ſuch a will it keepeth in the Eternity, in the firſt Principle: and there is no revoking, all thy envious wicked proud works appeare in thy <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>active property.</hi>

                  </note> Tincture of the Worme of the ſoule, and thou muſt live eternally therein: nay, thou canſt not conceive or apprehend any deſire [or will] to abſtinence [or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of it] but thou art Gods and the holy ſoules eternall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p n="46">46. For the doore of the Deepe to the light of God appeareth to thee no more: for thou art now a perfect creature in the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and now though thou doſt elevate thy ſelfe, and wouldſt breake open the doore of the Deepe, yet that cannot be [done]: for thou art a whole Spirit, and not meerly in the will onely, wherein the doore of the Deepe can be broken open; but thou flieſt out aloft over the kingdome of God, and canſt not enter in: and the higher thou flieſt, the deeper thou art in the Abyſſe, and thou ſeeſt not God yet, who is ſo neere thee.</p>

               <head>Mans Looking-Glaſſe.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF the Gate of the Deep were not opened to mee in my minde (ſo that I can ſee the ſtrife that is againſt the kingdome of God) then I ſhould alſo ſuppoſe, that the matter [of the Fall] were meerly a Diſobedience about the biting of an Apple, as the Text in <hi>Moſes</hi> barely paſſeth it over, though <hi>Moſes</hi> hath written wholly right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For [the matter] was about the earthly eating and drinking, wherewith the Paradiſicall Man was captivated by the Spirit of this world: which now muſt qualifie [or mix] with all Men. This the Holy Scripture witneſſeth, and alſo Reaſon, that Man is not at home, in the Elementary kingdome of this world: For Chriſt ſaid; <hi>My king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world;</hi> and to his Apoſtles he ſaid; <hi>I have called you out from this world:</hi> Alſo, <hi>Fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Alſo wee ſee that the kingdome of this world, dieth to Man, and [paſſeth away or] breaketh; ſeeing then, that <hi>Adam</hi> did beare the Image of the kingdome of God (which was eternall and uncorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſtood in Paradiſe) therefore wee can with no ground ſay, that he <note n="a" place="margin">Before the Fall.</note> did beare the Image of the kingdome of this world: For this world is tranſitory and <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>fragile.</hi>
                  </note> corruptible: but the Image in <hi>Adam</hi> was not tranſitory, but corruptible: alſo if wee will ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> (before his fall) lived in the ſource [or property] of the foure Elements; then wee can no way maintaine, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not a corruptible Image. For at the end, the foure Elements muſt paſſe away, and goe into the Eternall Element.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſides, he ſhould have been ſubject to the <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſtirring property of the four Elements.</hi>
                  </note> ſource, for heate and cold ſhould have ruled over him; which wee may ſee plainly in <hi>Moſes,</hi> that God firſt after the fall (by the Spirit or Angel of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of this world) made cloathes of ſkins, and put them [then firſt] upon them; as the vaile of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth cover it, that men cannot ſee his face, as is to be ſeene by [the people of] <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Beſides, if he had been meerly of Earth, and of the foure Elements, then he might have been burnt in the fire, or drowned in the water, and be ſtifled in the aire: Alſo wood and ſtone could have bruiſed him and deſtroyed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57651:100"/>
him, and yet it is written, that he [the Adamicall Man] at the Day of the Reſtitution ſhall paſſe through the fire, and be approved, and the fire ſhall not hurt him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now no other Man ſhall riſe [againe] but that which God created in the beginning; for he is created out of the Eternall will, as to his ſoule, which was breathed into him; and his body is created out of the Eternall Element, which was and is Paradiſe: and the foure iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues (of the foure Elements) out of the one [Eternall] Element, <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</hi>
                  </note> are this world, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was not created.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Text in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith; He was created in the Paradiſe in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron;</hi> that is, in the Gate of the Deep between the Deity and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſe of the kingdome of Hell: His body was out of the [one pure] Element, and his Spirit was breathed into him out of the Eternall Minde of God the Father, from the chaſt virgin of the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Love.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For the Element <note n="e" place="margin">As mans body without the Spirit is v yde of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> is without underſtanding, and that is that [which is attracted or] concreted in the will of God, wherein the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Wiſdome of God doth [ſparkle or] diſcover it ſelfe <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> [infinitely], and in that ſpring up, colours, arts, vertues, and the Eternall Wonders: out of which [Element] in the beginning (in the kindling of the fire in the ſterne fierceneſſe) are the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proceeded.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For this is very well to be apprehended and perceived in the earth and ſtones, that the foure Elements are of one onely ſubſtance, and that the earth and ſtones were generated in the fierceneſſe from the kindling of the Elements; For a ſtone is but water; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſhould doe well to conſider, what kinde of fierceneſſe there muſt have been, that hath <note n="f" place="margin">Congealed or knit.</note> drawne the water ſo hard together.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Moreover, the iſſue of the foure Elements may be perceived in the fierceneſſe of the fire, how inſtantly the ſtrong aire goeth forth from the fire; and the ſtone or wood, is nothing elſe but a <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </note> Sulphur from the water and from the earth: and if the Tincture be conſumed by the fierceneſſe, then the [wood or ſtone] would come to aſhes, and at laſt to nothing; as indeed at the end, this world with the foure Elements will come to nothing, and there ſhall remaine nothing elſe of <note n="h" place="margin">The foure Elements.</note> them in the Eternall Element, but the figure and the ſhaddow in the Wonders of God; How then canſt thou thinke that God hath created the Eternall Man out of the foure Elements, or <note n="i" place="margin">That which hath gone forth.</note> Iſſues, which are but corruptible.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yet as concerning <hi>Eve,</hi> wee muſt acknowledge that ſhee was created to this corruptible life, for ſhee is the Woman of this world; and at this time it could not be otherwiſe: for the Spirit of this world with its <note n="k" place="margin">Kinding or life.</note> Tincture, had overcome and poſſeſſed <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that he fell down into a ſleepe, and could not generate out of himſelfe, the Image
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57651:100"/>
of the virgin according to the <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
                  </note> diſcovery of the noble and chaſt virgin (the wiſdome of God) which was the Matrix in him, which was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned [or eſpouſed] to him out of the heavenly <note n="m" place="margin">Out of the heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, ſeede, or ſubſtantiality.</note> 
                  <hi>Limbus;</hi> where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which (in his being overcome) the Elementary Woman was given to him (viz. <hi>Eve)</hi> who (in the Spirit of the worlds over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming) was figured after a beaſtiall forme.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But that wee may in a briefe ſumme give the Reader to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what our knowledge and high <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </note> ſenſe in the light of Nature hath highly apprehended: wee therefore ſet it down thus, according to our knowledge. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Image of God, according to the ſimilitude of God, which God (the holy Trinity in one onely divine ſubſtance) through the virgin of his Eternall Wiſdome, in the wiſdome had [ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted or] <note n="o" place="margin">Foreſeene, or reſolved.</note> diſcovered [or purpoſed] (in the Eternall Element) to have in the roome of the fallen Devill; for his counſell (in the Eternall will) muſt ſtand: there ſhould and muſt be a Throne and Princely Region in this Place, which ſhould manifeſt the Eternall Wonders.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And ſo now God created the Image, and ſimilitude, out of the Eternall Element (in which the Eternall Wonders are Originally) and [God] breathed into him the Spirit of the Eſſences, out of his Eternall Originall will, out of the through broken Gate of the Deepe, where the wheele of the ſtirring and breaking-through, ſtandeth in the Eternall Minde, which reacheth the cleere true and pure Deity of the Heart of God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. This [Image] is not the Heart of God, but it reacheth into the Heart of God, and it receiveth vertue, light and joy from the Heart and Light of God: for it is in the Eternall will of the Father, out of which he [the Father] continually generateth his Heart and Word from Eternity; and <note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Adams</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences.</note> his Eſſences, which, in the Element of his body <hi>(viz.</hi> [in the Element] <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>wanting underſtanding.</hi>
                  </note> of Ignorance in the Eternall Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God), now breathed into him, they (in reſpect of the high triumphing Light, out of the Heart and Light of God) were Paradiſe: his meate and drinke was Paradiſe, out of the <note n="r" place="margin">The one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pure Element.</note> Element, in his will: whereby then he drew the vertue (of the Eternall Wonders of God) into him, and generated the noiſe [voice] ſound, or the Eternall Hymne of the Eternall Wonders of God, out of himſelfe before the will; and all this ſtood before the chaſt, high, noble, and bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, (the Divine Wiſdome) in a pleaſant ſport, and was the right Paradiſe.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But now, what this is, my Pen cannot deſcribe: I rather long after it to comprehend it more in perfection, and to live therein: which wee here in the light of Nature (in the Gate of the Deepe) <note n="ſ" place="margin">Apprehend or underſtand.</note> know and behold: but wee cannot raiſe our threefold minde into it, till our <note n="t" place="margin">Adams <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or this Earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</hi>
                  </note> rough Garment be put off, and then wee ſhall behold it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moleſtation.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:57651:101"/>
15. But becauſe the foure Elements went forth now further out of the [one] Element, and made, with the quinteſſence of the Starres, and with the heart of the Eſſences <hi>(viz.</hi> the Sunne) the third Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, wherein alſo the great Wonders ſtood; and becauſe there was no creature found that could manifeſt thoſe [wonders], but onely that Image and ſimilitude of God <hi>(viz.</hi> Man) who had the chaſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin (the wiſdome of God) in him; therefore the Spirit of this world preſſed ſo hard upon the Image, for the virgin, that it might manifeſt its wonders, and did poſſeſſe Man; from whence he firſt gat the name <hi>Menſch,</hi> [Man], as a mixt Perſon.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But when the Wiſdome of God ſaw, that Man from the Spirit of the world came to luſt, to mingle himſelfe with the foure Elements, then came the Commandement and ſaid: <hi>Thou ſhalt not eate of the knowledge of good and evill;</hi> Now the knowledge of good and evill is not manifeſt in the Paradiſe, and in the kingdome of Heaven, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <note n="u" place="margin">The foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are iſſued or gone forth out of the inward one Element.</note> iſſue out of the Element, in the fierceneſſe, there onely ſtandeth the knowledge of evill manifeſt: and there onely the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are kindleable: and ſo therein Death ſticketh; of which God ſaid, <hi>When thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. God intended that the body which he ſhould get from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the foure Elements, muſt dye: and it did alſo preſently (in his tender <note n="x" place="margin">Virgin-like, or may denly.</note> virgin minde) dye to the Paradiſe, and gat the minde of this world, wherein ſticketh nothing but patching and piecing, as alſo frailty, and at laſt, Death.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But that the foure Elements, with the Sunne and Starres, had ſuch power to preſſe upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and to <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>poyſon him.</hi>
                  </note> infect him, the cauſe of it was, becauſe he was extracted out of them <hi>(viz.</hi> out of the Element; and had (in the Originality) all the three Kingdomes (all three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) in him; and therefore it was that he muſt be tempted whether he could ſtand in the Paradiſe, (in the Kingdome of Heaven): and there, both heavenly, and alſo earthly fruit, was ſet before him.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For the Tree of Temptation was earthly (as now adayes all the Trees are): all the other were Paradiſicall, from which <hi>Adam</hi> could eate Paradiſicall vertue in his mouth, and had no need of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and gutts, for they [the Trees] were like his body and [like] the <note n="z" place="margin">One pure Element.</note> Element, and the Tree of Temptation, was like the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But that <hi>Moſes</hi> preſſeth ſo hard upon it, and ſaith: <hi>God created Man of a lump of Earth;</hi> there the vaile is before his face, ſo that the earthly Man cannot looke him in the face; indeed he was rightly a lump of earth and earth, when he had eaten earthly fruit which God did forbid him; but if <hi>Adam</hi> (before the Fall) had been of the earth earthly, then God would not have forbidden him the earthly fruit; as alſo, if he had been created out of the earthly Element, wherefore
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57651:101"/>
did not the Earthly Element put its cloaths upon him inſtantly with a rough skin? Wherefore did that [Earthly Element] leave Man naked and bare; and when it had plainly poſſeſſed him, yet it left him naked.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh onely of the Tables of God, which were <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>ingraven.</hi>
                  </note> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-through with the Ten Commandements, ſo that they could ſee through them into the Paradiſe: he hung the vaile before his face (as is to be ſeene concerning [the people of] <hi>Iſrael):</hi> becauſe Man was become earthly, and therefore muſt put off the earthly againe, and then he muſt with <hi>Joſua</hi> (or Jeſus) enter into the Paradiſicall Promiſed Land, and not with <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtay in the Wilderneſſe of this world, where the vaile of this world hangeth before him, before the Paradiſe.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Reaſon muſt not imagine, that God ever made any Beaſt out of a lump of Earth, as a Potter maketh a Pot: but he ſaid, <hi>Let there come forth all ſorts of Beaſts, every one after its kinde:</hi> that is, out of all Eſſences, every one after the property of its Eſſence; and ſo alſo it was (by the Fiat) figured according to the property of its own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and in like manner, all Trees, Hearbs, and Graſſe, all at once to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; how then ſhould the Image of God be made out of the fragile [or corruptible] Eſſences? But it [muſt be and] was made in the Paradiſe out of the Eternall [Eſſences]?</p>
               <p n="23">23. The earth is not Eternall, and for the ſake of the fragility [or corruptibility] therefore mans body muſt breake [or periſh]; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath attracted the corruptibility to him; thus alſo the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificall knowledge, delight and joy is departed from him, and he is fallen into the kindled anger, of the kindled foure Elements, which (according to their fierceneſſe,) <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>mingle.</hi>
                  </note> qualifie with the eternall anger in the Abyſſe; although the outward <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>working.</hi>
                  </note> Region of the Sunne is mitigated, ſo that it is a pleaſant habitation, as is ſeene before our eyes; yet if the Sunne ſhould vaniſh away, then thou wouldſt well ſee and feele the anger of God, conſider it well.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Thus it is ſhewed us in the light of Nature, that when <hi>Adam</hi> was thus impregnated [or poſſeſſed] from the Spirit of this world, then God <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>planted.</hi>
                  </note> built [or made] a Garden in <hi>Eden</hi> upon earth, <note n="e" place="margin">In the Divine and Angelicall habitation and joy.</note> in the Paradiſe, and cauſed to grow up, all ſorts of Paradiſicall fruit, pleaſant to behold, and good to eate, and the Tree of the Temptation in the midſt [of the Garden of <hi>Eden]</hi> which had its <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>out-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vertues.</hi>
                  </note> Eſſences from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world; and the other [Trees and Fruits] had Paradiſicall Eſſences.</p>
               <p n="25">25. In this [Garden] now the Image of God ſtood altogether free: it might embrace [and take] what it would, onely the Tree of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that was forbidden; there he was forty dayes in the Paradiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call knowledge, joy, and habitation; where yet there was neither day
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57651:102"/>
nor night to him, but onely the Eternity, he ſaw with his eyes [from or] out of the Divine Power [and vertue]: there was in him, no ſhutting of his eyes: he had no need of the Sunne at all, yet all things muſt ſerve and be ſubject to him. The Out Birth [or iſſue] of the foure Elements did not touch him; there was no ſleepe in him, nor paine, nor feare: A thouſand yeares were to him but as a day: he was ſuch an Image as ſhall riſe at the laſt day: there will riſe no other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, than that which God created in the beginning, therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it well.</p>
               <p n="26">26. But that I have ſaid, that he was forty dayes in the Paradiſe, the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> (Chriſts) Temptation teſtifieth ſo much to mee, as alſo the temptation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> [ſtayings] on the Mount, both which laſted forty dayes: which you may reade in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and concerning the Temptation of Chriſt, and you will finde wonders.</p>

For an angry, malicious, proud, ſelf ſeeking for honour and dignity, mendacious, [or lying] theeving, robbing, murtherous, laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious, lecherous minde, is not the ſimilitude of God; but an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, chaſt, modeſt, pure, courteous [minde] which inclineth it ſelfe with a longing deſire and love to the Heart of God, that is the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of God; in which the fire flaming Spirit in the joy and meekneſſe goeth forth out of the will, and for its brethren, the will of its Spirit (which goeth forth from it) readily inclineth towards them; and as the Proverb ſaith, <hi>Imparteth the very heart to them,</hi> which is done in Spirit, wherein the heavenly joy (in the Eternall Element) ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, and the Wonders of God are manifeſted in the virgin, by a Hymne of praiſe to the Eternall Minde of God; where the minde playeth upon the Harp of <hi>David</hi> an Hymne to God: where then (in the eternall holy Minde) there ſpringeth up knowledge and colours in the [Eternall] Element, and in the Spirit wonders, with works and powers [or vertues].</p>

                  </note> brought forth out of himſelfe; but when the modeſty of the wiſdome, and ability [or potency] departed from him, (when he paſſed into the Spirit of this world) he could not then bring forth [or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57651:105"/>
generate]; for in his ſleepe the Spirit of this world cloathed him with fleſh and bloud, and figured [formed or ſhaped] him into a Beaſt, as wee now ſee by very wofull experience; and know our ſelves to be blinde and naked as to the kingdome of God, [being] without any vertue, [or ſtrength], in the ſleepe of the great miſery, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with corruptible [fraile and tranſitory] fleſh and bloud.</p>
               <p n="56">56. And now when <hi>Adam</hi> awaked from ſleepe, then he was a Man and no Angel: he drew breath from the aire, and therewith kindled his <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>Aſtrall Spirit.</hi>
                  </note> Starry Spirit, which had taken poſſeſſion of him: he knew his wife to be a Woman, and that ſhee was <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                  </note> taken out of him, and tooke her to him, as all Beaſts couple together: yet he had then pure eyes, for the fierceneſſe [or grim wrath] did not yet ſtick in them, but the infection [or longing]: The Element of fire with its bitterneſſe (which qualifieth [or mixeth properties] with the Abyſſe of Hell) had not preſſed him wholly.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Thus now <hi>Adam</hi> with his wife, went (in great luſt and joy) into the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> where <hi>Adam</hi> told her of the Commandement concerning the Tree; But <hi>Eve</hi> (being a Woman of this world) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded it but little, and turned her from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Tree, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it with luſt: and the luſt inſtantly took hold of her: and the lying Devill (when ſhee was talking with him, whom ſhee knew not, neither had heard of any Devill) perſwaded her, and ſhee laid hold on the Tree, and brake off [an Apple] and did eate of the fruit of the foure Elements and Starres, and gave to <hi>Adam;</hi> and when <hi>Adam</hi> ſaw that <hi>Eve</hi> dyed <note n="y" place="margin">By eating.</note> not, then he eate alſo.</p>
               <p n="58">58. And then their eyes were opened, and they knew that they had fleſh and bloud, and were quite naked: for the Spirit of the great World took them captive with the foure Elements, and figured ([or framed in] them) Stomack and Gutts; though indeed in the ſleepe of <hi>Adam</hi> (when the Matrix was ſevered from the <hi>Limbus)</hi> the ſame formes were already figured, but they knew it not, till after the biting of the Apple: and then the Spirit of the fierceneſſe firſt gat in, and made its Region, (as may be ſeene, in the Heart, Liver, Lungs, Gall, and Bladder, as alſo in the Stomack) this Regiment, had <hi>Adam</hi> gotten in his ſleepe, and with the biting of the Apple, the Spirit of the great world hath ſet it ſelfe in that [Government].</p>
               <p n="59">59. And then they looked one upon another, and were aſhamed one before another, and they were afraid of the wrath [or ſeverity] that entered into them, for it was the anger of God; and thus they were captivated by the firſt Principle (as by the Abyſſe of Hell), and held <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> captive in their ſoules in the Eternall [part]: for it ſprung up with terrour, feare, and doubt, concerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: and they could have no comfort, [in that condition]; for they ſaw the Paradiſe no more, but the Garden in <hi>Eden:</hi> ſo alſo
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57651:106"/>
they had loſt the Deity, they could ſet no will [or deſire] into it: for the wrath and doubt ſtood in the way.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Then came the Spirit of this world with its rough Garment, with heate and cold, and preſſed upon them, as upon naked people: and ſo ſtruck the Image of God halfe dead, (with their fierceneſſe, anguiſh, and doubt, with their quality [or property] of hot and cold) and let it lye in paine, anguiſh, and doubt. And here Man went from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (out of the Paradiſe) to <hi>Jericho,</hi> into the houſe of murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who ſtript him of his Paradiſicall Garment, and robbed him, and ſtruck him (with their poyſon, torment, plague, and ſickneſſe, from their infection) halfe dead, and ſo left him and went their way, as the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid in the Goſpel, in a fimilitude [or Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble].</p>
               <p n="61">61. And here now was no remedy, neither in Heaven, nor in this world, they were captivated in hard ſlavery (in miſery and death): the Abyſſe of Hell did hold the ſoule, and the Spirit of this world held the body [captive]: Death and corruption was in the body: and there was nothing elſe in them but enmity to it ſelfe, [proceeding] from the tart Eſſences of the Starres, wherein one ſource [or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty] ſtriveth againſt the other, and one breaketh [or deſtroyeth] the other with greater paine and torment to the body, with trembling and skreeking, and at laſt [comes] corruption and death, as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes.</p>
               <p n="62">62. There the Devill gat the Game: for the kingdome of this world to be his againe, he gat an entrance into Man, and he could reach into the Eſſences of his ſoule; for they were <note n="z" place="margin">Man and the Devill were both in the wrath voyde of grace.</note> now both in one kingdome.</p>
               <p n="63">63. He [the Devill] ſuppoſed [ſaying] the kingdome of this world is thine, thou ſhalt ſport thy ſelfe according to thy power, with the Image of Man, which ſhould have poſſeſſed thy Throne his Spirit is in thy kingdome: and ſo [the Devill] mocked God in his minde; [ſaying] Where is now thy noble Image, which thou didſt create to Rule over my Throne? am not I Lord of the great Might of the fire? I will rule over thy Throne, the might [or ſtrength] and vertue is mine: I flie up above the Thrones of vertue and ſtrength, and no might [or power] can withſtand mee.</p>
               <p n="64">64. Yes indeed he flieth up above the Thrones: but he cannot flie into the Thrones; he flieth up in the firſt eternall ſource of fire, which is ſterne, ſoure, dark, hard, cold, rough, and burning; but he cannot get through the open Gate of the Deepe, into the Light of God, but he flieth up aloft in his Abyſſe, in the Eternity, in the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſource [or quality] of Hell, and reacheth nothing elſe. And therefore he is a Prince, (though in the Abyſſe of Hell,) which was well enough knowne to Man after his miſerable Fall.</p>
               <p n="65">
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:57651:106"/>
65. And becauſe I may not be well underſtood by the Reader, in that I write, that Man dwelleth in the Abyſſe of Hell with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills; therefore I will ſhew him the ground, that he may touch and handle it: and if he will not feele it, yet it is given to him that he may know it, and it ſhall be a witneſſe againſt him.</p>
               <p n="66">66. It is not without a cauſe, that Chriſt calleth the Devill a Prince of this world, for he is ſo, according to the firſt Principle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the kingdome of wrath, and continueth ſo to Eternity; but he is not ſo, according to the kingdome of the foure Elements and Starres; for if he had full power in that, then there would be no vegetative [fruit] nor living creature upon the Earth: he cannot maſter the <note n="a" place="margin">That which proceedeth, or iſſueth.</note> exit of the foure Elements: for he is in the Originality, and there is a [whole] Principle between; onely when the <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>aſpects of the Starres.</hi>
                  </note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations doe awaken the fierce wrath of the fire, in the Elements, as in a tempeſtuous ſtorme, then he is Maſter Jugler [in miſchiefe] and rejoyceth himſelfe [therein:] though indeed he hath no power there neither, except it be permitted to him from the anger of God, then he is the Hangman [or Executioner], and executeth the <note n="c" place="margin">The Sentence, Judgement, or Juſtice.</note> Right as a Servant [Miniſter or Officer], but not as a Judge, but as an Executioner.</p>
               <p n="67">67. He is Executioner in the kingdome of this world, the Starres are the Councell, and God is the King of the Land, and whoſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from God, falleth into the Councell of the Starres, which run many upon the ſword, and make them lay violent hands upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and [bring] ſome to a Rope, others to the water: and there he is very buſie, and is the Driver or Executioner.</p>
               <p n="68">68. Into this great miſery Man is fallen; and he is fallen quite <note n="d" place="margin">Into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</note> home to the kingdome of the Starres and Elements, as to his body, what theſe doe with him, that he is, and that ſtandeth in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; they make one great, another ſmall: one ſtraight, another ſtooping and crooked: they ſend one fortune and riches, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poverty: of one they make a crafty ſubtill Man according to the counſell and kingdome of this world, and of another they make an Ideot, they make one a King, and they breake and pull downe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: one they kill, another they bring into the world: and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually drive the minde of Man, yet into nothing elſe but into vaine turmoile, diſcontent, and vexation.</p>

If wee did well conſider the abominations and great ſinnes of Man before God, which our firſt Parents inherited for us, then wee ſhould ſcarce ever be merry in this world at all, if the Spirit of this world did not caſt fooliſh fancies, and ſeeming joyes and pleaſures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, in our impriſonment; or if the Regeneration did not cauſe us ſo highly to rejoyce that wee ſhall once be delivered out of this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for in this life, wee finde nothing elſe but meere abomination, ſinne, miſery and death, and ſcarce attaine (in this [temporary] life) ſo much as a glimpſe of the Eternall Joy.</p>
               <p n="71">71. Now the minde asketh, What is ſinne then? How is it ſinne? Wherefore hath God a loathing againſt the ſubſtance which he hath created? Behold thou childe of Man, there is no ſinne in Heaven in the preſence of God: onely in thy ſelfe there is ſinne, and ſinne ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth us and our God aſunder: otherwiſe all things are fix, [or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect], and good, in their own beeing [or ſubſtance]; the kingdome of Hell and of wrath is good in it ſelfe, according to its [own] Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it doth not vex or torment it ſelfe: but its woe [paine or ſmart] is its birth, and the riſing of its ſource; alſo it deſireth nothing elſe.</p>
               <p n="72">72. And ſo alſo the Kingdome of this world is fix [or perfect] and good, in it ſelfe: neither doth it vex or torment it ſelfe; but the elevating of the Elements <hi>(viz.</hi> the kindling of the heate, cold, aire, and water,) is its growing and ſpringing: neither doth it torment it ſelfe in it ſelfe; nor hath it any diſtreſſe or feare in it ſelfe.</p>

               <p n="84">84. And ſo inſtead of the Paradiſicall Joy and refreſhment, there hath been a meere Brimſtone-Spirit, which ſtandeth in anguiſh and trembling of corruption [or fragility]; which kindleth the Tincture of the Bloud, wherein tearing, ſtinging, and tormenting is wrought; and if the fire in the Brimſtone Spirit be too much kindled, then it burneth the Tincture up, and the light of Life goeth out, and then the body falleth away to be a dead carkaſſe: and if the tart ſoure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be kindled too much by the hard attracting and holding, then alſo the light of Life goeth out, and the body periſheth; ſo alſo of the water; if the Tincture kindleth it ſelfe in the meekneſſe, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh

               <p n="85">85. Thus, in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> (after the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Apple) there ſprung up the firſt fruit in the Gate of the Deepe, where the ſoule ſtandeth before God, and qualifieth [or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] with the will of the Juſtice of the Father: who ſetteth his will before him (in the breaking of the Darkneſſe) in the light of the Meekneſſe, and continually generateth his beloved Heart and Sonne (in the vertue of the meekneſſe of the will) <hi>viz.</hi> his Eternall Word, from Eternity.</p>
               <p n="86">86.

               <p n="87">87. But when he ſet his <note n="g" place="margin">Thoughts, minde, deſire, or lust.</note> Imagination in the kingdome of this world, then the bright and cleere will of his ſoule, drew the ſwelled kingdome of the out-Birth to the ſoule into its will: and ſo the pure Paradiſicall ſoule became darke, and the Element of the body did get the <note n="h" place="margin">The concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, maſſe, or lump.</note> 
                  <hi>Meſch</hi> or <hi>Maſſa,</hi> which the will of the ſoule of the minde attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Element [of the body]; and then he was a fleſhly Man, and gat the fierceneſſe of the firſt Principle, which the ſtrong break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through to God, in the Gate of the Deepe, did make to be hard <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>joynts.</hi>

               <p n="88">88.

               <p n="89">89. Therefore the Providence of God (when <hi>Adam</hi> fell into long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [deſire or luſt]) environed that vertue and ſtrength, with the might of the firſt Principle <hi>(viz.</hi> with the might of the Starres and ſharpneſſe of God) that the ſource [or quality] of the firſt and third Principle, might not ſo eaſily touch it; and this was done in <hi>Adams</hi> ſleepe, when God built <hi>Adam</hi> to [or for] this world, from whence

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith; <hi>That the naturall Man was created in the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible life of this world:</hi> which was done at the Temptation of <hi>Adam,</hi> at that time when God made his naturall wife out of him: but he was a holy Image before, and <note n="l" place="margin">The Adami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Man.</note> he muſt be the ſame againe in his Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Laſt Day.</p>
               <p n="90">90.

               </p>
               <p n="92">92. Here it may be ſeene very plainly, that the Devill had loſt his Angelicall Image: and cometh now in the forme of a Serpent, with his murtherous lying, and <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>deceiveth.</hi>

that ſhee ſhould be therein like God; the Devill mingled lyes and truth together, and ſaid, <hi>Shee ſhould be as God:</hi> but he meant, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Kingdome of this world, and according to the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the [fierce] wrath: and let Paradiſe out; But <hi>Eve</hi> underſtood it, that ſhee ſhould continue in the Paradiſe, in the divine and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Joy.</p>
               <p n="93">93. Therefore it is not good to prattle with the Devill, he is a lyar and murtherer from the beginning of his kingdome, and a theefe alſo, he cometh onely to murther and to ſteale, as here [with <hi>Eve]:</hi> and the Devill is the higheſt cauſe of the Fall: for he ſtrewed <note n="r" place="margin">The ſweetnes of ſinne.</note> Sugar up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that he imagined [or luſted] after the kingdome of this world; though <hi>Adam</hi> indeed did not ſee him, yet he ſlipt into the Eſſences of the [fierce, ſoure] ſternneſſe: and did there ſtrow Hells-Paradiſicall-Sugar before him, ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> luſted.</p>
               <p n="94">94. But becauſe he beguiled <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> with his Sugar, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath prepared ſuch a dwelling houſe for him, as <hi>Adam</hi> lets forth (from the <note n="ſ" place="margin">From the earthly volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe, and dainty delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the Dung.</note> earthly Sugar) at the nethermoſt Exit: and that ſhall be left for him at the corruption of the Earth, when it goeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its Ether; and then that pleaſant ſmell of the ſtinck of ſinne and abominations (in the kingdome of the fierce wrath) ſhall remaine for him, and that Sugar he ſhall eate Eternally, and frame his will continually therein to get other Sugar in the <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>Oven.</hi>

               <p n="95">95. And now when theſe two thus captivated by the Devill and this world, ſtood before God with feare and great horrour, and felt the anger of God, and the ſevere Judgement: then the Heart of God, which had made them pittied them, and it <note n="u" place="margin">Appeare, or diſcover it ſelf to ſee.</note> did look whether there were any [remedy or] counſell that might help poor Man, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme [or deliver] him from the Bands of the Eternall [fierceneſſe or] wrath, and from the mortall body of this world: but there was nothing found, neither in Heaven, nor in this world, that could make them free, there was no Principality or Throne-Angel, which had the ability to doe it: all was loſt, they were in the Eternall Judgement of the Temporall and Eternall Death. For the firſt Principle had cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated them, in the Spirit of the ſoule, and qualified [or mingled] with the ſoule; the Kingdome of Heaven in the Light was ſhut up and there was a firme encloſure] of a whole Principle between,

               <p n="96">96. Then the Devill mocked the Image, and Hell opened its jawes wide, and had the bridle in their Eſſences, and continually drew them therewith towards the helliſh fire of the fierce wrath: and then there was trembling and horrour in the minde, and they could not reach the love of God: Heaven was their Enemy, no Angel came neere them, but the horrible Devills, they ſhewed themſelves, and hooped, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ho, ho! wee have gotten the Game, wee are Princes over Men, wee will torment them ſoundly, becauſe they would have poſſeſſed our Throne: wee ſhould have been their footſtoole, and now wee are their Judges; what care wee for God, he dwelleth not in our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: wherefore hath he thruſt us out, wee will be ſure to wreake our ſpleene upon his Image.</p>

               <p n="97">97. Now when no counſell [or remedy] was found, and that Man was ſunk downe into Hell, to the great Triumph of the Devills: then ſaid God to the Serpent (the Devill;) <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done thus; be thou curſed; and the ſeede of the Woman ſhall tread upon</hi> [or break] <hi>thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe</hi> [or <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſting.</hi>

               <p n="98">98. <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth here as if the Serpent had beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God curſed it, [and ſaid] <hi>That it ſhould eate Earth, and creepe upon its belly;</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> here putteth the vayle before our eyes, that he cannot be looked in the Face: for all Prophecies ſtand in dark words, that the Devill may not know [nor apprehend them] and learne the Times, and that he may not ſtrow his falſe ſeede, before the wonders of God appeare; as may be ſeene in all the Prophets, who propheſied of the Treader upon the Serpent.</p>
               <p n="99">99. Wee know, that the Devill ſlipt into the Serpent, and ſpake out of the Serpent; for God did not meane [by it] that the Treader upon the Serpent, ſhould tread upon the head of the beaſtiall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: but that he ſhould deſtroy the Devill and the Abyſſe of Hell. But that was the Puniſhment of the Beaſtiall Serpent, that it ſhould
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57651:111"/>
remaine a poyſonous Worme, without feete, and eate Earth, and have communion with the Devill; for ſo all Evill Spirits in Hell appeare, in their own forme, according to their ſource [or quality] as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, Dragons, horrible Wormes and evill Beaſts.</p>
               <p n="100">100. This now the Devill did not underſtand: becauſe God ſpake of the Serpent, and curſed it to [be] a horrible Worme, and he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that it did not concerne him: neither doth he yet know his own judgement, he knoweth onely what he learneth from Men, that doe <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>Propheſie.</hi>
                  </note> declare [things] in the Spirit of God; yet the Spirit of God doth not wholly intimate his Judgement to him, but all in the Depth, afarre off, ſo that he cannot wholly underſtand it. For to the enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened Men, all Propheſies (even concerning the wickedneſſe of Men) are thus given, and they dare not ſet them downe clearer, that the Devill may not wholly learne the Counſell of God, and ſtrow his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar upon it: though in this place there are very excellent things, that ought not to be revealed to the world, for they remaine till the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; that the Devill may bring no new ſects into it, and lead men into doubt; and therefore they ſhall be paſſed over till the time of the Lilly.</p>
               <p n="101">101. So now when wee conſider the great love and mercifulneſſe, in that he hath turned to Man; wee finde cauſe enough to write and teach theſe <note n="a" place="margin">Matters or wonderous works and deeds.</note> things: for it concerneth our eternall Salvation, and Redemption out of the Jawes of Hell; therefore I will ſet downe the ground of the promiſed Meſſiah, that the following writings may be the better underſtood, eſpecially <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Booke of the Law; where there is need of it; now he that will ſee nothing, God help, he muſt needs be blinde; for the time of the viſitation of the hardned Jewes, Turks, and Heathens, cometh now. Whoſoever will ſee, let them ſee: the Lamps for the Bridegroome are ſhortly to be kindled: he cometh, whoſoever deſireth to be a Gueſt, let him prepare him a Wedding-Garment.</p>
               <p n="102">102. Now, ſaith Reaſon, how could <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> know what God meant by the Treader upon the Serpent? Indeed, they did not wholly &amp; altogether know; onely they ſaw that the Devill muſt depart from them, and not ſhew himſelfe outwardly any more; but the minde (in the Centre, of the breaking through of the life, into the Element, into the preſence of the chaſt and modeſt virgin, the wiſdome of God) that underſtood it well: for <note n="b" place="margin">Man.</note> he lodged a precious and worthy Gueſt; for the Word (which God the Father ſpake concerning the Treader upon the Serpent) went out of the Heart, and out of the Mouth of God, and that was the ſparke of Love [proceeding] out of the Heart of God, which was from Eternity in the Heart of God, wherein God the Father had knowne and elected Mankinde (before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World were laid) that they ſhould live therein; and that

               <p n="103">103. And this is it which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid; <hi>That Man is elected in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world,</hi> and not thoſe dregges of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire that are now taught about the Election of Grace: they are not the right underſtanding; I will ſhew thee <hi>Pauls</hi> [meaning about] his Election of Grace, in its due place, when I ſhall write of the <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p n="104">104. As is mentioned above; ſo hath that ſame Word out of the Heart of God (which God ſpake to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve)</hi> Imaged [or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med] it ſelfe in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> in the light of the Life in its own Centre; and eſpouſed it ſelfe with the deare and worthy <note n="e" place="margin">The wiſdome of God.</note> virgin of chaſtity, to continue eternally with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and to defend them from the fiery Eſſences and Darts of the Devill: as alſo if they would incline to that ſame Word, that then they ſhould thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the rayes of the holy Trinity, and alſo the wiſdome of the virgin.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Therefore let every one looke to it, and take heed of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing holy hypocrites and flatterers, for they are Antichriſts (and not Chriſts) Miniſters [or ſervants]; for Antichriſt hath ſet his foote upon the breadth of the Earth, and rideth upon the abominable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Beaſt, which is as Great as himſelfe and indeed Greater: Therefore it is highly neceſſary, that every one feele [or groape] in his own boſom, and conſider his heart how it is inclined, that he doe not deceive himſelfe, and unknowne to himſelfe, yeeld himſelfe to be the [ſervant or] Miniſter of Antichriſt, and fulfill that Propheſie; for <note n="b" place="margin">Antichriſt.</note> he ſtandeth now <note n="c" place="margin">Manifest.</note> in the light of the eyes: the time of his viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is at hand: he ſhall be manifeſted in the light of the life.

               </note> fierceneſſe, the time is neere.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now when poore fallen Man (viz. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve)</hi> ſtood thus (in great feare, horrour, and trembling) being faſt bound with the bands of the Devill, and of Hell, in great ſcorne and ſhame before the Heaven and Paradiſe; Then God the Father appeared to them, with his angry minde of the Abyſſe, into which they were fallen, and his moſt loving heart went (forth through the Word of the Father) in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>oppoſed.</hi>
               </note> placed it ſelfe before the wrath, highly in the Gate of Mans life, and enlightened the poore ſoule againe, yet they could not comprehend it in the Eſſences of the ſoule: but received the Rayes of the Almighty Power, whereby <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> became <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</hi>
               </note> glad againe: and yet ſtood trembling (by reaſon of the wrath [or fierce horrour or grimneſſe] that was in them, and heard the ſentence which God pronounced: for God ſaid <hi>(becauſe thou haſt eaten of the Tree whereof I told thee that thou ſhouldſt not eate) curſed be the ground for thy ſake, with care thou ſhalt maintaine thy life thereon all thy life long, Thornes and Thiſtles ſhall it bring forth to thee: and thou ſhalt eate the hearb of the field, till thou become Earth againe, from whence thou wert taken: for thou art now Earth, and to Earth you ſhall returne againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Here now ſtand the great ſecrets (which wee cannot ſee with <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>with the eyes of reaſon.</hi>
               </note> our earthly eyes) wholly naked and plaine, and there is no vayle before it, onely wee are blinde to the kingdome of God, for God cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Earth and ſaid, it ſhould now beare Thornes and Thiſtles, and

Man <note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>muſt.</hi>
               </note> ſhould eate the fruit of the accurſed Earth; This indeed is a new thing. He allowed them not in Paradiſe, to eate of the earthly hearbs, but of the pleaſant fruit. And if he had eaten of the hearbs of the fields, yet that which he had eaten, was heavenly; and when the Lord curſed the Earth, then all became earthly: and the holy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was withdrawne, and the fruit did grow in the iſſuing of the foure Elements, in the kindling of the fierceneſſe, out of which Thornes and Thiſtles grew.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Wee muſt conceive, that there <note n="i" place="margin">Before the Curſe.</note> was then a very pleaſant habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Earth: for all the fruits did grow [ſpring and bud] out of the hidden Element (through the fierceneſſe of the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments); and although the foure Elements had alſo their fruits, yet Man ſhould not, (but the Beaſts of the field ſhould) have eaten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but now when the Lord curſed the Earth, then the Element with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from the roote of the Fruit; (for Gods curſing is nothing elſe, but his flying from a thing) and thus Gods holineſſe is flien from the roote of the fruit, and ſo the roote [of the fruits] remaineth in the foure Elements; in the out-birth; and <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were alſo fallen <note n="k" place="margin">Into the four Elements.</note> thereinto: and thus now like came to like: his body alſo was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come earthly, and muſt turne to Earth againe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But that God did ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt turne to Earth from whence thou wert taken,</hi> that is alſo very true: but the underſtanding is [hidden] in the Word, and the earthly vayle hangeth before it, wee muſt looke under the vayle. For <hi>Adam</hi> was taken out of the earth, not out of the foure iſſuings of the Elements, [but he was] an Extract out of the Element, which qualified [or mingled] with the Earth: But when he fell into the foure Elements, then he became Earth, as alſo, fire, aire, and water: and now what ſhould the Beaſtiall Man doe [with] the heavenly Paradiſicall fruit, he could not <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>enjoy it.</hi>
               </note> eate of it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth not caſt his heavenly kingdome to beaſts and ſwine, but it belongeth to Angels.</p>
            <p n="7">7. So alſo it is very cleere and manifeſt, that (before the curſe) there grew ſuch venomous [or poyſonous] Thornes and Thiſtles, and poyſonous fruits: and if God had not curſed the Earth (from the [one] Element), then no Beaſt ſhould have been ſo fierce and [miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous or) evill; for God ſaid; <hi>Let the Earth be curſed for thy ſake.</hi> From whence now is alſo ariſen the diſobedience of the Beaſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man, and their wildneſſe, [or flying in their face] as alſo, that they are ſo [cruell] fierce [miſchievous] and evill, and that Man muſt hide himſelfe from their fierce rage [and fury] whereas God (in the Creation) gave all into his power, all Beaſts of the field ſhould be in ſubjection under him, which now is cleane contrary: for Man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Wolfe to them [in devouring the Beaſts] and they are [like] Lyons againſt him, and there is meere Enmity againſt one another: he can ſcarce order the tame Beaſts, much leſſe the wilde.</p>

8. And wee are to know, that there was a great difference in the Beaſts before the curſe: for ſome <hi>(viz.</hi> the tame ones) were very neer a-kinne to the Element, with whom Man ſhould have had joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; on the contrary, ſome <hi>(viz.</hi> the wilde ones, which flie from Man) [were very neere a-kinne] to the foure Elements: for the <note n="m" place="margin">The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reaſon why one beaſt was better than another.</note> cauſes of thoſe wonders ſtuck wholly in the Eſſences, and they were very well knowne and ſeene in the light of the life in the knowledge of the <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>Divine Wiſdome.</hi>
               </note> virgin: there is nothing ſo deepe that Man cannot ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſee it moſt <note n="o" place="margin">Infallibly.</note> aſſuredly, if he doe but put away the vayle, and look (through the Tables <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Law.</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>face, thou ſhalt eate thy Bread, till thou turne to Earth againe.</hi> Here now all is cleere [and manifeſt] in the light: for he had loſt the heavenly fruit, which grew for him without labour [or toyle of his]; and now he muſt dig and delve in the earth, and ſow and plant, and ſo in the foure Elements muſt get fruit, in cares, labour, toyle and miſery; for while the Element or the vertue [or power] out of the Element, ſprung forth through the Earth, there was ſo long, a continuall laſting roote to the fruit; but when the Element (by the curſe) withdrew, then the <note n="s" place="margin">Or, <hi>frazen.</hi>
               </note> congealed Death, frailty, and tranſitory fading, was in the roote, and they muſt now continually be <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted.</hi>
               </note> planted againe: Thus the turmoyling life of Man took beginning, wherein wee muſt now <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſwelter our ſelves.</hi>
               </note> bath our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="10">10. God could well have created creatures which ſhould have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the Beaſts, [ſo] that Man might well have ſtayd (in Paradiſe) in the Angelicall forme: and beſides that, there are already, in all the foure Elements, creatures without a ſoule; God would well have laid the labour [or charge] (of managing the Beaſts), upon another generation which were alſo <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>of the four Elements.</hi>
               </note> earthly: But he ſaw well that Man would not ſtand, therefore inſtantly the burthen was laid upon him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo writeth of it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But if God <note n="y" place="margin">Had deſired.</note> would have had Beaſtiall Men, then he would have created them ſo in the beginning, and given them no Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement (neither ſhould they have been tempted) as indeed the Beaſts have no <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement laid upon them.</hi>
               </note> Law.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Therefore all Objections, which fall into Reaſon, are nothing elſe but the ſubtle contradictions [or fallacies] of the Devill, who would very faine maintaine, that God did will the Fall of Man: There are alſo Men, that dare to ſay, that God did will it: [and ſay] that he fitted the tongue of the Serpent to ſeduce <hi>Eve;</hi> whoſe judgement is very juſtly upon themſelves, becauſe they [offer to] confirme the Devils word with lying, and [goe about to] make God a lyar.</p>
            <p n="13">13. 'Tis very true, according to the firſt Principle <hi>(viz.</hi> the Abyſſe of Hell) he hath willed it: but that kingdome is not called God:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57651:115"/>
there is yet another Principle and faſt incloſure between; but in the ſecond Principle (where God <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe.</hi>
               </note> appeareth) he hath not willed it; Indeed all is Gods: But the firſt Principle is the Band of Eternity, which maketh it ſelfe: from whence God the Father iſſueth forth from Eternity, into the ſecond Principle; and therein he generateth his Heart and Sonne [from Eternity to Eternity] and there the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt goeth forth from the Father and the Sonne, and not in the firſt [Principle] and Man is created for the ſecond Principle.</p>
            <p n="14">14. And therefore alſo the Heart of the ſecond Principle (by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) hath new regenerated him [Man] (out of the Band of the firſt Principle) and delivered him from the harſh [or wrathfull] Band: and each [Principle] ſhall ſtand, to it ſelfe, in its own Eternity: And yet God alone is Lord and alone Almighty; but the Eternall Band is Indiſſoluble, or elſe the Deity alſo would be diſſoluble; but now all muſt be to his honour, glory, and joy: and he is alone the Creator of all things: and all muſt ſtand [naked] before him: as the Scripture ſaith; <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee, and rejoyce, when the wicked are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced;</hi> whereas in the ſecond Principle, there is no deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge <note n="b" place="margin">As the light of the fire doth not conſume any thing.</note> at all: but in the ſharpneſſe of the breaking through out of the firſt [Principle] into the ſecond, where the ſoule ſtraineth through from the torment into the joy, there it rejoyceth that the <note n="c" place="margin">Hunter or Tormentor.</note> Driver (who plagued [and vexed] it) is impriſoned, and becauſe now it is ſecurely freed from him; even as it is the joy of the Kingdome of Heaven, that the Devill (in the firſt Principle) is impriſoned, ſo that he cannot moleſt the Heaven any more, and kindle the habitation of the Element.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Therefore there is alſo very great Joy in Heaven, (<note n="d" place="margin">At.</note> for this world,) becauſe there is a Principle generated, ſo that the Devill can make no more uſe of the fierce wrath (which he powred forth and kindled in the time of his Creation): but is impriſoned between the <note n="e" place="margin">The ſecond and the third.</note> two Principles, which are both Good.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Thus you muſt underſtand what it is [or meaneth] when the Scripture ſpeaketh of revenging the ungodly, that there is joy in the Saints, at it; for the fierce wrath [or grimneſſe] and the ſource [or torment] of Hell is the <note n="f" place="margin">As the fires conſuming is the joy of the light.</note> Joy of the Heaven: for if there were no ſource [or paine], there would be <note n="g" place="margin">As there would be no light without fire.</note> no flowing up [or ſpringing]: but if the light cometh [to be] in the fierce [auſtere, ſoure] ſource, then there is meere Joy: and in the Darkneſſe there is a peculiar en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in it ſelfe, and therein is the Eternall Worme generated.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Therefore wee muſt know, that (God as he is all in all) ſo where he is not (in the love) in the light, there he is (in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) in the fierceneſſe, and ſource [or torment]; for before the time of the Creation there was nothing but the ſource, and over it the Deity, which continueth in Eternity: there is no other ground: you

Then God choſe to himſelfe the Generation of <hi>Sem,</hi> (which did cleave to the Word) that ſo he might erect a light and office of Preaching, that the world might learne from them. But all availed nothing: the Starres ruled Men according to their ſource [or quality] in meere cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, unchaſtity, and pride; which was indeed ſo very great that they purpoſed to build a Tower, whoſe top ſhould reach to Heaven: ſuch blinde people they were as to the kingdome of God.</p>

And this forming [or Imaging]
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57651:119"/>
is done in the twinckling of an eye, wholly and perfectly without any defect: and there is nothing at all happened to it the more, with the length of time.</p>
               <p n="46">46. And the third forming was together in the ſame twinckling of an eye, with the other formings alſo at once (out of the [pure] Element,) produced (juſt as if an earthly ſeede were ſowen, out of which a whole childe ſpringeth ſorth) and took its beginning natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: and the new creature (in perfection of the Element) was the Maſculine ſeede of the earthly Man, which the earthly Matrix of the virgin, conceived in the boſom of the virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> yet the earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe defiled not the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the New Creature in the holy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the word of the Deity (which was the mark of the limit of ſeperation) did hinder that.</p>
               <p n="47">47. And the Angelicall Image, as to the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the [holy pure] Element, came naturally to be fleſh and bloud, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and figuring of all naturall Regions of humane members, as all the children of Men: and attained his naturall ſoule in <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>in the end.</hi>
                  </note> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third Moneth, as all other children of <hi>Adam:</hi> which hath its ground out of the firſt Principle: and hath raiſed up its Throne and ſeate, into the Divine Element, into the Joy [or habitation] wherein it ſat (in the Creation) in <hi>Adam;</hi> and there hath attained its Princely Throne (in the Kingdome of Heaven, before God) again, out of which it was gone forth, with ſinne, in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="48">48. And thither the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> (with his becoming Man) brought it in againe, and [there] (as a loving childe) was bound up, with the Word of God, in love and righteouſneſſe. And there the new creature (out of the Element) came to be the body of the ſoule. For in the new Creature of the <hi>Limbus</hi> of God, the ſoule was holy: and the Earthly Eſſences (out of fleſh and bloud) clave to it, in the time of the earthly body: which [Eſſences] Chriſt (when his ſoule with the new creature went into Death) left in Death: and (with the new body in the naturall ſoule) aroſe from Death, and triumphed over Death: as hereafter you ſhall ſee the wonders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="49">49. But that the ſoule of Chriſt, could be generated both in the new, and alſo in the old earthly creature: is becauſe the Gate of the ſoule in the firſt Principle, ſtandeth in the ſource [or quality] of the Eternity, and reacheth into the Deep Gate of the Eternity, in the Fathers Originall will, wherewith he breaketh open the Gate of the Deep, and ſhineth [or appeareth] in the Eternall Light.</p>
               <p n="50">50 Now then as the Word of God is in the Father, and goeth forth out of the Father into the [pure] Element, and that the ſame Word was given to Man againe in the Fall, (from out of the [holy] Element, through the voyce of the Father, with the promiſe of th
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57651:119"/>
Treader upon the Serpent) out of Grace, in the Centre of the light of life; ſo the naturall ſoule of Chriſt, with its firſt kindling in its Centre of the light of life (where the Word, with the conſent of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had ſet it ſelfe, by the Word in the Father of Eternity) received the Principle of the Father in the Light.</p>
               <p n="51">51. Thus Chriſt (<note n="c" place="margin">In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or way.</note> according to this forme) was the naturall Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sonne of God the Father: and the ſoule of Chriſt (in the Word) was a ſelfe ſubſiſting naturall Perſon in the Holy Trinity.</p>
               <p n="52">52. And there is in the Depth of the Deity, no ſuch wonderfull Perſon more, as this Chriſt is: which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calleth (in the Spirit highly knowne by him) Wonderfull, Power [or vertue, Champion or] Saviour, Eternall Father, and Prince of Peace: whoſe Dominion is great, and upon his ſhoulders; <note n="d" place="margin">Over the creatures of the inward Element.</note> underſtand [upon] the creatures of the Element.</p>
               <p n="53">53. And the ſecond Birth of the ſoule of Chriſt, ſtood in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propagation, like [the ſoules of] all men: for he alſo as well [as other Men] was in ſix Moneths wholly figured [framed or formed], with a naturall body and ſoule, with all the Gates of the Minde and ſenſes; the ſoule in the firſt Principle, and the body in the third Principle, and then Chriſt (the true breaker through) continued ſtanding in the ſecond Principle, in the Kingdome of God: and after nine Moneths was borne a Man, out of the body [or womb] of the virgin <hi>Mary, and wee ſaw his Glory as the Glory of the onely begotten Sonne of God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="54">54.

77. And while the Faith of the Living [at the time of thy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers] was yet ſomewhat good and pure ([as] to the kingdome of God) ſtill, (and they did not ſeek their Bellies and pomp [as they doe now]) therefore their Faith [or Beliefe] pierced into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, into the [pure] Element, to the Saints [or holy ſoules]: who thus did alſo naturally appeare with Works of Wonders [or Miracles] to the Living Saints (in their Element) in the ſtrong Faith, which [Works of Wonder] were onely comprehended [or taken hold of] in the Faith, and that <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly did not partake of them.</hi>
                  </note> not imparted to the ungodly.</p>
               <p n="78">78. For one Tincture caught hold of the other: ſo that the Saints [departed,] (in the Element) became longing after the ſtrong faith: eſpecially thoſe [Saints departed] that on Earth had turned many to Righteouſneſſe, for as every ones works of Faith follow after them: ſo alſo their will to turne more Men ſtill, followeth after them; and therefore one Faith (in the Tincture of the Holy Element) caught the other, and ſo [Miracles, or] Works of Wonder, were done at the Memorialls of the Saints; this God permitted for the Heathens ſakes, that they might ſee, that the Saints that were ſlaine, [or departed] were in God, and that there was another <note n="i" place="margin">So that God is the God of the living, and not of the dead.</note> life after this, that they ſhould turne and be converted, and therefore God ſuffered theſe works of wonder to be done.</p>
               <p n="79">79. But in the Ground of the Originality, it is not ſo, that one that is departed hath power to help one that is living, into the kingdome of Heaven: or that they ſhould undertake to bring and report the miſeries of the living, before God, and pray for them; for that were a great diſreſpect to the Heart of God, which without interceſſion or their prayer, powreth forth his Mercy over all Men with ſtretched out Armes: and his voyce is never any other than onely thus: <hi>Come yee all to mee, yee hungry and thirſty, and I will refreſh you,</hi> Matth. 11. He ſaid, Come to mee, I will doe it willingly. Alſo, It is delight to mee, to doe well to the Children of Men.</p>
               <p n="80">80. Who is it that will preſume to undertake, to ſtand before the ſource [or ſpring] of the Mercifulneſſe, and make interceſſion [or pray] for one that invocateth them?

the Deepe, and muſt paſſe through the Centre of the [grimme] fierceneſſe of Death, through the wrath of the Eternall Band, to the meeke Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, and become a member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, and receive of his fulneſſe, and live therein; his Death muſt be thy Death: his Eſſences muſt flow in thee: and thou muſt live in his ſource, [property or vertue]: thus thou muſt be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated anew in him, if thou wilt ſtand before his Father: elſe nothing will help: if there had been any thing in the whole depth of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that could have helped, God would have beſtowed it upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and would not have let his Heart, (againſt the courſe of Nature) to become Man. But there was no Counſell [or Remedy), neither in Heaven, not in this world, except God did become Man. Therefore be thou in earneſt and doe not ſeeke by-wayes to <hi>Babell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="82">82. God indeed (in former times) permitted much (for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion-ſake of the Heathen): but he hath not ordained the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to be ſo (in his Covetouſneſſe, Ordinances [or Lawes] and brabble in their Councells:) where Men have ſtopped the mouth of the Spirit of God, that it ſhould ſpeak no more: but that the <note n="k" place="margin">Viz. <hi>Thoſe that are learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Reaſon, in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</hi>

But it is come to be a <hi>Babell</hi> of Confuſion thereby; and in the Confuſion it breaketh [or deſtroyeth] it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="83">83. If now thou wilt behold the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> with her Sonne Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, then thou ſhalt finde that ſhee hath been juſtified and ſaved through her Sonne: although ſhee is come into great Perfection, as a <note n="l" place="margin">A holy or half morning ſtarre or as a halfe Lucifer before he fell.</note> Bright Morning Starre, above other Starres: and therefore alſo the Angel called her bleſſed among Women, and ſaid; <hi>The Lord is with thee:</hi> But ſhee hath not the Divine Omnipotence.</p>
               <p n="84">84. For the Word (which God promiſed in the Garden of <hi>Eden)</hi> ſprung [and budded) in the light of her life, in the Centre of God; and when the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> (from the Command of the Father) ſtirred that [Word of the promiſe] with the Meſſage, then it let it ſelfe into the chaſt virgin (<note n="m" place="margin">In the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before God.</note> in the Element) in: and not ſo wholly and altogether into the ſoule of the virgin, or into the earthly body that ſhee was <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>Godded.</hi>
                  </note> Deified; no; for Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, None goeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven but the Sonne of Man, who is come from Heaven, and who is in Heaven: all others, muſt goe through him into Heaven: <note n="o" place="margin">He is in the Father and his members are in him.</note> he is their Heaven, and the Father is his Heaven; he was in the Heaven and alſo (in the boſom of the virgin) in this world; the world was made through him, how then could it comprehend him?</p>
               <p n="85">85. The virgin comprehended [or conteined him] as a Mother
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57651:124"/>
doth her childe, ſhee gave him the naturall Eſſences which ſhee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited from her Parents, thoſe he aſſumed to the Creature, which was God and Man, the Eſſences of his Mother (in her virgin-Matrix, out of fleſh and bloud) he aſſumed to the <hi>Limbus</hi> of God (out of the [holy] Element) and in theſe became a living ſoule, without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing of the [holy] Element: and the Word was in the middeſt: the might [ſtrength] height and depth of the ſoule, reacheth even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father: and the outward kingdome of this world hung to the inward, as the foure Elements hang to the [one] Element, <note n="p" place="margin">Foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> which in the end ſhall paſſe away againe, and goe through the fire.</p>
               <p n="86">86. And as the childe is another perſon than the Mother; and as the childes ſoule, is not the ſoule of the Mother, ſo alſo here in this place. For the outward virgin could not comprehend, that ſhee did beare the Saviour of the world: but ſhee committed that (in her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-chaſtity) to God, whatſoever he did with her, ſhee would ſtill be contented with it.</p>
               <p n="87">87. But thou abominable Antichriſtian Beaſt, that wouldſt devour all, this thou ſhalt know concerning the holineſſe of the virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is higher, and hath a greater fullneſſe of the Glance [or Luſtre] than another childe, out of another body; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (thou evill Beaſt) art ſcarce worthy to have this told thee, thou art ſuch a devourer: yet, becauſe the Counſell of God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded ſo, <note n="q" place="margin">It ſhall be manifeſted.</note> it ſhall ſtand for a witneſſe againſt thee, in thy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="88">88. Behold, doeſt thou know how a childe cometh to be fleſh and bloud? and in the end a living ſoule? and doe you not know that the Tincture of the Mother is the firſt, when a childe ſhall be conceived? which is done in the deſire of the will between Man and Woman: where then the ſeede [for the childe] is ſowen, and then the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in the Matrix aſſumeth it, with the mixture of the <hi>Lambus</hi> of the Man. And though the outward Mother doth not deſire [to have] <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation.</hi>
                  </note> the childe, (but deſireth many times onely to have her pleaſure) yet the inward [Mother] doth deſire it, and alſo firſt of all impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe in the Tincture; and then attracteth the <note n="ſ" place="margin">Or, <hi>the Word which then formeth and createth.</hi>
                  </note> Fiat to it, and holdeth the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the Man, and becometh impregnated.</p>
               <p n="89">89. But now that Tincture qualifieth [or mixeth] with the whole body, and alſo with the ſoule; for if it [the Tincture] be faithfull, then it reacheth the virgin of God in the Element, and it is rightly the habitation of the holy ſoule, in which God aſſiſteth <note n="t" place="margin">The ſoule.</note> it.</p>
               <p n="90">90. Now thus the childe qualifieth [or mixeth] with the Mother, and with all Eſſences, till it kindleth the light of Life, and then the childe liveth in its [own] ſpirit, and the Mother is its dwelling houſe: but now ſeeing the ſoule of the childe is generated out of the <hi>Limbus,</hi> and out of the Eſſences of the Mother, therefore <note n="u" place="margin">The ſoule of the childe.</note> it is indeed, halfe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57651:124"/>
the Mothers, though now it is become the proper own of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="91">91. Thus alſo in Chriſt: the will [to the childe] was the Mothers, when the Angel declared the Meſſage to her, and the Tincture (which received the <hi>Limbus</hi> of God, and brought it into the will that ſhee was thus impregnated in the Element) that was alſo the Mothers, and thus the Deity was conceived, in the Mothers Tincture, in her will, like another naturall childe.</p>
               <p n="92">92. Seeing then that the ſoule of her childe was in the holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what doeſt thou think here? being it went forth out of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eſſences, whether might not the holineſſe of the childe (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his high Light) in the Mother ſhine bright and gloriouſly? and whether this Mother may not rightly ſtand upon the Moone, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe that which is earthly? as is to be ſeene in the Revelations [of Saint <hi>John].</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="93">93. For ſhee bare the Saviour of all the world, without any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixture: and ſhee is alſo a virgin of chaſtity, highly bleſſed by her Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, in the Divine Light and Clarity <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>above the clarity of the Heavens.</hi>
                  </note> more than the Heavens, like the Princely Thrones of the Angels. For out of her went forth the body, which attracteth all members to it; which are the children of God in Chriſt. And therefore her Glance [Luſtre or brightneſſe] is above the Glance of Heaven: and the Glance of her ſoule is in the holy Trinity, where all other children of <hi>Adam</hi> (which are borne [or begotten] in Chriſt) are alſo Members therein, in that One Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="94">94. Or doeſt thou think I make a God of her: no: the Invocation doth not belong to her: for the might [or ability] to helpe, cometh onely out of the Father, through the Sonne; for in the Father onely is the ſource [or fountaine] of the Omnipotence which he in the Sonne ſpeaketh forth, for the might, of the ſtrength, is in the firſt Principle, which is the Father himſelfe, and the Sonne is his Love, and <note n="y" place="margin">Brightneſſe or Glance:</note> Light: ſo now the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> dwelleth in the Heaven, in the Light and in the Love of the Father: as alſo all other Saints [doe].</p>
               <p n="95">95. But that they feine, [or babble,] that ſhee was taken up into heaven alive with ſoule and body, and that ſhee can carry our miſeries, and preſent them before her Sonne: I would faine know what under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and knowledge the Author of ſuch an invented fable, hath had of the kingdome of Heaven: ſurely, he tooke the kingdome of this world, to be Heaven.</p>
               <p n="96">96. I let it paſſe, and it is true, that ſhee may be in Heaven with body and ſoule: but with ſuch a body, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had upon Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> (in the Apparition before Chriſt [at his Transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on]) <hi>viz.</hi> that new body out of the Element: the tranſitorie [cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible body] belongeth to the Earth, for if wee could have ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in God, with this [tranſitory and corruptible] body, God would
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57651:125"/>
not have become Man, and have dyed for us. Even as all the Apoſtles of Chriſt are dead, and yet live; and ſo may it alſo be, that the body of the virgin was changed into a heavenly, and laid off the Earthly. What doth that availe us? Shee is no Goddeſſe.</p>
               <p n="97">97. And the Invocation of the Saints, is wholly againſt the nature of the firſt Principle. Shee is with God indeed, wee need not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that; but wee ſhould onely look to it, that wee alſo may come to her [where ſhee is] in her Sonne, and then wee ſhall have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall joy with her, for that ſhee is (from the Grace of God) become the bleſſed of [all] Women, and that wee ſee the greene Lilly twigge on her, and that ſhee is the Mother of our ſalvation, out of whom ſalvation is borne, through God.</p>

            <p n="1">1. IF wee conſider now (in the light of Nature) of Man (the Image of God,) of his beginning, and of his Eternall enduring, being [or ſubſtance]; and then of the breaking of his body, how bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule part aſunder; and whither the ſoules goe, when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their breath doth breake [or diſſolve] in them, and the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or moving in the Tincture of this world doth ceaſe; then wee finde the ground of the unquietneſſe of the ſoule, when it is ſevered from the body [being] unregenerated: from whence lamentation
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57651:126"/>
and deſiring ariſeth: from whence then the <hi>Babell</hi> of Confuſion hath ariſen: ſo that very many things have therefore been invented to Ranſom ſoules [out of Diſtreſſe].</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many of which [things] have no foundation in the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor can be found [therein]: But were rather invented for Covetouſneſſe, and for <note n="d" place="margin">For Livings.</note> filling of the Belly, and for deceit, upon which the Antichriſtian kingdome is founded: and thereout is a right <hi>Babell</hi> of Confuſion come to be, out of which then alſo the [Grimme, fierce, cruell enmity and hatred is ariſen, from whence <hi>Babell</hi> is broken in her ſelfe, and [Enmity] is generated out of <note n="e" place="margin">Wrangling, diſſention and warring</note> 
               <hi>Babell:</hi> and it is the fierce wrath of God which appeareth in the breaking [or deſtruction] of <hi>Babell,</hi> becauſe ſhee is generated in the Deceit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But now that the wrath devoureth all, and wholly darkneth the <hi>Myſteria,</hi> [Myſteries or hidden ſecrets,] and maketh the ſource [or quality] of the Eternall Birth [to be] a Darkneſſe, (onely that it may exalt its wrath,) and ſeeth nothing in the Birth of Eternity, but bringeth all things that are therein, to nothing; that is a very great <hi>Babell,</hi> for it not onely devoureth it ſelfe, but maketh it ſelfe <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde.</hi>
               </note> ſtark blinde in Nature; and it maketh of Mans Image, meere evill wolviſh Beaſts, which think that they are gone out from <hi>Babell,</hi> and yet are begotten in <hi>Babell,</hi> and are in the body of the evill devouring Beaſt, and ſo devour the houſe of their Mother, and manifeſt it to be a vile ſtincking Lake, and yet themſelves will not goe out from it, and it is altogether a Kingdome, which continually generateth it ſelfe, in its own voluptuouſneſſe and pride, and alſo continually manifeſteth its own ſhame, and devoureth it ſelfe in the wrath of its own ſinnes, and is rightly called <hi>Babell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But if wee goe out from <hi>Babell</hi> into the New Regeneration, and conſider our corruption, wherein the poore ſoule lyeth captive, and alſo conſider our Regeneration in Chriſt Jeſus, how wee are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated out of God, and then, how Man muſt enter into this new Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and be regenerated in the Birth of Chriſt; then wee ſhall well finde what the unquietneſſe of the ſoule is after the [departure] or breaking off of the body.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For, the ſoule which is out of the firſt Principle (out of the Band of the Eternity) was breathed into the Element of the body, to [be] the Image of God, out of the ſtrong Might of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened from the Divine Light, ſo that it hath received an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſource [or quality]; but when it went forth, out of the Light of God into the Spirit of this world, then there ſprung up in it, the ſource of the firſt Principle: and it neither ſaw nor felt the kingdome of God any more; till that the Heart of God ſet it ſelfe in the midſt againe; into that, the ſoule muſt enter againe, and be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:57651:126"/>
6. And that it might doe this, therefore the Heart of God became a humane <note n="g" place="margin">One Copie hath humane body.</note> ſoule, and ſlew (by his entring into Death) the Spirit of this world: and brought the fulneſſe of the Deity againe into his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoule: ſo that wee alſo may altogether in his (as in our own) humane ſoule, through him, preſſe into the holy Element before God; and now there is nothing to hinder us but our own vile ſluggiſh drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, that wee ſuffer our ſelves to be ſo wholly and altogether lead by the Spirit of this world, with pride, exalting of our ſelves to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſteeme, and greedy filling of the Belly [with plenty]: and wee look no further, [to conſider] that wee are but Pilgrims: and that as ſoone as the Spirit of this world hath laid hold of us in the Mothers body [or womb], wee are then Pilgrims, and muſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with our ſoules into another Countrey, where the earthly body is not at home.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For as this world breaketh and paſſeth away, ſo alſo all fleſh (which is generated out of the Spirit of this world) muſt breake and paſſe away. Therefore now when the poore ſoule muſt depart out of this body, wherein yet it is generated; if then it hath not the new Garment of the Regeneration of the Holy Ghoſt in it, and is not clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Mantle of Chriſt, with his Incarnation, ſuffering, Death, and Reſurrection, in him; then there beginneth great ſorrow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe; <hi>[viz.]</hi> in thoſe onely, which at the breaking of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are but in the Gate: and ſo ſwim between Heaven and Hell; and there then <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>beginneth the wreſtling.</hi>
               </note> is need of wreſtling and ſtrugling, as is to be ſeene by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many when they are a dying.</p>
            <p n="8">8. There then the poore ſoule in the firſt Principle doth <note n="i" place="margin">Swing, or ſwimme.</note> move in the Doore of the Deepe, being clothed with the vertue [or power of the Dominion or] Region of the Starres, appearing in that [ſhape or] forme of the body, which it had here: and many of them deſireth this or that, which was its laſt Will, in hope thereby to attaine abſtinence and [quietneſſe or] Reſt: alſo many by night (according to the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereall ſpirit) ſhew themſelves very diſquiet with tumbling and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the body; which our Learned Men from the Schoole of this world, aſcribe to the Devill, but they have no knowledge [or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding] in it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Seeing therefore that this is the weightieſt Article; and cannot be apprehended in ſuch a way; wee will deſcribe the dying of Man, and the departure of the ſoule from the body, and try, if it might ſo be brought to knowledge, that the Reader may comprehend the [true] <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it.</hi>
               </note> meaning of it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Mans Image borne of a Woman, here in this life, is in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold forme, and ſtandeth in three Principles [or beginnings]; <hi>viz.</hi> the ſoule, that, hath its originall out of the firſt Principle, out of the ſtrong and ſoure Might of the Eternity; and it ſwimmeth [or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth]
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57651:127"/>
between two Principles, begirt with the third [Principle]: it reacheth with its originall Roote, into the Depth of the Eternity, in the ſource [or quality] where God the Father from Eternity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth (through the Gates of the breaking through, and opening,) in himſelfe, into the Light of Joy: and it is in the Band, where God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe a Jealous angry and auſtere God: and is a ſparkle out of the Allmightineſſe, <note n="l" place="margin">Sparkling forth, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> appearing in the great Wonders of the wiſdome of God, through the deare virgin of Chaſtity; and with the forme of the firſt Principle, [it ſtandeth] in the Gate of the ſoureneſſe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity [mingled, united, or] qualified, with the Region of the Sunne and Starres, and begirt with the foure Elements; and the holy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>(viz.</hi> the Roote of the foure Elements) that is the body of the ſoule, in the ſecond Principle, in the Gate [before or] towards God; and according to the Spirit of this world, the Region of the Starres, is the body of the ſoule; and the iſſue of the foure Elements is the ſource-houſe [conduit-houſe, or work-houſe,] or the Spirit of this world, which kindleth the Region, ſo that it [ſpringeth forth or] worketh.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And thus the ſoule liveth in ſuch a threefold ſource [or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality] being bound with three <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Reines.</hi>
               </note> coards, and is drawne of all three. The firſt coard is the Band of Eternity, generated in the riſing up of the Anxiety, and reacheth the Abyſſe of Hell. The ſecond coard is the Kingdome of Heaven, generated through the Gates of the Deepe in the Father, and Regenerated out of the birth of ſinnes, through the humanity of Chriſt, and there the ſoule alſo (in the <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>becoming Man.</hi>
               </note> Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of God) is tyed up, and is drawne by the deare virgin, in the word of God. The third coard, is the Kingdome of the Starres, qualifying [or mingling] with the ſoule, and it is hard drawne and held by the foure Elements, and carried and lead by them.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But the third Kingdome is not alſo in the Eternity, but is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated out of the one Element in the time of the kindling of the Fiat; that now is corruptible, and hath a certain <hi>ſeculum,</hi> limit and time, [how long it ſhall laſt]; and ſo this Region in the ſoule (when the light of Life kindleth it ſelfe) hath alſo a certain <hi>ſeculum,</hi> and time of its breaking; and that kingdome <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Man.</hi>
               </note> bringeth Man up, and giveth him the ſource of his manners [conditions and diſpoſition] will and deſires to evill and good: and ſetteth him in beauty, glory, riches and honour: and maketh him an earthly God: and it openeth to him the great Wonders <note n="p" place="margin">In the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the four Elements.</note> in him, and runneth along with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately to the end of his <hi>ſeculum,</hi> terme, and end: and then it departeth from him; and as it did help Man to his life, ſo it helpeth him alſo to Death, and breaketh off from the ſoule.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Firſt, the foure Elements break off from the [one] Element, and then the ſource [or working faculty] of the third Principle cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57651:127"/>
and that is the moſt horrible thing [of all] when the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments breake in themſelves; and that is the Death, when the Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone Spirit (which hath its originall from the Gall, and kindleth the Tincture of the Heart) is choaked; where then the Tincture with the ſhadow of Mans ſubſtance, goeth into the Ether, and remaineth ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ſhadow, in the roote of the one Element; from which [one Element] the foure Elements were generated and gone forth; and therein onely conſiſteth the woe in the breaking, where one ſource-houſe is broken off from the ſoule.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But if now the <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>iſſuing ſubſtantiall faculties, or vertues.</hi>
               </note> Eſſences of the firſt Principle of the ſoule, have been ſo very converſant about [or addicted to] the Kingdome of this world, ſo that the Eſſences of the ſoule have ſought after the pleaſures of this world onely, in temporary honour, power, and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; then the ſoule (or the Eſſences out of the firſt Principle) keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſtarry Region to it ſtill, as its deareſt Jewell, with a deſire to live therein; but then [the ſtarry Region] hath the Mother <hi>(viz.</hi> the foure Elements) no more, and therefore it conſumeth, with the time it ſelfe, in the Eſſences out of the firſt Principle: and ſo the Eſſences of the firſt Principle continue raw, [or naked without a body].</p>
            <p n="15">15. And here ſtandeth the <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>Refining fire.</hi>

For the third Principle falleth away, and leaveth the ſoule, and it can uſe that no more in Eternity.</p>

               <p n="16">16. Seeing then, that Man is ſo very earthly, therefore he hath none but earthly knowledge: except he be Regenerated in the Gate of the Deepe. He alwayes ſuppoſeth that the ſoule (at the deceaſing of the body) goeth onely out at the mouth: and he underſtandeth nothing concerning its <note n="u" place="margin">Deep Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vertues or faculties which are of a higher originall than the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Deepe Eſſences above the Elements.

               <p n="17">17. O no, beloved Reaſon it is not ſo; the ſoule is not ſeene nor comprehended in the outward Elements; but that is the Brimſtone Spirit, the Spirit of the third Principle: for as when thou putteſt out a Candle, a filthy ſmell and ſtinck cometh from it, which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the Candle did burne; ſo here alſo, when the light of the body breaketh, then the Brimſtone Spirit is ſmothered, from whence that vapour and deadly ſtinck proceedeth, with its working [Spirit or infecting] poyſon.</p>

                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:57651:128"/>
18. Underſtand [or conſider] it aright: it is the ſource-Spirit [or working Spirit] out of the Gall, which kindleth the Heart, (whereby the life was ſtirred) which is choaked, ſo ſoone as the Tincture in the Bloud of the Heart is extinguiſhed: The right ſoule hath no need of ſuch going forth, it is much more ſubtile than the Brimſtone Spirit, although (in the life time) it is in one onely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But when the Spirit of the foure Elements parteth, then the right ſoule (which was breathed into <hi>Adam)</hi> ſtandeth in its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for it is ſo ſubtile that it cannot be comprehended; it goeth through fleſh and bones, alſo through wood and ſtone, and <note n="x" place="margin">Breaketh or diſturbeth.</note> ſtirreth none of them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. It may be comprehended [as followeth]: if it hath <note n="y" place="margin">Been enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and not broke off from it.</note> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſomewhat (in the time of the body) and hath not recalled it, then that word, and the earneſt promiſe comprehendeth it (which wee ought to be ſilent in, here;) or elſe there is nothing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth it; but onely its own Principle wherein it ſtandeth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the kingdome of Hell, or of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="21">21. It goeth not out at the mouth (like a bodily ſubſtance): it is raw [or naked] without a body: and inſtantly paſſeth (at the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the foure Elements) into the Centre, into the Gate of the Deep; [in the hidden Eternity]; and that which it is cloathed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that, it comprehendeth, and keepeth it: if its treaſure, be volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe, might, [or power,] honour, riches, malice, wrath, lying, or the falſhood of the world, then the fierce might of the Eſſences out of the firſt Principle comprehendeth theſe things, through the ſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall Spirit, and keepeth them: and <note n="z" place="margin">Buddeth or floweth.</note> worketh therewith according to the Region of the Starres; yet the [ſtarry Region] cannot bring the Spirit of the ſoule into its own forme; but it practiſeth its jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therewith, and ſo there is no reſt in its <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Therefore it happeneth often, that the Spirit of a deceaſed Man, is ſeene walking, alſo many times it is ſeene riding in the perfect forme of fire; alſo many times in [ſome] other manner of diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; all according as the cloathing of the ſoule hath been in the time of the body, juſt ſo hath its ſource [or condition] been: and ſuch a forme, according to its ſource, it hath (after the departing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) in its figure: and ſo rideth (in ſuch forme,) in the ſource [or working] of the Starres, till that ſource alſo be conſumed: and then it is wholly <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>without a body.</hi>
                  </note> naked, and is never ſeene more by any Man: but the Deep Abyſſe without end and number is its Eternall dwelling houſe; and its works which it hath here wrought, ſtand in the figure, in its Tincture, and follow after it.</p>

23. Hath it wrought good here, then it ſhall eate that good: for all ſinnes ſtand before it in its Tincture, if it think inwardly in it ſelfe of the kingdome of Heaven, (which yet it neither ſeeth nor knoweth) then it ſeeth the cauſes, wherefore it is in ſuch a ſource [or miſery]: for it ſelfe hath made that. And there all the teares of the oppreſſed and afflicted are in its Tincture, and they are fiery, ſtinging and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a hoſtile manner, fretting and gnawing in themſelves; and make an Eternall Deſpaire in the Eſſences, and an hoſtile will againſt God; the more it thinketh of <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>

               <p n="24">24. For there is no light, neither of this world, nor of God, but its own fiery kindling in it ſelfe, and that is its light, which ſtandeth in the horrible flaſh of the grimneſſe: which alſo is an Enmity to it ſelfe; yet the ſource is very unlike: all according to that which the ſoule hath here burthened it ſelfe with. For ſuch a ſoule there is no [re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy or] counſell, it cannot come into the Light of God; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> had left many thouſand Keys upon Earth, yet none of them could open the Heaven for <note n="d" place="margin">That ſoule.</note> it; for it is ſeperated from the Band of Jeſus Chriſt: and there is between it and the Deity, a whole <note n="e" place="margin">Principle or Gulfe.</note> Birth; and it is as with the Rich Man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. where thoſe that would come from thence to us cannot. And this muſt be underſtood of the unrepentant ſoules, which thus in hypocrifie [or ſhew-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe] depart from the body being unregenerated.</p>
               <p n="25">25. But there is a great difference in ſoules, and therefore <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture is alſo unlike.</hi>
                  </note> the going to Heaven is very unlike; ſome of them are through true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſorrow for their <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>evill deeds.</hi>

Theſe holy ſoules works alſo follow them, in their Tincture of the Spirit of the ſoule, in the holy Element, ſo that they ſee and know, how much good they have wrought here; and their higheſt delight and deſire is, ſtill continually (in their Love) to doe more good; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57651:129"/>
without the Paradiſicall body (which they [ſhall then] firſt attaine at the Reſtoration) they worke nothing, but their ſource [qualitie or property] is meere delight and ſoft <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>Well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

               <p n="27">27. Yet you are to know, that the holy ſoules are not ſo voyde of ability [or power]; for their Eſſences are out of the ſtrong Might of God, out of the firſt Principle; although (becauſe of their great humility towards God) they doe not uſe that [might] (whereas they continually expect their bodies in that ſtill reſt with great humility) and yet their love and delight is ſo very great, that at ſeverall times they have wrought great Wonders [or Miracles] (among the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) upon Earth: which [faithfull People] ſo vigorouſly ſet their love and deſire in them; that one holy Tincture took hold of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo through the Faith of the Living, wonders are thus done, for, <hi>there is nothing impoſsible to Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. And it is not hard (for the holy ſoules, which are departed from the body) to appeare <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>upon.</hi>

               <p n="29">29. And now if the deceaſed (or ſeperated) ſoule, was here in this world a Candleſtick, and a declarer [of the Name] of God, and that it hath turned many unto Righteouſneſſe: then it appeareth alſo to the Living Saints, which incline their Faith ſo ſtrongly to them; and it is not a jot harder now than in former times, when (in the times of the Saints) great Wonders were done: for the Faith of the Living, and the Love of the ſeperated [ſoules] towards the Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Saints, hath wrought them, in the ſtrong Might of God; and God hath permitted it, for the converſion of People, that they might ſee the great Might (of thoſe [that were] deceaſed) in God, and that they are, and live, in another kingdome, that ſo they might be aſſured of the Reſurrection of the Dead, by the great Miracles of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoules; All which, in generall were put to Death for the witneſſe of Jeſus; that the Heathen and all People might thereby ſee, what manner of Reward the holy People] had, when they laid downe their life for the Teſtimony of Chriſt: by whoſe example many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo were converted.</p>

But now that a <hi>Babell</hi> of confuſion is come out of this (in that, it is come ſo farre, that the Saints departed, are invocated [or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped] as Interceſſours to God, and that Divine honour is done them) this the holy ſoules departed, are not guilty of, neither here they deſired any ſuch thing, neither doe they preſent the miſeries and neceſſities of Men before God; But the fault lyeth in the forged Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the wicked deceitfull Antichriſt, who hath founded his <note n="m" place="margin">Chaire or Throne.</note> Stoole of Pride thereon; not as a living Saint, which (with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)

inclineth himſelfe to God: but as an earthly God: he thereby ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogateth Divine Omnipotence to himſelfe, and yet hath none; but is the greedy, covetous, proud Anti-chriſt, riding upon the ſtrong <note n="n" place="margin">The Arme of the Civill power.</note> Beaſt of this world.</p>
               <p n="31">31. The ſoules departed, doe not preſent our wants before God: for God is neerer to us than the ſoules departed are; and [beſides] if they ſhould doe ſo, then they muſt have bodies: as alſo Paradiſicall ſources [or flowing properties] ſpringing up, and working, whereas they are in the ſtill humility, and meeke Reſt, and doe not ſuffer our ſoure miſeries to enter into them, but one holy Tincture taketh hold of another to [increaſe] the love and delight But they make not of Chriſt (their Great Prince) a Deafe Hearer, as if he did neither heare, feele, nor ſee any thing himſelfe: who ſtretcheth out his armes, and himſelfe without ceaſing calleth with his holy Spirit, and inviteth all the children of Men to the wedding, he will readily accept all, if they would but come.</p>
               <p n="32">32. How then ſhould a ſoule come before Chriſt, and pray for a Living Invocatour, whereas Chriſt himſelfe doth ſtand, and invite Men, and is himſelfe the atonement of the anger in the Father: For the Father hath given Men to the Sonne: as himſelfe witneſſeth: <hi>They were thine, and thou haſt given them to mee, and I will that they be with mee, and ſee my Glory, which thou haſt given mee.</hi>

O thou confounded <hi>Babell,</hi> goe out from Antichriſt, and come (with a penitent heart and minde) before thy mercifull Brother, and Saviour of all Men: he will more readily heare thee, than thou come to him: Step onely out of this wicked <hi>Babell</hi> into a new Birth, and be not ſo much in love with the kingdome of this world; thou art but a meere Gueſt and ſtranger in it: what availeth thee, thy <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</hi>

which plagueth the poore ſoule, and uſually forceth it thereby into deſpaire, ſo that it ſelfe continually preſenteth its ſinnes before it, and deſpaireth of the Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Now behold, thou beloved ſoule, who art dearly redeemed by thy Saviour Jeſus Chriſt (with his entrance into the humanity, and with his entrance into the Abyſſe of Hell) and plucked off from the Kingdome of the Devill, (in the Might of the Father) and ſealed with his bloud and Death, and covered with his Enſigne of Triumph; all thy works ([both] the evill and the good) which thou haſt done, follow thee in the ſhadow, but not in the ſubſtance, nor in the ſource [or in the working property.] Yet they will not be any <note n="q" place="margin">Detraction, ſhame, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</note> prejudice in the Heaven to the holy ſoules (which have turned into the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Chriſt): but they ſhall have their higheſt joy concerning them, in that they have ſtuck in ſuch hard miſery and ſinnes, and have been plucked out of them by their Saviour Chriſt, and from thence will ariſe meere joy, and rejoycing, that they are redeemed from the <note n="r" place="margin">Hunter, or the Devill.</note> Driver of their ſinnes, and from great miſery, and that the <note n="r" place="margin">Hunter, or the Devill.</note> Driver is captivated, which tormented them day and night in ſuch <note n="ſ" place="margin">Sinfulneſſe.</note> ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="36">36. And there all the holy ſoules and Angells, (in one Love) will highly rejoyce, that the poore ſoule is delivered from ſuch great neceſſitie [or miſery]; and the great Joy then taketh its beginning from thence, of which Chriſt ſaid; <hi>That there is more joy for one ſinner that repenteth, than for ninety and nine righteous that need no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> And the ſoule will praiſe God that he hath redeemed it out of theſe great ſinnes; and herewith the praiſe of Chriſt [in] his merit, paſſion, and dying for the poore ſoule, ſpringeth up in Eternity, and it is the right Song of the redeemed Bride, which riſeth up in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; where the ſoules ſo highly rejoyce that the Driver is captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his <note n="t" place="margin">Dependents.

               <p n="37">37. And here is fulfilled that which King <hi>David</hi> deſcanteth upon; <hi>Thou ſhalt rejoyce to ſee, how the wicked are recompenced:</hi> how the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Driver [Hunter or oppreſſour] and <note n="u" place="margin">Occaſioner, or ſtirrer up of evill.</note> Incendiary of malice and wickedneſſe is tormented, in his Priſon: for the ſinnes that are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, ſhall not appeare in Heaven (as in the Abyſſe of Hell) in the forme of fire: but as <hi>Iſaias</hi> ſaid; <hi>Though thy ſinnes were as red as bloud</hi> [or <hi>ſcarlet]</hi> (if thou turne) <hi>they ſhall be like wooll, white as ſnow:</hi> they ſhall ſtand in a heavenly figure, for Men to ſing of, in a Hymne of Praiſe, and a Pſalme of Thankeſgiving, for their deliverance from the Driver.</p>

               <p n="40">40. And yet how ever, when the point [or houre] of Death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Conſcience is rouzed, and that the poore ſoule begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to tremble for great feare at the [Torment or] ſource of Hell; then theſe alſo would faine be ſaved: though there is very little ſaith in them, onely meere unrighteouſneſſe, falſhood, and pleaſure of the Earthly life: the groanings and teares of the poore, ſtand hard before it, and the Devill readeth the Book of Conſcience to the minde: and there ſtandeth alſo before the minde, the pleaſure of the world, and [the party] would faine live [ſomewhat] longer: and promiſeth to lead a life in [forbearance of evill or] abſtinence; and the minde inclineth a little towards God, [or Goodneſſe]: but the ſinnes beate that [inclination] downe againe: and then there ariſeth great doubt in <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi>

               <p n="41">41. And now when Death cometh and ſevereth the body and ſoule aſunder; then the poore ſoule hangeth by a Threed [or Faith] and will not let goe: and yet its <note n="a" place="margin">Budded eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall vertues.</note> Eſſences ſtick faſt in the anger of God, the ſource [or paine] of the groſſe ſinnes <note n="b" place="margin">Boyle up in it.</note> torment it, the Threed of Faith (in the New Regeneration) is very weake; and here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now they muſt preſſe through the Gate of the Deepe, through the paſſion, and through the Death of Chriſt [through the kingdome of Hell] to God: and Hell hath yet a ſtrong Band about the ſoule, the falſhood is not yet waſhed off.</p>

               <p n="44">44. And thy worldly Bravery, Glory, Beauty, and Riches, will not exalt thee before God, as thou ſuppoſeſt, nor yet thy Office which thou didſt beare here, be it the Kingly or Prieſtly Office; if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt to be in Heaven, then thou muſt (through thy Saviour) be new borne; thou muſt endeavour to bring thy Subjects unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and then thou wilt ſhine (with thy Office) as bright as the luſtre of Heaven, and thy works will follow thee. O Man conſider thy ſelfe in this.</p>
               <p n="45">45. But thou earthly <hi>Babell,</hi> what ſhall I write much of thee for? Indeed I muſt ſhew thee the ground, that thy hypocriſie may be brought to light, and that the Devill may not continue (in ſuch a manner) to ſtand in an Angelicall forme, and in the voluptuous king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world (in Man) be a God, which is his higheſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Behold, thou calleſt thy ſelfe a Chriſtian, and thou boaſteſt [that] thou art a childe of God: this thou confeſſeſt with thy mouth, but thy heart is a theefe and a murtherer: thou endeavoureſt after nothing elſe but honour and riches: and thy Conſcience regardeth little by what meanes thou attaineſt them [whether by hooke or by crooke]; thou haſt a will, one day, to enter into earneſt Repentance, but the Devill keepeth thee back that thou canſt not; thou ſayſt to morrow [to morrow] and that is alwayes ſo, from time to time: and thou thinkeſt with thy ſelfe, if I had my Chiſt full, then I would give to him that hath need [and become another Man]: If I had but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſerve my turne [aforehand] that I may not come to want my ſelfe; this is thy purpoſe till thy end, which the Devill perſwadeth thee, that it is farre off from thee.</p>
               <p n="47">47. In the mean while, thou conſumeſt the ſweat and bloud of the needy, and thou gathereſt all his miſeries and neceſſities on a heape in thy ſoule: thou takeſt his ſweat, to maintaine thy pride therewith: and yet thy doings muſt be accounted holy; thou giveſt ſcandall to the poore, ſo that by thy example and doings, he cometh to be vile [and wicked], and to doe that which is not right in the preſence of God; he curſeth thee, and therewith cauſeth himſelfe to periſh alſo; and thus one <note n="d" place="margin">One ſinne bringeth forth another.</note> abomination generateth another; but thou art the firſt

of the ſoules: wee need not to <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>to thinke of ſome farre diſtant place.</hi>
                  </note> caſt our mindes a farre off: for farre off and neere is all one and the ſame thing with God: the place of the Holy Trinity is <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>Every where.</hi>
                  </note> all over: Heaven and Hell is [every where] all over in this world, and the Man (Chriſt) dwelleth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for he hath laid off the corruptibility, and hath ſwallowed up Death, as alſo that which is [fragile or] temporall, and he liveth in God: his body is the ſubſtance of the Element, which out of the word of the Mercifulneſſe, is from Eternity generated out of the Gates of the Deep: it is the <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               <p n="63">63. And <hi>Adams</hi> body was alſo created out of it: and the whole world was made through the Element out of its iſſuing forth. Now therefore this Gate is [every where] all over: that which is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is alſo the moſt outward, but the middlemoſt is the Kingdome of God; the outward world hangeth to the outermoſt, and yet is not the outermoſt, but the ground of Hell is the outermoſt; and none of them all comprehendeth the other, and yet they are in one another, and the one is not ſeene in the other, but the <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>property is felt.</hi>
                  </note> ſource which is broke forth.</p>
               <p n="64">64. Wee finde indeede the vertue of the Kingdome of Heaven in all things: and alſo wee finde the vertue [or effect] of the Kingdome of Hell in all things: and yet the thing is not hurt [or diſturbed] by either of them, but what is not generated out <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>the one Eternall.</hi>
                  </note> of one [of them alone].</p>
               <p n="65">65. The ſoule of Man is generated out of the Gates of the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through out of the outward into the inward, and is gone forth out of the inward, (in <note n="a" place="margin">The Spirit of this world.</note> the out-Birth of the inward) into the outward: and that [ſoule] muſt enter againe into the inward; if it remaine in the outward, it is in Hell, in the deep great wideneſſe [vacuum or ſpace] without end, where the ſource [or the riſing tormenting qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity] generateth it ſelfe according to the inward, and in it ſelfe goeth forth into the outward.</p>
               <p n="66">66. The ſource in the breaking forth out of the outward into the inward, is the ſharpneſſe and the Allmightineſſe of the Kingdome of the Heavens over the outward: the outward is the Eternall Band, and the inward is the Eternall vertue and light, and cannot periſh: and thus God is all in all, and yet there is nothing that comprehendeth or detaineth him, and he is included in nothing.</p>
               <p n="67">67. Therefore the ſoule (when it departeth from the body) need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to goe farre: for at that place where the body dyeth, there is Heaven and Hell: and the Man-Chriſt dwelleth every where: God
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57651:133"/>
and the Devill is there, yet each of them in his own Kingdome: The Paradiſe is alſo there: and the ſoule needeth onely to enter through the deep Doore in the Centre. Is the ſoule Holy? then it ſtandeth in the Gate of Heaven, and the earthly body hath but kept it out of Heaven; and now when the body cometh to be broken, then the ſoule is already in the Heaven: it needeth no going out or in, Chriſt hath it in his armes: for where the foure Elements breake, there the roote of them remaineth, which is the holy Element, and therein the body of Chriſt ſtandeth, and alſo the Paradiſe, which ſtandeth in the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſource of Joy: and that Element is the ſoft ſtill Habitation.</p>
               <p n="68">68. So alſo, it is with the damned, [ſoule,] when the body breaketh, the ſoule needeth no flying forth, or departing far away: it remaineth in that which is outermoſt <note n="b" place="margin">Beyond.</note> without the foure Elements, in the darkneſſe, and in the <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>Aking property.</hi>
                  </note> anguiſhing ſource, its ſource is [that which cometh] after the light, and its riſing [or ſpringing up] is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt it ſelfe, and ſo climeth continually aloft over the Thrones of the Deity, and findeth them not, to Eternity, but it rideth in its pride aloft over the Thrones, in their own Game, with the ſtrong might of the grimneſſe; of which you ſhall finde at large, about the Deſcription of the laſt Judgement.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Our writing alſo will ſerve in its due time, when the <note n="c" place="margin">The bloſſome of the ſweet ſmelling Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> Lilly-Roſe ſhall bloſſom: for in theſe [writings] there is many a Noble Roſe-Bud, which at preſent (becauſe of the great darkneſſe in <hi>Babell)</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be knowne: but there is a time, wherein it ſhall <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>be known.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. Though indeed the Spirit of God (in zeale and in the great might of the Father) armeth many in the fierceneſſe [or wrath], as may be ſeene by <hi>Elias:</hi> where ſometimes the ſword of the wrath of God is given to the Angel, for the ſlaying of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts in <hi>Babell</hi> by <hi>Elias:</hi> Alſo, where <hi>Moſes</hi> Brake the Tables, and imployeth the ſword againſt the ſinne of the worſhippers of the Calſe; which neither <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> doth, nor <hi>Elias;</hi> but the fire of the wrath of God, by <hi>Elias,</hi> on the Mount.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Now when God the Lord had pronounced <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, about their Earthly miſery, labour, cares, and hard burthen, which they muſt beare: and [that he had confirmed them] husband and wife: and alſo bound them in the Oath of Wedlock, to keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as one [onely] body, and to love and help one another, as the Members of one [and the ſame] body; they were then wholly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they ſtood and were aſhamed of their earthly Image, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, of the Members of their <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>privities.</hi>
               </note> ſhame: alſo [they were aſhamed] of the <note n="g" place="margin">The dung.</note> excrement of the earthly food of their bodies; for they ſaw that they had a Beaſtiall condition, according to the outward body with all its ſubſtance; alſo heat and cold fell upon them: and the chaſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God was <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>loſt.</hi>
               </note> extinct: and now they muſt propagate after a Beaſtiall manner.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And then God the Lord, (through the Spirit of this world made them cloaths of the ſkinnes of Beaſts, and put thoſe on them (through the Spirit of this world:) that they might ſee that (according to this [outward] world,) they were Beaſts; and [he] taught them how they ſhould ſeek the wonders, (in the Spirit of this world,) and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt them, and cloath themſelves out of the wonders.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And here it may be ſeene very perfectly, that Man in this world, is not at home, but he is come into it as a Gueſt, and hath not brought the cloaths of this world with him (as all other creatures, that are at home therein, doe;) but muſt borrow cloathing from the <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>from the creatures of the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements.</hi>

            <p n="8">8. And this is done to the end (becauſe the Spirit of this world continually ſeeketh the Noble virgin of the Divine Wiſdome, and knoweth that ſhee is in Man,) that Man ſhould ſeek the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (that are in <note n="k" place="margin">The Spirit of this world.</note> it) and bring them to light: <note n="k" place="margin">The Spirit of this world.</note> It ſtill ſuppoſeth, that it ſhall through Man, bring the noble Tincture to light, that the Paradiſe might appeare, and that <note n="l" place="margin">The Spirit of this world.</note> it might be freed from vanity.</p>
            <p n="9">9. For the holy Element continually <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>

               </note> manifeſt: and therefore God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that Man is entred into the Spirit of this world, that he might manifeſt his wonders through him. Yet he deſireth alſo that <note n="r" place="margin">Man.</note> he ſhould not miſuſe this world, but that he ſhould goe againe out of this world into him: he deſireth that Man ſhould be where he is.

Why did God keep <hi>Iſrael</hi> forty yeares in the Wilderneſſe, and fed them with <note n="l" place="margin">With Manna.</note> Heavenly Bread? that they ſhould be a people, full of love, ſuch as love one another, and ſhould depend on God in one Love; and therefore he gave their Lawes brightneſſe [or clarity] to ſee if they could live in the Love of the Father, and then he would have ſent them among the Heathens, to turne them with their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; as was done at the time of the Apoſtles: and in that he fed them from the Heaven, and that none of them (which gathered much or little) had any want; thereby they ought to have knowne, that the Kingdome [the power and all] is Gods, and that they were in him: they ought to have left their covetouſneſſe, and to converſe among one another with brotherly Love, none ought to look after covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: becauſe he horribly puniſhed <note n="m" place="margin">Covetouſnes.</note> it.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Alſo when the Heathens ſhould heare, that God would ſend this People (which he had brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with great Wonders [or Miracles]) among them to deſtroy them, that they ſhould turne to God, and depart from covetouſneſſe, and enter into brotherly love: therefore he gave <note n="n" place="margin">The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</note> them a long time of reſpite; as alſo to <hi>Iſrael</hi> (whom he fed from Heaven) for an Example, that one people ſhould be an Example to the other, that there is a God that is Allmightie. But they being earthly both of them, and onely evill, and being they did live in the Fathers fierce anger, therefore the anger and ſeverity of God luſted alſo to devoure them, becauſe they continually kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note n="o" place="margin">His wrath.</note> it.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Therefore he ſaid to <hi>Joſhua, Paſſe over Jordan, and deſtroy that people: and leave none of them among you, that you be not polluted.</hi> This (ſaying of his) proceeded not out of his Love, when he did bid him to kill the Heathens: as alſo the Prophets did not all ſpeak from his Love, but from his Anger, which was awakened by the wickedneſſe of Man; ſo alſo he ſpeaketh many times through the Spirit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the Great World (in the Prophets and in <hi>Moſes)</hi> in the fire, or in other terrors in an angry Zeale.</p>
            <p n="25">25. And ſhould wee therefore ſay that God is well pleaſed with anger and ſtrife? No: the Prophets complained often (in the Holy Ghoſt [or Spirit] of God) that this evill people offended their God,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57651:136"/>
when they moved him to anger, ſo that accordingly his ſevere wrath went forth and devoured them. <hi>David</hi> ſaith in the fift <hi>Pſalme: Thou art not a God that are pleaſed with wicked wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="26">26. Now if Man awaken ſinne, then the fierce anger [or ſeverity] of God is ſtirred in himſelfe <hi>(viz.</hi> in Man) which otherwiſe (if Man did ſtand in humility) would reſt and be turned into great Joy, as was often mentioned before: But now when he burneth [in wrath] then one people devoureth the other, and one ſinne deſtroyeth another; if <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been <note n="p" place="margin">Honeſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, or had feared the Lord.</note> upright, they had not been put to make warre, but they ſhould have entred in with Wonders, and have converted the People, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have lead them into the [promiſed Land] with his [Miracles] or Deeds of Wonder: but becauſe they were wicked, they could not enter in (with the brightneſſe of <hi>Moſes;</hi> with deeds of wonder, in the luſtre [or glance] of the Father) to convert the Heathens: but <hi>Moſes</hi> (with his deeds of wonder) muſt ſtay in the Wilderneſſe: and the whole People was conſumed and devoured in the wrath: and <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt warre with the Heathens, and deſtroy them, for one <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>one ſinne.</hi>
               </note> wrath devoured the other.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Whereas <hi>Joſhua</hi> was an Image and ſimilitude, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not ſubſiſt in the Fathers clarity and love) ſhould be led by the ſecond <hi>Joſhua</hi> (or <hi>Jeſus)</hi> out of the wrath into the Love, through the breaking of his body, and entring into Death. <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt enter through Death into life, and bring his clarity, through Death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life: even as he appeared with <hi>Elias,</hi> on mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Joſhua</hi> (or <hi>Jeſus),</hi> in the claritie of the Father, and ſhewed him the pleaſure of the Father, <hi>[viz.]</hi> that he (the ſecond <hi>Joſhua)</hi> ſhould bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> (through his Death and clarity) into the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Land of Paradiſe.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Yet it could not be (how vigorouſly ſoever it was ſought after) that Man (in his own power) could enter into Paradiſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore poore captive Man muſt ſit in this world in the Devils murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Denne: where now the Devill hath built his Chappell cloſe by the Chriſtian Church, and hath quite deſtroyed the love of Paradiſe, and hath in the ſtead thereof ſet up meere covetous proud ſelfe-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led [or ſelfe-conceited] faithleſſe, ſturdy, malicious Blaſphemers, Theeves and Murtherers, which lift themſelves up againſt Heaven and Paradiſe, and have built themſelves a Kingdome (according to the Dominion of the fierce ſoure [Starres or] Conſtellations,) wherein they domineere (with ſilver and gold, and conſume the ſweat one of another, whoſoever is but able, oppreſſeth the other to the ground. And though he flie before him, yet then he onely putteth forth his Dragons tongue, and ſpitteth fire upon him: he terrifieth him with his harſh voyce, and plagueth him day and night.</p>
            <p n="29">29. What can he ſaid of thee O <hi>Cain?</hi> doeſt thou ſuppoſe that God
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57651:137"/>

O <hi>Eve!</hi> are not all, thy children which thou haſt brought forth? all come out of thy loynes. Was it then the purpoſe of God that the evill ſhould domineere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Good, and one plague another?</p>
            <p n="30">30. O no: But the Devill who is a cauſe of the <note n="r" place="margin">From the grimme wrath the Devill or Weeds or Tares are ſowen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Wheate.</note> wrathfulneſſe. <hi>Adam</hi> was made good out of the pure Element: but the longing [de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or luſt] of the Devill deceived him, ſo that he went into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world.</p>
            <p n="31">31. And now it cannot be otherwiſe, the two Kingdomes wreſtle one with another in the children of Men; the one is the Kingdome of Chriſt, [Generated] through the New Birth into Paradiſe: that (in this world) is miſerable and contemned, there are not many that deſire it, for it hath meere ſcorne and contempt from the Devill and his followers: it conſiſteth in righteouſneſſe and truth: and that is not valued in this world: and therefore it muſt lie at the Rich Mans doore with poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and at his feete: if any doe but let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that they are the childe of God, then the Devill will away with them preſently: or elſe will put them to ſuch ſcorne and diſgrace, that they cannot be knowne; that ſo the Devill may continue to be the Great Prince upon Earth, and that the world may not learne to know him.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The other Kingdome is that of Antichriſt, with a Golden [Splendour or] Glance, Prancing in ſtate, Gliſtering on every ſide: every one ſaith, it is a happy thing: for it adorneth it ſelfe moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, and ſetteth its ſeate over the Hills and Mountaines: every one ſaluteth it: [or doth it reverence:] it draweth the Tincture of the Earth to it ſelfe, that it may gliſter alone: it bereaveth the Kingdome of Chriſt of its temporall [food, livelihood, or] bread, it devoureth the ſweat of the needy: and ſaith to him, You are mine, I am your God, I will ſet you where I pleaſe: you are the dogge that lieth at my feete: If I had a minde to it, I could hunt you out of my houſe: you muſt doe what I will; and the needy Worme muſt ſay, I am your poore ſervant, doe but ſpare my life; and if he ſqueeze out the ſweat of his browes, ſo that it ſmarteth, (which his <note n="s" place="margin">Lord, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.</note> Maſter conſumeth [or ſpendeth]) then he groweth impatient with his Maſter, and curſeth him, and ſeeketh out wayes of lying and deceit, and by what way he might make his heavy burthen lighter.</p>
            <p n="33">33. And then if he finde his Maſter ſo unjuſt, he riſeth up againſt him, and taketh away his <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>falſe.</hi>
               </note> unrighteous Bread, which he thinketh to eate under a ſoft yoake, and <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>Plagueth.</hi>
               </note> worrieth him to the uttermoſt, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him no time to eſcape, but ſticketh full of impatience under that heavy burthen: he grumbleth and maundereth, and ſeeketh all evill
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57651:137"/>
devices to eaſe his yoake, that he might eate his bread in quietneſſe, and yet it will not be, the Driver [Hunter, cruell Tyrant his Maſter] is behinde him, and taketh away his bread, and feedeth him with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row under his yoake.</p>
            <p n="34">34. And then he ſtudieth cunning and deceit, and caſteth about, [to finde] which way he may by ſhifts and tricks fill his belly and live: he curſeth his Maſter ſecretly, and though he ſteale away cloſely by ſome ſlight the bread of another needy Man, yet that muſt be right [with him]: and his Maſter doth not regard it, ſo he eate not of his coſt, and ſo that he continue to be his dogge under his yoake. Thus the Maſter [Lord or Superiour] is unrighteous and <note n="x" place="margin">Evill or falſe.</note> wicked: and maketh alſo that his ſervant is unrighteous and <note n="x" place="margin">Evill or falſe.</note> wicked: whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe (if he might eate his bread under an eaſie yoake) he would not be ſo curſed and cunning in Theevery.</p>
            <p n="35">35. But what will the Spirit of this Kingdome ſay? Art thou not ſhining in Bravery? Haſt thou not taken poſſeſſion of all? Haſt thou not the Earth in poſſeſſion freely as God gave it thee? Doeſt thou not right? Doeſt thou not puniſh the wicked, and lookeſt to it, where the enemy breaketh it?

            <p n="36">36. But the Divine Anſwer in the Light of Nature ſaith to mee; Behold, out of what art thou growen? Have I planted thee? art thou not growen in my wilde Garden? When <hi>Adam</hi> went into the wilde Garden, there he <note n="z" place="margin">Grifted or inoculated.</note> planted thee, how art thou growen ſo great? who hath given thee vertue [or ſappe] thou wilde Tree? My Love never ſtirred thee up, all thy branches are wilde, and thy fruit is wilde; Doeſt thou think that my ſoule luſteth after thy food?

If God did not open our eyes, wee ſhould ſpeak ſimply of a keeper with a ſword: and Reaſon ſeeth nothing elſe.</p>
               <p n="40">40. But the Noble virgin ſheweth us the Doore, [and] how wee muſt enter againe into Paradiſe, through the ſharpneſſe of the ſword: yet the ſword cutteth the Earthly Body cleane away from the Holy Element: and then the New Man may enter into Paradiſe by the way of Life. And the ſword is nothing elſe, but the Kingdome or Gate of the fierceneſſe in the anger of God, where Man muſt preſſe in, through the fierce [bitter] Death, through the Centre, into the ſecond Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, into the Paradiſe of the holy Element before God; where then the fierce [grimme] Death, cutteth off the Earthly Body <hi>(viz.</hi> the foure Elements) from the holy [one] Element.</p>
               <p n="41">41. And the keeper of the Garden, is the Cherubine, the cutter off of the ſource [or quality] of the Starres, which holdeth the foure Elements for a while, and then breaketh them, and with its bitter ſharpneſſe ſevereth them from the ſoule, and paſſeth away it ſelfe alſo

Now if any body would come into the Garden, he muſt preſſe in through the ſword of Death; though indeed Chriſt hath broken the ſword, ſo that now wee can much eaſier enter in with our ſoules; yet there is a ſword before it ſtill: but he that findeth the way aright, him it doth not cut very much: for it is blunt, and it is bent; and if the ſoule goe but into the Gate, into the Centre, then it is preſently helped by the Noble Champion Chriſt; for he hath gotten the ſword into his <note n="e" place="margin">Into his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> hands: he is the ſlaine Lambe of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John;</hi> which took the Book of the <note n="f" place="margin">Shut, barred, or cloſed.</note> firſt Principle, out of the hand of the Ancient [of Dayes] who ſate upon the Throne, with his foure and twenty Elders (which [Book] had ſeven ſeales, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Spirits of the <note n="g" place="margin">Generation or operation.</note> Birth of God) and opened them: where the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders fell down before him, and worſhipped the Lamb that was ſlaine: and gave praiſe and honour to him which ſate upon the Throne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Champion of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had overcome.

Behold, thou immodeſt vile whoriſh world, here thou ſhalt finde a Glaſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy ſelfe [and ſee] what thou art.

For <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were entred into the Spirit of this world, and the Region of the foure Starres, with the infection of the Devill, had miſerably poſſeſſed them: and although they did ſomewhat ſtick to the word of the promiſe, yet the true longing and love towards God was very much extinguiſhed, and on the contrary, the longing and deſire after this world, was kindled in them, and beſides, they gat (from the Region of the Starres) a Beaſtiall luſt [or wanton deſire] towards one another, ſo that their Tincture thus became a fierce bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall [luſt or] longing: for they had no Law but the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they ſuppreſſed, and kindled themſelves in wanton [luſt], to which the Devill helped them.</p>
               <p n="46">46. And now when <hi>Eve</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Nor began to be conceived with childe.</note> was impregnated, her Tincture was wholly murtherous and falſe, for her Spirit in the Love, looked not upon God with a totall truſt and confidence: Alſo the wiſdome of God ſtood hidden in the Centre of the light of her life: <hi>Eve</hi> did not <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>incline.</hi>
                  </note> unite [or yeeld her ſelfe] to it with love and confidence, but much rather to the luſt of this world: ſhee muſt bring it to paſſe, if any thing were to be done: and being her Truſt was not in God, ſo alſo God was not in her, but in his own Centre [or Principle]: and the wrath began to flow forth [boyle or worke]; and this is that which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>An evill Tree bringeth forth evill fruit,</hi> and ſo out of a falſe Tincture

               </p>
               <p n="48">48. But the fault lyeth in Man; if he did put his Truſt in the love of God, then the Kingdome of God would have the victorie: but if he put it in his evill luſt and wantonneſſe, in himſelfe in his own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity [or power] then he is captivated by the wrath, and his body and ſoule is in the wrath. But when he putteth his minde and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, then he goeth out from the wrath, and the Kingdome of God worketh (in him) to righteouſneſſe: and thus it is ſeene as cleere as the Sunne, what the cauſe is, that the firſt Man borne of a Woman became a murtherer.</p>

               <p n="60">60. And the hardening is not ſo wholly in the Birth, that the ſoule (from the Mothers womb) ſhould be quite dead to God, or that God did not deſire it. The anger is in the flowing [working or boyling] of the Father, and the Father is God indeed, and generateth his deare Heart and Love (in the breaking of the Gate in the Habitation) out of himſelfe: ſhould he then be at oddes with himſelfe, becauſe his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is under the roote of his Love? Should he be at Enmity againſt himſelfe? his Anger is his Strength and Omnipotence [or Allmighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe], and Conſuming fire: and his heart in the Love, is his <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>humility.</hi>
                  </note> meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and ſo now, that which approacheth and entereth into his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is captivated in the Anger.</p>
               <p n="61">61. But it is poſſible to goe out from the Anger; as his deare heart is generated out of the Anger; which [cooleth, pacifieth, or] ſtilleth the Anger: and is rightly called the Paradiſe, or the Kingdome of Heaven. And his Anger is not knowne in the Heaven: and ſo there alſo; his Election goeth alwayes over the children of Love, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Kingdome of Heaven; and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh no otherwiſe of his Election: but meaneth [it of] them that draw neere to him, and enter into his Covenant, and give up themſelves to him: and theſe the Father draweth with the Holy Ghoſt, through the Death of Chriſt into the pure Element [that is] before the Father: <hi>Iſa</hi> 44. 2. <hi>Feare not thou [O] my ſervant Jacob, and thou</hi>

But that God (out of his purpoſe) ſhould harden the will of any, and make it darke, that is not true; the Spirit of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen from the wicked, who onely wreſtle for the might [or power] of the fire, for he himſelfe goeth out from God, and deſireth not [to enjoy] God. God withdraweth himſelfe from none: Man hath a free will, he may lay hold on what he will: but he is held by two (by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and by Hell) to which he yeeldeth, he is in that.</p>

               <p n="65">65. And know you not that the band of the Eternity ſtandeth free, and maketh it ſelfe? but that which inclineth to him is alſo <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>borne of God.</hi>

               <p n="66">66. Then wherefore doth not the ſoule of Man goe alſo [there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with] out of the Anger into the Love, and ſo it ſhould be generated [to be] another creature in the Love? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>Whom he hath foreſeene, thoſe he hath ſanctified, that they may be like his Image;</hi> the foreſeeing, is in his Election: he alwayes electeth [or chooſeth] his Sheepe. Thoſe who come to him, he aſſureth them the Eternall Life. But that he hardeneth (thoſe that deſire <note n="r" place="margin">Sincerely, or unfeinedly.</note> earneſtly to come to him) and will not foreſee [Predeſtinate or elect them] that is not ſo. His will is to helpe all Men: and Chriſt himſelfe ſaith: <hi>Come yee all to mee that are weary and heavy laden,</hi> (here it is, thoſe that are laden with ſinnes) <hi>I will refreſh you;</hi> that is, certainly, foreſee [or Elect] and draw [them] to mee: and there wanteth but to Come.</p>
               <p n="67">67. What is it now, that lyeth in the way of the wicked, that he cannot come? It is the Angry-Sword of the Angel (or Cherubine) which he will not breake, the faire, gliſtering, hypocriticall, dainty world in his boſom [malice or wickedneſſe] in fleſh and bloud, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him too well: he will not breake his minde, which yet he is able to doe: and if he doe breake it, then he is drawne of God (by Chriſt) to the Father: and inſtantly is choſen to [be] a childe of God: and out of the Image of the Serpent there cometh [to be] the Image of an Angel.</p>
               <p n="68">68. For ſo long as the Image ſtandeth in the Anger, it is the Image of the Serpent; but if it goe forth [from the luſt of ſinne, or deſire of evill], into the breaking [or deſtroying thereof] then a Heavenly Image is figured (by the Treader upon the Serpent); and <note n="ſ" place="margin">The Evill is overcome with Good.</note> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Head is broken; the two Kingdomes fight [or wreſtle] one with another, and that which overcometh figureth the Image.</p>
               <p n="69">69. Whereby it is ſeene, how great the Anger was in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> in that the wrathfull Kingdome ſooner overcame, than the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven: and the ſcorner is ſooner generated than the <note n="t" place="margin">Honeſt or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</note> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. But yet the fault of this was in the Parents: had they not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57651:142"/>
and let the Anger into them, then it had not been ſo, as at this Day.</p>
               <p n="70">70. Although indeed, Nature taketh hold of the childe (in the Mothers body [or womb]) and [ſhapeth, figureth, or] Imageth it: yet the <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

And although indeed it Image [or frame] a Man in the outward Beaſtiall Minde with a little underſtanding many times, yet that is no matter: the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man is the Beaſt of the Starres; but the inward (in the [one] Element) is the Image of God: and the divine framing [figuring or Imaging] is not performed in the <note n="y" place="margin">Foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but in the one holy Element.</note> outward, but in the inward Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="71">71. For a Man is many times (in the outward) ſo very evill natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red [or malicious froward conditioned] from the Starres, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>angry, or vexed with, and abborreth himſelfe.</hi>

79. Wee are eſpecially to obſerve in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> what their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was. <hi>Cain</hi> was a Plowman [or Tiller of the Ground] and <hi>Abel</hi> was a Shepheard [or keeper of ſheepe]: <hi>Abel</hi> relyed upon the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God towards his flock, to maintaine himſelfe by the bleſſing of God: <hi>Cain</hi> relyed upon his own labour, to maintaine himſelfe by his own skill and induſtry. <hi>Eve</hi> tooke part with <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> with <hi>Abel;</hi> for <hi>Eve</hi> counted him to be the Prince on Earth, to whom the Kingdome did belong, and ſuppoſed that he (as a Champion) would chaſe and hunt away the Devill; although ſhee knew <note n="r" place="margin">The Devill.</note> him not.</p>
               <p n="80">80. But if Men ſearch very Deepe, this [that followeth they will finde] is the very Ground. <hi>Eve</hi> was the Childe in the Matrix of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> (if he had not been overcome) ſhould have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated out of himſelfe, in great modeſty [purity] and holineſſe; but becauſe <hi>Adams</hi> Matrix was impregnated from the Spirit of this world, therefore God muſt frame a fleſhly woman out of it, which afterwards (in her firſt fruit) became luſtfull, and infected from the Devill, as well as the <hi>Limbus</hi> in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="81">81. And therefore they alſo generated ſuch a towardly childe as looked onely after covetouſneſſe: as <hi>Eve</hi> alſo did, who would be like God: and ſurely <hi>Adam</hi> had ſome minde that way, or elſe he ſhould not have entred into the ſpirit of this world.</p>
               <p n="82">82. And ſuch alſo now was their Sonne <hi>Cain:</hi> he ſuppoſed that he was Lord on Earth; and therefore he grutched that his Brother ſhould have any thing: eſpecially when he ſaw that he was accepted before God, that vexed him; and he thought that <hi>Abel</hi> ſhould come to be Lord on Earth: in his ſacrifice, he regarded not the feare of God, though he (as an appearing holy Man [or hypocrite]) ſacrificed alſo; but he regarded onely the <note n="ſ" place="margin">The higheſt place of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dominion.</note> Region.</p>
               <p n="83">83. And here the Antichriſtian Kingdome tooke its beginning, where Men <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſpeake good words before God.</hi>
                  </note> give God good words, and their heart is poſſeſſed with covetouſneſſe, and ſeek after nothing but power and authority, to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineere over the needy and miſerable, who truſt and relie upon God. Therefore Antichriſt hath his God in his Chiſt, and in the ſtrength of his power: and behinde his cloake there hangeth a Fox. He prayeth, yet he deſireth nothing elſe but the Kingdome of this world: his heart doth not leave off to perſecute and to hunt poore <hi>Abel.</hi> But <hi>Abel</hi> prayeth to the Lord, and his heart inclineth it ſelfe to the Love of God, in the true Image, for he deſireth the Kingdome of Heaven, and the Bleſſing of God here, for his <note n="u" place="margin">Neceſsitie, or ſubſiſtence of the body.</note> maintenance.</p>
               <p n="84">84. Now the Devill cannot endure that a holy Church ſhould grow up in his Dominions, he will murther <hi>Abel</hi> ſtill, as he did then; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Cain</hi> feared not God, therefore the Devill gat an acceſſe to him, and ſtirred up the inbred wrath in <hi>Cain</hi> againſt <hi>Abel,</hi> that he ſlew him. Here ſurely all the Devills danced at it, and thought, now is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57651:144"/>
ours againe: whereat <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were much amazed and affrighted, when they ſaw that he whom they accounted for a Prince became a murtherer; and as the Hiſtory ſaith, they copulated [or knew one another] no more in ſeaventy yeares after.</p>
               <p n="85">85. Now it being thus, therefore they ſought for quite another Treader upon the Serpent: alſo now they inclined their heart to God, ſo that ſeventy yeares after this murther, they begat a very upright [vertuous] holy Sonne that feared God, (who eſtabliſhed againe the pure Church of the feare of God and promiſed ſeede of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;) whoſe name was <hi>Seth;</hi> who alſo begat a very upright [vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous] Sonne, whoſe name was <hi>Enos,</hi> and then Men began to preach openly [or plainly] of God: and the Chriſtian Church alwayes roſe up like a ſmall flock, in ſpite of all the Regings of the Devills.</p>
               <p n="86">86. But <hi>Cain</hi> exalted himſelfe to be a Lord over his kindred: from whence aroſe the Dominion, and Rule or Government of this world, all (according to the influence of the Starres) generated <hi>per Spiritum Majoris Mundi,</hi> [by the Spirit of the <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme.</hi>
                  </note> Great world]: and is not as <hi>Cain</hi> ſuppoſed, ſo ordained, by the cleere Deity.</p>
               <p n="87">87. It is true indeed, when the world became ſo evill, malicious, and murtherous, then there muſt needs be Judges and Magiſtrates that the fierce wrath might be ſtopped by puniſhment and feare; but if thou haddeſt continued in Love, then thou ſhouldſt have had no Lords, but loving Brothers and Siſters O <hi>Cain!</hi> thy potent Kingdome cometh not from God, but hath its influence from the ſtarry Heaven in Anger, which domineereth over thee, and many times giveth thee Tyrants, who conſume thy ſweat in Pride, and this thou haſt for thy Paradiſe.</p>
               <p n="88">88. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth very well, that there is no [power, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or] Magiſtracy but of God; but he ſaith, it is an <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>for the puniſhment of evill doers.</hi>

               <p n="89">89. But if any ſay, that God doth [abhorre or] loath the Great Tyranny and Oppreſſion, when they domineere and take away the ſweat of the poore and needy, and conſume it in pride and ſtateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that <hi>Cain</hi> cannot endure: if the terrible Example of the Floud [or Deluge] did not ſtand there, then [Tyranny] would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted holineſſe; but thy <note n="z" place="margin">The time will not beare the Expoſition of this, let every one finde it with their own eyes.</note> Kingdome O <hi>Cain!</hi> is ſet up in <hi>Babell,</hi> and thy Beaſt Ruleth in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> there is a fire from the Lord of Heaven in it: it is time to goe with <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſinne is awakened in <hi>Cain.</hi>

90. Now when <hi>Cain</hi> had murthered his Brother, then he went ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely as a Lord: and thought, now thou art ſole Prince on Earth; but the voice of the fierce anger of God came, and ſaid; <hi>Where is thy Brother Abel?</hi> and he anſwered, <hi>I know not, Shall I be my Brothers keeper? And</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gods Anger.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſaid, What haſt thou done?

               </p>
               <p n="91">91. And now when the Anger of God ſtirred the ſinne in <hi>Cain,</hi> then it became awakened: and he was perplexed [or troubled]: and then his falſe Faith was ſeene: for he deſpaired, and ſaid; <hi>My ſinnes are greater, than that they can be forgiven mee: behold thou driveſt mee away from the Lord this day, and I muſt hide my ſelfe</hi>

               <p n="92">92. Here there appeareth to us the moſt terrible Lamentable and miſerable Gate of deſpaire, upon the committing of ſinnes: for when God ſaid; <note n="d" place="margin">This concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</note> 
                  <hi>Curſed art thou upon the Earth, which hath opened its mouth, and received thy Brothers bloud from thy Hands:</hi> then the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſelfe-potent, gliſtering, hypocriticall, flattering Kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt was rejected of God: and it hath (with it entring into the fierce wrath, in the Murther) ſeperated it ſelfe from God.</p>
               <p n="93">93. Therefore ſaid God; <hi>Be thou accurſed;</hi> and the diſtinction of this curſing or flying out of the fierceneſſe, <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſheweth.</hi>
                  </note> is, that the Love of God will not dwell in the fierceneſſe, and that Kingdome muſt not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after his Name: for God conſented not to the Murther, but the fierceneſſe [or wrath] of which God warned <hi>Cain,</hi> at his ſacrificing, [ſaying,] <hi>Be thou upright, and thou ſhalt be accepted; if not, then ſinne</hi> (and the Kingdome of the fierce wrath) <hi>lyeth at the Doore;</hi> he ſhould not let <note n="f" place="margin">The wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> it have any power, but ſhould rule over it, but when he let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it have power, then it ruleth, and vanquiſheth him.</p>
               <p n="94">94. Thus alſo God withdrew, that is, <hi>Cain</hi> went out from God: from the Kingdome of God, into the Kingdome of the fierceneſſe of the Driver: therefore alſo his affaires (which he further [managed, held forth, and] pretended) were not of God, but from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fierce wrath; that [fierceneſſe] lead him, and generated or awakened <note n="g" place="margin">The wonders of the fierce wrath.</note> its wonders through him, that the [Kingdome of the fierceneſſe] might be alſo manifeſted, even as it was a great wonder, <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>that.</hi>

               <p n="95">95. And there the Word, or the Treader upon the Serpent, ſtood in the new regenerated Element, in the ſoule of <hi>Abel,</hi> in the Centre, in the Gate of the Deepe, and did breake the Serpents (that is, the Kingdome of the fierceneſſes) head of its might; for the Head, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, the ſtrong Might of the fierce Anger.

               <p n="97">97. But it was miſerable, and all in vaine, for <hi>Cain</hi> (in his tender humanity) cryed woe woe is mee; his ſinnes were greater than <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>above his power.</hi>
                  </note> he, he could not in his own power preſſe in to God: he trembled and at length ſtood amazed before the Abyſſe of Hell, which had captivated him, and held him in it: he <note n="q" place="margin">Seperated.</note> ſevered himſelfe now alſo from [the company of] Men: and ſaid, <hi>Now whoſoever ſhall finde mee will ſlay mee, for I muſt flie from thy face.</hi>

               <p n="98">98.

Yet now he had in himſelfe nothing for a propriety, but the firſt and the third Principle: for as to his ſoule, he was in the firſt Principle, as all Men [are]: and as to the body, he was in the third Principle in the Kingdome of this world. And now he ſhould with his ſoule goe out of the Kingdome of this world, and preſſe into the ſecond Principle <hi>(viz.</hi> into the Truſt in God, into the Word of the Promiſe) to God, as <hi>Abel</hi> did: and labour with his hands in this world, and Plant and Build; but his minde ſhould be directed to God in confidence, and ſhould commend the <note n="f" place="margin">Rule or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> Kingdome of this world to God, and carry himſelfe therein as a travailing ſtranger, which onely with this ſtrange body is in his propriety, as to the body, and a ſtranger onely as to the ſoule, and beſides as an aſhamed Gueſt like a Priſoner in it: whoſe onely ſtudy ſhould be, to get againe into his true Native Countrey, out of which he is gone forth with his father <hi>Adam;</hi> but he let the ſecond Principle, the Kingdome of Heaven goe, and yeelded himſelfe wholly with his ſoule into the Kingdome of this world, where he would be Lord; and ſo the Anger took hold on him: for he went out from the Word, the Promiſe of Grace.</p>
               <p n="103">103. And then the Word ſtood againſt him, in the Centre of the Heaven: and he ſtood (in the Roote of the fierceneſſe) againſt the Word; for his Spirit went out of the Gate of the Centre of Heaven, and ſtood in the ſource [or active property] of the Originall of the Creation in the fierce Roote of the fire, and deſired the Out-Birth out of the Holy Element, (which alſo ſtood in the kindling in the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;) <hi>viz.</hi> the foure Elements.</p>
               <p n="104">104. His Anger againſt <hi>Abel</hi> came from hence, becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>tooke no pleaſure in the Kingdome of this world.</hi>
                  </note> ſtood not in this Birth, and his Spirit would not endure the Kingdome of <hi>Abel</hi> in his Kingdome: for he would rule (as by his own power,) in the <note n="h" place="margin">The firſt and the third.</note> two Principles (wherein he ſtood:) and therefore he ſlew <hi>Abel.</hi>

                  </note> falſhood, and there they felt the fire of the Anger with great horrour, trembling and crying; for they were gone out from God, and neither ſaw nor felt the heavenly ſource any more: and therefore they deſpaired, becauſe they found [or felt] themſelves in the ſource of the wrath: and the Body with all its Eſſences cryed; <hi>My ſinnes are greater than that they can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</hi>

And here is apparently ſeene the Glaſſe of the Abyſſe of Hell, and [of the] Eternall deſpaire; when the Anger of God riſeth up in the ſource, that the malice [and wickedneſſe] is made ſtirring, and there beginneth trembling, galling, and crying, and deſpaire in it ſelfe as to God: there the ſoule ſeeketh abſtinence in the Kingdome of this world, and findeth <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>

               <p n="107">107.

            <p n="2">2. Therefore now wee can ſpeak or write of nothing elſe but of his Wonders; for wee have a great Example of them in <hi>Cain,</hi> when the Kingdome of the fierce wrath (after his murther) awaked in him, and would have <note n="g" place="margin">By making him deſpaire in God.</note> devoured him: that God came to help him, when the Divine Juſtice (in his Conſcience) ſentenced him to Death, then the Divine Anſwer ſpake againſt it, [ſaying] No: <hi>Whoſoever ſlayeth Cain, it ſhall be avenged ſevenfold;</hi> by which ſpeech the fierce vengeance of the Abyſſe of Hell, was driven away from him, ſo that <hi>Cain</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57651:150"/>
and though he were gone forth from God, yet the Kingdome of Heaven ſtood towards him, he might turne, and enter into Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: God had not yet quite rejected him; but his malicious, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous, and his falſe confidence, he accurſed, and would not <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>conſent thereto.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. For God departed not from <hi>Cain,</hi> but <hi>Cain</hi> went himſelfe from God: if he had been ſtrong in Faith and Confidence in God, then he might have been able to enter into God again: even as he thought before the fall [into the murther], that he would break the head of the Serpent: but there it was ſeene, what Mans ability was; If he had laid hold on the true Treader upon the Serpent, then he might have gone inſtantly (in the vertue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. And here may be ſeene very exactly, who was the accuſer of <hi>Cain: viz.</hi> the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> which cryed to God from the Earth and awakened the fierce Anger againſt <hi>Cain;</hi> where the Eſſences of the ſoule of <hi>Abel,</hi> through the deep Gate of Anger, preſſed in to God, through the Treader upon the Serpent; and ſo ſtirred the Roote of the fire in <hi>Cain,</hi> whereby the Anger was awakened. Here conſider what the ſighings of the righteous, and their preſſing into God (in their unequall being oppreſſed) can doe; how it kindleth the Anger of God, as in <hi>Cain:</hi> whereas then fiery Coales are heaped upon the Drivers [or oppreſſours] head.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But when <note n="l" place="margin">The wrath, or the gnawing Worme of his Conſcience.</note> it was allayed againe by the voyce of God, then <hi>Cain</hi> did not know how that came to paſſe, and ſet his murther at Reſt, like one, who hath a ſecret gnawing Dogge ſitting in the Darke; yet he proceeded and built his powerfull Earthly Kingdome, and did not wholly put his truſt in God: for when he ſaw, that he muſt ſeeke for his Bread out of the Earth, and muſt take his cloathing from the <note n="m" place="margin">The Beaſts and that which groweth out of the Earth.</note> children of the Earth, therefore all his buſineſſe lay in the Art of Seeking, how and which way he might finde, and how to poſſeſſe the treaſure of that which was found, that he might alwayes have enough: becauſe he ſaw God no more, therefore he did like <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and when they ſaw him not (becauſe he was on the Mount) then they began their dancing and falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and asked after <hi>Moſes</hi> no more.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thus <hi>Cain</hi> now built his earthly Kingdome, and began to ſearch all manner of Arts, not onely in <note n="n" place="margin">Husbandry, plowing or Tilling of the ground.</note> Agriculture, but alſo in Mettalls,

            <p n="13">13. And it is highly to be found and conſidered by us, in the light of Nature, how the fierceneſſe [or wrath] is the Roote of all things, and moreover the Originality of the Life, therein onely conſiſteth the Might and the Power, and from thence onely proceed the Wonders: and without the fierceneſſe [or wrath] there would be no enmity, but all [would be as it were] a nothing, as is formerly mentioned.</p>
            <p n="14">14.

               <p n="39">39. Seeing now Man is entered into the Spirit of this world, and hath all Gates in [him] <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdome of Heaven, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Hell, and alſo the Kingdome of this world: and muſt thus live in the preſſe [or narrow chink] between heaven and this world; where the Devill ſtirreth up one Mocker after another (who are brought up by the Kingdome of fierceneſſe,) and continually ſtirreth them up againſt the Children of God, ſo that the world is full of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and Beaſtiall bloudy inceſtuous perſons: alſo murtherers and theeves: and becauſe covetouſneſſe grew up; therefore the Office of Ruling was moſt profitable, that the wicked <note n="l" place="margin">Hunter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutour, or oppreſſour.</note> Driver might be ſtopped by power [and authority].</p>
               <p n="40">40. And ſo it is ſeene how the Providence of God is come to the help of the Kingdome of this world: and hath by the Spirit of this world ſtirred up Rulers; who have inflicted puniſhment; yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God complaineth of them, that they are turned Tyrants, who ſuppreſſe all with their power: and the Abelliſh Church in love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not therein, but the ſtrong might of God, for the ſuppreſſing of evill Doers.</p>
               <p n="41">41. It is true indeed, the Judges and Kings, as alſo Princes and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers [or Magiſtrates] are the Officers of God in the houſe of this [foure Elementary] world, whom God (becauſe of ſinne) hath ſet to puniſh ſecretly, that thereby the wicked drivers [and oppreſſours] might be ſtopped.</p>
               <p n="42">42. And their ſtate [condition, Juriſdiction, or authoritie] is founded in the Originality of the Eſſence of all Eſſences, where God in the beginning created the Thrones, according to his Eternall Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: where then (both in Heaven and alſo in Hell) there are <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Throne-Princes.</hi>
                  </note> Thrones and Principalities, and alſo a Region [or Dominion] ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeven Spirits of the Eternall Nature, of which here much ought not to be ſaid, for the World holdeth it impoſſible to know ſuch things: whereas yet a Spirit borne in God <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>hath knowledge of.</hi>
                  </note> ſearcheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="43">43. But a true Judge, who judgeth according to righteouſneſſe, he is Gods Steward [viceroy or vicegerent] in the Kingdome of this world; and that it might not be needfull that God ſhould alwayes powre forth his wrath upon the people [and Nations], therefore he hath put the ſword into their hands to protect and defend the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and to puniſh the Evill: and if any doe ſo, in earneſt upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (in the feare of God, and nothing partially for <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>for by-reſpects.</hi>
                  </note> favour) then he is Great in the Kingdome of Heaven; for he beareth the [ſword] for righteouſneſſe, and he ſhineth, as the Sunne and Moone, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Starres.</p>
               <p n="44">
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:57651:154"/>
44. But if he turne tyrant, and doth nothing but devour the bread of his ſubjects: and onely adometh his ſtate and dignity in pride, to the oppreſſion of the needy, and hunteth after nothing but covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, accounting the needy to be but his dogges, and placeth his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice onely in voluptuouſneſſe, and will not heare the oppreſſed; then he is an inſulting tormenting Prince and Ruler in the Kingdome of Antichriſt, and is of the number of the Tyrants, and he rideth upon Antichriſts Horſe.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And wee are to conſider, how the true Chriſtian Church, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with the Cainiſh Antichriſtian Church, and how they live in one onely Kingdome in this world. As the firſt Principle incloſeth all, and yet can comprehend or hold nothing; but the Kingdome of Heaven is (from Eternity) brought forth out of the Anger, as a faire ſweet ſmelling flower, out of the Earth; ſo alſo the holy Church ſtandeth in the Antichriſtian; where they both together goe to pray before God, and one is accepted by God, and the other [is accepted] by the Spirit of this world, each Image goeth into its own Region [or Kingdome].</p>
               <p n="46">46. There is nothing more ſecret in this world, than the Kingdome of Chriſt; and alſo nothing more manifeſt than the kingdome of Chriſt; And it is often ſo, that he who ſuppoſeth he hath it, and liveth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, hath it not, but hath the Kingdome of Antichriſt, and he is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite and ſcorner, and hath the Serpents <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>Image.</hi>
                  </note> figure: and his heart alſo is but the heart of a greedy Wolfe, and he ſtandeth not in the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>Image.</hi>
                  </note> Figure.</p>
               <p n="47">47. On the contrary, many a one is in great anguiſh and longeth after <note n="q" place="margin">The kingdome of Chriſt.</note> it, and generateth very painfully, he would faine have <note n="q" place="margin">The kingdome of Chriſt.</note> it; but then the Devill ruſheth upon him: and after ſtirreth up irkſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe [vexation] and diſcontent, and alſo overwhelmeth him with great ſinnes, ſo that he knoweth not himſelfe: and then dejecteth him with impatience and doubting: and his heart ſtandeth continually in anguiſh, it would faine get out of Evill, and endeavoureth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for abſtinence or <note n="r" place="margin">Forgiveneſſe, comfort or reſt.</note> for bearance, many times with groanes, ſighing, and longing: But then the Devill holdeth his ſinnes before him, and barreth up the doore of the Grace of God, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Yet he ſoweth the Pearle in his afflicting anguiſh: and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill covereth it in him, that he may not know it, neither doth he know himſelfe: he ſoweth into the Kingdome of God, and knoweth not his own ſeede; but the ſeede of Sinne, and of the Hunter. And ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth not to the ſins which he committeth; but the Devill (with his <note n="s" place="margin">Sect.</note> followers [or aſſociates] over powre him, ſo that the Adamicall Man in the Anger doth that which the new borne [Man] in the holy Element willeth not: now though he doth it, yet the new Man in the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57651:155"/>
Image doth it not, but the old Man in the <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>in the ſtriving foure Elements.</hi>
                  </note> Anger; And therefore there is in him a continuall ſtrife, and he runneth continually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; where yet the hidden Man in the <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>in the ſtriving foure Elements.</hi>
                  </note> Anger cannot reach the Lilly, but the hidden Man [doth it].</p>
               <p n="49">49. Therefore he ſtandeth often in doubt and impatience: and in ſuch a Man there is great ſtrife; he knoweth not himſelfe: he ſeeth and knoweth nothing elſe but his wickedneſſe, and yet is borne in God; for his Spirit continually breaketh the gate of the Darkneſſe: but then the Anger in him doth hold him back that he cannot enter in; but yet ſometimes he reacheth a Glimpſe: from whence the ſoule is cheared, and the Pearle is ſowen in a very dark valley.</p>
               <p n="50">50. And then when he conſidereth the ſweet fore taſt of the Pearle, which he had, then the ſoule would faine goe through, and it ſeeketh the Pearle; but then cometh the Black Spirit, and covereth it from him, and then the ſtorme and ſtrife about the Pearle beginneth, each would have its right: the ſoule would have it: and then the Devill covereth it, and caſteth the wrath and <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>infirmities in the way to the Pearle.</hi>
                  </note> ſinne before it, that the ſoule ſhould behold it ſelfe therein; then there falleth to be weakneſſe and neglect, ſo that the poore ſoule becometh weary, faint, and timorous, and ſo ſitteth ſtill, and thinketh continually of ſome other way to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, [or <note n="x" place="margin">Comfort or Reſt.</note> Amendment] how it might beſt get the Pearle.</p>
               <p n="51">51. But the <note n="y" place="margin">Driver or Perſecutour the Devill.</note> Hunter is a cunning Artiſt, which cometh then with the Region of this world, with worldly luſts of the fleſh, with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall honour and riches, and holdeth them before the poore ſoule, that it might bite at his <note n="z" place="margin">Husks, or Crabbs.</note> Swines-Apples: thus he leadeth many a one for a long while, with his Chaines, captive in the Anger of God.</p>
               <p n="52">52. But if the Noble Graine of Muſtard-ſeede be ſowen, then the Noble virgin of God preſerveth it, and maketh the poore ſoule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually carefull, to endeavour for Abſtinence, and to enter into fight with the Devill. O what a wonderfull way is it the Children of God goe in this miſerable houſe of fleſh! which the Reaſon of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites neither comprehendeth, nor can beleeve, onely they that have tryed it, know it.</p>
               <p n="53">53. Though indeed the high precious knowledge is not [attained] except one hath overcome in the ſtorme, and hath vanquiſhed the Devill: ſo that the ſoule hath once attained the heavenly Gate, and gotten the Garland of Victory, which the lovely virgin of chaſtity ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up, as a triumphant Enſigne, of its conqueſt in its deare Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, Chriſt, and there riſeth up the <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the wonders w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> neither eye hath ſeene nor eare heard, nor ever entered into the heart to conceive.</hi>
                  </note> wonderfull knowledge, yet not in perfection.</p>
               <p n="54">54. For the old Enemy is ſubtile, and ſtrong: who ſtill aſſaulteth the ſoule againe, to trie, how he may afflict and deceive it; if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not over whelme it with ſinnes, then he beginneth an outward warre with it, and ſtirreth up the children of <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>Iniquity.</hi>
                  </note> malice againſt it, ſo that they
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57651:155"/>
contemne, mock, deride, and vilifie it, and doe all manner of evill to it; and ſo they lay waite for its body and goods, they jeere, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ſcorne it; and account it as the of-ſcouring of the world: they upbraid it for its infirmities: if it doe but reprove their faults and unrighteouſneſſe, then it muſt be an hypocrite [with them].</p>
               <p n="55">55. Not onely the Children of malice doe thus, but the Devill many times bringeth the Children of God, by his ſnares to be againſt it, ſo that in their blindneſſe they grow furious and raging, as <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did againſt <hi>Stephen.</hi> Thus the poore ſoule muſt be afflicted among Thornes and Thiſtles, and continually expect when the evill world ſhall teare away the body.</p>

               <head>The victorious Gate of the poore ſoule.</head>
               <p n="56">56. Now ſaith Reaſon, What is the beſt Counſell and Remedy for the poore ſoule? What ſhall it doe in this Bath of Thornes and Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? Behold, wee will ſhew thee the counſell of the <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>Wiſdome of God.</hi>

               <p n="57">57. Behold thou poore ſoule in thy Bath of Thornes, where is thy home? Art thou at home in this world? Wherefore then doeſt thou not ſeek the favour and friendſhip of the world? Wherefore doeſt thou not hunt after temporall honour, after pleaſure and riches, that it may goe well with thee in this world? Why doeſt thou make thy ſelfe a foole to the world, and art every ones Owle and footſtoole? Wherefore doeſt thou ſuffer thy ſelfe to be deſpiſed and abuſed by thoſe that are inferiour to thee, and know leſſe than thou? Why ſhouldeſt thou not be ſtately and brave with thoſe appearing holy hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites? and then thou wouldſt be beloved, and no body would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe thee: and thou wouldſt be more ſafe and ſecure in thy body and goods, than in this way, wherein thou art but the worlds Owle and foole.</p>
               <p n="58">58. But my loving virgin ſaith: O thou my beloved Companion, whom I have choſen, goe with mee, I am not of this world: I will bring thee out of this world into my Kingdome, there is meere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant reſt and wellfare: in my Kingdome is meere joy, honour, and glory: there is no <note n="e" place="margin">Hunter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutour or oppreſſour.</note> Driver in it: I will adorne thee with the glory of God, and put thee on, my bright Ornament.

               <p n="59">59. But I have a little againſt thee: I have drawen thee out of the thorny Bath, wherein thou wert a wilde Beaſt, and have figured thee for my Image; and yet thy wilde Beaſt ſtandeth in the Thorny Bath, which I will not take into my boſom, thou ſtandeſt yet in <note n="f" place="margin">In the foure Elements in fleſh &amp; bloud.</note> thy wilde Beaſt; now when the world taketh its wilde Beaſt which belongeth thereto, then I will take thee, and ſo every one ſhall have its own.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Wherefore doeſt thou love that wilde Beaſt ſo much, which doth but afflict thee? And beſides, thou canſt not take it with thee, neither doth it belong to thee, but to the world: let the world doe what it will with it, ſtay thou with mee: it is but a little while before thy Beaſt breaketh, and then thou art unbound, and abideſt with mee.</p>
               <p n="61">61. But I alſo have a Law in my Love, <hi>viz.</hi> I not onely deſire [to have] thee, but alſo thy brothers and ſiſters which are in the world, who are yet in part unregenerated, whom the <note n="g" place="margin">Hunter, or perſecutour.</note> Driver holdeth cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; thou muſt not hide nor bury thy Pearle, but ſhew the ſame to them, that they alſo may come into my Armes; thy mouth muſt not be ſhut, thou ſhalt walke in my Law and <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>Tell the Truth.</hi>

               <p n="62">62. And although the Driver compaſſeth thee about, and will fetch thee away, yet there is a limit ſet for thy Beaſt how farre it ſhall goe, the Hunter cannot breake [or deſtroy] it, ſooner than the limited time: and then if he doe breake it, it is done onely for [the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting of] Gods deeds of wonder, and for thy beſt good: all thy ſtripes in the Thorny Bath, ſhall ſtand in my Kingdome for a faire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of thy victory; and moreover, thou ſhalt have great joy in it, before the Angels of God, in that thou haſt deſpiſed the Hunter, and art gone out of a wilde Birth into an Angelicall one; O how thou wilt rejoyce when thou ſhalt think upon thy wilde Beaſt, which <note n="i" place="margin">Vexed and tormented.</note> plagued thee day and night, in that thou art <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>Releaſed.</hi>

Then thou haſt great honour for thy great ſhame; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why art thou ſo ſad? lift up thy ſelfe out of thy wilde Beaſt, as a faire flower ſpringeth out of the Earth; or doeſt thou ſuppoſe, thou wilde Beaſt, that my Spirit is mad, that it ſo little eſteemeth thee? Thou ſayeſt I am indeed thy Beaſt, yet thou art borne out of mee, if I had not growen forth, thou hadſt not been neither: Hearken thou my Beaſt: I am greater than thou: when thou wert to be, there I was

thy Maſter-framer: my Eſſences are out of the Roote of the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but thou art from this world, and thou breakeſt [or corrupteſt] but I live in my ſource [or quality] Eternally; therefore am I, much nobler than thou: thou liveſt in the fierce [wrathfull] ſource; but I will put my ſtrong fierce property into the Light, into the Eternall Joy: my works ſtand in power, and thine remaine in the figure; when I ſhall once be releaſed from thee, then I ſhall take thee no more to be my Beaſt againe; but [I will take] my new body which I brought forth in thee, in thy deepeſt roote of the holy Element. I will no more have thy rough iſſues of the foure Elements, Death ſwalloweth thee up: But I ſpring and grow out of thee, with my new body, as a flower out of its roote; I will <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>Leave thee.</hi>

                  </note> curſed thee together with the Earth) hath grafted my roote againe in his Sonne, and my body groweth in the holy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before God. Therefore thou art but my wilde Beaſt, which doeſt plague mee, and make mee ſick here, upon which the Devill rideth, as upon his accurſed Horſe: and although the world ſcorne thee, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not that; it doth that for my ſake: and yet it cannot ſee mee? neither can it know mee, and wherefore then is it ſo mad? It cannot murther mee, for I am not in it.</p>
               <p n="64">64. But thou mad world, what ſhall the Spirit ſay [of thee]? Art thou not my Brother: the Eſſences of my Spirit ſtirre thee: goe forth out of thy Beaſt, and then I will goe with my Companions into the Garden of Roſes, into the Lilly of God; why keepeſt thou back, and ſuffereſt thy ſelfe to be held by the Devill? Is he not thy enemy, he doth but hunt after thy Pearle; and if he get it, then thy Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a Worme and Beaſt in its figure; why ſuffereſt thou thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Image to be taken away, for temporall pleaſure ſake? Thy pleaſure is onely in the corruptible Beaſt, but what doth that avayle the ſoule? If thou doeſt not goe out from it, thou wilt get Eternall woe and ſorrow by it.</p>
               <p n="65">65. Or what ſhall thy Noble Warriour Chriſt ſay to it? Have not I [ſaith Chriſt] broken thy wilde Beaſt? am not I entred into Death? I have cut off from thy ſoule, the foure Elements, and the wickedneſſe [or malice] of the Devill: and have <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>ingrafted.</hi>
                  </note> inoculated thy ſoule into my vertue [or power] that thy body might ſpring and grow againe out of my body, out of the holy Element before God; and I have bound my ſelfe to thee by my Spirit: have I not made a Covenant with thee, that thou ſhouldſt be mine? Have I not given thee my body for food, and my bloud for drink? Have I not given thee my Spirit for a <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>leader.</hi>
                  </note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour, and allotted thee my Kingdome for thy own? Wherefore doeſt thou deſpiſe mee, and goeſt away from mee? Thou runneſt after the Wolves and the Dogs, and howleſt with them, and thou ſeekeſt onely after anger, and how thou mayeſt bite [and devoure]: thou

And now if wee look round about us every where, upon Heaven and Earth, the Starres and Elements; yet wee can ſee and know no way [or paſſage] where wee may goe to our Reſt: wee ſee no other than the way of the entrance in, of our Life, and then of the end of our Life, where our body goeth into the Earth, and all our Labour (alſo our Arts and Glory) is inherited by another, who alſo vexeth himſelfe therewith for a while, and then followeth after us: and that continueth ſo from the beginning of the world to its end.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wee can in our miſery never <note n="b" place="margin">Underſtand, or comprehend.</note> know, where our Spirit doth abide, when the body breaketh, and cometh to be a Carkaſſe, except wee be againe new-borne out of this world, that ſo wee may dwell in this world as to our body, and as to our minde in another eternall perfect new life, wherein our ſpirit and minde putteth on a new Man, wherein he muſt and ſhall live Eternally: and then wee firſt know what wee are, and where our home is.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Seeing then wee clearly ſee and underſtand, that wee have our beginning altogether Earthly: and are ſowen in a field (as Graine is ſowne in the Earth); where our life ſpringeth up, groweth, and at length flouriſheth as Corne [or graine] doth out of the Earth; where wee can know in us nothing but an earthly life; yet wee ſee very well that the <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>Starres.</hi>
                  </note> Conſtellations and Elements qualifie [or work] in us, and nouriſh, drive, governe, and guide us, alſo fill us and bring us up, and ſo preſerve our life a while: and then breake it againe, and turne it to duſt and aſhes; like all Beaſts, Trees, Plants, and all [things] that grow, but wee ſee not how it is with us afterwards, whether all be ended with it, or whether wee goe with our Spirit and Converſation into another life: and therefore it is moſt neceſſary to learne and to ſeeke the right way.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now that is teſtified to us by the Writings of thoſe who have been regenerated out of this <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſſe.</hi>
                  </note> Earthlineſſe, and at length are entred into a holy and uncorruptible life, who have written and taught of an Eternall joyfull Life, and alſo of an Eternall periſhing and anguiſhing Life: and have taught us how wee ſhould follow after them; and how wee ſhould ſtep into a new Birth, where wee ſhould be regenerated out of this Earthlineſſe, into a new Creature: and that wee ſhould
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57651:158"/>
doe nothing elſe about it but follow them: and then wee ſhould finde <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>really.</hi>
                  </note> in deed and in truth, what they had ſpoken, written, and taught: yea even in this life wee ſhould ſee our true Native Countrey in the new Regeneration, and <note n="f" place="margin">uunder ſtand, or apprehend.</note> know it (in the new-borne Man) in great Joy, whereas then our whole minde would incline to it: and in our new knowledge (in the new Man) true Faith would grow, and the hearty defire of the unfeigned love towards the hidden God; for which noble knowledge ſake, many times <note n="g" place="margin">Holy people.</note> they have yeelded their earthly body and life, to the unregenerated gainſayer (according to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh, malicious revengefulneſſe) into Death, and have taken it with great Joy; and have choſen for themſelves the Eternall uncorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Life.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Seeing then, there is the greateſt and higheſt Love in the new Birth, not onely towards God, or ones ſelfe, but alſo towards Men, our brothers and ſiſters: and ſeeing thoſe that were unregenerated, have had their deſires and love ſo carried towards Men, that they have very earneſtly taught men with meekneſſe and reproving: and that their love to them in their Teaching, hath been ſo great, that they have even willingly yeelded their life up to Death, and left their earthly goods, and all they had, in aſſured hope, (in their ſtrong and firme knowledge) to receive all againe in great honour [and glory].</p>
               <p n="9">9. And therefore wee alſo have longed to ſeeke after that Pearle, of which wee write at preſent; and though now the unregenerated (in the Kingdome of this world) will give no credit to us (as it hath happened to our forefathers, from the children of this world) wee cannot help that, but it ſhall ſtand for a witneſſe againſt them, which ſhall be a woe to them Eternally, that they have ſo fooliſhly ventured [and loſt] ſo great an Eternall Glory and holineſſe, for a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the eye, and luſt of the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And wee know (in our deep knowledge) that <note n="h" place="margin">The holy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</note> they have rightly taught and written, that there is one onely God, which is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in Perſonall Diſtinction, as is before-mentioned. And wee alſo know that he is the Creatour of all things; that he hath generated all out of his own <note n="i" place="margin">Eſſence or Beeing.</note> ſubſtance, both light &amp; darkneſſe, as alſo the Thrones and <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </note> Dominions of all things. Eſpecially wee know (as the holy Scripture witneſſeth throughout) that he hath created Man to his own Image and ſimilitude, that he ſhould Eternally be, and live in the Kingdome of Heaven, in him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And then wee know alſo, that this world (wherein wee now are and live) was generated, out of the Eternall Originall, in time; (through the pure Element) in the Fiat, and ſo created; and ſo, <note n="l" place="margin">The world of foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> it is not the ſubſtance of the holy pure Element; but an iſſue [or out-birth] out of the Eternall <hi>Limbus</hi> of God, wherein the Eternall Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57651:158"/>
conſiſteth, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is before the cleere Deity, wherin conſiſteth Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, &amp; the Kingdome of Heaven: &amp; yet the <hi>Limbus,</hi> together with the pure Element, is not the pure Deity, which is alone holy in it ſelfe, and hath the vertue of the Eternall Light ſhining in it: but hath no Eſſences (in the light of the Clarity) in it: for the Eſſences are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the vertue, <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>of.</hi>
                  </note> according to the Light, as a Deſire; and the deſire attracteth to it, from whence the Eſſences proceede, as alſo the Eternall Darkneſſe in the ſource, as is before-mentioned.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Seeing then God is all in all, and hath created Man to his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſimilitude, to live with him Eternally in his Love, Light, Joy and Glory; therefore wee cannot ſay, that he was meerly created out of the corruptibility of this world: for therein is no Eternall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Life, but Death, and perplexity, anguiſh, and neceſſity; but as God dwelleth in himſelfe, and goeth through all his works, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibly to them: and is hindred by nothing; ſo was the ſimilitude before him out of the pure Element: it was indeed created in this world, yet the Kingdome of this world ſhould not comprehend that [Image], but the ſimilitude (Man) ſhould mightily, and in perfect [power or] vertue, Rule through the Eſſences, (with the Eſſences out of the pure Element of the Paradiſicall holy <hi>Limbus)</hi> through the Dominion of this world.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Therefore he breathed into him the living ſoule out of the Eternall will of the Father: (which will goeth thither onely to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his Eternall Sonne:) and out of that will, he breathed into Man; the ſame is his Eternall ſoule, which muſt ſet its regenerated will in the Eternall will of the Father, meerly in the <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>Sonne of God.</hi>
                  </note> Heart of God, and ſo it receiveth the <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>power.</hi>
                  </note> vertue of the Heart of God, and alſo his holy Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Light, wherein Paradiſe, the Kingdome of Heaven, and alſo the Eternall Joy ſpringeth up; and in this vertue [or power] it goeth through all things, and <note n="p" place="margin">Hurteth or moveth.</note> breaketh none of them, and is mighty over all [things] as God himſelfe is: for it liveth in the vertue [or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er] of the Heart of God, and eateth of the Word [that is] genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of God.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Thus alſo wee know, that the Soule is a Spirit: generated out of God the Father, in the Throne and entrance out of the recompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended [or reconceived] will, out of the Darkneſſe into the Light, to the generating of the Heart of God: and that [ſoule] is free, to Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it ſelfe above <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Above the Heart of God as</hi> Lucifer <hi>did.</hi>
                  </note> it, in the will, or in the Meekneſſe in the will of the Father, to comprehend and incline it ſelfe to the Birth of the Heart of God the Father.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But its body (which is the true Image of God, which God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſtandeth before the cleare Deity, and is in and out of the holy pure Element: and the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the Element (out of which the Eſſences generate) is the Paradiſe, an Habitation of God the holy
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57651:159"/>
Trinity; Thus was Man an Image and ſimilitude before God, wherein God dwelleth, in which (through his Eternall Wiſdome) he would manifeſt his Wonders.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And now as wee underſtand, that Man (with the ſimilitude wherein God dwelleth) is not meerly at home in this world, much leſſe in the ſtincking <note n="r" place="margin">Cadaver. Corps.</note> Carkeſſe; ſo it is manifeſt (in that wee are ſo very blinde as to Paradiſe) that our firſt Parents (with their Spirit) are gone out of the heavenly Paradiſe, into the Spirit of this world: where then the Spirit of this world, inſtantly captivated their body, and made it Earthly; ſo that body and ſoule are periſhed: and now wee have the pure Element no more for our body, but the iſſue [or Out-Birth] <hi>(viz.</hi> the foure Elements, with the Dominion of the Starres) and the Sunne onely is the light of the body: alſo this body doth not belong to the Deity: God doth not diſcover himſelfe in the ſtincking Carkeſſe [or Corps]; but in the holy Man, in the pure Image which he created in the beginning.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Now Man being thus fallne, out of the holy into the unholy, out of the Image of God into the Earthly corruptibility, therefore his body ſtood in the corruptible Death, and his ſoule in the Eternall will of the Father; yet <note n="ſ" place="margin">Or, <hi>averted.</hi>
                  </note> turned away from the Heart of God, into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world; captivated by the Eternall Darkneſſe: for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goeth out from God, goeth into the Eternall Darkneſſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Heart of God there is no Light.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And now there was no [remedie or] Counſell for this Image, except it were new regenerated by the ſoule, through the Heart and Light of God, through which the new Element before God <hi>(viz.</hi> the body of the ſoule) is regenerated; or elſe the Deity would not nor could not dwell therein; this, Man (by his own vertue or power) was not able to <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>bring to paſſe.</hi>
                  </note> attaine: therefore if it were to be done, then the <hi>Barmhertzigkeit,</hi> Mercifulneſſe, or Mercy of God muſt doe it.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And here wee give the Reader (that loveth God) to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand cleerly in the Great Deepe, what the pure Element is, wherein our body (before the Fall of <hi>Adam)</hi> ſtood, and in the new Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration now at preſent ſtandeth alſo therein; It is the heavenly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity, which is not barely and meerly a Spirit, wherein the cleere Deity dwelleth: it is not the pure Deity it ſelfe; but [it is] genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Eſſences of the holy Father, when as he continually and Eternally goeth in through the Eternall Gate, in the Eternall minde in himſelfe (through the recomprehended will) into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Habitation; where he generateth his Eternall Word.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Thus the pure Element is the <hi>Barm</hi> [or warme] in the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the attracting to [be] the Word: the Eſſences are Paradiſe, and the <hi>Barm</hi> [or warme] is the Element: thus now the Father continually ſpeaketh the Eternall Word, and ſo the Holy Ghoſt goeth
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57651:159"/>
forth out of the ſpeaking: and that which is ſpoken forth is the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Wiſdome: and it is a virgin: and the pure Element <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Barm</hi> [or warme] is her body: wherein the Holy Ghoſt diſcovereth himſelfe through the out ſpoken Wiſdome; and ſo the flaſh [or glance] out of the Light of God in the Holy Ghoſt, is called <hi>hertz</hi> [or heart]; this receiveth the Element in the Eſſences of Paradiſe, that it may be ſubſtantiall, and then it is called <hi>ig</hi> [or <hi>ed]:</hi> and the ſtrength of the Father, and the great Might of the fire, goeth as a flaſh into the Eſſences, and that is called <hi>keit</hi> [or <hi>neſſe],</hi> like a might [or force] which preſſeth through, as a ſound [or noiſe] which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth not the ſubſtance aſunder; and this together is called <hi>Barm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hertz-ig-keit [Warm-heart-ed-neſſe]</hi> or <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Mercifulneſſe,</hi> and this ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before God: and God (the holy Trinity) dwelleth therein.</p>
               <p n="21">21. And the virgin of the Wiſdome of God is the Spirit of the pure Element: and is therefore called a virgin, becauſe it is ſo chaſt [or pure], and generateth nothing: yet as the flaming Spirit in Mans body, generateth nothing, but openeth all ſecrefies, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is that which <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>bringeth that which is hidden, to Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi>
                  </note> generateth, ſo alſo here; the wiſdome, (or the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall virgin) of God, openeth all the great Wonders in the holy Element; for there are the Eſſences, wherein the buddes [or fruits] of Paradiſe ſpring up; and if wee take the Eternall Band (and that together) wherein the Deity generateth from Eternity, then it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Eternall <hi>Limbus</hi> of God, wherein conſiſteth the Eſſence of all Eſſences.</p>
               <p n="22">22.

               </p>
               <p n="23">23. Thus know (my beloved Reader) that our Father <hi>Adam</hi> is gone out of this Glory into the Out-Birth of the ſubſtance of this world: and now if he be to be helped, then the <hi>Barmhertzigkeit,</hi> or <note n="y" place="margin">Or, <hi>Mercy.</hi>

25. Seeing now wee know, that wee loſt our heavenly Man in our firſt fall, ſo alſo wee know that a new <note n="a" place="margin">Heavenly Man.</note> one is generated to us in the Mercifulneſſe of God, into which wee ſhould and muſt enter, if wee will be the children of God: and without <note n="a" place="margin">Heavenly Man.</note> this wee are the children of the Anger of God.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And as the Prophets have written of it, ſo the New Man, (which is borne <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>in.</hi>
                  </note> to us of God) is the Sonne of the Virgin: not of Earthly fleſh and bloud, alſo not of the ſeede of Man, but conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and borne of a pure divine chaſt virgin: and (in this world) revealed [or manifeſted] in our fleſh and bloud: and is entred with his holy body into Death: and hath ſeperated the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly [body] together with the might of the Anger, from the holy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hath <note n="c" place="margin">Brought it into the ſoule againe.</note> reſtored the ſoule againe, and hath opened the Gate to the Light of God againe, ſo that the averted ſoule can (with the Eſſences of the Father in the holy will) reach the Light of God againe.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Therefore now wee know, that wee were not created to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate [<note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>in an Earthly, but heavenly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
                  </note> that which is] Earthly, but Heavenly, out of the body of the pure Element; which [body] <hi>Adam</hi> had before his ſleepe, and [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore] his <hi>Eve</hi> [was], when he was neither Man nor Woman [male nor female], but one onely Image of God, full of chaſtity, out of the pure Element; he ſhould have generated an Image againe like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: but becauſe he went into the Spirit of this world, therefore his body became earthly; and ſo the heavenly Birth was gone, and God muſt make the Woman out of him, as is before-mentioned; Now if wee the children of <hi>Eve</hi> be to be helped, then there muſt come a new virgin, and beare us a Sonne, who ſhould be God with us, and in us.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And therefore inſtantly at the Fall, the Word of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (and in the Word the Light) through the holy Ghoſt entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy Element, and into the chaſt virgin of the wiſdome of God, and made a precious Covenant, to become a creature in this virgin, and to take away the Devils power in the Anger, and to deſtroy his Kingdome; and this Chriſt would yeeld himſelfe to be in the periſhed humanity: and with his entring into Death, ſeperate the Hell of the Anger, and the kingdome of this world from us; and God the Father diſcovered this Word (of the promiſed ſeede of the Woman) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly (after the Fall) in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> where inſtantly it gave up it ſelfe (in the Eternall Eſpouſall) into the Centre of the Light of Life, and ſeperated all the ſoules of Men (who have inclined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and yeelded themſelves up to him,) in the dying of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; from the Anger of God, and from the Kingdome of this world, and brought them in to him, (into the pure Element of the Paradiſe) into the Joy, and into the chaſt virgin of God, there to waite, till God breake the kingdome of this world, with the Starres and Elements;

where then inſtantly the pure Element ſhall be inſtead of the Out-Birth; and there ſhall ſpring and grow the new body, upon the ſoule, in the holy Element before God eternally.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Now if wee [would] conſider his precious incarnation [or becoming Man], then wee muſt rightly open the eyes of the Spirit, and not be ſo earthly minded, as at preſent they are, in <hi>Babell;</hi> and wee muſt rightly conſider, how God is become Man; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith; <hi>He was conceived and borne without ſinne, of a pure virgin.</hi> Here conſider now beloved Minde, what kinde of virgin that was? for all whatſoever is borne of the fleſh and bloud of this world, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, and there can no pure virgin be generated, in this corrupted fleſh and bloud; the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> deſtroyed all: and it is all under ſinne, and there is no pure virgin generated of Mans ſeede: and yet this Chriſt was conceived and borne of a pure virgin.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Here the learned (of the Schooles [or Univerſities] of this world muſt ſtand ſtill; and the Scholler (borne of God) muſt here begin to <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>teach.</hi>
                  </note> learne concerning this Birth; for the Spirit of this world apprehendeth no more here, this is fooliſhneſſe to it: and though he goe very far <note n="f" place="margin">In ſtudying the literall wiſedome of Reaſon, and be excellent therein.</note>, yet he is but in <hi>Babell,</hi> in his own Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Therefore wee ſet it downe here (according to our knowledge) that the pure chaſt virgin (in which God was borne [or generated]) is the chaſt virgin [that is] in the preſence of God: and it is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall virgin; before ever Heaven and Earth was created, it was a virgin, and that without blemiſh; and that pure chaſt virgin of God, put it ſelfe into <hi>Mary,</hi> in her <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> Mary's <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be a humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Man.</hi>
                  </note> Incarnation, and her new Man, was in the holy Element of God: and therefore ſhee was the bleſſed among all Women, and the Lord was with her, as the Angel ſaid.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Thus now wee may know, that God is All in All, and filleth All, as it is written; <hi>Am not I he that filleth all things;</hi> and therefore wee know, that the holy pure Element in Paradiſe is his dwelling; which is the ſecond Principle: and is in all things, and yet the thing (as a dead dark out-Birth) knoweth it [the ſecond Principle] not (as the pot [knoweth not] its Potter) ſo alſo that [thing] neither comprehendeth nor apprehendeth that [ſecond Principle]. For I cannot ſay (when I take hold of, or comprehend any thing) that I take hold of the holy Element, together with the Paradiſe and the Deity, but I comprehend the Out-Birth, the kingdome of this world, <hi>(viz.</hi> the third Principle and the ſubſtance thereof) and I move [or ſtirre] not the Deity therewith. And ſo wee are to know [and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand] that the holy new Man [is thus] hidden in the Old, and not ſeperated, but in the Temporall Death.</p>
               <p n="33">33. And now ſeeing the holy [thing] is in all places, and ſeeing the ſoule is a Spirit; therefore there is nothing wanting, but that our ſoule comprehend the holy [thing], ſo that it hath that for its own,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57651:161"/>

               <p n="34">34. And therefore thus wee ſay of <hi>Mary:</hi> ſhee hath comprehended the Holy Heavenly Eternall Virgin of God, and put on the Holy and Pure Element, [together] with the Paradiſe, and yet was truly a virgin in this world [generated] by <hi>Joachim</hi> and <hi>Anna.</hi> But ſhee was not called a holy pure virgin according to her earthly Birth: the fleſh which ſhee had from <hi>Joachim</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> was not pure, without ſpot; but her holineſſe and purity is according to the Heavenly <note n="h" place="margin">The wiſdome of God.</note> virgin: beſides, ſhee brought not the heavenly virgin to her out of her own ability; for the Angel ſaid to her, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall came upon thee, and the Power of the moſt High ſhall over-ſhadow thee; therefore that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly [thing] that ſhall be borne of thee ſhall be called the Sonne of God.</hi>

               <p n="42">42. Therefore the body of Chriſt is inferiour to the Deity; and in theſe our humane Eſſences he ſuffered Death, and his Deity of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man in the pure Element, entered together alſo into Death, and

bereaved Death of its power, and did ſeperate the naturall ſoule (which Chriſt commended to his Father, when he dyed on the Croſſe) from the Kingdome of this world, alſo from Death, from the Devill, and from Hell (in the ſtrong divine Might [or power]), and opened a Gate for us all, who come to him, and incline our ſelves (with minde and thoughts) to him; then the Father draweth our ſoule (which is in him) into the pure love of Chriſt: where then it putteth its Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againe through Chriſt <note n="t" place="margin">Or, <hi>in true Reſignation.</hi>

               <p n="43">43. And for this cauſe, God became Man, that he might in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe new generate the ſoule of Man againe, and might redeeme it from the chaines of the fierceneſſe of Anger: and not at all [for the Beaſtiall bodies ſake) which muſt melt againe into the foure Elements and come to nothing; of which nothing will remaine, but the ſhadow in the figure of all <note n="u" place="margin">His or Mans works.</note> its works, and <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſubſtance, things or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</hi>

And that you may rightly and properly underſtand us: wee [meane or] underſtand here, no ſtrange Chriſt, who is not our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as himſelfe ſaid, at his reſurrection: <hi>Goe to my Brethren, and your Brethren, and tell them, I goe to my God and to your God.</hi> As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the body (which wee here carry about us) is not the Image of God, which God created; for the Kingdome of this world put its Image upon us, when <hi>Adam</hi> conſented to yeeld to it: and wee (if wee be regenerated,) are not at home in this world, with our New Man; as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples; <hi>I have called you out of this world, that you ſhould be where I am:</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our Converſation</hi> (as to the New Man) <hi>is in Heaven.</hi> Thus wee underſtand alſo that our <hi>Immanuel</hi> [who is] the moſt holy of all, with his true Image of God (wherein alſo our true Image of God doth conſiſt) is not of this world; but as the Old Mortall Man (from the Kingdome of this world) hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us, ſo our Mortall Man alſo hung to the Image of God in Chriſt, which he drew from his Mother <hi>Mary,</hi> as the pure Element [draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] the Kingdome of this world [to it].</p>

But now wee muſt not think, that the holy Man, (in Chriſt,) dyed, for that dyeth not: but the mortall [Man] from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world [is that which dyeth]; that [was it which] cryed (on the Croſſe) <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee:</hi> and wee ſee very cleerly the great Might [and power] of the holy Man in Chriſt, when the mortall (which was taken from this world) went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death: how the holy Allmighty [Man] wreſtled with Death, in ſo much that the Elements did ſhake with it, and the Sunne (which is the Light of the Nature of this world) loſt its ſplendor, as if it were then to periſh; and then the living Champion in Chriſt, fought with the Anger, and ſtood in the Hell of the Anger of God, and looſed the ſoule (which he commended into his Fathers hands) quite off from the Anger of God, alſo from the ſource [or Torment] of Hell; and that was it which <hi>David</hi> ſaid; <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell, nor permit thy holy [one] to</hi>

               <p n="48">48. And as <hi>Adam</hi> had opened the Gate of the Anger, ſo hath the Deity of Chriſt opened the Gate of the Eternall Life, ſo that all men can preſſe in to God, in this opened Gate. For the third Principle is broken here, and Judgement paſſed upon the Prince of Darkneſſe, which ſo long held us priſoners in Death.</p>
               <p n="49">49. But ſince Man is ſo ſlow of apprehenſion, it may be wee ſhall not ſufficiently be underſtood; and therefore wee will once more ſet it downe briefly and accurately, how theſe great Myſteries are; for wee know what Adverſary wee have <hi>(viz.</hi> the Prince of this world) he will not ſleepe, but try what he can to ſuppreſſe this Noble Graine of Muſtard-ſeede.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="52">52.

Beſides, it is not the ground neither, which the Ancients and thoſe heretofore, have ſet downe, (which yet went very high) as if <hi>Mary</hi> from Eternity had been hidden in <hi>Ternario ſancto</hi> [the holy Ternary or Trinity], and that ſhee entered at that time onely into <hi>Anna,</hi> as into a Caſe, [or houſe]; and were not of the ſeede of <hi>Joachim,</hi> and bloud of <hi>Anna.</hi> They ſay, ſhee was an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall virgin out of the Trinity, of whom Chriſt was borne: becauſe he came not out of the fleſh and bloud of any Man: and as himſelfe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, that he was not of this world, but was come from Heaven: he ſaith, <hi>That he came forth from God, and muſt returne againe to God:</hi> and to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> he ſaid, <hi>None goeth into Heaven, but the Son of Man which is come from Heaven, and who is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="53">53. And there he ſpake cleerly of the Son of Man, of his humanity, and not of his Deity meerly: for he ſaith plainly, <hi>The Sonne of Man:</hi> But God from Eternity was not the ſonne of Man, and therefore no ſonne of Man can proceed from the Trinity; therefore wee muſt look upon it aright. If <hi>Mary</hi> had proceeded out of the Trinity, where ſhould our poore captivated ſoules have been? If Chriſt had brought a ſtrange ſoule from Heaven, how ſhould wee have been delivered? Had it been poſſible to redeem Man [without it] what needed God to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our forme, and be crucified? If it could have been ſo, then God ſhould inſtantly have ſeperated or freed <hi>Adam</hi> from Death, when he fell; or doeſt thou ſuppoſe that God is ſo maliciouſly zealous, as to be ſo angry without a Cauſe?</p>
               <p n="54">54. Indeed, when his wrath was ſprung up in Man, then he would manifeſt his wonders, but that was not the purpoſe of God when he created <hi>Adam;</hi> but it was tried which of them ſhould get the victory, the Meekneſſe or the fierceneſſe in the Eternall Roote: but the ſoule in <hi>Adam</hi> was yet free: and there was nothing elſe that could periſh but the <note n="a" place="margin">Selfe-will, or free-will.</note> own will.</p>
               <p n="55">55. And ſo now the ſoule was the will, which was breathed into <hi>Adam,</hi> by the Spirit of God out of the Eternall will of the Father: and yet out of that place where the Father <hi>(viz.</hi> God) out of the Darkneſſe, in his own re-conceived will, entereth into himſelfe, and in himſelfe generateth the meekneſſe in his own re-conceived will.</p>
               <p n="56">56. And ſo the ſoule of Man is out of the ſame Balance in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the re-comprehended will, towards the light: and alſo in the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57651:163"/>
firſt will in it ſelfe, in its own Centre; where behinde it the Darkneſſe is comprehended, and before it, is the end of the Eternall Band: and in it ſelfe there would be nothing, but an anxious ſource [or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty]; and if any thing elſe were to be in it, then the firſt will (in the eternall Band) muſt conceive another will (in it ſelfe) to goe out of the dark ſource [or property] into a joyfull habitation without a ſource.</p>
               <p n="57">57. If now the firſt eternall will doe thus conceive another will, then it breaketh the ſource of Darkneſſe, and dwelleth (in it ſelfe) in the joyfull habitation, and the darkneſſe remaineth darkneſſe ſtill, and a ſource [or working property] in it ſelfe, but toucheth not the re-conceived will: for that dwelleth not in the Darkneſſe, but in it ſelfe: thus wee underſtand the ſoules own power [to be] which God breathed into <hi>Adam,</hi> out of the Gate the breaking through, in himſelfe, into the Light of the habitation of joy.</p>
               <p n="58">58. This ſoule (being cloathed with the pure Elementary and Paradiſicall Body) ſevered its will, [which came] out of the Fathers will (which tendeth onely to the conceiving of his <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>Sonne.</hi>
                  </note> vertue [or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er], from whence he is impregnated to beget his Heart) [and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it] from the Fathers will, and entred into the luſt of this world; where now (backward in the breaking [or deſtruction] of this world) there is no light; and forward there is no comprehenſibility of the Deity: and there was no Counſell [or remedy] except the pure will of the Father enter into it againe, and bring it into his own will a gaine, into its firſt ſeate, that ſo its will may be directed againe into the Heart and Light of God.</p>
               <p n="59">59. And now if it be to be helped againe, then the Heart of God with its Light, (and not the Father) muſt come into it; for it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Father however: yet turned away from the Entrance, (to the Birth of the Heart of God) backward into this world, where no Light is to be comprehended, either behinde or before it: for the ſubſtance of the body breaketh, and then the poore ſoule ſtandeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the dark Dungeon; and here the Love of God (towards the poore impriſoned ſoule) is [made] knowne; Conſider thy ſelfe here; O deare Minde.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Heere was no remedy now, neither in God, nor in any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; onely the meere Deity of the Heart of God muſt enter in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narium Sanctum</hi> [into the holy Ternary]; <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Barmhertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit</hi> [the Mercifulneſſe] which is from Eternity generated out of his Holineſſe, wherein the Eternall wiſdome (which [coming] out of the ſpeaking of the Word, through the Holy Ghoſt) ſtandeth as a virgin before the Deity: and is the Great Wonder, and a Spirit in the <hi>Barmhertzigkeit,</hi> [the Mercifulneſſe], and the Mercifulneſſe maketh the holy Ternary (the holy Earth) the Eſſences of the Father (in the

attracting to the Word) <hi>viz.</hi> the holy Conſtellations: as may be ſaid in a ſimilitude.</p>
               <p n="61">61. And as wee perceive that in this world there is Fire, Aire, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Earth, alſo the Sunne and the Starres, and therein conſiſt all the things of this world: ſo you may conceive by way of ſimilitude, that the Father is the Fire of the whole [holy] Conſtellations, and alſo in the [<note n="c" place="margin">One Eternall Element.</note> holy] Element: and that the Sonne, <hi>(viz.</hi> his Heart) is the Sunne, which ſetteth all the Conſtellations in a light pleaſant habitation: and that the Holy Ghoſt is the Aire of the Life, without which neither Sunne nor Conſtellation would ſubſiſt: and then that the concreted <hi>Spiritus Majoris Mundi</hi> [or Spirit of the great World] is the chaſt virgin before God; which Spirit of the great World, in this world giveth to all Creatures, Minde, ſenſe, and underſtanding (through the influence of the Starres); and ſo alſo [doth the chaſt virgin] in the Heaven.</p>
               <p n="62">62. The Earthly Earth, is like the holy-Ternary, wherein is the heavenly <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>Water-Spirit.</hi>
                  </note> Aquaſter <hi>(viz.</hi> in the heavenly Earth, which I call the [one Holy] Element) which is pure.

               <p n="63">63. For, the Deity is incomprehenſible, and inviſible, yet <note n="e" place="margin">Findable, or palpable.</note> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible; but the virgin is viſible like a pure Spirit: and the [one holy] Element is her body, which is called <hi>Ternarius ſanctus</hi> [the holy Ternary], the Holy Earth; and into this holy Ternary, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Deity is entred, that ſhee may be an Eternall Eſpouſall [or union]: ſo that (in a fimilitude) the Deity is in the pure Element, and the Element is the Deity; for God and <hi>Ternarius ſanctus</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one thing; not in Spirit, but in ſubſtance, as body, and ſoule.

Thus the Word in the holy Ternary let it ſelfe into the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and received to it a true ſoule out of the Eſſences of the ſoule of <hi>Mary</hi> (like all other Men) in the Time <hi>(viz.</hi> in the end of three Moneths); not out of the holy Ternary; but our ſoule: yet not our body, wherein the Kingdome of this world, and ſinne, did ſtick.</p>

He brought no ſoule out of the holy Ternary: the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly virgin was the ſoule in the holy Ternary; and that he brought with him for a Bride to our ſoule, as this whole Booke doth treate of it. For what would it help mee, if he had brought a ſtrange ſoule with him? Nothing at all. But that he hath brought my ſoule into the holy Ternary, I rejoyce at that: and thus I can ſay, that Chriſts ſoule is my Brother, and his body is the food of my ſoule; as he ſaith in the fixt Chapter of <hi>John; My fleſh is meate indeed, and my bloud is drink indeed.</hi>

               <p n="69">69. Yet Men cannot ſay, that <hi>Mary</hi> was borne out of a barren womb, although the body of <hi>Anna</hi> was unfruitfull, which was from the Counſell of God: (in that they were honeſt [vertuous] people fearing God) that their Tincture might not be defiled, becauſe they were to generate that which the Lord would highly bleſſe. God knew how to open it in due time, and that in old age, when the wanton luſt (of this world from the Elements) was extinguiſhed, as in <hi>Sarah A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> wife.</p>
               <p n="70">70. For if the ſoule ſtandeth in the feare of God, then the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture alſo (in which the ſoule ſpringeth up) is purer; although that be not free from the Originall [or inherited] ſinne. Thus <hi>Mary</hi> is indeed truly generated of <hi>Joachim:</hi> and Chriſt hath his naturall ſoule from the Tincture of <hi>Mary,</hi> yet but halfe: for the <hi>Limbus</hi> of God was the Man [or Maſculine ſeede], and therein was the chaſt virgin of

God in the holy Ternary, and in the holy Ternary, the Trinity, the whole fulneſſe of the Deity: and the Holy Ghoſt was the Work-Maſter.</p>
               <p n="71">71. Here wee cleerly finde what Chriſt ſaid to his Father concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us Men; <hi>Behold the Men were thine, and thou haſt given them to mee: and I will that they be with mee where I am, that they may ſee my Glory.</hi> When the Word (or Heart of God) went into the holy Ternary, there it was the Sonne of the Father, and alſo his ſervant, as <hi>Eſayah</hi> ſaith, and as it is in the <hi>Pſalmes:</hi> for he had [united or] eſpouſed himſelfe <note n="m" place="margin">In or into</note> to the Element, and had the forme of a ſervant; but the Word which went into the [pure] Element, was his Sonne: and thus he took our ſoule upon him, not onely as a Brother; for the <hi>Limbus</hi> of God (in the heavenly Tincture) was the Man, and that was our Lord: for the whole world ſtandeth in the Might thereof: and that Might ſhall ſweepe the threſhing floare of this world. And thus wee are his ſervants, and alſo his Brethren in reſpect of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but in reſpect of his Father wee are his ſervants; and before the Fall wee were the Fathers, alſo till his humanity [or becoming Man,] though in the Word of the Promiſe [it was], in which, the faithfull entred into God.</p>

                  </note> right in the earthly Body, and ſomewhat was permitted to him; and then he took the body, with the ſoule, and ſet them upon the Pinnacle of the Temple, and ſaid; Caſt thy ſelfe downe (for thou art powerfull and canſt doe all things) and then the People ſhall ſee that thou art God, and haſt overcome; this is the right fluttering Spirit, wherewith the Devill would faine alwayes flie above the Thrones over the Deity, and yet goeth but in himſelfe, into the Helliſh fire, and apprehendeth not the Deity.</p>
               <p n="94">94. And <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>herein.</hi>
                  </note> here alſo was <hi>Adam</hi> tempted, [to try] whether he would ſtedfaſtly put his Imagination into the Heart of God, and then he ſhould have continued in Paradiſe: but when he turned away his Minde from the Heart of God into the Spirit of this world, and would
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57651:168"/>
flie out beyond the humility, and would be like God; then he went forth beyond the Throne of God, in the Spirit of the fierceneſſe of the Anger. Therefore here the ſoule of Chriſt muſt be accuratly temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, [to try] whether it would (ſeeing it had retained the heavenly Bread), flie out alſo in Pride in the might of the fire; or whether it would in humility look onely upon the Heart of God, and <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſubmit to it.</hi>
                  </note> give it ſelfe up to that, that it might be carried onely in the will of God, and become an Angel in humility, and not relie onely upon it ſelfe, to flie in its own might [or power].</p>
               <p n="95">95. And here the Devils Maſter piece is ſeene, in that he <note n="n" place="margin">Alleadgeth Scripture.</note> uſeth the Scripture, and ſaith; <hi>The Angels will beare thee up;</hi> whereas here the matter was not about the body, but about the ſoule; which he would bring into Pride, that it might teare it ſelfe off from the love of God, and relie upon the Angels bearing it up; and that it ſhould break it ſelfe off againe from the new body (which can flie well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with that) and leap down in the old Body, and relie upon the Angels, and ſo ſhould flie out from God into the Spirit of this world againe.</p>
               <p n="96">96. But here his valour is ſeene: though he ſtood (with his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Body) upon the pinnacle of the Temple, yet he committed his Earthly Body to God, and truſted in him, and that he was every where in God: and ſaid to the Devill; <hi>It is written, thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> Here the Devils Pride (in the Kingdome of wrath) was rightly overcome: and the humility, the ſtrength, and the might remained to be our Chriſts: and the ſoule of Chriſt is entered into the holy Ternary, as into the humble Love, and eſpouſed it ſelfe with the humble chaſt virgin of the Divine Wiſdome.</p>
               <p n="97">97. Now when the Devill had loſt twice, then he came at laſt, with his laſt powerfull Temptation (as he did alſo to <hi>Adam) he would give him the whole world, if he would fall downe and worſhip him.</hi> The buſineſſe with <hi>Adam</hi> alſo was about this world, he would draw this world to him, and ſo be like God with it, that as God had drawne this world to him, to manifeſt his great Wonders therewith, ſo the ſoule in <hi>Adam</hi> thought [with it ſelfe] thou art the ſimilitude of God, thou wilt doe ſo too, and ſo thou ſhalt be like God: but thereby he went forth from God, into the Spirit of this world. Now therefore the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> muſt hold out the ſtanding of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> whereby it was tempted [or tried] whether the ſoule would continue in the new holy heavenly Man, and live in the <hi>Barmhertzigkeit</hi> [the <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </note> Merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe] of God, or in the Spirit of this world.</p>
               <p n="98">98. And thus ſtood the ſoule as a valiant Champion, and ſaid to Satan; Get thee hence Satan, thou ſhouldſt worſhip the Lord thy God, and ſerve him onely; I have no more to doe with thee: there the Devill, Hell, and the Kingdome of this world was commanded to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57651:168"/>
be gone, and the valiant Champion hath gotten the victory; and the Devill faine to get him gone: and the earthly [part] was overcome. And here now the Noble Champion ſtandeth upon the Moon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth all might, in Heaven, Hell, &amp; on Earth, into his power, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth (with his ſoule, in the holy Ternary, in this outward body) over Death and life: and here this world is become Chriſts owne, for he had overcome it, he could live in God, and needed not the earthly food nor drink.</p>
               <p n="99">99. And the Reader muſt know, that the Combat (with the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) was held in body and ſoule; and that this Temptation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth us alſo; he hath overcome for us: if wee put our whole truſt in him, then wee have victory in him, over ſinnes, Death, Hell, and the Devill, and alſo over this world: for he held the laſt victory in his Death, when he brake the ſword of the Cherubine, and deſtroyed the Hell of the Devill, and hath led captivity captive: that thereby thou mightſt live by the Death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="100">100. And wee ſee that all is true, as is above-mentioned; for when he had overcome in the Temptation, and had ſtood forty dayes, then he had wholly overcome till the laſt victory in Death: for ſo long <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was in the Temptation, in the Garden of <hi>Eden:</hi> and <note n="p" place="margin">Viz. <hi>after the Temptation.</hi>
                  </note> there he began his Prieſtly Kingdome (as a King over Heaven and this world) with ſignes and wonders: and in his firſt Miracle, turned water into good wine, he alſo healed the ſick, made the blinde to ſee, the lame to goe, and cleanſed the Lepers: alſo he raiſed the dead: and ſhewed himſelfe to be the true King over the <note n="q" place="margin">Over the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and the dead.</note> quick and dead; and ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Davids</hi> Throne of Promiſe, and was the true Prieſt in the Order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> All whatſoever <hi>Aaron</hi> was (in the Fathers might) in a Type, that this high Prieſt was in vertue [and power] with deeds and wonders: which wee will cleerly deſcribe in the other Book following this, if wee live, and God ſhall give us leave to doe it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IT is apparent how they have hitherto in <hi>Babell</hi> danced [or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended] about the Cup of Jeſus Chriſt, and about his holy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, for which they have cauſed many warres and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheddings, but what kinde of knowledge concerning thoſe [Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments] they in <hi>Babell</hi> have, appeareth by their works of Love, among one another; which their Councels have brought to paſſe, where Men have ſtopt the mouth of the Holy Ghoſt, and have made a worldly <note n="a" place="margin">Rule or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> Dominion out of the Prieſthood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. O you high Prieſts and <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scripture.</hi>
                  </note> Scribes, what anſwer will you make to Chriſt, when you ſhall be found thus [at his comming]? Or doe you ſuppoſe you ſtand in the dark? No, you ſtand in the preſence of the cleere countenance of Jeſus Chriſt, who is Judge of the quick and dead, doe but open your eyes, and rightly feed the flock of Jeſus Chriſt, he cometh and demandeth them of you. You are not all Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards or Paſtours, but intruded covetous Wolves; you relie on your Schoole-Art [or Univerſity Learning and Schollerſhip]: O that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayleth nothing in the preſence of God: the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh not from that, he will not be bound up; if you will be Paſtours, then you muſt hold out in the Temptation: and put on the Garment of the Lamb in your heart, you muſt not take the wooll of the ſheepe onely from them: but you muſt give them the food of the Holy Ghoſt in true Love, and be practiſers of it your ſelves; <note n="c" place="margin">Note this.</note> But how will you give it, if you be in the Wilderneſſe ſtill, and have choſen the Kingdome of this world to your ſelves in the Laſt Temptation. What ſhall be ſaid of you? Is not the Anger broke out and burning? carry fuell to it: for <hi>Babell</hi> is on fire, the <note n="d" place="margin">Humility and Love.</note> water is dried up: or what have I to doe with thee, that I muſt write thus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wee have ſhewed in few words the Incarnation and Birth of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, and yet wee are ſo very earthly, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend it: but are continually asking where is Chriſt with his body? where ſhall wee ſeek for him? and therefore our ſoule longeth to write of his Omni-preſence, and that notwithſtanding all the raging and fury of the Devill, and of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wee having cleerly deſcribed, how God, out of his love and mercifulneſſe, of Grace, hath turned his beloved heart to us againe, and how he hath opened the Gate to the Kingdome of Heaven for our ſoules; therefore now wee are further to conſider of the Body of Chriſt; for reaſon ſaith continually: the body of Chriſt is gone up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, he is farre from us, wee muſt erect a <note n="e" place="margin">Government, Diſcipline, or forme of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> Kingdome, that wee may ſerve him in his abſence, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did with the Calves; and ſo that Kingdome is rightly called <hi>Babell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Doeſt thou boaſt thy ſelfe to be a Chriſtian, why doeſt thou not
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57651:169"/>
then beleeve his Word? when he ſaid; <hi>He would be with us to the end of the world.</hi> and ſaid moreover, <hi>He would give us his body for meate, and his bloud for drinke: Alſo his body is meate indeed, and his bloud is drink indeed:</hi> What doe you underſtand by this, an abſent [Chriſt] O thou poore ſick <hi>Adam:</hi> Wherefore art thou gone againe out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe? Hath not Chriſt brought thee in againe, wherefore then didſt thou not ſtay there? Doeſt thou not ſee, that the Apoſtles of Chriſt and their Succeſſours (who dwelt in the Paradiſe of Chriſt with their ſoules) and did great Wonders? Wherefore art thou againe entered into the Spirit of this World? Doeſt thou ſuppoſe that thou ſhalt finde the Paradiſe with thy Reaſon in thy Art? Doeſt thou not think it hath another Principle; and that thou ſhalt not finde it, except thou beeſt borne anew?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thou ſayeſt, Chriſt is aſcended into Heaven, how then can he be in this world? and when thou reacheſt fartheſt, thou thinkeſt that he is preſent onely with his holy Spirit, here in his Teſtaments, and that the Teſtaments are onely <note n="f" place="margin">Symboles of his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſignes of his Merits. What ſayeſt thou then of thy New Man? When indeed the ſoule is fed with the Holy Ghoſt; What [food] hath thy new Man then? <note n="g" place="margin">The new Man feedeth upon the pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the outward Man eateth of the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> for each life feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon its Mother.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now if the Soule eateth of the cleere Deity, what [food] hath the body then? For thou knoweſt that the ſoule and the body are not one and the ſame thing: it is indeed a [very] <note n="h" place="margin">Corpus. <hi>And they differ, as body and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                  </note> body: but the ſoule is a Spirit, and muſt have ſpirituall food, and the body muſt have bodily food. Or wilt thou give the new Man earthly food? If thou meaneſt ſo, thou art yet farre from the Kingdome of God. The heavenly body of Chriſt did eate no earthly food, but the outward body onely did eate that? Is not Chriſts body now in the <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>The pure holy ſubſtantiality;</hi> viz. <hi>the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall world, the holy earth.</hi>
                  </note> holy Ternary, and eateth Paradiſicall food? Wherefore then ſhall not our new Man doe ſo? did he not eate heavenly food forty dayes in the Wilderneſſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes afterwards? and did he not tell his Diſciples at <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well; <hi>I have meate to eate that yee know not of:</hi> and further; <hi>It is my meate to doe the will of my Father which is in Heaven?</hi> Is the will of God his food, why then is it not ours, if we live in him? Hath not the Deity of Chriſt put on the Kingdome of Heaven for a Body? is not the pure Element (wherein the Deity dwelleth) his body?</p>
               <p n="8">8. But reaſon ſaith, the Body of Chriſt is but in one place, how can he then be every where? He is indeed a Creature and a Creature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in all places at once. Hearken beloved Reaſon, when the Word became Man in the body of <hi>Mary,</hi> was he not at that time alſo aloſt above the Starres? When he was at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> was he not then alſo at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and every where in all the Thrones [of Heaven]? Or doeſt thou ſuppoſe, when God became Man, that he was ſhut up and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the Humanity, and was not every where? Doeſt thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57651:170"/>
that the Deity (in Chriſts becoming Man) divided it ſelfe? O no: he never went from his place, that cannot be.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And now he is become Man, therefore his humanity is every where, whereſoever his Deity was; for thou canſt not ſay, that there is any place in Heaven or in this world, where God is not; now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Father is, there alſo is his heart in him, and there alſo is the Holy Ghoſt. Now his Heart is become Man, and in the Humanity of Chriſt; and therefore if you will think, that the body of Chriſt is far of in Heaven, yet you muſt alſo ſay, that the Heart of God is in him: and now (when you ſay that God the Father is here preſent) will you ſay, that the heart in him is not here preſent with him? Or wilt thou divide the Heart of God, and wilt onely make it, that there is but a ſpark of it in the body of Chriſt, and that the reſt of it is every where all over? What doe you doe? Deſiſt, and I will truly and exactly ſhew you the true Ground.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Behold God the Father is every where, and his <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>Sonne.</hi>
                  </note> Heart and Light is every where in the Father; for it is alwayes from Eternity begotten every where of the Father, and his birth hath neither begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor end, he is even at this very day continually generated of the Father; and then alſo when he was in the body of <hi>Mary,</hi> yet he ſtood then in the Fathers Birth, and was continually begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Holy Ghoſt proceeded continually from Eternity, from the Father through his <note n="l" place="margin">Sonne or word.</note> Heart: for the whole <note n="m" place="margin">Geniture or working.</note> Generation of the Deity is no otherwiſe, neither can it be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Now the Father is greater than all, and the Sonne in him is greater than all, and his <note n="n" place="margin">Barmhertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit. <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </note> Mercifulneſſe is alſo greater than all: and the [one pure] Element conſiſteth in his <note n="n" place="margin">Barmhertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit. <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </note> Mercifulneſſe, and is as great as God: onely, it is generated of God, and is ſubſtantiall, and it is under [or inferiour to] God, and ſo therein is the <hi>Ternarius ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> with the wiſdome of God in the Wonders; for all Wonders are manifeſted therein, and that is the heavenly body of Chriſt, with our (here aſſumed) ſoule in it, and the whole fulneſſe of the Deity is in the Centre therein; and thus the ſoule is environed with the Deity, and eateth of God, for it is Spirit; thus my beloved ſoule, if thou art rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in Chriſt, then thou putteſt on the body of Chriſt, [which is] out of the holy Element, and that giveth thy new body food &amp; drink: and the Spirit of this world in the 4 Elements giveth our old Earthly [Body, Earthly meate and drink that is Earthly and Elementary].</p>
               <p n="12">12. Thus underſtand and know this precious depth; as Chriſt-made a Covenant with us, in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> that he (as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) would thus become Man, ſo alſo after he had laid off that which was Earthly, he made a Covenant with us, and hath appointed his body for food, and his bloud for drink: and the Water of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Life (in the Originality of the Deity) for a holy Baptiſme,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57651:170"/>
and commanded, that wee ſhould uſe it till he cometh againe.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Now thou wilt ſay, what did Chriſt give to his Diſciples in his Laſt Supper, when he ſat with them at Table? Behold, the Deity is not comprehenſible [or circumſcriptive], and the holy Body of Chriſt is alſo not meaſurable (it is creaturely indeed, but not meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:) he gave them his holy heavenly Body, and his holy heavenly bloud, for food and for drink, as his own words import; doeſt thou ſay, how can that be? Then tell mee, how it can be that the holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement hath put on this world, and hath another Principle in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this world; that holy Element is the heavenly body of Chriſt. Thus he gave them outward bread and outward wine in the kingdome of this world, and therewith his holy heavenly body in the Second Principle; which comprizeth the outward, and likewiſe his heavenly bloud, wherein the heavenly Tincture, and the holy life conſiſteth.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now ſaith reaſon; That was another body, in another bloud, and not his own creaturely body; prethee reaſon tell me, how can it be another body, indeed it is in another Principle, but of no other Creature: Did not Chriſt ſay; <hi>I am not of this world;</hi> and yet he was really according to the outward man of this world: or doeſt thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it onely of his Deity? What becomes then of his eternall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, according to which he was a King of the promiſe upon the Throne of <hi>David?</hi> If the promiſe had been able to ranſome us; then the worke need not have followed: and <hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe had been able to have brought the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the true promiſed Land; which verily <hi>Joſhua</hi> (who was a type of this Chriſt) could not doe; but he brought them only into the Land of the Heathen, where there was continually warre and ſtrife; and was onely a valley of miſery.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But <note n="o" place="margin">Joſhua, and King.</note> this Chriſt fitteth upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> upon the Throne of the Promiſe: like as <hi>David</hi> was an outward King, and in his ſpirit a Prophet before God; and ſo ſat outwardly as a Champion in the world, and inwardly as a <note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>One Copie hath</hi> Prophet.</note> Prieſt before God; who propheſied of this Chriſt that he ſhould come; and commanded all doores to be ſet open; and all Gates to be lift up on high, that this King of glory might enter in. Thus he ſpeaketh not onely of his Deity, from which he propheſied (for that was however with him, and in the Power and knowledge of the ſame he ſpake) but he propheſied of his Eternall humanity; for that was not a King, who onely ſat there in the Spirit; wee could neither ſee him, nor converſe with him; but that is a King who ſitteth in the humanity.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Now this King was promiſed of God; that he ſhould poſſeſſe the Gates of his Enemies; and ſhould lead his enemies captive; and the Devils are theſe enemies Now how doeſt thou conceive; that when this Creature bound the Devils at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and as a confined creature that did reach no further, did lead them captive; who then
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57651:171"/>
did binde them at <hi>Rome?</hi> thou ſayſt; his Deity; O no! that was not its office; the Devils are however in the Fathers moſt internall roote; in his Anger; A Creature muſt onely do it, who was ſo great as could be every where with the Devils.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Therefore muſt Chriſt in his Temptation overcome the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Anger, and this externe birth; and by his Entrance into death, he brake the head of the Serpent: <hi>viz.</hi> the Devill and all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; and tooke them captive. Thou muſt underſtand it thus; That the inward Element (which comprizeth the whole body of this world) became Chriſts Eternall body; for the whole Deity in the Word and Heart of God, entred thereinto; and <note n="q" place="margin">Uniteth or contracteth.</note> eſpouſed it ſelfe to remaine therein to all Eternity; and this ſame Deity became a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even ſuch a creature, as can be every where, as the Deity it ſelfe; and this ſame creature hath captivated all Devils in the Kingdome of this world; And all men who with their minde draw neere to this Chriſt, and deſire him in right Earneſt, they are drawne by the Spirit of the Father, <hi>(viz.</hi> of the cleare and pure Deity) into the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt; that is, into the Pure Element <note n="*" place="margin">Wherein the preſence of the Trinity is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</note> before the Trinity. And if they continue ſtedfaſt, and do not againe depart from God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Deſire of the Devill; then the precious Pearle, <hi>viz.</hi> the light of God is ſowne in their ſoule, which [light] attracteth to it ſelfe the precious body of Jeſus Chriſt, with Paradiſe, and the Kingdome of Heaven; And thus the right new Man <hi>(Chriſtus)</hi> groweth on the ſoul in the heavenly Virgin of Gods Wiſdome; in the holy Ternary; in the Kingdome of Heaven. And thus ſuch a man is according to the new Man in Heaven in the body of Jeſus Chriſt; and as to the old earthly Man, which hangeth unto the holy [Man] he is in this world in the houſe of ſin, and the Deity acteth the new humanity, and the Spirit of this world the old, untill he puts him off in death; for he is a man in Heaven; borne in the <note n="r" place="margin">Barmhertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit, <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Limbus</hi> of God; So that all Angels, in every Throne, did give their will unto the Angelicall Throne or Arch Angel; as it is ſufficiently to be knowne by the fall of Lucifer; and alſo may be diſcerned in the Regions of the Kingly Governments of this world; if the Devill did not ſo deſtroy the right <note n="u" place="margin">Agreement, or compact.</note> union; as is very clearely to be ſeen. Thus likewiſe (underſtand us I prethee thou very precious and noble minde) this ſecond ſurpaſſing,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57651:171"/>
excellent Creation is in the Fiat; When God ſaw and took notice of our miſerable Fall; he did illuſtrate [or manifeſt] himſelfe by the holy Eternall Virgin of his Wiſdome in the Eternall Wonders; in <note n="x" place="margin">Barmhertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit.</note> mercy which alwayes floweth out of his heart; and did comprehend with his ſpeculation [or manifeſtation] the Throne; and did further illuſtrate himſelfe in the Throne into many millions without number; and eſtabliſhed his Covenant with his Oath therein; with his precious Promiſe of the Womans Seed.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Thus my very precious minde, apprehend it aright; This ſame Throne was made in Time (when as the Time of his Covenant was revealed) an Angelicall Principality in the mercy of God; in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pure Element, in the Sacred Ternary, that is, in the holy Earth, wherein the Deity is ſubſtantially knowne; ſo that the whole Mercy of God (which is unmeaſurable, and every where in the Sacred Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; which is likewiſe ſo great in the holy Element, that comprizeth Heaven and this world) became a Man; that is, a ſubſtantiall Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Spirit of the Trinity, in which (likeneſſe) the Trinity dwelleth with compleat fulneſſe; and in this great Angelicall Throne and Principality ſtood in the beginning and from Eternity the Aſpect in the infinite multiplicity proceeding from all the Eſſences in the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the Father; and became truely illuſtrate [or manifeſt] in the Time of the Promiſe.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Thus now even unto this very day all things are yet in the Fiat (or creating), and the Creation hath no end untill the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, where that which hath growne on the holy Tree, ſhall be ſeparated from the unholy Thiſtles and Thornes; and wee men are theſe innumerable aſpects (or idea's) in the Fiat of the great Princely Throne, and we, who are holy; ſhall be created in the body of this Prince in God; but we that degenerate (or periſh) ſhall be caſt out as naughty <note n="y" place="margin">Fruit.</note> apples unto the ſwine of the Devill.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Thus we were foreſeen [or elected] in Chriſt Jeſus before the foundations of the world were laid; that we ſhould be his Angels and Servants in his high Princely Throne, in the body of his Element, in which his Spirit; <hi>viz.</hi> the holy Trinity will dwell.</p>
               <p n="22">22. This I would clearly demonſtrate unto thee <note n="z" place="margin">Or, <hi>upon it; as by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi>
                  </note> in the Kingdome of this world, yea in all things; thou ſhalt not be able to name any thing out of which I will not demonſtrate it unto thee, if God gave us leave; but ſeeing it will here take up too much roome, I will write a booke by it ſelfe of it; if the Lord permit.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Therefore my beloved ſoule, be lively, and ſee what thy noble Bridegroom hath left thee in his Teſtaments for a Legacy; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Baptiſme, the water of his Covenant, flowing from his holy Originall body, whereas we in this world; <hi>viz.</hi> in the externe birth of his body, do acknowledge foure things; namely, fire, aire, water, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57651:172"/>
earth; wherein our earthly body conſiſteth. So likewiſe in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly body there are foure ſuch things: The fire is the enkindling of the divine deſire, The water is that which the fire deſireth, whence it becomes meeke, and a light; The aire is the joyfull ſpirit which bloweth up the fire; and maketh in the water the motion; And the earth is the true Eſſence which is borne in the Three (Elements) and is rightly called <hi>Ternarius Sanctus</hi> [the Sacred Ternary] in which the Tincture is brought forth in the light of the meekneſſe; and therein alſo is borne the holy bloud out of the water; being an oyle of the water, in which the light ſhineth, and the ſpirit of life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Underſtand it thus, that water, is the water of the Eternall Life in the <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſeede.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Limbus</hi> of God in the Holy Ternary: and that is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which baptizeth the ſoule, when wee keepe the <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </note> uſe of his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the ſoule in his Covenant is dipped and waſhed in that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it is rightly the Bath [or Laver] of Regeneration; for by its dipping in the Holy Water, it is received and quickned by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Water, and cometh (in the Covenant of Chriſt) into the ſoule of Chriſt: indeed not fully into his ſoule, but into his body, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Brother of the ſoule of Chriſt; for Chriſts ſoule is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (as our ſoules are,) and is in the body of the Mercifulneſſe in the Trinity, being ſurrounded therewith, and hath the ſame in it for food and ſtrength [or refreſhment]. So alſo our ſoules in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, if they be faithfull, and continue in God, they are the brethren of Chriſts ſoule.</p>
               <p n="25">25. For Chriſt hath taken this Pledge <hi>(viz.</hi> our ſoule) from us Men, in <hi>Mary:</hi> at which wee rejoyce in Eternity, that the ſoule of Chriſt is our Brother, and the Body of Chriſt, our Body, in the New Man. And ſhould I not rejoyce that my ſoule is in the body of Chriſt, and that the ſoule of Chriſt is my brother, and that the Holy Trinity is the foode and vertue [or ſtrength] of my ſoule? Who can judge mee, lay hold of mee, and <note n="c" place="margin">Spoyle or hurt mee.</note> deſtroy mee, when I am (in my true Man) in God? When as I am Immortall in my new Man; wherefore ſhould I be much afraid in the Earthly Man, which belongeth to the Earth? Let every thing take its own, and then my ſoule will be <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>rid of the Driver.</hi>
                  </note> freed from the <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>from corruption.</hi>
                  </note> Driver.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Or, what ſhall I ſay? Muſt I not in this Body (which I here in the Earthlineſſe carry about mee) through the New Man, reveale the Wonders of God, that ſo his Wonders might be manifeſted? I ſpeake not onely concerning my ſelfe, but concerning all Men, good and bad: every one muſt manifeſt the Great Wonders (wherein he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) in <note n="f" place="margin">Gods.</note> his Kingdome, whether it be in Love or Anger, (after the breaking [or diſſolution] of this world) it muſt all ſtand in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: For at preſent this world ſtandeth in the Creating, and in the <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſeed time</hi>

which he afterwards confirmed with his Death, and wee muſt doe it alſo, and not leave it undone: it is not in the <note n="u" place="margin">Arbitrium, <hi>or free-will.</hi>

               <p n="31">31. For the Teſtatour ſtandeth in the Covenant, and ſaith, <hi>Come,</hi> and whoſoever doth not deſire to <hi>Come,</hi> goeth not in to him.

               <p n="32">32.

                  </note> into the Covenant? Thy Faith is its Faith, and thy confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God in the Covenant, is its confidence. It is indeed thy <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>Children are thy Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>

For the Deity ſtandeth in the Centre of the Light of Life: and ſo now if the Tree ſtand in the Covenant, then the Branch may well doe ſo.</p>
               <p n="33">33. But thou muſt not omit Baptiſme for all that: for when the childe is borne into the world, then it is ſevered from its Tree, and is in this world, and then it ſelfe muſt paſſe into the Covenant: and thou muſt with thy Faith preſent it: and with thy Prayer give it to God. in his Covenant; there needeth no <note n="b" place="margin">Bravery, ſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="36">36. But this I ſay, according to my knowledge, (and not out of any command) that if the Parents be wicked, and indeed in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Devill, and that they have thus begotten their fruit out of their falſe [or evill] Eſſences (in which [Patents] there is no Faith, but onely a falſe hypocriſie, and yet will <note n="e" place="margin">Mock Chriſt, and yet be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> in an Apiſh mockery be counted Chriſtians; and as the Devill oftentimes changeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the likeneſſe of an Angel, ſo they alſo ſend their children with the like trimmed falſe Angels before the Covenant of Chriſt) ſuch doings is very dangerous, which alſo inſtantly ſheweth it ſelfe (in the growing of the Tree), indeed the Covenant continueth ſtill, but there muſt be earneſtneſſe in avoyding of the Devill: It may be that very many are Baptized in the Anger of God; becauſe they doe but contemne the Covenant, and many times wicked drunken Prieſts uſe it, who even ſtick in Hell fire over head and eares, and therefore the Covenant of Grace ſtandeth as a Teſtimony againſt the <note n="f" place="margin">The heape or multitude.</note> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the wicked. And that which they ſee and know (and doe not performe it with earneſt ſincerity) that ſhall judge and condemne them.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Now ſaith Reaſon, how is the Baptiſme then? I perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but water, and words? I anſwer: Hearken beloved Reaſon, thy outward body is in this world onely; and therefore outward water is requiſite. But as the hidden Man Chriſt, with his pure Element, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Out-Birth of this world <hi>(viz.</hi> the foure Elements, wherein our body confiſteth) and as all is his; ſo he holdeth alſo the outward wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and baptizeth with the Inward water of his Element, with the water of the Eternall Life, [coming] out of his holy Body. For the Holy Ghoſt in the Covenant baptizeth with the Inward water, and the Miniſter baptizeth with the outward; the outward [Man] receiveth the Earthly Elementary water, and the ſoule [receiveth] the water of the waſhing in the Regeneration.</p>
               <p n="38">38. The ſoule is waſhed in the Holy water, and the Word is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it, and the ſoule ſtandeth in the Covenant. And now it may reach after the Pearle, although the ſoule be tied backward in the Kingdome of this world, yet it ſtandeth in the Covenant for all that.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57651:174"/>
And if, in the unfeigned Faith of the Parents, of the Prieſt, and of the ſtanders by, it be thus waſhed in the Liver of Regeneration, and ſo paſſe into the Covenant, then the Devill may not touch it, till [the time] that it <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth.</hi>
                  </note> underſtandeth what evill, and good is, and entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of them, in a free will.</p>
               <p n="39">39. And now if it enter into the <note n="h" place="margin">Wickedneſſe, or malice.</note> Evill of this world, and ſuffer it ſelfe to be drawne by the Devill then it goeth away out of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and forſaketh God and the Kingdome of Heaven; and there then the Noble virgin of God, ſtandeth in the Centre of the Light of Life (which inſtantly in the entring of the Light of Life, yeelded her ſelfe into the Centre of the Light of Life, as a Conductour and loving Companion to the ſoule) and warneth the ſoule of the ungodly wayes, that it ſhould turne, and ſtep into the Covenant againe. But if it doe not, and that it continue in the Kingdome of the Devill, then ſhee continueth ſtanding in the Centre of the Holy Paradiſe: and ſhee is a Virgin of her ſelfe, but the ſoule hath afflicted her, and ſo they are parted: except the ſoule returne againe, and then it will be received againe by its virgin, with great honour and joy.</p>
               <p n="40">40. And therefore it is that Chriſt made two Teſtaments, the one in the Water of the Eternall Life, and the other in his Body and Bloud; that (whenſoever the poore ſoule ſhould be defiled againe by the Devill) it might yet in the other, enter into the Body of Chriſt againe; and if it turne with ſorrow for its finnes, and putteth its truſt in the mercy of God againe, then it ſteppeth againe into the firſt Covenant, and then it may come to the other Teſtament, and draw neere to God, and then it will be received againe with joy; as Chriſt ſaith; <hi>That there is more joy in Heaven (for one poore ſinner that repenteth,) than for ninety and nine righteous that need no Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="41">41. Then ſaith Reaſon: I can ſee nothing but Bread and Wine; and Chriſt alſo gave his Diſciples but Bread and Wine. I anſwer: As the Baptiſme outwardly is outward water, and the Inward is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Eternall Life, and the Holy Trinity Baptizeth; as may be ſeene in <hi>Jordan,</hi> that three Perſons appeared; the Sonne of God, in the water; the Father, in the voice of the words; and the Holy Ghoſt over the water, moving upon the Head of Chriſt; and ſo all Three Perſons in the Deity Baptized this Man Chriſt; And thus it is alſo in the Supper.</p>
               <p n="42">42. The outward is [Earthly] Bread and Wine, as thy outward Man alſo is Earthly; and the Inward (in his Teſtament, is his Body and Bloud, and that thy Inward Man receiveth: underſtand it right: the ſoule receiveth the Deity, for <note n="i" place="margin">The ſoule.</note> it is Spirit: and thy [Inward] New Man receiveth Chriſts reall Body and Bloud; not like a thought in the Faith, although Faith muſt be, but in ſubſtance; incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible to the outward Man.</p>
               <p n="43">
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:57651:174"/>
43. Not that the Holy is changed into the Outward, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay (of the Bread which thou eateſt with the outward Mouth, and alſo the Wine) that the outward, is the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt: no but it is the <note n="k" place="margin">Caſe, ſhell, or Cabinet.</note> Chiſt, and yet it cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or incloſed by the <note n="k" place="margin">Caſe, ſhell, or Cabinet.</note> Chiſt, as this world cannot comprehend the Body of Chriſt in the holy Element, or as our outward Body cannot comprehend the inward new [Body] of the ſoule. Alſo the firſt Supper of Chriſt, teacheth you this, when Chriſt ſate with them at Table, and gave them his holy hidden body and bloud to eate and drink (after <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>in his own way.</hi>
                  </note> a peculiar manner) under Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p n="44">44. For thou canſt not ſay (when thou doeſt handle the bleſſed Bread) here I hold the body of Chriſt in my hand, I can feele and taſte it: no my friend: the outward is earthly Bread, from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Element: and the Incomprehenſible in the holy Element, is the Body of Chriſt, which (in this his Covenant and Teſtament) is offered to thee under the outward Bread, and that [Body] thy new Man receiveth: and the Old [Man receiveth] the Bread; and ſo it is with the Wine.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Make mee no abſence of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, the ſoule needeth not run farre for it: and beſides, the body of Chriſt in his bloud (in this Teſtament) is not the food of the ſoule; but the meere Deity is the food of the ſoule: and the Body of Chriſt, is the food of the New Man, which the ſoule hath put on from the Body of Jeſus Chriſt: the body and the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt feedeth the new Man: and if the new Man abideth faithfull in the body of Jeſus Chriſt, then the Noble Pearle of the <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>Divine Light.</hi>
                  </note> Light of God, is given to him, ſo that he can ſee the Noble Virgin of the Wiſdome of God: and that Virgin taketh the Pearle into her boſom, and goeth continually with the ſoule into the new Body, and warneth the ſoule of the falſe [or evill] way. But what manner of Pearle this is, I would that all men might know it. But how much it is knowne, is plaine before our eyes: It is brighter than the ſplendour of the Sunne, and of more worth than the whole world, but how cleare ſoever it is, yet it is alſo ſecret.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Now then Reaſon asketh, What doth the wicked receive which is unregenerated? I anſwer: Hearken my beloved Reaſon, what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; becauſe he diſtinguiſheth not the body of Chriſt, therefore he receiveth it to his own Judgement: As the Prophet ſaith; <hi>They draw neere to mee with their libs, but then hearts are farre from mee;</hi> and as is before-mentioned, whoſoever goeth away from God, entreth into his wrath.</p>
               <p n="47">47. How wilt thou receive the holy Body in the Love, if thou art a Devill? Hath not the Devill alſo been an Angel, wherefore went he away from God? if thy old Man ([captivated] in the wrath) be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on thy ſoule, and no new [Man,] then thy ſoule receiveth the wrath
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57651:175"/>

               <p n="48">48. I ſay not that thou receiveſt the wrath of God in the Bread and in the Wine, but in thy falſe confidence: thou art with thy body and ſoule in the anger, and wilt not goe out from it: wherefore then doeſt thou approach often to the Covenant of God, ſeeing thou art capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated of the Devill? Doeſt thou thinke that <note n="o" place="margin">God.</note> he will adorne thy hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and will hang his Pearle on thee? Thou art a Wolfe, and how leſt with the Dogs: thy mouth prayeth, and thy ſoule is <note n="p" place="margin">Ein ſchalck.</note> abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably wicked [and naught], when it goeth from the Teſtament of Chriſt, it entreth into the ſtall of Robbery againe, and is a Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: it howleth with the Dogs: it is a perfidious whore: when it goeth away from the Covenant, it ſteppeth into whoriſh corners, into the denne of Theeves: and there they ſtand, and pretend Great Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: O, this day is a holy Day to mee, I muſt not ſinne? and yet they think, to morrow, or next day, they will goe thither againe.</p>
               <p n="49">49. O thou Knave, if thou bringeſt not another Man than ſo, to it, ſtay away from the Teſtament of Chriſt: thou art but a Murtherer, and doeſt ſcandalize thy neighbour, ſo long as thou art in ſuch a way; thy Prayer is falſe, it commeth not from the bottom of the Heart: thy Heart deſireth onely the pleaſure of this world, and the <note n="q" place="margin">Hunter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, or the Devill.</note> Driver receiveth thy Prayer, he is thy God: therefore conſider what thou doeſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. MY beloved Reader, wee tell thee this, that all things from the Originall of the Eſſence of all Eſſences (every thing from its
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57651:175"/>
Originality) hath its driving [or impulſion] in its own forme: and it alwayes maketh that very thing, with which the Spirit is impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the body muſt alwayes labour in that wherein the Spirit is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. When I conſider and think, why I write thus [many wonders]: and leave them not for other ſharper wits; I finde that my Spirit is kindled in this matter, whereof I write: for there is a living running fire of theſe things in my Spirit; and thereupon (let mee purpoſe what I will) yet this thing continually moveth and ſwimmeth on the top, and ſo I am captivated therewith in my Spirit: and it is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee as a work which I muſt exerciſe. Therefore ſeeing it is my work that my Spirit driveth, I will write it downe for a Memoriall, in ſuch a manner, as I know it in my Spirit, and <note n="a" place="margin">The way how I attained to it.</note> in ſuch a manner as I attained to it, and I will ſet downe no <note n="b" place="margin">Other thing than my ſelfe have tryed.</note> ſtrange thing, which my ſelfe have not tried [and knowne], that I be not found <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>to write lyes of my ſelfe.</hi>
                  </note> a liar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my ſelfe before God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now then if there be any that have a deſire to follow mee, and would faine have this knowledge, whereof I write, I adviſe him that he follow mee in this following Table [Patterne or way] (not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with the Penne, but with the Labour of the Minde,) and then he ſhall finde, how I could come to write thus; whereas I was not taught from the Schooles of this world, but onely a little of this mean hand-writing, as may be ſeene here.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But now ſeeing I have in hand the Articles of Repentance, therefore I certifie the Reader, that in my Earneſtneſſe, this Pen was given mee, which the Hunter would have broken: with whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan an earneſt ſtorme, in ſo much that he had caſt mee downe to the ground under his feete: but the breath of God helped mee up, ſo that I ſtand up, and have the firſt Pen in my minde ſtill, wherewith I will write further, though the Devill for malice ſhould ſtorme Hell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore now if wee will ſpeake of this moſt ſerious Article, wee muſt goe from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jeruho,</hi> and ſee how wee lie among Murtherers, who have ſo wounded us, and beaten us, that wee are halfe dead, and wee muſt looke about us for the <hi>Samaritan</hi> with his Beaſt, that he may dreſſe our wounds, and bring us into his Inne. O how lamentable and miſerable it is, that wee are ſo beaten by the murtherer (the Devill) that wee are halfe de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, and yet feele our ſmart no more. O if the Phyſician would come, and dreſſe our wounds, that our ſoule might revive and live, how ſhould wee rejoyce: thus ſpeaketh the deſire, and hath ſuch longing hearty w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhes; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Phyſician is preſent, yet the minde can no where appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, becauſe it is ſo very much wounded, and lieth halfe dead.</p>
               <p n="5">5. My deare Minde, thou ſuppoſeſt thou art very ſound but thou art ſo beaten, that thou feeleſt thy diſeaſe no more; art thou not very neere unto Death, how then canſt thou account thy ſelfe to be ſound?
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57651:176"/>
O my deare Soule, boaſt not of thy ſoundneſſe, thou lieſt fettered in heavy Bonds, yea in a very dark Dungeon: thou ſwimmeſt in a deepe water, which riſeth up to thy very lips, and thou muſt continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Death; Beſides, the <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>Corrupt Nature.</hi>
                  </note> Hunter is behinde thee with a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thy worſt Enemies, whereby he draweth thee continually downe by his chaines into the horrible Deepe, into the Abyſſe of Hell, and his crew thruſt thee on behinde thee, and run upon thee on all ſides, yelling and hunting, as if they had the Hinde they hunt after.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then ſaith Reaſon, wherefore doe they ſo? O my deare Soule, they have great cauſe for it: behold, thou haſt been their Hinde, and thou art broken out of their <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>Park.</hi>
                  </note> Garden, beſides thou art ſo ſtrong, that thou haſt broken downe the Hedge of their Garden, and haſt taken poſſeſſion of their dwelling: beſides, thou haſt made their meate as bitter as Gall, that they cannot eate it: thou haſt broken their Throne with thy Hornes, and haſt brought a ſtrong <note n="f" place="margin">Company, or Army.</note> hoaſt into their Garden, and thou haſt uſed a ſtrange power, to drive them out of their Garden; and though they have thee in their Fetters, yet thou oppoſeſt them as if thou wouldeſt deſtroy their kingdome: thou breakeſt their coards in pieces, and breakeſt their Bands, and thou art a continuall ſtormer of their Kingdome, thou art their worſt Enemy, and they thine; and if thou wert but gone out of their Garden, they would be contented, but thou being in it ſtill, the ſtrife continueth, and hath no end, till the Ancient [of dayes] cometh, who will part you aſunder.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Or doeſt thou ſuppoſe, that wee are madde that wee write thus? if wee did not ſee and know it, wee ſhould then be ſilent. Or canſt thou not once know the thorny Bath, wherein thou ſwimmeſt? Doeſt thou ſtill ſay, thou art in the Garden of Roſes? If thou thinkeſt thou art there, ſee well whether thou art not in the Devils Paſture, and art his moſt beloved Hinde, which he fatneth to the ſlaughter, for his food.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I tell thee for certain, and it is in earneſt; when I was at <note n="g" place="margin">In, or of the world.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> there my beloved companion opened my eyes for mee, that I ſaw: and behold, a great Generation of Men and multitudes of People and Nations were together, one part were like Beaſts, and one part like Men, and there was ſtrife between them: and beneath there was the Abyſſe of Hell, and the Beaſts ſaw not that, but the Men were afraid and would be gone: to which the Devill would not conſent, becauſe his Garden had no doores [open]: but they <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſtroyed.</hi>
                  </note> brake open his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: and ſo he muſt watch at the Doore that they doe not run away from him; but the Beaſts, (which were Men alſo) they did eare of his food, and drank of his drink, and he did nothing to them, becauſe he fatned them for his ſlaughter, and there was a continuall Emnity between the right Men, and the Beaſtiall Men.</p>

                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:57651:176"/>
9. Or doeſt thou ſuppoſe this is not true; which my beloved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion hath ſhewed mee; when he opened my eyes, that I ſaw? then come, and goe with mee to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wee will goe together along the way to <hi>Jericho,</hi> and ſee it well enough; and by the way is this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, wherein the Devill, with this great Generation, dwelleth: wee will ſhew thee great Wonders, thou ſhalt ſee and know all that which wee mentioned above, if thou art but a Man, and not the Devils fatted Beaſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Behold, wee underſtand by <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Paradiſe; and by the way to <hi>Jericho,</hi> the going forth out of Paradiſe into this world, where then the world captivated us in her Garden, where continually the great Sea of miſery is, wherein our ſoule ſwimmeth: Alſo the Devill is therein, who hath bound us with the chaines of the Anger of God, and he leadeth the poore ſoule captive, (in the dark Garden of fleſh and bloud,) into his fierce Garden of Anger; where the new-borne ſoules continually break out of his Garden, and break his Helliſh king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in pieces: alſo they have taken poſſeſſion of his <note n="i" place="margin">Regall or Kingly.</note> Royall Throne, where he was an Angel, and with their Hornes (which are the Spirit of God) have broken in pieces his helliſh Kingdome which he ſet up; alſo they oppoſe him with their ſtorme out of Hell into Heaven, and aſſault his Kingdome: but he holdeth the poore ſoule captive with the chaines of the Anger, in this evill fleſh and bloud: and continually ſetteth on the crew of the wicked, that they ſeduce it, and <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>Dip it.</hi>
                  </note> baptize it in the Anger of God up to the very lips; and there the poore ſoule ſtandeth up to the neck, in the Sea of miſery, ready to be drowned: and there the Devill thruſteth it downe with the vices and ſinnes of the body, and would drowne the poore ſoule in the Anger of God in the Abyſſe of Hell.</p>
               <p n="11">11. All malicious captived Men (whom he hath captivated) are his hounds, which hunt the poore ſoule, with haughtineſſe, bravery, covetouſneſſe, unchaſtity, anger, curſing, and wrongfull oppreſſion, ſo that the poore ſoule is infected with theſe things, and is very often ſet upon the Devils Horſe, as one of the [Devils] Captives, and then the Devill will ride with it into Hell into the Anger of God. O how often doth he rob the poore ſoule of her faire Garment (of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God) how doth he rend away the Word of God from their eares and hearts, as Chriſt ſaith cleerely! Now if it will not doe as he will, and that it break out of his Garden; then he caſteth his durt and filth upon it: and then he ſtirreth up all his Bloud-hounds, they muſt bawle at it, and caſt meere diſgrace upon it; and then it ſtandeth as an Owle among the Birds, who one and other will have a fling and a pluck at it: and ſo it is alſo with the poore ſoule, which ſteppeth through earneſt Repentaoce (out of the Devils net,) into the New Regeneration.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:57651:177"/>
12. On the contrary, thoſe others (who feed upon the weeds of the Devill, in vices and ſinnes) are in peace; for he faſtneth them in the Anger of God; and they are his Bloud hounds wherewith he hunteth the Hinde, the poore ſoule, which would eſcape and ſtorme his Helliſh Kingdome. The Devill would be well contented, though ſome ſoules ſhould eſcape (though he had rather increaſe than weaken his Kingdome) but that his Kingdome would be broken by it, which he cannot like.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For as he goeth a hunting in his Kingdome, and catcheth the poore ſoules which way ſoever he can, and layeth waite for them by his ſervants, with all manner of vice and wickedneſſe, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſetteth ſuch looking glaſſes before the ſoule, that it ſhould behold it ſelfe, in its own wickedneſſe: and tickleth it alſo with faire promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of greac honour, power, and Authority, he ſetteth the poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed ſort before the ſoule, and ſaith; Wilt thou onely be the foole of the world, come along with mee, I will give thee the Kingdome of this world for a poſſeſſion, as he ſaid to Chriſt; ſo in like manner, when the ſoule hath put on the Kingdome of Heaven and yet ſticketh in the dark valley in fleſh and bloud, and ſeeth the Devils <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring.</hi>
                  </note> murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its brethren and ſiſters, then it cometh to be armed of God to fight againſt the Devill, and to diſcover his <note n="m" place="margin">Trap, ſnare, or pit-fall.</note> burrow: for the love to its neighbour conſtraineth it to doe ſo, becauſe it would help to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Kingdome of Heaven: therefore it teacheth and reproveth thus, it warneth againſt ſinne, and teacheth the way to the Kingdome of Heaven; which indeed the Beaſtiall Body doth not underſtand, it goeth away, like the rude Aſſe: and thinketh with the Starry and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Minde, as followeth.</p>
               <p n="14">14. O! what miſchiefe I doe to my ſelfe, in making my ſelfe the foole of the world: what doe I get by it, but ſcorne and diſgace; I am not ſure of my life thereby I bereave me and mine of our daily bread and livelihood, and muſt alwayes be expecting of death, and ſwelter in the ſoorne of People. O! how ſuddenly thou committeſt a fault, and then thou art perſecuted, and art throwne away like a rotten ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and what reward have thoſe thou leaveſt behinde thee, but to ſuffer [the more] for thy ſake.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Thus Man in fleſh and bloud, Judgeth: and when the Devill underſtandeth it; how ſoone is he there watching as a Cat watcheth for a Mouſe, ſaying; O! who can tell, whether that be true or no, which thou teacheſt: thou haſt not ſeene it: neither hath any come from the dead, and told it thee, there are many dead, that have taught juſt as thou doeſt: and yet doth not the world ſtand in its old <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>Order.</hi>
                  </note> courſe, at one time as at another? They were counted fooles, and ſo art thou, and after thee agame things will be ſtill as they were before: to what purpoſe then is thy care and paines.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:57651:177"/>
16. At length <note n="o" place="margin">The Devill.</note> he cometh with a ſuttle ſnare, and ſaith, through the Spirit of the great world in the Minde, in himſelfe; O! The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens have cauſed thee to be borne to it, that thou doeſt ſuch fooliſh tricks, and would play jugling feats in thee, thy gifts are not from God; God hath never ſpoken with thee? and what canſt thou know then? Leave off, let it alone, thou mayeſt be a Chriſtian well enough, and be quiet: let the Prieſts teach, they have their <note n="p" place="margin">Livings, Pay, or Hire for it.</note> wages for it; what haſt thou to doe with it? Beloved Reader, with theſe blowes this Penne was once throwne to the Ground: and the Driver would have broken it: but the Breath of God took it up againe; therefore it ſhall write, what happened to it; to be an Example for all well-willers: and it is an exceeding precious one.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Now when the Devill had thus throwne it downe, then it was ſilent: and deſired not onely to write no more, but the Devill ruſhed in upon it, and beate it along, and would have broken it. He came forth with his ſowre Apples, and held them before the ſoule of this Penne, and would have it eate of his dainties: alſo he ſtrewed Sugar upon them [as he did for <hi>Eve]:</hi> If he had gotten the ſoule againe into his chaines, how would he have been revenged on it; as was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards knowne in the Storme where his minde was knowne very well. Now when it was thus, the Lilly faded and loſt its fragrant ſmell, the Pearle did hide it ſelfe, and the Virgin of the Pearle ſtood mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Noble Minde ſunke downe in great unquietneſſe.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Indeed the Driver ſaid at the beginning, that it ſhould have reſt with being quiet: but it was a reſt onely to fleſh and bloud, and yet it was no quietneſſe neither, but a furtherance to the Hunting. But when the Minde found it ſelfe in great unquietneſſe of ſoule, it recollected the ſoule, and ſought the Pearle which the ſoule had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſuppoſed that it lay as a Treaſure in the <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>Cabinet.</hi>
                  </note> caſe of the ſoule, but it was gone: and then the Minde ſought that [Pearle] in body and ſoule, and behold it was not there, it could not be found: and there was nothing to be ſeene but the Devils ſowre Apples, which were ſtrowed before the ſoule, that it ſhould feed on them. But the ſoule ſtood in great perplexity, and would not eate of its evill fruit, it called its virgin, but ſhee ſate as if ſhee were a ſleepe.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Thus the ſoule ſtood with great longing and defire: alſo was many times in great Combate with the Hunter, who would ſtill throw it to the ground: when it ſet it, ſelfe in oppoſition againſt him, then he took all the vices (which ſtuck in fleſh and bloud) and caſt them upon the ſoule, that he might intangle it with them, and hinder it from comprehending the virgin againe; he made a great Mountaine of the ſinnes in the fleſh and bloud, and therewith covered and ſhut cloſe up the <note n="r" place="margin">Barmhertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe.</hi>
                  </note> Mercy of God <hi>(viz.</hi> the New Man in Chriſt): and the Gates of Heaven which ſtood open before, were ſhut up cloſe, miſery and great
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57651:178"/>
trouble were heaped upon the ſoule, till at length once againe, from the Breath of God (which came into it againe) it was moved to break the Devils chaines in pieces, and entered into Combate with him, ſo that he was quite throwne to the ground, and its covering was rent in pieces, and then the ſoule ſaw its beloved virgin againe: what <note n="s" place="margin">Note. <hi>No Pen in this world can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</hi>
                  </note> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcoming there was then, I had rather the Reader might finde it by experience, than that I ſhould write of it.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Thus the ſoule deſired the Pearle againe, but it was gone, and muſt be generated anew, and be ſowne as a Graine of Muſtard-ſeed, which is ſmall and little, and afterward there groweth a great Tree out of it; and thus the Pearle groweth in the Boſom of the <note n="t" place="margin">The wiſdome of God.</note> Virgin (in the ſoule). Therefore keep what thou haſt, for miſery is an ill Gueſt; regard not what Sugar the Devill ſtroweth, though the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world ſeeme as ſweet as Sugar, it is nothing elſe but Gall: conſider that the poore ſoule in this world, and in the fleſh and bloud is not in its true home, it muſt travaile into another Countrey. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffer not the Devill to cover it thus with the untowardneſſe of the fleſh, for great earneſtneſſe is requiſite for the driving away of the Devill; though that would not be in our ability [and power,] if the exceeding worthy Champion did not ayde and aſſiſt us.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Therefore none ſhould be ſo preſumptuous, as to mock and deſpiſe the Children of God, who are in the Combate againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; but think that it will come to thy turne alſo: if thou wilt not goe about it when thou art well and in health, thou muſt come to it at thy Death: when the poore ſoule, cometh to part from the body, then it muſt enter into the Combate, there is no remedy: for it muſt depart from the body out of the Spirit of this world; and then two Gates ſtand open; <hi>viz.</hi> Heaven and Hell, it muſt goe in at one of them, there is no other place out of this world.</p>
               <p n="22">22.

how often is it covered with ſinnes: for all, that is in this world, is againſt it, it is as it were left alone and for ſaken: even the children of God themſelves ruſh upon it: for the Devill doth plague the poore ſoule thus, to try if he can lead it aſtray, either with flattery and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, that the ſoule might flatter it ſelfe; or elſe with ſinnes in the Conſcience; he never ceaſeth, and thou muſt alwayes ſtrive againſt him; for ſo the Tree of Pearle groweth, as Corne doth in the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous ſtormes and windes; but if it grow high, and come to bloſſom, then thou wilt enjoy the fruit well enough, and underſtand better what this Penne hath written, and where it was borne: for it was a long time in this condition, many ſtormes went over its head: and therefore this ſhall be for a laſting Memoriall, and continuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to it: ſeeing wee muſt ſit here in the murthering den of the Devill, if wee doe but overcome, our great reward will ſoone fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us.</p>

               <p n="34">34. Here the Tree of Pearle ſtandeth hidden; behold my beloved Reaſon, the Tree of Pearle is not ſowen into the outward Man, he is not worthy of it, he belongeth to the Earth, and the Man of ſinne ſticketh in him, and the Devill often maketh his ſeate therein, who heapeth together anger and malice therein, and bringeth the poore ſoule often into <note n="d" place="margin">Abominable ſinnes and wickedneſſe.</note> luſts, unto which it doth not conſent, ſo that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy medleth with that which the ſoule is againſt: and now when this is ſo, it is not alwayes the ſoule that doth it, but the Spirit of the Starres and Elements in Man; the ſoule ſaith it is not right, nor well: but the [outward] Body ſaith, wee muſt have it, that wee may live and have enough: and ſo it is one time after another: ſo that a true Chriſtian knoweth not himſelfe, how then ſhould he be knowne by others; alſo the Devill can cover him ſufficiently, that he may not be knowne: and that is his Maſter-piece, when he can bring a true Chriſtian into wickedneſſe, to fall into ſinnes, ſo that outwardly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is diſcerned by him, but that he reproveth the ſinnes of others, and yet ſinneth outwardly himſelfe.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IF wee conſider our ſelves in our right Reaſon, and behold the Kingdome of this world (in which wee ſtand with our fleſh and bloud, alſo with our Reaſon and ſenſes) then wee finde ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that wee have the ſubſtance and ſtirring of it in us: for wee are its very proper own. Now all whatſoever wee thinke, doe, and purpoſe in the outward Man, that the Spirit of this world doth in us Men: for the Body is nothing elſe but the Inſtrument thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it performeth its work; and wee finde that as all other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which are generated from the Spirit of this world) decay,

corrupt, and turne to duſt, ſo alſo our earthly Body, wherein the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world worketh [and acteth] for a while.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore none ſhould ſcorne or deſpiſe another, though he lead not the ſame courſe, that he doth himſelfe; or though he be not of that way in his minde and will, which himſelfe is: or that another cannot learne and follow the ſame ſtately Courtly manners and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, with himſelfe; for the Naturall Heaven maketh every one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as, its forme (in its Influences) is, at all times: and ſo every Creature getteth its condition, forme [or ſhape] inclination and will: which cannot wholly be taken away from the outward Man, till the [Naturall] Heaven breaketh its Beaſt. Therefore wee ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the great ſtrife in us, when wee are regenerated out of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, then the Eternall ſtriveth againſt the Corruptible, againſt the malice and falſhood of the Corruptible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And now each Kingdome <note n="a" place="margin">Worketh or performeth.</note> effecteth its will, the inward goeth right forward, and conſenteth not to the wickedneſſe of the outward, but it runneth to its <note n="b" place="margin">It aimeth at.</note> Mark; and the outward alſo goeth forward with its deſire, and performeth its work according to the Influence of its Conſtellation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if it happen, that the outward doe not what its deſire will; that proceedeth not from its wiſdome, but the Heaven hath altered it by another <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>aſpect.</hi>
                  </note> Conjunction; but if <note n="d" place="margin">The outward Man.</note> it be compelled to leave off that which is evill; that is not <note n="e" place="margin">From the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence or acting.</note> by the courſe of the Heavens: but the new Regenerated Man (who is in ſtrife with the Earthly) doth many times overcome, but cannot ſwallow up the Earthly; for the Earthly getteth up againe: as wee ſee by our Anger; for if my new Man have the upperhand, he will have no Anger, nor any evill deſire: but if this worlds Driver aſſault him, then the fire of Anger riſeth up in the old Man, and his deſire is often kindled, to doe what he rejected, and reproved a little before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now wee cannot ſay, that the Spirit of this world alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth to, and doth that which is evill and wrathfull: for the whole Man oftentimes runneth with all his thoughts, and his whole will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. And heere wee <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>know.</hi>
                  </note> finde our great Miſery, for the poore ſoule (which lieth yet tied in the Bands of Anger) is often kindled, that it burneth like a fire, and runneth after [evill]: for it is in the Band of Eternity, in the Father, and reacheth (in its moſt inward Roote) the Anger of God: and that is even the Birth of its Life, and its Origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and the Noble Graine of Muſtard-ſeede (that was the new Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoule, which was new put upon it in its Repentance) is many times deſtroyed: therefore none ſhould be ſecure; though he doe once attaine the Garland of Pearle: he may looſe it againe; for when the ſoule conſenteth to ſinne, then it goeth forth from Chriſt, into falſhood, and into the Anger of God.</p>

6. Now therefore as wee know, that Chriſt (by his entrance into the Incarnation) hath opened a Doore into Heaven, into his holy Body, ſo that wee (through a true Repentance and Confidence) may come to him and put the new white Garment (of his Innocency, in his Love,) upon our ſoules; ſo wee know alſo that the ſoule ſtandeth yet faſt bound with two chaines; one is the Birth of its own Life, whoſe moſt inward roote is poyſon and wrathfulneſſe: and ſo, the ſoule being [ſprung] out of the Eternall ſource, and having its originality out of the Eternity: none can redeeme it <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>bring it back.</hi>
                  </note> in its own roote of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or bring it out of the Anger, except there come one who is the Love it ſelfe, and be borne in its own very Birth, that ſo he may bring it out of the Anger, and ſet it in the Love in himſelfe, as it was done in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The other Gate, or Chaine, is the fleſh and bloud, with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion [or Dominion] of the Starres; there the ſoule is faſt bound, and ſwimmeth therein, as in a Great Sea, which daily ſo <note n="h" place="margin">Infecteth it, that it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> ſtirreth up the ſoule that it is kindled.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Concerning theſe two chaines; wee know in our deepe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſee them in the Ground of the Originality, and know very exactly, that wee could not be redeemed, except the Deity did goe into the ſoule, and <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi>
                  </note> bring forth the will of the ſoule againe out of the fierceneſſe in it ſelfe, into the Light of the Meekneſſe; for the Roote of Life muſt remaine, or elſe the whole Creature muſt be diſſolved.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But becauſe the ſoule ſtood with its moſt inward Roote in the Abyſſe of Hell, and according to the Kingdome of this world in the hard [frozen] Death; ſo that (if the fleſh and bloud, as alſo the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Starres ſhould leave it) then it would continue inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſtiffneſſe.</hi>
                  </note> hardneſſe, wherein there is no ſource [or active property]: and it ſelfe in its own property, would be but in the fierceneſſe of the Originality, in great Miſery; and therefore it was neceſſary not onely for God to come into the ſoule, and generate it to the Light, (for there was danger, that the ſoule with its Imagination might goe forth out of the Light againe) but alſo for God to aſſume a humane ſoule, from our ſoule, and a new heavenly body (out of the firſt Glorious Body before the fall) and put it on to the ſoule, with the old earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body hanging on it; not onely as a Garment, but really [united as one] in the Eſſences: ſo that it muſt be a Creature that is the whole God, with all the Three Principles.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And thus yet the one muſt be parted from the other; <hi>(viz.</hi> the Kingdome of this world, which is a Roote or ſtirrer up of the Roote of the fierceneſſe) and therefore it was neceſſary that God ſhould paſſe with the new Body into the Seperation of the Roote, and of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world, as into the Death of the fierceneſſe, and ſhould deſtroy Death, and ſpring with its own vertue and power through

And ſo the Woman (in whom the Eternall Life ſpringeth) ſtandeth upon the Earthly Moone, and deſpiſeth that which is Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for, that which is Earthly periſheth: and then there remaineth (of that which is Earthly) the hard [frozen] Death; and ſo now the Word of God (as a living <note n="m" place="margin">Source or active pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie.</note> fountaine) is entred into Death, and hath generated the ſoule in its ſelfe, and ſpringeth forth out of the ſoule through Death like a new flower; and that flower is the new Body in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="13">13. After this manner you may underſtand how he deſtroyed Death; by the Springing of the Eternall Life in the Deity through Death; and you may underſtand how the new Body in the Love of God, holdeth the Eternall ſource of the Anger captive; for the Love is the priſon [of the Anger:] for the ſource of the Anger cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Love, but continueth onely by it ſelfe, as it was from Eternity, and therein the Devils are impriſoned: for the Light of God ſtriketh them downe: they neither can nor dare behold that Light in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, a Principle is between: for the Love ſpringeth forth in the Centre of the ſoule, and therein the Holy Trinity appeareth [or ſhineth].</p>
               <p n="14">14. Thus wee have gotten a Prince of the Eternall Life, and wee need doe no more, but to preſſe in to him with a firme truſt and ſtrong Beliefe, and then our ſoule receiveth his Love, and ſpringeth forth with him through death, and ſtandeth upon that which is Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> upon fleſh and bloud, and is a fruit in the Kingdome of God, in the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and triumpheth over the fierceneſſe, for the Love holdeth that captive, and that is a reproach to Death: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Hell, where is thy Victory? Thanks be to God, who hath given us victory.</hi>

And becauſe wee cleerly underſtand and apprehend it in the Spirit, therefore wee are indebted, to ſhew the light to thoſe that apprehend it not, and doe lie thus captivated in Reaſon, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſearch into the Circumſtances, why it happened ſo [in the Paſſion of Chriſt]. For Reaſon ſaith; If it muſt needs be ſo, that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57651:182"/>
Chriſt muſt enter into Death, and deſtroy Death, and ſpring up through Death: and ſo draw us unto him; what is the cauſe then, that he muſt be ſo deſpiſed? and <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>whipped.</hi>

               <p n="17">17. As wee have in the beginning of this Booke, mentioned the Eternall <note n="p" place="margin">Or, <hi>working.</hi>
                  </note> Birth in the Originality, ſo wee have mentioned the Birth of the Eſſences, and the ſeven Spirits of the Eternall Nature: and therein wee ſhewed, how there is a Croſſe-Birth in the Eternall Birth in the fourth forme, where the Eſſences in the turning wheele, make a Croſſe-Birth, becauſe they cannot goe out from themſelves, but that the Eternall Birth is every where ſo in all things, in the Eſſence of all Eſſences.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And wee give you to underſtand thus much (in very exact knowledge) at the inſtant of this Text: that all Eſſences in all qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities at the time of the over-coming of Death (when Chriſt was to overcome death, and deſtroy hell, and captivate the Devill) were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant: for ſo it muſt be; he muſt releaſe the ſoule from all Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Now the Croſſe-Birth is the middlemoſt in the Eſſences, yet before the Fire: <note n="q" place="margin">The Croſſe-Birth.</note> it ſtandeth in the Anxious Death in the fierceneſſe of the Hell, as you may reade before; for from the fierce flaſh in the Brimſton Spirit, the fire cometh forth, and in the flaſh, the Light: and the fierceneſſe it ſelfe maketh the Brimſtone-Spirit, and out of that (in the Light) cometh water: as is before-mentioned. Now then
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57651:183"/>
the ſoule of Man is diſcovered in the flaſh, as a Spirit, and held by the Fiat, and ſo is created or generated, and was brought in it ſelfe into the fift forme of the Birth, as into the Love, where then it was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, in the Light of God.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But this world being created (as a Principle) in the fourth forme (as an out-Birth): and the Paradiſe [being] between the fourth and the fifth forme: and the <note n="r" place="margin">The one pure Element.</note> Element [being] in the fift forme, and therein, the Eternall Light of the Deity having opened another Centre: and the ſoule having reflected back againe into the fourth forme, and entered thereinto; it made all Eſſences predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in it, which ſtood in the fourth forme.</p>
               <p n="21">21. And now when the body of the ſoule in the fourth forme, was come to be a Maſſe out of the water, with a mixture of the other formes, then ſtuck all Eſſences, out of the fourth forme, upon the ſoule: and it was captivated with this body: and it had continued in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Priſon, if the Eternall Word had not inſtantly <note n="s" place="margin">Or, <hi>put.</hi>
                  </note> given it ſelfe into the Centre of the fift forme, as was manifeſted in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Eden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. And now when the time came that the Word became Man, then the Deare Life came into the ſoule againe. But when the ſtrife came that the fourth forme ſhould be broken, then the outward bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt (and wee all) in the fourth forme were environed with death, and then all the formes in Nature did ſtirre, and were all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant together, whereupon the Perſon of Chriſt (in the Garden) did ſweat bloud out of his body, when he cryed; <hi>Father, if it be poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, take this cup from mee:</hi> Thus the outward Man cried out: and the Inward ſaid, <hi>yet not my will</hi> (underſtand [my] outward will) <hi>but thy will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. And now becauſe the Devill had ſo highly triumphed, and had Man in the Eternall Priſon, therefore it was now permitted to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world, that they <hi>(viz.</hi> the Phariſees who lived onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit of this world) all of them might doe and bring to paſſe, whatſoever the Devill had brought into the Eſſences, in the Garden of <hi>Eden:</hi> and there all was turned into a ſubſtance, and to an Eſſentiall work; for a terrible Example to [ſhew] us, that all (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever wee ſuffer to come into the ſoule, and fill the ſoule full of, with a totall will) ſtandeth in the figure, and muſt come to light, at the Judgement of God.</p>
               <p n="24">24. For when <hi>Adam</hi> went out of the Angelicall forme into the fierceneſſe of the forme of the Serpent, then the Devils mocked him: and that mocking muſt at this time be eſſentially [or actually done] upon the outward Man Chriſt: and the Devils fatted ſwine (the high Prieſts) muſt have their pleaſure upon him.</p>
               <p n="25">25. And ſo, when <hi>Adam</hi> went out of the Angelicall forme and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57651:183"/>
into the fourth forme, then all the fierce [wrathfull] Effences fell upon him, and <note n="t" place="margin">Qualified or mingled in him.</note> wrought in him, and ſcourged him exceedingly. But the Word of God in the Promiſe mitigated that againe: though indeed wee muſt ſtill feele it enough; if thou haſt any Reaſon, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. And now the outward Man Chriſt underwent this paine alſo outwardly, when he was ſcourged: for all the Inward formes, which the Man Chriſt muſt beare inwardly for our ſakes, which cauſed him to ſweate drops of bloud; they ſtood alſo outwardly on his body; to ſhew, that the outward Man in this outward world ſtood and dwelt in ſuch a ſource [property or condition].</p>
               <p n="26">26. And as <hi>Adam</hi> (in Pride) deſired the Kingdome of this world, and would be like God in it, and weare the Crowne of this world; ſo muſt Chriſt weare a Crowne of Thornes, and muſt endure to be mocked by it, as a falſe King; for ſo the Devils alſo did to <hi>Adam,</hi> when they had ſet the Crowne of folly upon him; the Kingdome of this world.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And as <hi>Adam</hi> (after his entrance, into the Spirit of this world) muſt have his Eſſences broken: (when the Woman was made out of him, and a ribbe was broken from his ſide for a wife) ſo muſt bloud flow out of all the Eſſences of Chriſt in his ſcourging, and his ſide muſt be opened with a Speare, that therein wee may behold the broken Man within us, which the Devill had mocked: thus this Chriſt muſt beare the reproach for us, in his body.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And as <hi>Adam</hi> went out from the Eternall Day, into the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall [darke] Night, wherein the Anger of God was: ſo this Chriſt muſt be bound in a dark Night, and be lead before the angry Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, who all opened their Jawes, and would powre out their fury upon him.</p>
               <p n="29">29. And as <hi>Adam</hi> in confidence of himſelfe (deſiring to be high and wiſe like God himſelfe) went into the Spirit of the fierce ſource [or property] in this world: ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> muſt endure all mocking, torment, and paine, to be inflicted upon him from the wiſe <note n="u" place="margin">Who were learned in the Scriptures.</note> Scribes, that wee might ſee that in our greateſt Art (which wee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have from the Schooles and Univerſities in this world) wee are but fooles, and that ſuch wiſdome is but folly before God: and our own opinions and conceits ſtick therein, as in <hi>Adam.</hi> who thought, he could not now faile, he was become Lord therein <hi>[viz.</hi> in his ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſdome], and he was but a foole. Thus alſo, when we fall from God, and relie upon our own Reaſon, wee are [but] fooles</p>
               <p n="30">30 How will yee then (O Antichriſtian fooles) binde us to your Art, that wee ſhould turne away from the Heart of God, to behold your invented fables and fopperies?

               <p n="31">31. And as <hi>Adam</hi> muſt carry the untoward groſſe body, that the Spirit of this world had put upon him, and was ſcorned of all Devils, becauſe he had changed his Angelicall [Body] into a monſtrous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, ſo Chriſt muſt carry his heavy woodden Croſſe, and was for our ſakes ſcorned of all theſe wicked people.</p>
               <p n="32">32. And as the fierce [wrathfull] Eſſences of the Anger of God, preſſed into <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby he entered into Death (of which God ſpake, ſaying, <hi>If thou eateſt of the Tree, thou ſhalt dye the Death,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Death in the fleſh, even while they were in the earthly life) ſo the ſharp Nayles muſt pierce through the hands and feet of Chriſt, and ſo he muſt enter into Death: and as there is in the humane Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (before the Light of God) a Croſſe Birth; ſo when the Light of God ſhineth therein, all is turned into a pleaſant flouriſhing bloſſome, wherein the ſharp Eſſences are not found or perceived.</p>
               <p n="33">33. And when <hi>Adam</hi> with his ſoule entered into the fourth forme, into the Spirit of this world, then that Croſſe Birth was ſtirred: and (when his wife was made out of his Eſſences) he was <note n="y" place="margin">Parted aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> divided in that Croſſe Birth; and ſo the Woman hath the one halfe of the Croſſe, and the Man the other halfe; which you may ſee <note n="z" place="margin">

               <p n="34">34. And as the ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi> hung between two evill Kingdomes, (as between the Kingdome of this world, and the Kingdome of Hell) ſo Chriſt hung on the Croſſe between two <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>Theeves.</hi>
                  </note> Murtherers: And thus Chriſt muſt reſtore againe all that <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt. And as the one Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor turned and deſired to be with Chriſt in his Kingdome, ſo the one Kingdome, <hi>v. z.</hi> the Earthly Man, muſt alſo turne againe, and the poore ſoule muſt enter into Chriſt againe through the earthly Death, and ſpring up againe, like this Murtherer, [Theefe, or Malefactour] on the Croſſe, who deſired the Kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="35">35. And thus you may well beleeve, that all whatſoever happened in the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby <hi>Adam</hi> is fallen; the ſame was the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> faine to beare upon his ſhoulders; for <note n="b" place="margin">Adam.</note> he was fallen into the Anger of God: and now if that muſt be allayed and reconciled: then the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> muſt ſet himſelfe therein, and yeeld his outward bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with all Eſſences therein; and he muſt goe through Death, into Hell, into the Anger of the Father: and reconcile it with his Love: and ſo himſelfe muſt undergoe that hard condition, wherein wee muſt have been in Eternity.</p>
               <p n="36">36. And now when this earneſt buſineſſe was taken in hand, that the Saviour of the World, hung on the Croſſe, as a curſe, and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <p n="37">37. And when he ſaw <hi>John,</hi> with his Mother under the Croſſe; he ſaid, <hi>Behold, that is thy Mother;</hi> and to her he ſaid, <hi>Behold, that is thy Sonne,</hi> and inſtantly <hi>that Diſciple tooke her to him.</hi> His Mother, ſignifieth his Eternall new Humanity, which he had <note n="c" place="margin">Aſſumed.</note> received in his Mother <hi>(viz.</hi> in the holy Ternary) which wee ſhould take to us, and refreſh our ſelves with his Mother; and therefore he ſhewed her to <hi>John:</hi> of which very much might be written; but this ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in another place.</p>
               <p n="38">38. And this is as cleere as the Sunne, that (as the poore ſoule in us, hangeth between two Kingdomes, which both keepe it altogether impriſoned) ſo muſt Chriſt hang between two Malefactours; take this into great conſideration, and weigh it well: it is a moſt ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and wee ſee the whole terrible earneſt [ſeverity,] that when the ſoule of Chriſt brake off from the Earthly Body; when it paſſed into the Anger of the Father; <hi>viz.</hi> into Hell: then the Earth trembled, and the ſtony Rocks cleft in ſunder: alſo the Sunne loſt its Light: and this wee ſee cleerly, and underſtand it from the mouth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="39">39. When he now had undergone all the reproach and ſufferings; he ſaid on the Croſſe; <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> while he yet lived in the Earthly Body, he ſaid it was <hi>finiſhed;</hi> underſtand, all that ſhould have remained upon us Eternally; and ſhould have ſprung up in us, with all the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie, in which wee ſtood before Hell, and the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he had all that laid upon him: concerning which, <hi>Eſaiah</hi> ſaith; <hi>Surely, he bare our infirmities, and tooke upon him our tranſgreſsions:</hi> yet wee held him as one ſmitten of God, tormented, and afflicted; but he tooke upon him our diſeaſes, and all our miſeries were laid upon him, and through his wounds wee are healed: wee all went aſtray like ſheepe, every one hath looked upon his own way: and yet wee could not help our ſelves, but wee went as miſerable halfe ſlaine ſheepe, and wee muſt let the Devill (in the Anger of God) doe with us what he will: for wee beare on us a monſtrous Garment, and ſtand in great ignominie before Heaven and Hell.</p>

               <p n="43">43. Now it was the Love that became Man, and had put on our humane ſoule: and the ſoule, that was enlightened from the Love, and ſtood with its Roote in the Anger, as in the ſtrong Might of the Father; and now the New Man in the Love, commended the ſoule to the Father into his Might, and <note n="h" place="margin">Quitted or left.</note> yeelded up the Earthly Life, [which proceeded] from the Conſtellations and Elements; <hi>viz.</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world; and ſo the ſoule now ſtood no more in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world, in the <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>active propertie.</hi>

And here wee ſhould have remained in the Anger, in the dark Hell: but the bright Father in his Glory, tooke the ſoule to him, into the Trinity.

And then alſo the holy Bodies went out of the Graves; (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this well;) thoſe that had put their truſt in the Meſſiah, had (in the Promiſe) gotten the pure Element for a new Body; and now when the Promiſed Saviour, went through Death into Life, and put on that pure Element for a Body, then their ſoules in the Saviour, (in whom they ſtood) in hope, gat the upperhand, and put on their new Body, (in the Body of Chriſt,) and lived in him, in his [power and) vertue; there were the holy Patriarchs and Prophets, who in this world, had put on the Treader upon the Serpent, in the Word of God: wherein they had propheſied of him, and wrought Miracles; they were now quickened, in the vertue of Chriſt: for the vertue of Chriſt ſprung up through Death: and reconciled the Father, who held the ſoules captive in the Anger; and they now entered, with Chriſt, into Life.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Heere yee beloved Sheepe obſerve: When Chriſt dyed, he did not caſt away his Body (which he had heere), and yeelded it up to the foure Elements to be ſwallowed up, ſo that he muſt have wholly a ſtrong Body; no: but <note n="l" place="margin">He hath laid off.</note> the ſource [or property] of this world, which is in the Starres and Elements, and the <note n="m" place="margin">Corruption put on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> Incorruptible ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up the Corruptible, ſo that it is a Body, which liveth (in the vertue of God) in God; and not in the Spirit of this [foure Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary] world: and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith concerning the Laſt Judgement; <hi>That the Incorruptible (viz.</hi> the New Man) <hi>ſhall over-cloath the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſhall ſwallow up the Corruptible;</hi> ſo that Death ſhall be made a ſcorne; according to that ſaying; <hi>[O Death] where is thy Sting?

               </p>
               <p n="48">48. You muſt know, that Chriſt (while he lived upon the Earth, and all wee, that are new-borne in him) have and carry the heavenly fleſh and bloud in the earthly [Man]: and wee carry it alſo in the New Man, in the Body of Chriſt. And when wee die thus, in the old Earthly Body, then wee live (in the New Body) in the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and ſpring up in him out of Death: and our ſpringing up, is our Paradiſe, where our Eſſences ſpring up in God, and the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſwallowed up in Death, and wee put on our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; not onely in the Faith and Spirit, but in the vertue [and power] of the Body, in our Heavenly Fleſh and Bloud; and ſo wee live to God the Father in Chriſt his Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt confirmeth all our Doings; for all what wee ſhall doe, it is God doth it in us.</p>

               <p n="52">52. Behold, the <note n="r" place="margin">Innocent.</note> Guiltleſſe Man Chriſt, was ſet in our ſtead, in the Anger of the Father: he muſt reconcile [and ſatisfie] not onely all that which <hi>Adam</hi> had made himſelfe guilty of, (by his going forth from Paradiſe into the Kingdome of this world, and ſo fell foulely in the preſence of God, and was ſcorned of all the Devils;) but [he muſt make attonement for] all that which was done afterwards, and which is ſtill done, or [will be] done by us.</p>
               <p n="53">53. And this wee ſet before your eyes, in the knowledge of God, and in true earneſt Sincerity; not that wee will deſpiſe any Man, and exalt our ſelves: wee would rather be baniſhed from this world, than that wee ſhould ſeeke our own Praiſe, in Pride; that is but dung and droſſe, and the Spirit of knowledge would not ſtay with us; this ought
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:57651:186"/>
well to be conſidered. Therefore wee will write (in our knowledge) for our ſelves, and leave the event to God.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Behold, when <hi>Adam</hi> entred into this world, Pride wrought in him, he would be as God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith; the Serpent (the Devill) perſwaded him to it; He [Man] would have the Third Principle working and flowing in him; and thereby he loſt God, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven: But that it is true that Pride acted in Man, looke upon <hi>Cain,</hi> he would be Lord alone, he would not that his brother ſhould be accepted before God, fearing that he ſhould then get the Dominion, and therefore he ſlew him.</p>
               <p n="55">55. And ſo <hi>Cain</hi> and his Succeſſours have ſet up a Potent King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: from whence Dominion proceedeth, whereby one Brother aſpireth above another, and have made them ſlaves. And thus horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tyranny hath been hatched; and the Potent have done whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they liſted: he hath oppreſſed the needy at his pleaſure: he hath gotten to him the Kingdome of the Earth, and therewith exerciſeth Tyranny, wickedneſſe, and wrong, and yet men muſt ſay to him, it is right: he hath contrived all ſorts of Policy and cunning Devices, and made Lawes of them [and eſtabliſhed them for Right] and afterwards ſold them to others for Rights, and hath brought up his Children with wickedneſſe and falſhood. He hath beaten downe the Conſcience of the ſimple-hearted in his good meaning: he hath invented Rights, which in his Lawes, ſerve to promote his decent, contrary to the light of Nature: all reproach and Blaſphemies have ſubſiſted in his ſtrength and authority, whereby he hath terrified the ſimple-hearted, that his power might be great.</p>
               <p n="56">56. Thus falſhood is wrought with falſhood, and the Inferiour is become falſe alſo: who hath ſet lyes to ſale for truth, and ſo falſly cheated his ſuperiour; from whence is growne, curſing, ſwearing, ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and murthering, ſo that they have continually held one another for cozening cheaters, lyars, and unjuſt; for they are ſo indeed, and <note n="ſ" place="margin">The Superiour and the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another.</note> they have exchanged words for words, and therewith in lying and in truth alſo, they rub one another with the bitter unſavoury ſalt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in the Anger of God, whereby the Name of God is blaſphemed and abuſed, and the World is found [to be] in the Anger of God, and is become a Den of Theeves and Murtherers.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Seeing then out of this unrighteous people, there ſhould an hoaſt [or Generation] be borne to the Kingdome of Heaven; and ſeeing none lived upon Earth that was not defiled with this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and yet that, in the Love of God there was a poſſibility found [that ſuch a Generation might be brought forth out of Mankinde]: ſo that wee (who are ſorry and grieved at this fore-mentioned evill Beaſt, and deſire to goe out from it) might come to the Grace of God, and yet no otherwiſe, but in this Chriſt: And yet that it is daily found
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57651:187"/>
among the Regenerated Chriſtians, that the Old Earthly Body is ſo kindled in ſuch wickedneſſe, and that (although they would faine goe out from it, and leave it quite,) yet they cannot; for the Anger hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us captive in the Old Man, and the Devill is Lord therein, who driveth the Body (in the Spirit of this world) often into evill and wickedneſſe, which Man intended not to doe; for the wickedneſſe of the ungodly (by his curſing and falſhood) kindleth the Anger of the <note n="t" place="margin">Wherein the New Man liveth.</note> Old Man: and although he be inwardly [new] borne in God, yet it is not knowne.</p>
               <p n="58">58. Therefore (ſeeing our falſhood and unrighteouſneſſe, as alſo our offences are manifeſted before God, and appeare in the Tincture, and that wee could not [otherwiſe] be freed from ſuch evill) Chriſt hath taken upon him all our tranſgreſſions, and ſuffered himſelfe to be accounted one that had a Devill, and a ſorcerer, ſeducer, and deceiver, as if he would have ſet up an Imperiall Crowne for himſelfe, as the High Prieſts laid to his charge; he ſuffered himſelfe to be mocked, ſcourged, ſpit upon, and ſmitten on the face: he ſuffered a falſe Crowne of Thornes to be ſet upon his head; and as wee proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another, and vex one another with falſhood and malice, upon Earth, where the Potent doth what he liſteth, to ſatisfie his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and as wee revile, deride, mock, vilifie, and ſend one another to the Devill, to deprive one another of their credit and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation through falſhood; ſo muſt Chriſt therefore take all this upon him.</p>
               <p n="59">59. And you ſee cleerly, that the wicked Phariſees and Scribes put theſe things upon him; for theſe things did not happen to him for nothing, or without cauſe; for it was of neceſſity to be ſo: for the Phariſees, Scribes, and Rulers, had put that in his diſh, for him, which he muſt eate. Or ſhall wee be ſilent, wee muſt tell it, though it ſhould coſt us our life.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Behold thou wicked Antichriſt, thou art the ſame which thou haſt alwayes been, thou art an old, and not a new [Antichriſt,] thy cunning policy is borne in the Anger of God; the Devill teacheth thee to doe what thou doeſt: Among Princes and Kings (who have their ground and foundation in Nature) thou ſtirreſt up to warres and diſſentions, that thou mighteſt be advanced by them, through thy deceit, hypocriſie, and knaviſh ſuttle cunning policy: this thou doeſt out of Pride; thou perverteſt the Scriptures of the <note n="u" place="margin">Or, <hi>Holy Men.</hi>

               <p n="62">62.

               <p n="66">66. Yet it is ſeene that ſome wealthy people did draw neere to Chriſt: whereby it may be perceived, that the Kingdome of Heaven conſiſteth not in miſery onely, but in Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; and none ought to eſteeme himſelfe happy, becauſe he is poore and miſerable: he is in the Kingdome of the Devill nevertheleſſe, if he be faithleſſe and wicked.

               <p n="67">67.

               <p n="68">68. Therefore now the queſtion is, Where the ſoule of Chriſt was
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57651:188"/>
all the time that the body did Reſt in the Grave? Beloved Reaſon, doe not like thoſe, that are blinde concerning God, who ſay, the ſoule [of Chriſt] went away from the Body downe into Hell into the Earth, and during that time, in the Divine power and vertue; aſſaulted the Devils in Hell: and bound them with chaines, and deſtroyed Hell. O it is cleane another thing. The Saints riſing out of the Graves at the houre of the Death of Chriſt; declareth otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="69">69. Reaſon knoweth nothing at all of God, and if it be not poſſible to attaine further from the Gift of God, doe not deſcend downe into that Deepe, but in ſingleneſſe of heart ſtay <note n="d" place="margin">Reſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that which the Scripture ſaith.</note> on the Article; it will not endanger thy happineſſe: God looketh onely upon the will of the Heart. Thou muſt not ſearch ſo deepe into every thing, if it be not given thee, as it is to this Pen; this Pen writeth in the Counſell of God, (that which the hand knoweth not, and ſcarce underſtandeth the leaſt ſpark of it) and yet very deeply, as thou ſeeſt, that the things to come are ſhewen in a very difficult depth, which God alone will diſcover in due time, which is <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p n="70">70. Thou knoweſt that God himſelfe is all, and there are but Three Principles <hi>(viz.</hi> Three Births of diſtinction) in his Eſſence; or elſe all things would be one thing, and all were meerely God, and if it were ſo, then all would be in a ſweet meekneſſe: but where would be the Mobility, Kingdome, Power, and Glory? Therefore wee have often ſaid; the Anger is the Roote of Life: and if <note n="f" place="margin">The Anger.</note> it be without the Light, then <note n="f" place="margin">The Anger.</note> it is not God, but Hell fire: but if the Light ſhine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it becometh Paradiſe and fulneſſe of Joy.</p>
               <p n="71">71. Therefore wee can ſay no otherwiſe of the ſoule of Chriſt, but that he commended it into his Fathers hands, and the Father took it into his Divine power; it ſtood with its Roote therein before: but its own Roote, was (without the Light of God,) in the Anger. And now the ſoule of Chriſt came with the Light of God into the Anger; and then the Devils trembled, for the Light tooke the Anger captive, and the Father (underſtand, his Anger) in the Kingdome of Heaven was Paradiſe, and in Hell remained to be Anger ſtill. For the Light ſhut up the Principle of Hell, ſo (to be underſtood,) that no Devill dareth to take one glimpſe [of light] in thither, he is blinde before the Light, and [the Light] is his terrour and ſhame.</p>
               <p n="72">72. And ſo thou muſt not think that the ſoule of Chriſt was then gone a great way from his Body; for all the Three Principles were on the Croſſe, why alſo not in the Grave? at that very, moment, when Chriſt laid off the Kingdome of this world, the ſoule of Chriſt preſſed into Death, and into the Anger of God, and in that very moment, the Anger was reconciled in the Love in the Light, and became Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: and the Devils were captivated in the Anger in themſelves, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all wicked ſoules: and ſo inſtantly the life did ſpring up
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57651:189"/>
through Death, and Death was deſtroyed, and made a ſcorne; yet to the wicked (which remaine in the Anger) it is a Death, but in Chriſt it is a Life.</p>
               <p n="73">73. Thus the ſoule of Chriſt reſted in the Grave, in the Father, forty houres preſent with its body; for the Heavenly Body was not dead, but the Earthly onely, the ſoule ſprung up in the Heavenly through Death, and ſtood forty houres in Reſt; theſe were the forty houres, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was aſleepe, when his wife was taken out of him: as alſo the forty dayes when <hi>Moſes</hi> was on the Mount [and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was tempted to try] whether it were poſſible to live in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or power of the Father in the Kingdome of Heaven.

               <p n="75">75. As <hi>Adam</hi> went out of the cleere Light of God, into the dark Kingdome of this world, and the ſoule of <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood between two dark Principles (as between Death and Hell) and grew up in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſo alſo would Chriſt (in his growing body) riſe up from the dead at midnight, and make the night in his holy body to be a cleere Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Day, whereinto no night ever came, but the Light of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Lamb ſhone therein.</p>
               <p n="76">76. Thou ſhouldſt not think that the ſoule of Chriſt theſe fortie houres was in any other place than in the Father, <note n="g" place="margin">As fire goeth out in the Iron by the waters quenching or killing of it, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the Iron in its own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> and in his body, where it ſprung up (in great meekneſſe upon the perſecution [it had]) as a Roſe, or faire flower out of the Earth; as alſo our ſoules in our Reſt, in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt (at the Laſt Judgement-day in the deſtruction of this world) ſhall in the new body breake forth againe out of the Old: and in the meane while the ſoule groweth up in the Holy Element, in the body of Chriſt, till <note n="h" place="margin">Our appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time.</note> our forty houres alſo come about, and not one houre longer, than the appointed time is. Thus is the body of Chriſt in the power or vertue of the Father, (through the ſoule) riſen againe and gone forth, and hath in it the Light of the Holy Trinity.</p>
               <p n="77">77. It was not needfull that the Stone ſhould be rowled away
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57651:189"/>
[from the Grave], but to convince the blinde Jewes, that they might ſee it was but folly in them to goe about to detaine or ſhut up God: alſo becauſe of the Diſciples weake Reaſon, that they might ſee that he was riſen for certain: for [when the Stone was rowled away] they could goe into the Grave and ſee it themſelves.</p>
               <p n="78">78. Alſo the Angel appeared to them there, and comforted them: Thus will Chriſt comfort his afflicted ones, who are afflicted for his ſake: yea he is [preſent] with them, as he was with <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> and with the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="79">79. Thou muſt know, that no Stone or Rock, can keepe or retaine his body, he pierceth and penetrateth through all things, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing: he comprehendeth all things, and the thing compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth not him: he comprehendeth this world, and the world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth not him: he is hurt by nothing, the whole fulneſſe of the Deity is in him: and is not included in any thing: <note n="i" place="margin">Note.</note> he appeareth a Creature, in our Humane forme, in the ſame <note n="k" place="margin">Circumſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> dimenſions that our bodies have: and yet his body hath no end or limit; he is the whole Princely Throne of the whole Principle.</p>
               <p n="80">80. When he was here upon Earth in the earthly Man, his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward body was circumſcribed and limited, as our Bodies are: but the Inward body is unlimited: for wee alſo (in the Reſurrection in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt) are unlimited, yet viſible and palpable or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, in the heavenly fleſh and bloud, as the Prince of life him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is; <note n="l" place="margin">Note.</note> wee can in the heavenly figure [or ſhape] be great or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and yet nothing be hurt or wanting in us, there is no need of compreſſing the parts of that body.</p>
               <p n="81">81. O deare Chriſtians, leave off your Contentions about the body of Jeſus Chriſt; he is every where in all places, <note n="m" place="margin">Note.</note> yet in the Heaven; and the Heaven (wherein God dwelleth) is alſo every where: God dwelleth in the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and in all holy ſoules of Men, even when they depart from this outward body; and if they be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, then they are in the body of Jeſus Chriſt, even while they are in this Earthly body: A ſoule here in our body upon Earth, hath not the body of Chriſt in a palpable ſubſtance, but in the word of power [or vertue] which comprehendeth all things: in Chriſt indeed body and power is one [thing]; but wee muſt not underſtand [this, of the foure Elementary] Creature [which is] in this world.</p>
               <p n="82">82. And the Spirit <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</hi>
                  </note> ſignifieth, that if you doe not leave off this Contention, you ſhall have no other ſigne [given you] then the <note n="o" place="margin">When the fire devoured the unbeleeving Captaines and their fifties.</note> ſigne of <hi>Elias,</hi> in fire, in zeale, the zeale ſhall devoure you, and your contention muſt devoure your ſelves, you muſt conſume your ſelves; therefore are you not madd? Are yee not all Brethren, &amp; are yee not all in Chriſt? If you did converſe in Love, what ſhould you need to ſtrive about your Native Countrey (wherein you dwell)? O leave off,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57651:190"/>
your cauſe is evill in the fight of God, and yee are all found to be in <hi>Babell:</hi> be adviſed: the day breaketh: how long will yee keepe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with that adulterous Whore? Ariſe, your noble Virgin is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in her Orient Garland of Pearle: ſhee weareth a Lilly which is moſt delightſome: be brotherly, and ſhee will adorne you indeed, <note n="p" place="margin">Note.</note> wee have ſeene her really, and in her Name wee write this.</p>
               <p n="83">83. There is no need of Contention about the Cup of Jeſus Chriſt, his body is really received in the Teſtament, by the faithfull, as alſo his Heavenly Bloud, and the Baptiſme is a Bath [or Laver] in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Eternall Life (hidden in the outward [Baptiſme with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter]) in the Word of the Body of Chriſt. Therefore all Contention [or Diſputation] is in vaine: be in Brotherly Love, and forſake the Spirit of Pride, and then yee are all in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="84">84. Theſe very deepe and difficult matters are not profitable for you, you ought not to looke after them; wee muſt onely ſet them downe, that you may ſee what the ground is; and what the Errour is. For wee are not the cauſe of theſe Writings, but you (in your high puffed up Luſt) have ſtirred up the Spirit, that you might finde out the thoughts of your hearts, let the Reſurrection of Chriſt be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full [and effectuall] to you: for his Reſurrection is your Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and in him wee ſhall grow, and flouriſh, and live Eternally: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtick to him, and then you cannot periſh in any diſtreſſe: for if you have him, you have the Holy Trinity of God.</p>
               <p n="85">85. If you will pray to God, then call upon God (your Heavenly Father) in the Name of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, [deſiring] that he would forgive you your ſinnes, for the ſake of his ſufferings and death: and give you what is good for you, and may further your ſalvation: Give up and yeeld all whatſoever is earthly, to his pleaſure and will; for wee know not what wee ſhould deſire and pray for, but the Holy Ghoſt helpeth us in Chriſt Jeſus, before his Heavenly Father. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no need of many words [or Long Prayers]; But a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Soule, which with its whole Earneſt [reſolved purpoſe,] yeeldeth it ſelfe up into the Mercy of God, to live in his will, in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt: and continueth conſtant, then he is ſure and ſafe from the Devill.</p>
               <p n="86">86. That Phantaſie about the Interceſſion of the Saints, is unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: it is but a vexation, whereby you diſquiet the Saints in their Reſt. Doth not God himſelfe call you continually: and doth not your Virgin waite for you with a Longing Deſire: doe but come, and ſhee is yours: you need not ſend any forraine Embaſſadours: it is not heere, as at Court, Chriſt would alwayes faine increaſe his Heaven, in his Joy: Why ſtand you ſo long in doubt, becauſe of your finnes? Is not the Mercy of God greater than Heaven and Earth: what doe you meane? There is nothing neerer you than the Mercy of God;
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57651:190"/>
onely in your ſinfull impenitent Life, you are with the Devill, and not with Chriſt Say what you will: though you ſent a Million of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to him, if your ſelfe be wicked, you are but with the Devill ſtill: and there is no remedy, but you muſt your ſelfe riſe with Chriſt, and be borne anew, in the body of Jeſus Chriſt, (through the power of the Holy Ghoſt) in the Father, in your own ſoule. If thou makeſt a feaſt [or keepeſt a ſolemnity] doe it for the benefit and <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
                  </note> reliefe of the afflicted and needy, whereby God is praiſed in thy Love, and that is well; but if it be for the Rich Glutton, who onely uſeth it out of pride and lazineſſe, thou haſt no benefit of that: for God is not prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therewith, neither doth Paradiſe grow therein.</p>
               <p n="87">87. And doe not relie upon the hypocriſie of the Antichriſt, he is a lyar, and covetous, and a diſſembler: he mindeth onely his Idoll the Belly, and is a Thiefe, in the ſight of God: he devoureth the Bread, that belongeth to the needy: he is the Devils Hell-hound, learne to know him.</p>
               <p n="88">88. Speaking then of the true Reſurrection of Chriſt; wee will alſo ſhew [ſomewhat] concerning his converſation (thoſe forty Dayes) after his Reſurrection, before his Aſcenſion: Becauſe wee know that he is become a reall Lord over Heaven, Earth, and Hell, therefore wee ſhew you, how the Kingdome of this world with all the Eſſences and qualities thereof, hath been ſubjected to him. And although he did not alwayes converſe viſibly with his Diſciples, yet many times he ſhewed himſelfe to them viſibly, palpably, and ſtaying with them, <note n="r" place="margin">According to the ruling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the four Elements.</note> according to the Kingdome of this world, according to his body which he had heere, which was ſwallowed up by the new Body, which he muſt preſent againe, as God would have it to be preſented: for God is Lord of every thing, and every thing muſt be changed, (as he pleaſeth,) that he might thus ſhew his Diſciples his reall Body, and the Print of the Nayles: which ſtand in the Holy Chriſt, in his holy Body in Eternity (as a ſigne of his victory) and ſhine brighter than the Morning-Starre.</p>
               <p n="89">89. He thereby confirmed his Diſciples weake faith: and ſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he is Lord alſo over the Kingdome of this world: and that all whatſoever wee ſow, build, plant, eate and drinke, is fully in his Almighty power, and that he can bleſſe and increaſe it, and therefore he is not ſevered or parted from us; but as a flower groweth out of the Earth, ſo his Word, Spirit, and power [or vertue] groweth in every thing; and if our minde be ſincerely inclined to him, then wee are bleſſed of him, in body and ſoule: but if not; then the curſe and the Anger of God is in all things, and wee eate death in all fruits [or food]. And therefore it is that wee pray, that God will bleſſe our meate and drinke, alſo our bodies and ſoules in Chriſt, and that is right.</p>
               <p n="90">
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:57651:191"/>
90. Secondly, wee intimate alſo, how Chriſt converſed upon Earth, forty dayes after his Reſurrection, (underſtand, in the Kingdome of this world, whereas yet he was in Heaven) yet he bare that Image without any outward Glory or Clarity before the eyes of Men: and he had the body wholly with every Eſſence, as it hung on the Croſſe, except the <note n="s" place="margin">Or, <hi>working property of the foure Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary world.</hi>
                  </note> ſource of the Principle, which he had not; but elſe he had all Eſſences in fleſh and bloud, and yet the outward flaſh ſtood in the might [and power] of the Heavenly. This wee ſee, by his going in to his Diſciples, the Doore being ſhut: and paſſed with his body through the wood of the Doore: Thus you may underſtand, that the world is as nothing to him, and that he hath power over all things.</p>
               <p n="91">91. And further alſo wee intimate to you, that theſe forty dayes, are the forty dayes of <hi>Adams</hi> being in Paradiſe before his ſleepe ere the Woman was made out of him, where he ſtood in the Paradiſicall Temptation, where he was ſtill pure and heavenly; And ſo this Chriſt muſt alſo ſtand forty dayes in the Paradiſicall ſource [or condition] in the Temptation [to try] (whether the body would continue Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſicall) before he was Glorified: and therefore he did eate and drinke with his Diſciples in a Paradiſicall manner, (as <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have done) into the Mouth, and not into the Body, for the contuming conſiſted in the vertue [or power].</p>
               <p n="92">92. Heere it was rightly tempted, whether the body would live in divine vertue and power, as <hi>Adam</hi> alſo ſhould have done, while he was in Paradiſe in this world: and though he were there, yet he was in this world, and yet he lived not in the ſource of this world, but in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſicall property above the world, and alſo above the wrath of the Anger in the Hell: he ſhould have lived in the ſource of Love, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Meekneſſe, and <note n="t" place="margin">Barmhertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit; <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe.</hi>
                  </note> Mercy in the friendly will of God: and ſo he ſhould have ruled over the Starres and Elements, and there ſhould have been no death nor frailty or corruption in him.</p>
               <p n="93">93. Therefore yee Turkes and other ſuperſtitious People, you ſhould obſerve and underſtand aright; wherefore Chriſt gave us ſuch Lawes: as command us not to be revengefull: and that when any ſtrike us on the one cheeke, wee ſhould preſent the other to him, and ſo further; that wee ſhould bleſſe them that curſe us, and doe well to them that hate us, and hurt us, underſtand yee this?</p>
               <p n="94">94. Behold, a true Chriſtian (who liveth in the Spirit of Chriſt) muſt alſo walke in the converſation of Chriſt: he muſt not walke in the fierce ſterne revenging Spirit of this world; but as Chriſt lived and converſed in this world, after his Reſurrection, and yet not in the ſource or property of this world. And though it is not poſſible for us (while wee live in the ſource of this world) to doe ſo, yet in the new Man in Chriſt (whom the Devill bideth and obſeureth) wee may; if wee live in meekneſſe, then wee overcome the world in Chriſt: if wee
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57651:191"/>
recompence Good ſoa Evill, then we witneſſe, that the Spirit of Chriſt is in us: and then wee are dead, to the Spirit of this world, for the ſake of the Spirit of Chriſt, which is in us; and though wee are in this world, yet the world doth but hang to us, as it hung to Chriſt after his Reſurrection, and yet he lived in the Father in the Heaven, even ſo doe wee alſo, if wee be borne in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="95">95. Therefore let this be told you yee Jewes, Turkes, and other Nations: yee need not looke for any other, there is no other Time at hand, but the Time of the Lilly; and the ſigne of that [time] is the <note n="u" place="margin">See <hi>verſ.</hi> 82.</note> ſigne of <hi>Elias.</hi> Therefore take heed in what Spirit you live, that the fire of Anger doe not devoure you, and <note n="x" place="margin">Or, <hi>conſume you.</hi>
                  </note> eate you up. It is high time to caſt <hi>Jezabel</hi> with her whoredomes out of the houſe: leaſt you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the wages of the whore; and as you revile one another, ſo you devoure one another. Truly, if the contentious Diſputations be not ſuddenly ſtayed [and theſe courſes mended], the fire will burne out aloft over <hi>Babel;</hi> and then there will be no remedy, till the Anger eate up and conſume all whatſoever is in it.</p>
               <p n="96">96. Therefore let every one enter into himſelfe, and not ſpeake of another, and hold his way to be falſe, but look that he turne himſelfe, and have a care, that he be not found in Anger of the devourer; elſe if he ſhould hoope, and hallow, and laughing ſay, looke how <hi>Babell</hi> burneth, then he muſt be burnt and conſumed alſo, for he is fuell for that fire: and whoſoever feeleth a thought in himſelfe, that doth but wiſh for the Anger, [to devoure], <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>And he is of</hi> Babell.</note> that proceedeth from <hi>Babell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="97">97. Therefore it is very hard to know <hi>Babell:</hi> every one ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he is not in it: and yet the Spirit ſheweth mee, that <hi>Babell</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Includeth &amp; incompaſſeth.</note> encloſeth the whole Earth; therefore let every one look to his own wayes, and not hunt after covetouſneſſe, for the <note n="a" place="margin">The wrath devoureth all that covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe gathereth together.</note> Driver deſtroyeth it, and the Stormer eateth it up and conſumeth it; the Counſell of the Wiſe Man will not help then: all the Wiſdome of this world is folly: for that <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
                  </note> Fire is from the Anger of God: your Wiſdome will turne to your hurt and ſcorne.</p>

               <head>Of Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven.</head>
               <p n="98">98. As wee know, when <hi>Adam</hi> had lived forty dayes in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, then he went into the Spirit of this world, whereas he ſhould have gone into the Trinity; for he ſtood in the Time of the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if he had held out theſe forty dayes, then he had been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his ſoule in the Light of God, and his body in <hi>Ternarie ſancto,</hi> [in the Holy Ternary], like this Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="99">99. For when he had converſed forty dayes (after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) in the <hi>Proba</hi> [or Triall] in this world; then he went up into a Mountaine, whither he had appointed his Diſciples to come, and went up aloft viſibly, with his own body which he had offered up on the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:57651:192"/>
Croſſe (till a cloud came and did hide him from their fight) for a ſure ſigne that he was their Brother: and that he (in this Earthly forme and body) would not forſake them; as he alſo ſaid to them, <hi>Behold, I am with you to the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="100">100. Now then ſaith Reaſon, whither is he gone? is he gone out of this world, aloft above the Starres into another Heaven? Hearken my beloved Reaſon, incline thy Minde to Chriſt and behold, I will tell it thee: for we ſee it and know it: not I: for when I ſay we, you muſt not barely underſtand it of my Earthly Man: for the Spirit that dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this Pen is ſpoken of alſo; therefore I write and ſay wee, when I ſpeake of my ſelfe, as of the Author; for I ſhould know nothing, if the Spirit of knowledge did not ſtirre it up in mee: and there could be nothing ſound but in ſuch a way, the Spirit would not be in any other way: but he did hide and withdraw himſelfe: and then my ſoule was very much diſquieted in mee, with great longing after the Spirit, till I did learne how it was.</p>
               <p n="101">101. Behold that which the Antients have invented and taught, is not the Ground; They tooke upon them to meaſure how many hundred thouſand miles it is to <note n="c" place="margin">Coelum Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreum, <hi>they call it.</hi>
                  </note> rhe Heaven whither Chriſt is gone. They did it to this end, that they might be Gods upon Earth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as their invented Kingdome ſheweth and declareth, which ſtandeth meerly in <hi>Babell.</hi> Behold, when wee ſpeake of the Thrones, it is cleane another thing than that they meane: and their blindneſſe and ignorance is found, though there is a Spirit in their knowledge which is not ſo much rejected: but that Spirit is not [or cometh not] <hi>ex Fernario ſancto</hi> [out of the Holy Ternary] out of the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but it is out of the High Eternity, which flieth up above the Thrones; which may be mentioned in another place.</p>
               <p n="102">102. Wee muſt continue in this Throne [which is ours], what are the other Thrones to mee, where the Principalities of Angels are: they are indeed our friends, and faithfull helpers in the ſervice of God; wee muſt look upon our own Throne wherein wee were created and made Creatures, and upon our Prince in that Throne; upon God. The firſt Purpoſe of God (when he created us, and beheld us in the Eternall Band) that muſt ſtand.</p>
               <p n="103">103. This was the Throne of Lueifer, with his Legions: but when he fell, he was thruſt out into the firſt Principle: and then the Throne in the ſecond Principle was empty: in the ſame Principle God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man, which ſhould continue therein, and it was tempted [to try] whether that were poſſible; and to that end it was, that God created the Third Principle, (in the place of this world,) that Man alſo (in the fall) might not become a Devill, but that he might be helped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Therefore the Enmity of the Devill againſt Chriſt is, becauſe he ſitteth upon his Royall Throne, and beſides holdeth him captive with his Principle.</p>
               <p n="104">
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:57651:192"/>
104. Thus the place of this world (according to the Heavenly Principle,) is the Throne and Body of our Chriſt: and all (whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is in this world in the Third Principle) is his own alſo; and the Devill (who dwelleth in this place in the firſt Principle) is our Chriſts captive [or Priſoner].</p>
               <p n="105">105. For all Thrones are in God the Father, and without him is nothing; he is the Band of the Eternity; but his Love in the Body of Chriſt (as in his Throne) holdeth the Anger in the Band of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (together with the Devils) captive. And you muſt underſtand, that all is creaturely, his Love, and alſo his Anger; and as is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before, ſo the difference [diſtinction or diviſion] is a Birth; and ſo it cannot be ſaid, that the Devils dwell farre from Chriſt, no; they are neere, and yet in Eternity cannot reach to him: for they cannot ſee the cleere Deity in the Light, but are <note n="d" place="margin">As thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that ſee in the dark are blinded by the Sunne.</note> blinded by it, and wee ſhall in Eternity not ſee nor touch them, as at preſent wee ſee them not, becauſe they are in another Principle, and ſo that Principle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</p>
               <p n="106">106. Thus my deare Minde, know; <note n="e" place="margin">As the Sunne is the Centre of all that live, move, and ſpring in the four Elements.</note> that the creature of Chriſt is the Centre of this Throne, from whence every life proceedeth, <hi>viz.</hi> whatſoever is heavenly; for in that Centre is the Holy Trinity, and not alone in this Centre, but alſo in all Angelicall Thrones, alſo in the ſoules of holy Men: onely wee muſt thus ſpeake, that it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Now the Body (underſtand the Creature, the Man Chriſt,) is ſet in the midſt of this Throne: and ſtandeth alſo in Heaven, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in his Principle) ſitting <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>with.</hi>

The right hand of God, is where the Love quencheth the Anger, and generateth the Paradiſe, that muſt needs be the Right hand of God, where the Angry Father is called God in the Love and Light of his Heart, (which is his Sonne); and this bodily Throne <hi>(viz.</hi> the whole body of Chriſt) is wholly at the Right hand of God; but when it is ſaid, <hi>at the right hand of God,</hi> then underſtand, the moſt inward Roote of the ſharpe Might of the Father, wherein the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence conſiſteth, where the Father himſelfe goeth forth, into the re-conceived will, into the meekneſſe, and openeth the Gate (in the diſpelling of the Darkneſſe) in himſelfe: thus Chriſt is ſet therein, and ſitteth thus at the Right hand of the vertue [or power] and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, in ſuch a manner, as wee cannot more highly expreſſe it with our Tongue, wee underſtand it well in the Spirit: therefore it is not needfull for you to ſearch any further into it: but onely looke that you attaine the Body of Chriſt, and then you have God, and the Kingdome of Heaven, but wee muſt write thus, becauſe of the Errours in the world, and for their longings ſake that are therein.</p>

Behold, Chriſt fitteth in himſelfe, and ſtandeth in himſelfe, he needeth no chaire, nor foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole: his power is his ſtoole, there is neither above nor beneath there. And as you ſee in the viſion of <hi>Eſaias,</hi> that was full of eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde and before, above and beneath; ſo the body of Chriſt, the holy Trinity ſhineth in the whole Body, and needeth no Sunne, nor day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOw ſaith Reaſon, if Chriſt aſcended thus with his body, which he <note n="b" place="margin">Sacrificed.</note> offered up on the Croſſe, when was he Glorified in his body? Or how is his body now? is it now as his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſaw him aſcend into Heaven? My beloved Reaſon, my Earthly eyes ſee it not, but the ſpirituall [eyes] in Chriſt ſee it very well. The Scripture ſaith; <hi>He is</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Clarified or Brightened.</note> 
                  <hi>Glorified and Lord over all;</hi> but wee will open to you, the Gate of the Great Wonders, that you may ſee what wee ſee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Behold, when God the Father had brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and would give them Lawes, in which they <note place="margin">Exodus 24.</note> ſhould live: then he commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to come up the Mountaine to the Lord, and the reſt of the Elders muſt ſtay a farre off, and the people below the Mountaine: and <hi>Moſes</hi> went up the Mountaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to the Lord; and there appeared the brightneſſe [or Glory] of the Lord, and on the ſeventh Day he called <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſpake with him concerning all the Lawes? And the countenance of <hi>Moſes</hi> was <note n="d" place="margin">Became bright and did ſhine like the Sun.</note> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified from the Lord, ſo that he could ſtand before him, and ſpeake with him. Thus alſo the Man-Chriſt in <hi>Ternario ſancto</hi> [in the Holy Ternary] (when he was aſcended into his Throne) was Glorified on the ninth Day in the Holy Trinity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Underſtand it right: his ſoule in the Creature was not firſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, but his whole Body, or Princely Throne: there went forth out of the Centre of the Holy Trinity, the Holy Ghoſt; as you ſee cleerly,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57651:193"/>
that thoſe (who had put on the Spirit of Chriſt) were highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened: for the Holy Ghoſt went forth from the Centre of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into the whole holy Element, and did flow into the <note n="e" place="margin">Barmhertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit; <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe.</hi>
                  </note> Mercy of God: and as he Triumphed in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo alſo in his Diſciples, and in the Beleevers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There were opened all the Doores of the Great Wonders, and the Apoſtles ſpake with the Languages of all Nations: and ſo it may be ſeene cleerly, that the Spirit of God had opened all the Centres of all Eſſences, and ſpake out of them all; for Chriſt was the Lord, and the Heart of all Eſſences, and therefore the Holy Ghoſt went out of all Eſſences, and filled the Eſſences of all Men, which turned their eares with a deſire to it, and in that he preſſed into all: and every one heard (out of his own Eſſences and Language,) the Spirit of God ſpake out of the Diſciples: and the Holy Ghoſt was borne in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all their hearers, which had but an earneſt deſire to it, and they were all filled: for the Spirit of God pierced through into their hearts, as he preſſed forth out of the Centre of the Trinity into the whole body and Plincely Throne of Jeſus Chriſt, and filled all outwardly in the Clarity [or Glory].</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thus all the holy ſoules were filled, ſo that their whole body in all Eſſences was made ſtirring from the exceeding pretious vertue [or power] which went forth in the Wonders in power and in <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>Miracles.</hi>
                  </note> Deeds that were done there. And here is ſet before us the vertue [or power] of the Father in the Fire, in his ſevere Omnipotency on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> alſo the Still Loving vertue of the Sonne of God in the Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for wee ſee that wee could not at all live in the Father (in the ſource of the Fire): and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> brake the Tables, and the people fell away from God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But now when the Meekneſſe was in the Father, then the Love held the Anger captive, and [the Love] went out of the ſource of the Father (and that was the Holy Ghoſt) in the Wonders: There ſtood the highly worthy heavenly Virgin (of the Wiſdome of God) in her higheſt Ornament, with her Garland of Pearles: there ſtood <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Ternario Sancto,</hi> of which the Spirit (in the Antients) hath ſpoken wonderfully; And here <hi>Adam</hi> was brought into Paradiſe againe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And now if wee will ſpeake of the Glorification of Chriſt, and of his body, which he viſibly (and in that forme in which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed upon Earth) aſcended withall; then wee muſt ſay, that as the Love of the Heart of God hath reconciled the Anger of the Father, and holdeth it as it were captive in it; ſo alſo the Holy Ternary hath comprehended the hard palpable body of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <note n="g" place="margin">The ruling property.</note> Kingdome of this world, as if it were wholly ſwallowed up, whereas it is not ſwallowed up, but the <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>working property.</hi>
                  </note> ſource of this world, is deſtroyed in Death,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57651:194"/>
and the holy Ternary hath put on the body of Chriſt; not as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but virtually [or powerfully] in the Eſſences, and he is as it were ſwallowed up (to our apprehenſion and ſight) and yet is really: and ſhall come againe at the Laſt Judgement-Day, and manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his own body which he had here, that all may ſee him, be they good or bad: and he ſhall alſo come in the ſame forme to keepe the Judgement of the Separation; for in his Divine Glorified forme, wee cannot behold him before wee be Glorified, eſpecially the wicked. But thus all Generations ſhall ſee and know him, and the unbeleeving ſhall weep and wayle, that they went ſo out of their fleſh and bloud into another ſource [or condition], when they ſhould and might in their own Eſſences have put on God, and yet did put on the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fierceneſſe of the Anger of God, with the Devils; and let the ſame into the Eſſences of their ſoules, and cauſed themſelves to periſh.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Therefore wee ſay, that in the ſoule of Chriſt, in its Eſſences, the cleere Deity <hi>(viz.</hi> the Light of God is comprehended, which hath quenched the Anger in the ſource of the ſoule: and thus that Light <note n="i" place="margin">Glorifieth or brightneth.</note> clarifieth the ſoule, and (though the proceeding vertue) the Tincture is alwayes generated out of the ſoule, and the Fiat in the Eſſences maketh it comprehenſible and palpable; and that is the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius Sanctus,</hi> or the Holy Earth, that is, the holy fleſh, for God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth in this body, all in all.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thus his earthly body is ſwallowed up in God, though indeed he never had ſuch an earthly body as wee have, for he was not of the Seede of a Man; but wee ſpeake onely of the comprehenſibility and viſibility of it to our eyes, according to which he is our Brother: and he ſhall appeare at the Laſt Judgement-Day in our fleſhly forme, in the power of God, as Lord over all, for all power in Heaven and in this world is ſubjected under him, and he is Judge over all, A Prince of Life, and Lord over Death.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And ſo the Kingdome of Heaven is his own body, and the whole Princely Throne of his Principle is Paradiſe, wherein the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fruit in the vertue of God ſpringeth up: for the Holy Ghoſt is the vertue [and power] of the fruit; as the Aire in this world is, ſo the Holy Ghoſt is the Aire and Spirit of the ſoule in Chriſt, and of all his children: for there is no other Aire in Heaven, in the body of Chriſt; and God the Father is All in All. Thus wee live and are (in Chriſt) all in the Father, &amp; there is no ſoule that ſearcheth out to the depth; but wee live all in ſingleneſſe of heart and in great humility and love one towards another, and rejoyce one with another, as children doe before their Parents: and to this end God created us.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Thus my deare <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>friend.</hi>
                  </note> ſoule, ſeeke Chriſt and incline thy ſelfe to him, and ſo thou ſhalt receive the Holy Ghoſt, who will new regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57651:194"/>
thy ſoule, and enlighten, drive, and leade thee; and he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale [and manifeſt] Chriſt to thee: Leave off all opinions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions; for the Kingdome of God is neere thee; and thou art kept out from God onely by thy own unbeliefe, by thy evill works <hi>(viz.)</hi> by thy pride, covetouſneſſe, envy, anger, and falſhood: for thou clotheſt thy ſelfe with them, &amp; ſo thou art in the Devils cloaths, without God.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But if thou leaveſt them off, and paſſeſt with the deſire of thy heart into the Mercy of God, then thou goeſt into Heaven, into God the Father, and thou walkeſt in the body of Chriſt in the pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Holy Ghoſt goeth forth out of thy ſoule, and leadeth thee into all truth: and the old corrupt Man doth but hang to thee, which thou ſhalt deſtroy in Death: and with thy Love in Chriſt, ſtill, overcome, and captivate the Anger of the Father in thy ſoule: and thou ſhalt ſpring up with thy New Man through Death, and appeare in the ſame at the Laſt Judgement Day.</p>

When wee conſider with our ſelves, the many Sects, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in Religion, and from whence they come and take their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall: it is as cleere as the Sunne, and it manifeſteth it ſelfe indeed, and in truth: for there are great Warres and Inſurrections ſtirred up for the cauſe of [Religion or] Faith: and there ariſeth great hatred and envy about it, and they perſecute one another for opinions ſakes; becauſe another is not of his opinion, he ſticks not to ſay, he is of the Devill; and this is yet the greateſt Miſery of all, that this is done by the Learned in the high Schooles [or Univerſities] of this world.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And I will ſhew (thee ſimple Man) their venome and poyſon: for behold every one among the Layety looketh upon them, and thinketh, Sure it muſt needs be right if our <note n="m" place="margin">Miniſter, Paſtour, Preacher, or Teacher.</note> Prieſt ſay it: he is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God: he ſitteth in Gods ſtead, it is the Holy Ghoſt that ſpeaketh out of him. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>Trie the Spirits:</hi> for every ones Teaching is not to be beleeved: and Chriſt ſaith; <hi>By their works thou ſhalt know them: for a good Tree bringeth forth good fruit, and an evill tree bringeth forth evill fruit;</hi> alſo he teacheth us plainly that we ſhould not gainſay the Propheſie that is of God, but we ſhould learne to try them by their fruits.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Wee ſpeake not of perfect Works done by the body, which is captivated in the Spirit of this World; but [wee ſpeake] of their Doctrines, that wee [muſt] trie them, whether they be generated of God. For if that Spirit teacheth blaſphemies, ſlanders, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then it is not from God, but it proceedeth from the covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and haughtineſſe of the Devill. For Chriſt teacheth us meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to walk in brotherly Love: wherewith wee may overcome
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57651:195"/>
the enemy, and take away the Might of the Devill, and deſtroy his Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But when any fall to fireing, killing with the ſword, to undoe people, ruine Townes and Countreys, there is no Chriſt, but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Father, and it is the Devill that bloweth the <note n="n" place="margin">Or, <hi>the Cole.</hi>
                  </note> fire. For the Kingdome of Chriſt is not found in ſuch a way, but in Power; as the Examples of the Apoſtles of Chriſt declare, who taught no revenge, but they ſuffered perſecution, and prayed to God, who gave them ſignes, and great Wonders, ſo that people flocked to them: and ſo the Church of Chriſt grew mightily, ſo that it overſhadowed the Earth. Now who is the Deſtroyer of this Church? Open thy eyes wide and behold: it is Day-light, and it muſt come to the Light, for God would have it ſo, for the ſake of the Lilly. It is the Pride of the Learned.</p>
               <p n="17">17. When the Holy Ghoſt ſpake in the Saints with power and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and converted people powerfully, then they flocked to them, they honoured them greatly, they reſpected them, and ſubmitted to them as if they had been Gods. Now this was well done to the Saints, for the honour was given to God, and ſo humility and love grew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and there was all loving Reverence, as becometh the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and as it ought to be.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But when the Saints compriſed their Doctrine in Writings, that therby in their abſence it might be underſtood what they taught; then the World fell upon it, and every one deſired to be ſuch a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and thought the Art, skill, and knowledge ſtuck in the Letter: thither they came running, old and new, who for the moſt part onely ſtuck in the Old Man, and had no knowledge of God: and ſo taught according to their own conceits, from the written words: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them according to their own meanings.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And when they ſaw that great reſpect and honour was given to the Teachers, they fell to ambition, pride, and greedineſſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: for the ſimple people brought them preſents or gifts, and they thought that the Holy Ghoſt dwelt in the Teachers, whereas the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of Pride lodged in them: and it came to that paſſe, that every one called himſelfe after his Maſters name [whoſe Doctrine he prized moſt] one would be of <hi>Paul;</hi> another of <hi>Apollo;</hi> another of <hi>Peter;</hi> and ſo forth And becauſe the Saints uſed not the ſame kinde of words and expreſſions in their Teaching and Writings (though they ſpake from one and the ſame Spirit) therefore the Naturall Man (which being without the Spirit of God, knoweth nothing of God) began all manner of ſtrife and Diſputations, and to make Sects and Schiſmes: and they ſet themſelves up for Teachers among all ſorts of People: not for Gods ſake, but for temporall honour, riches, and pleaſure ſake, that they might live brave lives. For it was no very hard labour and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57651:195"/>
worke, to hang to the bare Letter: and ſuch ſtrife and contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe amongſt them, that they became the moſt bitter enemies and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters one of another: and none of them were borne of God: but their Parents held them cloſe to the Scripture, that they might come to be Teachers, that ſo they might be honoured in and for their children, and that their children <note n="o" place="margin">Might have good mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or great Livings for their Beasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Man.</note> might live bravely.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And ſo it fell out, that every one would get the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of people he could, that he might be eſteemed by moſt people; and theſe Lip-Chriſtians did ſo multiply; that the ſincere hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to God was left, and they onely looked upon the Lip-Prieſts, who did nothing but cauſe ſtrife and contentions; and they all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poured and boaſted of their own Art and skill which they had learned in the Schooles and Univerſities: and cryed, loe here is Chriſt, come running hither, thus and thus hath <hi>Paul</hi> written; and another ſaith, come hither, here is Chriſt, thus and thus hath <hi>Peter</hi> written, he was the Diſciple of Chriſt? and had the keyes of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, this cannot be amiſſe: they doe but deceive you, follow after mee.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Thus the poore ignorant people looked upon the <note n="p" place="margin">Such as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly Teach the words of Holy Men, without the underſtanding they bad.</note> Mouth-Apes, thoſe greedy covetous Men, which were no other than <note n="q" place="margin">Mock Prieſts, Monſters of Prieſts, or Prieſts in a Play.</note> vizard-Prieſts: and ſo loſt their deare <hi>Immanuel;</hi> for Chriſt in them (from whence the Holy Ghoſt goeth forth, which driveth and leadeth Men, and who at firſt had begotten them with power and Miracles) muſt now be nothing but a Hiſtory, and they became but Hiſtory-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; yet ſo long as the Apoſtles and their true Diſciples lived, they ſtopped and reproved ſuch things, and ſhewed them the right way; but where <note n="r" place="margin">The Apoſtles and their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> they were not, there the Hiſtory Prieſts miſ-led them, as may be cleerly ſeene in the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. And ſo the Kingdome of Chriſt grew not in Power onely; but for the moſt part in the Hiſtory; the Saints borne in Chriſt, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that many times with great Wonders [or Miracles] and the Hiſtory-Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> they alwayes built upon thoſe [Miracles of the Saints], ſame that which was good for the promoting vertue and good manners: many brought forth thiſtles and thornes, that they might make ſtrife and warres: many ſought onely great honour, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and glory, that it ſhould be conferred upon the Church of Chriſt and her Miniſters, as it may be ſeene in Popery, out of what Roote it is growne: And it came ſo farre, that they mingled the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Ceremonies in their Doings, as if the Juſtification of a poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner didlye in them, becauſe they were of Divine appointment; for which cauſe, the Apoſtles held the Firſt Councell at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the Holy Ghoſt concluded, that they ſhould onely cleave to Chriſt in true Love one to another, and that was the onely Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>

                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:57651:196"/>
23. But it availed not, Pride would erect its Throne, and ſet it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Chriſt, the Devill would be God: and they made <note n="ſ" place="margin">Faire ſuttle pretences and Expoſitions of Scripture.</note> Gloſſes, that they might bring it to paſſe in ſuch a way, that the ſimple people might not take notice of it; there the Keys of <hi>Peter</hi> muſt govern the Citie, and they drew together with the Keys, <note n="t" place="margin">Jus Divinum.</note> Divine Authority to them, and ſo could uſe the Divine Power in deeds and wonders no more: for they deſired to be rich and wealthy upon Earth, and not to be Poore with Chriſt, who in this world (as himſelfe witneſſeth) had not whereon to lay his head; they would not be ſuch Chriſtians in power and wonders: As <hi>Adam,</hi> who would not live in the Power, but in a great Heape [of Earth], that he might have ſomething to take hold of. And heere may be rightly ſeene our Miſery which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> brought us into, that our Eſſences alwayes reach after the Spirit of this world, and deſire onely to fill themſelves with a great Heape, from whence <hi>Adam,</hi> and wee all, have gotten ſuch a ſwelled groſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward body, full of ſickneſſes, contrariety, and contentious deſires.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Now when the Hiſtoricall Chriſtendome, and the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians grew together, the Scepter was alwayes among the Learned, who exalted themſelves, and made themſelves potent, and great, and the ſimple [Church] yeelded to it as right: and yet there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after the Kingdome of God found in Men, <hi>v. z.</hi> the Noble Word of God (which had <note n="u" place="margin">Imaged or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured it ſelfe in the minde.</note> imprinted it ſelfe in the Promiſe [in Paradiſe] in the Light of Life, and which was made ſtirring by Chriſt) that drave them indeed to the feare of God. And then they built great <note n="x" place="margin">Temples or Churches.</note> Houſes of Stone, and called every one thither, and they ſaid that the Holy Ghoſt was powerfull there, and they muſt come thither: <note n="y" place="margin">Saying, doe as wee ſay, and not as we doe.</note> beſides, they durſt be ſo impudent to ſay (when they were found to be ſo wicked and malitious) that the Holy Ghoſt was powerfully in the mouth of the wicked.</p>
               <p n="25">25. But thou Hypocrite, thou lyeſt: if thou art ungodly, thou canſt not raiſe <note n="z" place="margin">The dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes.</note> the Dead, thou canſt convert none, that in this world lyeth drowned in finnes; thou mayeſt ſtirre the heart of the Beleever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (through thy voyce,) which is a work of the Spirit; but thou bringeſt forth none out of Death [into life]; it is an impoſſible thing. For if thou wilt convert a poore ſinner (which is drowned in ſinne, and lyeth captive in the Anger), then the Holy Ghoſt muſt be in thy mouth, and thy Eſſences muſt take hold of his, and then thy Light will ſhine in him, and thou ſhalt raiſe him out of the Death of ſinnes, and with thy Love, in thy Tincture, catch him: and then he will come to thee with a hearty deſire, longing after the Kingdome of Heaven: and then thou art his Confeſſour, and haſt the Keys of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> and if thou art voyde of <note n="a" place="margin">The Holy Ghoſt.</note> that, thou haſt no Keyes.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. VVEE know Chriſt hath taught us, that a Judgement ſhal be kept: not onely for the Puniſhment of the deſpiſers of God, and for a reward to the good; but alſo for the ſake of the Creature, and of <note n="b" place="margin">The outward Nature.</note> Nature, that they may once be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from vanity: and wee know that the ſubſtance of this world and the property thereof muſt paſſe away, the Sunne and the Starres, and alſo the foure Elements, muſt paſſe away as to their ſource [or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty] and all muſt be reſtored againe, and then the life will ſpring forth through Death, and the figure of every thing ſhall ſtand Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally before God, for which end it was created: alſo wee know that our ſoules are immortall, generated out of the Eternall Band; and when this world paſſeth away, then alſo all its Eſſences paſſe away, which are generated out of it, and the <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>the ground of the Eſſences or ſubſtance.</hi>
                  </note> Tincture remaineth ſtill in the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore O Man! Conſider thy ſelfe here in this world, in which thou ſtandeſt in the Birth, thou art ſowne as a ſeede or Graine, and a Tree groweth out of thee; therefore now ſee in what <note n="d" place="margin">Field or ſoyle.</note> Ground thou ſtandeſt, that thou mayeſt be found to be Timber for the great building of God in his Love, and not for a threſhold [or footſtoole] to be troden under-feete, or that is fit for nothing but for the fire, whereof nothing will remaine but duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is ſaid to thee, that the wood [or fewell] of thy ſoule ſhall burne in the Laſt Fire, and that thy ſoule ſhall remaine to be aſhes in the fire, and thy body ſhall appeare like black ſoote; why wilt thou
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57651:198"/>
then ſtand in a wilderneſſe, yea in a Rock where there is no water? How then will thy Tree grow againe? O! what great miſery it is that wee are ignorant in what <note n="e" place="margin">Ground or field.</note> ſoyle wee grow, and what kinde of <note n="f" place="margin">Sap, juice, or ſubſtance.</note> Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wee draw to us, ſeeing our fruit ſhall appeare and be taſted: and that which is pleaſant ſhall ſtand upon Gods Table; and the other ſhall be caſt to the Devils ſwine. Therefore let it move you, to looke that you grow in the Ground or ſoyle of Chriſt, and bring forth fruit, that may be ſet upon Gods Table, which fruit never periſheth but continually ſpringeth, and the more it is eaten of, the pleaſanter it is, how wilt thou rejoyce in the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Laſt Judgement is appointed for that end: and as wee know that all things [in this world] have had a beginning, ſo they ſhall alſo have an end: for before the Time of this world, there was nothing, but the Band of Eternity, which maketh it ſelfe, and in the Band the Spirit, and the Spirit in God, who is the higheſt Good, which was alwayes from Eternity, and never had any beginning; but this world hath had a beginning from the Eternall Band in the Time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For this world maketh a Time, therefore it muſt periſh: and as it hath been Nothing, ſo it will be Nothing againe; for the Spirit moveth in the <note n="g" place="margin">Or, <hi>upholder.</hi>
                  </note> Ether; And therein the <note n="*" place="margin">The ſevde.</note> 
                  <hi>Limbus</hi> (which is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible) is generated, from whence all things proceed: and yet there was no <note n="*" place="margin">The ſevde.</note> faſhioner, but the Spirit (or the <note n="*" place="margin">The ſevde.</note> Vulcan) in the Eſſences, and ſo alſo there were no Eſſences, they were generated in the will of the Spirit, and in that will is the <note n="h" place="margin">Framer, moulder, or former.</note> faſhioner which hath faſhioned all things out of nothing, but meerly out of the will.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Seeing then it is faſhioned out of the Eternall will, therefore it is Eternall; not in ſubſtance but in the will, and after the breaking of the ſubſtance, this world ſtandeth wholly and altogether (like a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure) in the will for [a <note n="i" place="margin">Figure or Picture.</note> Glaſſe of] Gods works of Wonder. And ſo wee know now, that where there is a will, it muſt comprehend it ſelfe ſo that it be a will, and that comprehenſion maketh an attraction, and that which is attracted is in the will, and it is thicker than the will, and is the darkneſſe of the will, and a ſource in the darkneſſe: for the will deſtreth to be free, and yet cannot be free, except it goe againe in it ſelfe out of the Darkneſſe, and if it doe, then the Darkneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in the firſt will, and there conceived will remaineth in it ſelfe in the <note n="k" place="margin">Liberty or freedome.</note> Light.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thus wee give you to underſtand, that this world (when the will was moved), was created out of the Darkneſſe, and the out-going out of the will in it ſelfe, is God: and the out-going out of God, is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which hath diſcovered it ſelfe in the dark will, and that which was diſcovered were the Eſſences, and the <note n="l" place="margin">Or, <hi>the ſtriker of fire, which ſtriketh up the thoughts of the minde.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Vulcanus</hi> was the wheele of the Minde, that divided it ſelfe into ſeven Formes.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:57651:198"/>
8. And as is mentioned before, theſe ſeven Formes divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againe every one in it ſelfe into infinite many formes, according to the <note n="m" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſparkling.</hi>
                  </note> diſcovery of the Spirit, and therein ſtandeth the Eſſence of all Eſſences, and it is all a great wonder: and our whole Teaching doth but aime at this, that wee, Men, might enter into the Light ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonders: for at the end of this Time all ſhall be manifeſted, and every thing ſhall ſtand in that wherein it is growne: and then when that ſubſtance (which at preſent it poſſeſſeth and bringeth forth) periſheth, then it is all an Eternity.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Therefore let every one have a care, how he uſeth his Reaſon, that he may therewith ſtand in great honour in the wonders of God. Wee know that this world ſhall periſh in the Fire; it ſhall be no fire of ſtraw or wood, (that would turne no ſtones to aſhes, and further, to nothing) neither will there any fire gather together, into which this world ſhall be throwne; but the fire of Nature kindleth it ſelfe in all things, and will melt or diſſolve the body of every thing (or whatſoever is palpable), and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urne it to nothing.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For as all in the Fiat was held and created according to the [will of the] <note n="n" place="margin">Framer, or Artificer.</note> faſhioner (which was the ſole and totall work-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in all things, in the ſeven Spirits of Nature, which brake nothing when he faſhioned it, nor threw one [part] from the other when he had made it, but every thing ſeperated it ſelfe, and ſtood in the ſource of its own Eſſences) ſo there ſhall not need much bluſtering, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightening, and breaking, (as this world in <hi>Babell</hi> teacheth) but every thing <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>paſſeth away.</hi>
                  </note> periſheth in it ſelfe: the ſource [or flowing forth] of the Elements ceaſe, as a Man when he dyeth [ceaſeth from work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing], and all paſſeth into its Ether [or receptacle].</p>
               <p n="11">11. And at the Time (before this Fabrick [of Heaven and Earth] periſheth and paſſeth into its Ether) cometh the Judge of the Living and the Dead; there all men muſt ſee him in his, and in their fleſh; and all the Dead muſt riſe through his voyce, and ſtand before him; and there the Angelicall world ſhall be manifeſted. And all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Earth (which are not comprehended in the body of Chriſt) ſhall howle; and then they ſhall be ſeperated into two flocks: and the Sentence of Chriſt paſſeth over all, both good and bad; and there will be howling, trembling, yelling, roaring, and curſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Children curſing their Parents: and wiſhing that they had never been borne.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Thus one of the wicked curſeth the other, who hath cauſed him to commit ſuch wickedneſſe: the Inferiour his Superiour that hath given him offence, [and been a ſtumbling block to him]: the Layety curſe the Clergy, or <note n="p" place="margin">Miniſters or Teachers.</note> Prieſts, who have given them evill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and ſeduced them with falſe Doctrine: the wicked Curſer, ſwearer, and blaſphemer, biteth and knaweth his Tongue, which hath
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57651:199"/>
ſo murthered him, the Minde beateth the Head againſt the ſtones: and the ungodly hide themſelves in the caves and holes of the Earth, before the Terrour of the LORD: for there is great quaking and ſtirring in the Eſſences of the Anger and fierce wrath of the LORD: and the Anguiſh breaketh the heart; and yet there is no dying; for the Anger is ſtirring, and the life of the ungodly floweth up in the Anger. There the ungodly curſe the Heaven and the Earth that did beare him, as alſo the Conſtellation [or Starres] that lead him; and the houre of his <note n="q" place="margin">Nativity.</note> Birth: all his uncleanneſſe ſtand before his eyes, and he ſeeth the cauſe of his horrour, and condemneth himſelfe: he cannot looke upon the Righteous for very ſhame: all his works ſtand in his minde, and (in the Eſſences), cry woe to him, that did them, they accuſe him: the teares of thoſe he hath afflicted and oppreſſed, are like a fiery ſtinging Serpent; he deſireth <note n="r" place="margin">Abſtinence.</note> Reſt or eaſe, but there is no comfort, deſpaire riſeth up in him, for Hell terrifieth him.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Alſo the Devils tremble at the Kindling of the Wrath, whoſe faces appeare before the eyes of the ungodly: for they ſee the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall world before them, and the Helliſh Fire in them: and they ſee how every life burneth, and every one in its own ſource, in its own Fire. The Angelicall world burneth in Triumph, in Joy, in the Light of the <note n="ſ" place="margin">Clarity, Luſter, or Brightneſſe.</note> Glory, and it ſhineth as the cleere Sunne (which neither De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, nor any of the wicked dare looke upon,) and there is Praiſe [and Halelujahs] that the Driver is overcome.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And there then the Judgement is ſet, and all Men (both the Living and the Dead) muſt ſtand there, every one in his own body: And the Angelicall Quire of the holy Men (who have been killed for the Witneſſe of Jeſus) is ſet: there ſtand the holy Patriarchs of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the holy Prophets, with their Doctrine: and all that they have taught is made manifeſt and revealed, and ſtandeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the wicked: they muſt give an account of all their murtherings of the Saints: for they that have been murthered for the Truths ſake, ſtand before the eyes of their murtherers, whoſe lives the murtherers muſt give an account for, and yet have no excuſe to make, but ſtand ſpeechleſſe; all his ſlandering reproaches which he hath caſt upon the Righteous, ſtand there before him <note n="t" place="margin">Really.</note> in ſubſtance, and is a ſubſtance, about which, the Law is there read to him.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Where is now thy Authority, thy honour, thy riches, thy pomp and bravery, thy power, wherewith thou haſt terrified the needy, and haſt made the Right bow and bend to thy will? Behold, it is all in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſtandeth before thee, the oppreſſed reade thy leſſon to thee, all that was rightly ſpoken [by thee] in this world, is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called againe: and thou abideſt (in thy unrighteouſneſſe) a lyar, and thou muſt be judged by thoſe that thou haſt here judged in falſhood: all lying and deceit, ſtand <note n="u" place="margin">Are really diſcovered in the Light.</note> manifeſt in the ſubſtance, all thy words
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57651:199"/>
ſtand in the Tincture in the ſubſtance of Eternity, before thee, and are thy Looking-Glaſſe: they will be thy Eternall knawing Whelps, and the Booke of thy Comfort and Truſt. Therefore doe but thinke what thou wilt doe, wilt thou not then curſe and judge thy ſelfe?</p>
               <p n="16">16. On the contrary the Righteous ſtand there in unſpeakable great Joy: and their Joy riſeth up in the ſource [or Well-ſpring] of the Holy Ghoſt; all their ſorrow and heavineſſe (which they have had heere) ſtandeth before them in ſubſtance, and it appeareth how they have ſuffered wrongfully: their comfort ſpringeth up in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath redeemed them out of ſo great miſery: all their ſinnes are waſhed, and appeare as white as ſnow; and there then they returne thanks to their Bridegroom, who hath redeemed them out of ſuch neceſſity and miſery, wherein they lay captive here; and there is meere hearty Joy that the <note n="x" place="margin">The evill, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or the Devill.</note> Driver is deſtroyed: all their good works, their teaching and well doing, appeare before them: all the words of their teaching and reproving (wherewith they have ſhewed the ungodly the right way) ſtand in the Figure.</p>
               <p n="17">17.

And they will anſwer; Lord, when have wee ſeene thee hungry, thirſty, naked, in priſon, or in miſery, and have ſerved thee. And he will ſay, what you have done to the leaſt of theſe my brethren, you have done that to mee. And to the wicked he will ſay: Away from mee yee curſed into the Eternall Fire: for I have been hungry, thirſty, naked, in priſon, and in miſery, and you have never miniſtred unto mee. And they will anſwer; Lord, when have wee ſeene thee ſo, and not miniſtred unto thee. And he will ſay; What you have not done to the leaſt of theſe my poore brethren, that you have not done to Mee; and they muſt depart from him.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And in that moment of departing, there <note n="z" place="margin">Periſheth.</note> paſſeth away Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, Sunne, Moone, Starres, and Elements, and thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, Time is no more.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And there then in the Saints, the incorruptible attracteth the corruptible into it ſelfe, and the Death, and this Earthly fleſh is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up: and wee all live in the great and holy Element of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, in God the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: and with this world, and with our Earthly Body, all knowledge and skill of this world periſheth: and wee live as children, and eate of the Paradificall fruit; for there is no terrour, feare, nor death any more: for the Principle of Hell, together with the Devils (in this laſt

Shall he therefore reject the whole crop, or burne it for the Thiſtles and Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells ſakes? No: but he threſheth it, and fanneth it, he ſevereth the weeds and droſſe from it, and uſeth the good ſeede for his foode, and giveth the chaſſe to his Cattle or Beaſts, and with the ſtraw he maketh <note n="f" place="margin">Or, <hi>dung for his Land.</hi>

And now though other ſeede be found among the wheate (when it is fanned and ſifted) that he cannot get out, ſhall he therefore not uſe his wheate for food? Every kinde of Graine hath its vertue, one ſtrengtheneth the heart, the other the ſtomack, another the other members of the Body: for one Eſſence alone ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no Tincture, but all the Eſſences together, make the ſenſes, [Thoughts] and underſtanding.</p>

               <p n="27">27. Thus I muſt tell you: the Heaven is a ſower, and God giveth him ſeede, and the Elements are the ground into which the ſeede is ſowen: now the Heaven hath the Conſtellation, and receiveth alſo the ſeede of God, and ſoweth all together one among another, now the Eſſences of the Starres receive the ſeede in the Ground, and qualifieth [or is united] with it, and carry themſelves along in the hearb, till a ſeede alſo be in the hearb.</p>

               <p n="29">29. Therefore my beloved Minde, looke what thou doeſt: and judge not ſo haſtily and unadviſedly, and do not turne Beaſt (becauſe of the multitude of Opinions,) to whom belongeth onely the Chaffe of the Noble ſeede. The Spirit of God ſheweth himſelfe in every one that ſeeketh him, yet according to the manner and kinde of his Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and yet the ſeede of God is ſowne along in the Eſſence; and if the ſeeker, ſeeketh in a Divine deſire, then he findeth the Pearle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Eſſences, and ſo the great Wonders of God are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted thereby.</p>

               <p n="31">31. The good ſmell in the hearb (which you ſhould now look for, in the many Opinions) is onely the New Regeneration (out of the old corrupted Adamicall mixt Man) in the body of Jeſus Chriſt, in the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a new Minde towards God in love and meekneſſe: which is not ſet upon pride, covetouſneſſe, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own honour, credit, and eſteeme, nor upon warre, or any manner of ſtirre or inſurrection of inferiours againſt their ſuperiours: but groweth in patience and meekneſſe, as a Graine of wheate among thornes, and bringeth forth fruit in its ſeaſon. And conſider, that where there is ſuch fruit [in thy minde] that is borne of God, and it is the Noble vertue in that [Man]: Goe out from the other fruit, which teacheth uproares and diſſention, between inferiours and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, for ſuch [fruits] are thiſtles, and will prick, and ſting [like Nettles], God will fanne his wheate himſelfe.</p>

Therefore let none thinke, that when ſtrife goeth on, and he getteth the upper hand, now it is well and right: and he that is under, and ſubdued, let him not thinke, ſure I am found to be in the wrong, I ſhould now goe to the other opinion or ſide, and help that party, to proſecute the other: no; that is not the way, ſuch a one is meerely in <hi>Babell.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.<seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe in our <note n="a" place="margin">The Aurora, and the Three Principles.</note> foregoing Writings, there are ſome words which the Reader may not perhaps apprehend, eſpecially where wee have written; that in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead, we ſhall be in the Body of Chriſt, in <hi>Ternario Sancto:</hi> where wee call the <hi>ſernarius ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> Holy Earth: which muſt not be underſtood of Earth, but of the holy Body out of the holy vertue [or power] of the Trinity of God:
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57651:202"/>
d that b y <hi>Ternarius ſanctus</hi> is properly underſtood in our writings the Gate of God the Father, from whence all things proceed as out of one onely ſubſtance: Therefore wee will inſtruct the Reader of the <note n="b" place="margin">The Three Principles.</note> Second Booke of our Writings a little more fundamentally, that he may not hang ſo to the bare letter, and make a Hiſtoricall matter of our Writings, but that he may obſerve the minde and ſpirit, what that [Spirit] meaneth, when it ſpeaketh of the Divine Life, and uſeth not alwayes the ſame words and names.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For if wee look into the Creation of God, wee finde very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things, which yet in the beginning proceeded out of one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fountaine: for wee finde evill and good, life and death, joy and ſorrow, love and hate, weeping and laughing: and wee finde that it all ſprung out of one onely ſubſtance, for that may very well be ſeene in all Creatures, eſpecialiy in Man, who is the ſimilitude of God, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> writeth, and the Light of Nature convinceth us. Therefore wee ought to conſider of the Threefold Life in Man, which is found ſo, alſo in the Gate of God the Father.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If wee conſider of the alteration how the minde is changed as it is, how ſuddenly joy is turned into ſorrow, and ſorrow into joy, then wee ought well to conſider from whence that taketh its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: For wee finde it all to be in one and the ſame minde; and if one forme [property or quality] riſeth and getteth above the other (there then preſently <note n="c" place="margin">Or, <hi>a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</hi>
               </note> ſomething followeth, ſo that the minde collecteth all its thoughts together, and ſendeth them to the Members of the Body, and ſo the hands, the feete, the mouth, and all goe to worke, and doe ſomething, according to the deſire of the minde) and then wee ſay that forme [or property that driveth the work] is predominant, qualifying and working above other formes, wherein yet all other formes of Naturelye yet hidden; and are ſubject to that one forme: And yet the minde is ſuch a wonderfull <note n="d" place="margin">Eſſence, or ſubſtance,</note> thing, that ſuddenly (out of one forme that is now predominant and working more than all other) it bringeth forth and raiſeth up another, and quencheth the [forme] that was kindled before, ſo that it becometh as it were a nothing, as may be ſeene in joy and ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now therefore when wee conſider whence all taketh its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, wee finde, eſpecially three formes, in the minde; wee ſpeak not heere of the Spirit of this world onely; for wee finde that our minde hath alſo a deſire [or longing] after another minde, and that it is anxious for that which the eyes of the body ſee not, and which the mouth taſteth not, and the feeling of the earthly body doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, neither doth the earthly eare heare it, nor the noſe ſmell it, which yet the Noble Minde can ſee, raſte, feele, perceive and heare, if the forme of the Divine Kingdome in that minde, he predominant or qualifieth more than the other two: there then inſtantly the other
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57651:203"/>
two are as it were haiſe dead and overcome, and the Divine [forme] riſeth up alone, and then it is in God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And wee ſee alſo how inſtantly the Minde raiſeth up another forme, and maketh it predominant <hi>(viz.</hi> the Spirit of this world) in covetouſneſſe, pride, in the oppreſſing of the needy, and lifting up it ſelfe onely, and ſo drawing all to it: whereupon then inſtantly alſo the third forme breaketh forth out of the Eternall [Indiſſoluble] Band; as falſhood, envy, anger and malice; ſo that the Image of God is as it were dead and overcome: where then the minde (in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) <note n="e" place="margin">Or, <hi>ſtandeth.</hi>
               </note> is in the Anger of God, in Death, in the Jawes of Hell, over which Hell in the Anger of God inſulteth; for hereby its Jawes are ſet wide open, and it becometh predominant: but when the Divine forme breaketh forth againe, then the Kingdome of Hell is overcome, and as it were dead, and the Kingdome of Heaven cometh to be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and working againe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To whom you yeeld your ſelves as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in obedience, his ſervants you are, (whether of ſinne unto Death, or of the obedience of God to righteouſneſſe)</hi> and that ſource or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wee have, and in that Kingdome wee live, and that Kingdome with the property thereof driveth us: ſeeing then heere in this life, all is in the ſowing and in the growing, therefore the harveſt alſo ſhall one day follow: where then the one Kingdome ſhall be ſeperated from the other.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For there are in the minde of Man Three Principles, all which Three in the Time [of this foure Elementary Life] he may open: but when the body is broken, then he liveth in one Principle onely, and then he hath loſt the Key, and can open no other Principle more, he muſt continue Eternally in that ſource [or quality] which he hath kindled heere. For wee know that <hi>Adam</hi> (with his going out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe into this world) brought us into Death; And Hell in the Anger of God groweth from Death, and ſo our ſoule is capable of [going into] the Kingdome of Hell, and ſtandeth in the Anger of God, where the Jawes of Hell then ſtand wide open againſt us, continually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure us, and wee have [made] a Covenant with Death, and wholly yeelded our ſelves up to it, in the ſting of the Anger, in the firſt Principle.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Wee not onely know this, but wee know alſo, that God hath regenerated us in the life of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt to a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to live in him. And as he is entered into Death, and againe through Death into Eternall Life, ſo muſt wee enter into the Death of Chriſt, and in the life of Jeſus Chriſt, goe forth out of Death, and live in God his Father: and then our life and alſo our fleſh is no more earthly, but holy in the power of God, and wee live rightly in <hi>Terna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio Sancto,</hi> in the Holy Trinity of the Deity. For then wee beare the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57651:203"/>
holy fleſh (which is out of the holy Element in the preſence of God) which our loving Brother and Saviour, or <hi>Immanuel,</hi> hath brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our fleſh: and he hath brought us in and with himſelfe out of Death into God his Father, and then the Holy Trinity of the Deity is ſubſtantially [or really] working in us.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And as the Eternall Word in the Father, is become true Man, and hath the Eternall Light ſhining in him, and hath humbled [and abaſed] himſelfe in the Humanity, and hath put upon the Image which wee heere beare in this Life, the Image [which is] out of the pure unſpotted Element in the preſence of God, (which wee l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> which ſtandeth in the Mercy of God), as is cleerly mentioned in our ſecond Booke with all the Circumſtances of it: ſo muſt wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo put on to us that Image [which is] out of the pure Element, out of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and live in that bodily ſubſtance, and in that ſource [condition] and vertue wherein he diveth.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Wee doe not heere meane his Creature, that wee muſt enter into that, but wee underſtand, his ſource, for the depth and breadth of his life in his ſource is unmeaſurable: and as God his Father is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable, ſo alſo is the Life of Chriſt ſo: for the pure Element in the ſource of God the Father in his <note n="f" place="margin">Barmhertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igkeit; <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe.</hi>
               </note> Mercy, is the Body of Chriſt: and as our Earthly Body ſtandeth in the foure Elements, ſo the new Man ſtandeth in a pure Element, out of which this world with the foure Elements is generated: and the ſource of the pure Element, is the ſource of the Heaven, and of Paradiſe, and ſo alſo it is [the ſource] of our Body in the New Regeneration.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Now that Element is in the whole Principle of God every where, in all places, and ſo is unmeaſurable and infinite, and therein is the Body of Chriſt and his quality; and in that is the Trinity of the Deity: ſo that the Father dwelleth in the Sonne, <hi>(viz.</hi> in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,) and the Sonne in the Father, as one onely God, and thus the Holy Ghoſt goeth forth from the Father in the Sonne, and is given to us, to regenerate us to a new life in God, in the life of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Earthly Man (in his Image and ſource [or quality and property]) hangeth but to us in this [Life] time, [which is] well underſtood, if wee be borne of God with our Minde.</p>
            <p n="12">12. For as God the Father in his own ſubſtance, comprehendeth all the Three Principles, and is himſelfe the ſubſtance of all ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein both joy and ſorrow is comprehended, and yet goeth forth in it ſelfe, out of the ſource of the Anguiſh, and maketh the Kingdome of Joy to himſelfe, unconceivable to the ſorrow, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to the ſource of his Anger in the Anguiſh, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth to himſelfe his Heart in the Love, wherein the Name of God taketh originall. So alſo the Minde hath in it all the Three Principles, and therein the ſoule is comprized, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Band of Life: <note n="g" place="margin">The ſoule.</note> which
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:57651:204"/>
muſt enter againe into its ſelfe, and create a will in the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, and endeavour after it, deſiring it with a ſtrong will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and not ſtay meerly in the Hiſtory, or in the knowledge of it, and being able to ſpeake of it, and ſuppoſe the words and diſcourſe make a ſufficient Chriſtian, when the Minde is ſtill in meere doubt in <hi>Babell:</hi> no: that is not the Regeneration, but it muſt be an Earneſt Reſolution: the Minde muſt in it ſelfe goe forth into the humility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and enter into the will of God, in Righteouſneſſe, Truth, and Love.</p>
            <p n="13">13. And though indeed the Minde is not able to doe this in its own abilitie (becauſe it is captivated with the Spirit of this world) yet it hath the Purpoſe in its power, and God is preſented with [and in] the Purpoſe, and receiveth it in his Love, and ſoweth therein the ſeede of Love in his vertue [or power], out of which the New Man in the Life of Jeſus Chriſt groweth. Therefore all lyeth in the true Earneſt [Purpoſe], which is called True Repentance: for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Word of God in the obedience of Love, groweth not in the Earthly Life, but in the New borne, in the Life of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Therefore the Kingdome of Heaven is a beſtowed Bounty of Grace for all thoſe that earneſtly deſire it; not that it is enough to ſay to ones ſelfe; I have indeed a will to yeeld my ſelfe earneſtly to God, but I have need to have this world for a while, and afterwards I will enter into the obedience of God, and that continueth from one time to another, and from one day to another, and in the meane while the <note n="h" place="margin">Or, <hi>the childe of perdition.</hi>
               </note> evill Man groweth: if you deferre it to the end, and then deſire [and think] to be a Heavenly fruit or Birth, when all the Time of your life, you have growne in the anger of God, in the Abyſſe of Hell; no: that is deceit, thou deceiveſt thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Prieſts in <hi>Babell</hi> have after that, no Key to open the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven for thee: thou muſt enter in thy ſelfe, and be new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, or elſe there is no remedy for thee in this world, nor in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: thou ſtandeſt heere in this [life] time, in the Ground, and art a Plant, but when Death cometh, and cutteth downe the ſtock, then thou art no more in the growing, but art a fruit: and then if thou art not foode for God, thou doeſt not belong to his Table, and then God will not dwell in thee.</p>
            <p n="16">16. For wee know that the Deity onely, is the vertue to the New Birth, which [vertue] (if thou longeſt for it, and deſireſt it with earneſtneſſe) ſoweth it ſelfe in thy minde, and in thy ſoule, out of which the New Man in the Life of Chriſt groweth, ſo that in this world the Earthly [Man] doth but hang to it. Thus the New Man is in God in the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Old Man is in this world; of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth cleerly in his <note n="i" place="margin">Or, <hi>Epiſtle.</hi>

if wee thus live in the New Birth, wee live to God, but as to the old <hi>Adam</hi> wee are in this world: where then the ſource of the Eternall Band in the ſoule is alſo changed, and the ſoule entreth in it ſelfe into the Life of Chriſt, into the Holy and Pure Element: which in ſome places of my Second Booke I call the <hi>Ternarius Sanctus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. Not according to the underſtanding of the Latine Tongue, but according to the underſtanding of the Divine Nature; by which words is excellently expreſſed the Life of Jeſus Chriſt in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as alſo the Characters or Letters themſelves, and the Spirit in the ſyllables doe ſignifie: wherein the Birth [unigeniture, or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall working] of the Deity is excellently underſtood; though indeed it is hidden to the Hiſtoricall Man of the <note n="k" place="margin">Or, <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</hi>
               </note> Schoole of this world, yet it is wholly comprehenſible to thoſe that are enlightened from God, who then alſo underſtand the ſource [or working property] of the Spirit in the Letter, which is not at this time fit to be ſet downe here, and yet it ſhall be brought to the underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="18">18. And there is nothing more profitable for Man for his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the New Birth, than true earneſt ſincere Repentance, with great earneſt Purpoſe and Reſolution: for he muſt preſſe into the Kingdome of Heaven, into the Life of Chriſt, where then his Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratour is ready, deepe in his Minde, in the Light of Life, and with deſiring and earneſtneſſe helpeth [to wreſtle], and ſo ſoweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a Graine of Muſtard ſeede into the ſoule of Man, as a Roote to a New Creature. And if the earneſtneſſe in the ſoule of a Man be great, then the earneſtneſſe in his Regeneratour is alſo great.</p>
            <p n="19">19. And it is not poſſible to deſcribe the New Birth in Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for he that cometh into it, can finde it onely in himſelfe by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: there groweth another Bud in his Minde, another Man with other knowledge, he is taught of God: and he ſeeth that all the labour in the Hiſtory, without the Spirit of God, is but a confuſed work of <hi>Babell,</hi> from whence ſtrife and contention (in ſelfe Pride) cometh, for they aime onely at Pride and Advancement, to Recreate themſelves in the Luſts of the Fleſh, and in ſelfe. They are no Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards or Paſtours of Chriſt, but Miniſters or Servants of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, they have ſet themſelves upon Chriſts Throne; but they have erected it in this world.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Yet the Kingdome of Chriſt is not of this world, but conſiſteth in Power; and there is the true knowledge of God in no Man, except he be Regenerated in God, out of his corrupted houſe of ſinnes, where then the fierceneſſe changeth it ſelfe into Love, and he is a Prieſt of God in the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, who alwayes ſeeketh that which is in Heaven in the Wonders of God: and the New Man is hidden in the Old Man, and is not of this world, but he is in <hi>Ternario Sancto,</hi> in the holy Body of Jeſus Chriſt, underſtand, in the vertue of his Body.</p>

21. For ſuch alſo his Covenant with us is, both in the Baptiſme and the Laſt Supper. He tooke not the fleſh of his Creature and gave it to his Diſciples, but he tooke the Body of the Pure Element [that is] before God, wherein God dwelleth, which is preſent in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but compriſed in another Principle, and gave it to his Diſciples to eate and to drinke under Earthly Bread and Wine: ſo alſo he Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the Outward Man with Earthly Elementary Water, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward New Man he Baptiſeth with the Water in the holy pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Body and Spirit, which ſubſtance appeareth onely in the Second Principle, and is preſent every where, yet is hidden to the Third Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Spirit of this world.</p>
            <p n="22">22. For as wee know, that our Minde reacheth all over this world, and alſo into the Kingdome of Heaven to God: ſo alſo the Life of the Pure Element (wherein the Creature Chriſt, and our New Man in Chriſt ſtandeth) reacheth every where all over, and it is all over full of the fullneſſe of the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, but onely in the [One Pure Holy] Element, and not in the foure Elements, in the Spirit of the Starres.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Therefore there needeth not in our Writings much toyle nor hard conſideration or ſtudy, wee write out of another Principle, no Reader underſtandeth us rightly in the Ground, except his Minde be borne in God: there ought no Hiſtoricall skill and knowledge to be ſought for in our Writings: for as it is not poſſible to ſee God with earthly eyes, ſo alſo it is not poſſible that an unenlightened Minde in the Earthlineſſe can comprehend <note n="l" place="margin">The Ground of our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> it, Heavenly thoughts and meanings can comprehend <note n="l" place="margin">The Ground of our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> it, like muſt be comprehended by like.</p>

None ſhould thinke or deſire to finde the Lilly of the Heavenly Bud, with deepe ſearching and ſtudying; if he be not entered by earneſt Repentance into the New Birth, ſo that it be growne in himſelfe; for elſe it is but a Hiſtorie where his Minde never findeth the Ground, and yet it ſelfe ſuppoſeth it hath comprehended it, but his Minde maketh it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, <note n="n" place="margin">Of what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</note> what Spirits childe it is: for it is written; <hi>They are Taught of God.</hi>

Wee know that every Life is a fire that conſumeth, and muſt have ſomewhat to feede its conſuming, or elſe it goeth out: ſo alſo wee know that there is an Eternall Band of Life, where there is a matter whereon the Eternall fire feedeth continually, for the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fire maketh that matter for foode to it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="26">26. So alſo wee know that the Eternall Life, is twofold in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſource [quality or property] and each ſtandeth in its own fire:
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57651:205"/>
The one burneth in the fierceneſſe, and in the woe, and the matter thereof is Pride, Envy, and Anger, its ſource is like a Brimſtone Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for the riſing up of the Pride, in coverouſneſſe, envy, and anger, maketh together, a Brimſtone, wherein the fire burneth, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually kindleth it ſelfe with this <note n="o" place="margin">Materia, <hi>or Materiall.</hi>
               </note> matter: for it is a great Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherein the Mobility of the Life conſiſteth, as alſo the <note n="q" place="margin">Or, <hi>Vulcan.</hi>
               </note> Striker up of the fire <note place="margin">Like Gall.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="27">27. Now wee know alſo, that every fire hath a ſhining and Glance, and that Glance goeth in it ſelfe forth from the ſource [or quality], and enlighteneth the matter of the ſource, ſo that in the ſource there is a knowledge and underſtanding of a [thing or] ſubſtance, from whence a Minde and the Might, taketh its Originall, of doing and comprehending a will to ſomewhat, and yet was not there in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginality: and that will in it ſelfe in the ſource, goeth forth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a liberty for it ſelfe in the ſource, and the will deſireth the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that it might ſtand therein, and hath its life from the will in the Light, and in it ſelfe, in the habitation, liveth without ſource, and yet there it ſtandeth in the Originality in the Ground of the ſource.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Thus my Beloved, worthy ſeeking <note n="r" place="margin">Or, <hi>friend.</hi>
               </note> Minde, know and obſerve, that every Life ſtandeth upon the Abyſſe of the fierceneſſe: for God calleth himſelfe, <hi>A Conſuming fire,</hi> and alſo, <hi>A God of Love,</hi> and his Name GOD, hath its Originall in the Love, where he goeth forth out of the ſource in himſelfe, and maketh it, in himſelfe, Joy, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Wee all in the Originality of our Life, have the ſource of the Anger, and of the fierceneſſe, of elſe wee ſhould not be alive: but wee muſt looke to it, and in our ſelves goe forth out of the ſource of the fierceneſſe, with God, and Generate the Love in us, and then our Life ſhall be a joyfull and pleaſant habitation to us, and then it ſtandeth rightly in the Paradiſe of God. But if our Life ſtay in the fierceneſſe, <hi>(viz.</hi> in covetouſneſſe, envy, anger, and malice,) and goeth not forth into another will, then it ſtandeth in the Anguiſhing ſource, as all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills doe, wherein no one good thought or will can be, but a meere enmity in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Therefore theſe two Lives, <hi>viz.</hi> the Life in the Loving Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and the Life in the Originality of the ſource [or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty]; are one againſt another: and becauſe the Life in the Love, is not Enimicitious; therefore it muſt ſuffer it ſelfe to be pinched, pierced-through and wounded, and upon it the Croſſe is laid to be borne with Patience of Meekneſſe, and in this Bud, in this Ground, [ſoyle, or field] a childe of God muſt be a bearer of the Croſſe: and for this end hath God appointed in himſelfe, a Day of Judgement, and of Seperation, where then he will reape what is growne in every Life,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57651:206"/>
and herewith ſhall all formes of the Eternall Life be manifeſted, and all muſt ſtand to [the manifeſting of Gods Deeds of Wonder.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Therefore O Man! looke to it, deſtroy not thy ſelfe: ſee that thou grow in the Ground [or field] of Love, Meekneſſe, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and enter with thy Life in thy ſelfe, into the Meekneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, in the Regeneration to God, and then thou ſhalt live in Gods ſource of Love: and ſo when the field of this <note n="ſ" place="margin">Or, <hi>Bud.</hi>
               </note> ſprout is taken away, then thy Life is a fruit and Plant of God, and thou ſhalt ſpring and grow with a New Body out of the holy and pure Element before God, in the Life of thy deare Saviour and Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt; give up, [or dedicate] thy ſelfe to it (in this contentious Life) wholly and altogether, and ſo thou ſhalt, with him, through his Death and Reſurrection, grow up in a New Man before God.</p>
