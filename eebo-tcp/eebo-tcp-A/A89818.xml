            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The AUTHOR'S motive and deſigne in the preſent Work.</head>
            <p>ABout four or five years ſince, there came abroad a little Book in <hi>French,</hi> intituled, <hi>Nouueau Jugement, &amp;c. New Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on what hath been ſaid and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as well for, as againſt the Book of the curious Doctrine of the Great Witts of theſe times.</hi> At the end of this Book the Authour inſerted two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, very ſhort indeed, againſt <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil;</hi> to what end or upon what ground it is not much material here to diſpute; but in that of <hi>Virgil,</hi> he repreſents him as a moſt eminent Conjurer, and one that had done abundance of ſtrange and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Magick.</hi> This he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently remembred was taken <hi>verbatim</hi> out of the laſt Book publiſh'd by <hi>de Lancre</hi> againſt <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> whereupon reflecting on what he had read, and calling to mind that not only <hi>Virgil</hi> but in a manner all great perſons were in like manner charg'd with Magick, he imagin'd the charge might be unjuſt and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. This put him upon ſearch of the truth, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it an act of piety to right the memory of thoſe great men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>and an obligation put upon the world, to endeavour their ſatisfaction, who want either time or couveniences to informe themſelves, and ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to communicate, what he had found, in this APOLOGIE: whereof take this ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115273:6"/>
In the firſt place he aſſignes certain conditions or qualifications neceſſarily requiſite in him, that would judge of <hi>Authors,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> and <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monographers,</hi> who are the chief Architects of this Labyrinth of erroneous opinions, which who is once gotten into cannot well get out without this Clue. Then he divides Magick into ſeverall ſpecies, ſo to confront the charge and the Anſwer, which conſiſts in the diſtinction of Magick into <hi>Diabolicall</hi> and <hi>Naturall.</hi> That done, he comes to certain generall cauſes whence the ſuſpicion hath been deriv'd, <hi>viz. Politicks, extraordinary Learning, Mathematicks, Suppoſititious Books, ſuperſtitious Obſervations, Hereſy, Malice, Emulation, Ignorance, Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Readers, and want of circumſpection and Judgment in Writers.</hi> This is fully diſpatch'd in five Chapters, which are as it were a preludinm to XIV more, ſpent in the particular vindication of <hi>Zoroaſtes, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Democritus,</hi> and others, not proceeding ſo much according to the times wherein they flouriſh'd as their ſeverall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and employments. So that having run through the ſeverall vindications of <hi>Philoſophers, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, Religious men, Biſhops, Popes,</hi> all to be done was to cloſe up the treatiſe with a Chapter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the means whereby theſe Errours are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and what will be the conſequences of them if not ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>So much, as to the Authors deſigne in this work. That diſpatch'd, he thought fit to ſay ſomething to thoſe who might haply quarrell with him for his chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering it ſo much with ſentences and Authorities out of <hi>Latine</hi> Authors. There are indeed a many and thoſe the moſt refin'd Writers, who cannot, without a certain ſcorn and indignation, look on the writings
<pb facs="tcp:115273:6"/>
of ſuch, as, like them, will not employ themſelves ſo trivially as to compoſe <hi>Love Stories</hi> and <hi>Romances</hi> for the entertainment of women and Children. For thoſe his anſwer is, that as he quarrels not with them for uſing a Style proportionable to their capacities to whom they direct their Labours; ſo does he expect they ſhould be as favourable to him, for not tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Latine paſſages as ſuch as are not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly calculated for the meridian of the Populace, but ſome of a higher elevation, who meaſure not truth, by the credit of Historians and Demonogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that have almoſt beſotted the multitude with their extravagances. Theſe indeed are a ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo much oblig'd one to another, that ſhould we imitate them in the Labours we intend for posterity, we must do as the <hi>Rhodians</hi> did, who only chang'd the heads of ancients Statues to make them ſerve for new repreſentations, ſuch a ſtrange art have they of diſguiſing and diſme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers workes that, ſtrictly examined, there's nothing new but the Titles. For <hi>Citaions,</hi> he thought they only avoided them who never expected to be cited themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it were too great a preſumption in any one to think himſelf ſo well furniſht with concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as toſatisfie ſo great a diverſity of Readers without borrowing any. But if ever there were any ſuch, they were certainly <hi>Plutarch, Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Montagne,</hi> who yet have not bluſh'd to derive from others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they thought contributed to the embelliſhment of their diſcourſes. To prove this we need only mention the Greek and Latine verſes cited almost in every line of their workes, and particularly that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> conſisting but of ſeven or eight Leaves ſent by the former to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> wherein there are above <hi>150.</hi> verſes out of <hi>Homer,</hi> and near as many out
<pb facs="tcp:115273:7"/>
of <hi>Heſiod, Pindar, Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Euripides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is he ignorant what theſe regulators of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting might oppoſe againſt this, <hi>viz.</hi> the authority of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who in <hi>300</hi> Volumes left behind him, had not ſo much as one Citation; but this would make againſt them, by reaſon of the contrary conſequences of theſe two different procedures, for the workes of <hi>Plutarch, Seneca</hi> and <hi>Montagne,</hi> are daily read, ſold, and reprinted, whereas of thoſe of <hi>Epicurus, Laertius</hi> can hardly furniſh us with a Catalogue. Yet would he not have this ſo underſtood as to approve their courſe who conceale the treaſures of their own abilities to beg and borrow of others, never appearing but as people at falſe Musters, and, without any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to themſelves, carrying other mens Arms. Tedious and fruitleſſe diſcourſes are like Forrests of Cypreſſe trees, fair and flouriſhing to the eye, but bearing no fruit ſuitable thereto.</p>
            <p>The ſureſt way therefore were to keep the mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe extremities, which is for a man to make a certaine allyance between his own conceptions and thoſe of the ancient, when the ſubject will bear it. For as it belongs only to ſuch elevated and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Souls as have ſomething above the ordinary rate of men, to tranſmit their conceptions to us pure and naked, without any other convoy than that of Truth, and that it is the <hi>indicium</hi> of a low &amp; reptile mind to undertake nothing of it ſelf; ſo is it the proper chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a perſon unacquainted with vain glory and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to a conſiderable knowledge and experience of things to follow the track which the moſt learned &amp; best esteemed Authors have gone before him, and not ſo much endeavour to tickle the ears of his Readers, as to neglect what might ſatisfie their understanding.</p>
            <p>And this method hath our Author obſerv'd in this
<pb facs="tcp:115273:7"/>
APOLOGIE: which whoever ſhall examine without prejudice or paſſion, must certainly conclude it no ſmall performance, eſpecially if he conſider the difficulty of the undertaking, the many Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, the particularities he hath been forc'd to quote, and the novelty of the Subject, which, were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, were enough to oblige the more ingenious, to countenance and encourage</p>

the nobler part of man, the <hi>Mind,</hi> and the enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it with Sciences and Diſciplines, that ſo it might diſcover and practiſe what is moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous and reall therein, is particularly employed in the cenſure and judgement of Authours. This is ſo truly neceſſary, and of ſuch importance, that, being once well ordered, it ſo guides us into the interiour of the perſons we deal with, that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the calms or tempeſts of their paſſions, the <hi>Euripus</hi> of their ſeverall agitations, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diverſity of their inclinations. The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage we are to make of it, is like that of a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to diſtinguiſh truth from falſhood; of a Torch, to light us in the palpable darkneſſe of Errour, or we muſt look towards it, as our onely Pole-ſtar, regulating our courſe and diſcoveries of Truth. For ſince ſhe alwayes appears to us masked with the paſſions of thoſe, who either out of ignorance, or intereſt, endeavour to diſguiſe her, we muſt, to enter into familiarity with her, and to be abſolutely poſſeſſed of her, ſeek her out, as <hi>Palamedes</hi> did <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> or young <hi>Aristeus</hi> the Sea-god; in thoſe places where ſhe is hidden and be ſo importunate with her, that after ſhe lurked under the indiſcretion of the ignorant, the envie of the paſſionate, the extravagancies of the teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious, the blindneſſe of the intereſſed, and an infinite number of fabulous, ſtrange, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous opinions, ſhe may appear at laſt reſtored to her own former ſhape;</p>

To do this, we muſt ſhake off all the inſinuating titles, the Panegyricks, the manifeſt gratulations, which are ordinarily beſtowed on thoſe, who are the moſt able to diſguiſe her with the greateſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices and Palliations. For we ſhould be more tender of our liberty, than to be fooled out of it by the number of their ſuffrages, as if we were obliged, as a packed Jury, to approve whatever they are pleaſed to tell us, and had not the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a diligent diſquiſition and cenſure, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether it be juſt and rationall. To our diſcare, as to this point, may we juſtly attribute all the fables, impertinencies, and ſuperſtitions, that have to this day crept into the writings and imaginations of abundance of people, eſpecially that ſimple and ridiculous opinion of a many, who have thought the moſt eminent men that ever were, even to the higheſt Magiſtrates of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall State, Sorcerers and Magicians. But as this diſcare hath been extreamly prejudiciall to us, ſo muſt we endeavour to make it as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, and uſe it as <hi>Telephus</hi>'s ſpear, which only could cure the wounds it made; or as the Sun, who onely diſperſes thoſe clouds and miſts which were riſen in its abſence.</p>
               <p>This task is indeed too difficult and ſubtle to be indifferently accommodated to all perſons, and therefore <hi>Experience,</hi> which is onely acquired by Time, the <hi>Reflection</hi> men ought to make on what they have conceived, the carefull <hi>obſervation</hi> of the excellent ſayings, and prudent actions of others, and above all things, that <hi>Indifference</hi> which ſhould alwayes carry the light before us in this diſquiſition of Truth, give a certain diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to weak, inconſtant, and obſtinate minds,

from employing themſelves in this cenſure, whereof a riper age, and a well-ſettled conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, acquits it ſelf with better ſucceſſe, and leſſe difficulty. Nor can we but obſerve, that <hi>Eraſmus, Vives, Scaliger, Bodin, Montaigne, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Poſſevin,</hi> and many more, who reſerved this employment for their more ſerious ſtudies, have proved ſo fortunate in this kind, that we muſt needs (if with <hi>Seneca</hi> we acknowledge, that <hi>Bona mens nec emitur, nec commodatur)</hi> adde ſomething to it by their examples, and by the aſſiſtance of thoſe precepts, which may be generally given for the regulation and refining of the judgement: whereof,</p>
               <p>The firſt is, to be very well verſed in thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, who have been moſt excellent in this kind; as for inſtance, <hi>Seneca, Quintilian, Plutarch, Charron, Montaigne, Vives;</hi> as alſo in thoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and great Genius's of Hiſtory, <hi>Thucydides, Tacitus, Guicciardine, Comines,</hi> and <hi>Sleidan.</hi> Adde to this an acquaintance with thoſe who have been Authours of politicall and rationall <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> and all ſuch as are eminent for new diſcoveries and conceptions, ſuch as <hi>Cardan,</hi> and the great Chancellour of England, <hi>Verulam,</hi> in all their books.</p>
               <p>The ſecond requires the knowledge of <hi>Logick,</hi> to be able with more readineſſe and facility, to diſtinguiſh between true and falſe, ſimple and compound, neceſſity and contingence; which

does (as it were) open the way to</p>
               <p>The third and laſt, which is a certain familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the moſt profitable Sciences, and the moſt univerſall and generall account of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this World that may be had, which is to be gained, partly by our own induſtry, partly by the endeavours of thoſe who have gone before us, ſuch as may be thoſe of Hiſtorians. But in this the choice is of ſuch conſequence, that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too much circumſpection uſed, eſpecially in the preſent age, wherein ſelf-love does ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily triumph over the induſtry of men, to force upon the world the fruits of their ignorance.</p>

I therefore think it extreamly neceſſary, amidſt ſuch a multitude of Authours, to be curious in the choice and ſelection of thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the diligent reading
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115273:12"/>
whereof may convince us, that they have been furniſhed with all the conditions required in a perfect Hiſtorian, ſuch as was for the Engliſh, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydor Virgil;</hi> for the Germans, <hi>Rhenanus;</hi> and for the French, <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> and diſcard all the reſt, who (as the fore-mentioned) have not the mark of truth. But if we are deſirous to read them, let it be on the ſame conditions, as <hi>Seneca</hi> permitted his friend <hi>Lucilius; Nec te prohibuerim</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>aliquando iſta agere, ſed tunc cum voles nihil agere.</hi> For my part it ſhould be my cenſure, that they be all ſuppreſſed, or that, as anciently all under fourty years of age were forbidden the reading of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and the laſt chapter of the Prophet <hi>Eſdras,</hi> ſo they, whoſe judgements are not ſettled by the reading of good books, ſhould not be permitted to ſurfet on thoſe abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fruits of ignorance, whereof there is no end, but that of degenerating and baſtardizing the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thoſe that trouble themſelves with them, <hi>Nam qui omnes etiam ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But to avoid all theſe abſurdities, we are only to conſider the method &amp; deſigne of ſuch as enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us with theſe fine conceptions, and make an aſcent from one to another, till we come to diſcover the firſt advancer of them, and haply the only man from whom all the reſt derived them. For inſtance; It is out of all controverſie, that all our old <hi>Romances</hi> took their riſe from the <hi>Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of Biſhop <hi>Turpin;</hi> all the Stories of <hi>Pope Ioan,</hi> from one <hi>Marianus Scotus;</hi> the Salvation of <hi>Trajan,</hi> from one <hi>John Levit;</hi> the opinion of <hi>Virgill's</hi> being a Magician, from <hi>Helimnndus</hi> the <hi>Monk.</hi> This man once found out, we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently conſider his quality, the party he inclin'd to, and the time wherein he firſt writ; and thence bethink our ſelves, whether we ought not to give greater credit to thoſe who have had the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagment of Affairs, than to Monks and private men; to perſons of honour and worth, than to the dreggs of ignorance and the populace.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, we are to look on Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, (thoſe only who are perfectly Heroick excepted) as a fort of people ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repreſenting things truly and naturally, but ſhadowing and masking them according as they would have them appear, and ſuch as to gain their judgment a reputation, and to inſnare others therein; ſpare not either abilities or eloquence, Stretching, Amplifying, byaſſing and diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all things, as they think moſt proper to their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115273:14"/>
deſign. Hence it is that we find Heathens and Idolaters have ſpoken many things againſt the firſt Chriſtians, out of the averſion they had to the Religion; that the adherents of ſome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours broach'd many indignities againſt the Popes; that the Engliſh repreſented the Mayd of <hi>Orleans</hi> as a witch and Sorcereſſe; and that modern Heretiques have vented ſo many fables againſt the dignity of the Church, and the main Pillars of it.</p>
               <p>In the Third place, we are to make that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Books which <hi>Paterculus</hi> made of Learned men, experience teaching us, that in a manner, all Hiſtories within ſeven or eight hundred years paſt are ſo hydropically ſwoln with lying legends, that a man would think the Authors of them had made it their main ſtrife, who ſhould advance the greateſt number, From theſe ſeverall conditions requiſite to the cenſure of Hiſtorians, it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd that theywill ſignifie little as to the direction of thoſe dull &amp; earthly ſouls, which are repreſented to us in the Aegyptian <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> by the <hi>Ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalus,</hi> a Creature that ſtirres not from the ſame place, that is to ſay, ſuch as are not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any thing beyond the limits of their own Country, who read no Hiſtories, who trouble not themſelves, with any thing done elſewhere, and who are unletterr'd and ignorant to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that when they hear ſome great perſon nam'd, they think the diſcourſe is about ſome African monſter or ſomething of the new world.

From theſe four different wayes, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer four kinds of Magick: <hi>Divine,</hi> relating to the firſt; <hi>Theurgick,</hi> to the ſecond; <hi>Geotick,</hi> to the third; and <hi>Naturall,</hi> to the laſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that ſacred and divine Magick, which being abſolutely happy and accompliſhed, exceeds our forces, and wholly depends on that Spirit, <hi>qui qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Pliny,</hi> not underſtanding it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns; as alſo another, which he cals by the name of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Magick, that is, that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who being in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> did, in the preſence of the Pro-Conſul <hi>Sergius,</hi> make <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer loſe his ſight. But this kind never diſcovered it ſelf with ſo much luſtre and miracle, as in thoſe two tranſcendent actions, the alliance of God with man, made at ſeverall times, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> who confirmed it onely by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Magick.

                  </gap>ad learned in the ſchool of men, he by the practice

of this, delivered the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian bondage, and made himſelf a Generall of 600000 men, whom he and his Succeſſours go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned according to the Laws he had received from God with thunder and lightening. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> wrought wonders with ſo much eaſe, that both Jews and Gentiles, not able to comprehend whence that power was derived, which yet was no other than that of his Divinity, imagined all done by a wicked and Diabolicall Magick. Thence it came they were ſo impudent (as <note n="d" place="margin">In <hi>13.</hi> Ezech.</note> S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerve) that they publiſhed certain books under the title of, <hi>Magia Jeſu Chriſti ad Petrum &amp; Paulum Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los.</hi> But the ſaid Doctors prove them clearly ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, in that having ſeen and read them, they found them fraught with ſtories quite diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the actions of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> who left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind him in writing, nor called <hi>Paul</hi> to the Apoſtleſhip till after his Aſcenſion: beſides that, he could not by his Magick have made the Prophets ſay what they had foretold both of his Deity and Coming.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Theurgick,</hi> or <hi>White Magick,</hi> which upon the account of Religion, enjoyns faſting and abſtinences, piety, purity, candour, and integrity of life, that the Soul deſirous of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the ſuperiour Deities, may not be in any thing diverted by its polluted and ſinfull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Corpus quod corrumpitur, aggravat animam,</hi> and ſuffers not a man to make uſe of that ſtrictneſſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, which is abſolutely neceſſary in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration; which, me thinks, <hi>Scaliger</hi> too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally commends, if ſo be what he ſayes in his third

It were therefore much more to our purpoſe, and the advantage of Religion, to beſtow ſome time in refuting what <hi>Picus,</hi> in his Apologie, <hi>Crinitus,</hi> and the reſt affirm, that this wicked and unlawfull Magick was ſo predominant all over Aegypt, that people reſorted thither from all parts of theworld, as if it had been ſome Academy or Lycaeum, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſet up for the propagation of this Idolatry.

                  </note> Biſhop <hi>Mirandulanus</hi> obſerves, that, this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick having been ſo much in vogue, neither <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor any Philoſopher of his rate, took any paines to leave us the leaſt account of it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the former, who having obſerv'd what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was conformable to reaſon in his Books, could not have forgot himſelf ſo far, as to paſſe over the effects of this admirable doctrin, in that little Book wherein he hath, with ſo much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, layd up together whatever he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd that were ſecret, and ſurpaſſing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of Nature.</p>
               <p>It is therefore no hard conjecture, to think that theſe tranſcendent Sciences, this rare doctrin, theſe admirable diſciplines amounted to no more than the practice of our fourth and laſt kind of <hi>Magick,</hi> called <hi>Naturall.</hi> To diſcover and unmask which, we are to remember that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115273:27"/>
the Vulgar as the Mechanicks are, which cannot ſo much command admiration, becauſe, being exerciſ'd about manifeſt and palpable Bodies, it is a manner impoſſible that the Authors thereof ſhould keep up the ſecret of their ſeverall canſes and operations. And this leads us to a neceſſity of acknowledging that the practice of the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and, above all, of theſe Mechanicks, and judiciary Aſtrology, hath contributed much to the confirmation of all theſe erroneous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as we ſhall ſhew more at large elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

               <p>AMong all the Precepts which contribute any thing to the regulation and conduct of our Actions, me thinks there is not any more ſerious or of greater conſequence then that which minds us, that, <hi>Venena non dantur niſi mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le circumlita, &amp; vitia non decipiunt niſi ſub ſpecie Virtutum.</hi> Of this we have daily experience, in that as Coyners of falſe mony employ all their induſtry ſo to diſpoſe ſome little Gold or Silver upon bad pieces that they may paſſe for good and current; ſo the greateſt part of thoſe who by reaſon of the lightneſs and vanity of their Doctrine fall into the generall contempt, are forc'd to change Scenes, to diſguiſe, and if they are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, for example, to take the title of Divines; if Impoſtors, of Chymiſts, if Mounte-banks, of

Doctors; if Sophiſters, of Philoſophers; if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers, of Well-wiſhers to the Mathematicks.

Magicians. For, in the firſt place, we have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge or account of theſe books, than what we find in certain Catalogues, who furniſh us with their titles in ſuch a manner, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge, unleſſe by ſome other circumſtances, what the Authours drift and deſigne was in the compoſition of them, whether to illuſtrate or confute, plead for or againſt, mantain or condemn the ſubject they treat of, and buſie themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Whence it came to paſſe, that many find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by theſe Catalogues, that <hi>Alexander Aphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeus</hi> had written of Magicall Arts, <hi>Aquinas</hi> of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary Aſtrologie, and <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> of Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancie, have preſently entered into imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contrary to what they ſhould, beleeving that they contain'd nothing elſe, but the precepts and direction we are to follow, to be perfect in the practice of all thoſe Divinations, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there was much reaſon, why the Authors ſhould be accounted Magicians.</p>
               <p>But this conſequence is vain, light, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; for beſides the firſt errour, we may obſerve a ſecond, which, becauſe not ſo obvious, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded a many, even to this day, who held that there needed no more to qualifie any one, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter or Magician, than to write of Magick: which once granted, we muſt alſo infer, that all thoſe who undertake to write againſt, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, ſhould be bemir'd with the ſame vice, and accordingly incur the ſame puniſhment. For it muſt be ſuppoſed, that they cannot diſcover the abſurdity of their precepts and maximes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they underſtand and declare them to us, which if they do, they become equally guilty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the good or bad intention of the one and

the other, doth not make any alteration in the caſe, relating onely to the nature of Precepts, which ſhould have no more force taken out of <hi>Picatrix</hi> than <hi>Delrio,</hi> if he hath once explan'd them, nor of the prohibited Authours, than thoſe who refute them. Nay, we muſt preſſe further, and affirm, that all thoſe who are able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe pertinently of Magick, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd as Magicians, were there no other reaſon than that it is in their power, as much as theirs who did it before, to furniſh us with books and precepts, which if they do not, it is either becauſe they think it not convenient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or out of ſome other motive, without any prejudice to their learning.

of the principall cauſes of this falſe accuſation, obliges us now to ſay ſomething of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> its adverſe party, and ſhew, how prodeminant it was, as well among the Greeks before <hi>Socrates,</hi> who may be called the Patriarch of Philoſophy, as the <hi>Latines,</hi> from the times of <hi>Boetius, Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and <hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> till the laſt taking of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> Then indeed the world began to put on another face, the Heavens to move upon new Hypotheſes, the Aire to be better known as to Meteors, the Sea to be more open and eaſie, the Earth to acknowledge a Siſter Hemiſphere, men to enter into greater correſpondences by Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Arts to be delivered of thoſe miraculous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Guns and Printing.

               <p>Not indeed is it any thing extraordinary, when they are commonly accounted Magicians that can produce Roſes and Summer-Flowers in the depth of Winter. That thoſe gallant men, who have been ſeen like ſo many Stars ſhining in that dark and Melancholy night, and have darted the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of their miraculous Learning, in the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and froſtieſt ſeaſon of Letters, have paſſ'd to us under the ſame Title, through the over eaſy belief of thoſe who firſt miſtook, then repreſented them for ſuch.

               <p>And now we have but a ſtep to the fourth cauſe of ſuſpicion which faſtens on theſe great perſons, that is, from <hi>Ignorance</hi> to that of <hi>Credulity,</hi> which eaſily admits abundance of ſuch things, as though improbable and ſuperſtitious, ordinarily fall and follow one in the neck of another. To make this more evident and apprehenſible, we muſt begin with what we find related in a little Treatiſe, which St. <hi>Agobart</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> made in the year of Chriſt 833, againſt the extravagance of the people then, who beleev'd that thoſe could trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the air, and raiſe tempeſts, who, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the firſt chapter of the Capitularies of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonaire,</hi> are called, <hi>Tempeſtarii, ſive immiſſores Tempeſtatum.</hi> It was, it ſeems, the common, and, by a many, ſtiffely maintain'd opinion, that there were in his time certain Conjurers, that had the power to make it hail and thunder, or to raiſe tempeſts, as often and when they pleaſ'd, ſo to ſpoil and deſtroy the fruits of the earth; which ſo deſtroy'd, they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſold to certain Inhabitants of the Countrey of <hi>Magodia,</hi> who every year brought ſhips tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the air, to carry away thoſe proviſions. This was grown into ſuch a vulgar article of faith, that the good Biſhop had much ado one day, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver three men and a woman out of the clutches of the diſtracted multitude, who were dragging them to execution, as having fallen out of thoſe ſhips. The ſame Authour relates further in the ſame book, that there being a generall mortality <note place="margin">Life of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne.</hi>

               <p>To the vanity of theſe Romances we are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obliged for all the falſe relations which were ſoon after ſcattered among the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous ſtratagems of <hi>Sylveſter, Gregory, Michael Scotus, Roger Bacon, Peter d' Apono, Thebit,</hi> and in a manner, all the moſt learned of that time. Theſe proved excellent entertainments, till the year 1425, when an infinity of other ſuperſtitions began to ſwarm, giving (as it were) a ceſſation to the precedent. And theſe we have thought fit to particularize, to ſhew it is no miracle, if the great knowledge of a many of that time occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned millions of ridiculous ſtories and fictions, when the zeal and good life of the greateſt Saints, &amp; the conduct &amp; courage of the greateſt Captains and Commanders have met with the ſame fate. Nor does it amount to much, that ſome of their books have been condemn'd as conjuring books, when a many others, whereof the very reading ſufficiently clears their innocence, have met with as little favour.

               <p>But ſince we muſt try what we can pick out of theſe proofs, we may anſwer, to the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is not any one can aſſure us that this laughing of <hi>Zoroaſtes</hi> happened preciſely on the day of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, whether when he was aſleep or awake, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the percuſſion of the Aire, or only an agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his lips all which one ſhould know to judge aright of it.

The only way then, me thinks, to diſengage Truth out of all theſe maskes and diſguiſes, is, to take as ſtrict and near a view of them as may be, and, when we come to the weight and tryall of them, never to admit that prejudicate opinion, which often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to chooſe and preferre ſhadows before bodies, darkneſſe before Light, and the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-regular fables before certain and authentick Hiſtories.

               <p>But, in the mean time, there's no reaſon to admit for truth the wantonizing conjectures of this Writer upon the relation there is between the Magicians and the Orpheoreleſtae, ſince they proceed rather from an ambition in him to ſtart out ſome new obſervation upon ſo thread-bare a ſubject, then that he gave the extravagance any credit. To cure him of it, and to cleare up the buſineſſe from the bottom, we muſt remember, that, according to all the beſt Authors, the Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanalian <hi>Orgia</hi> or Dionyſiacks were firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>Orpheus</hi> in his own Country, <hi>Thracia;</hi> ordaining that they ſhould be celebrated by the Women when they were in their <hi>terms,</hi> meerly to ſeparate them for that time from the company their Husbands, to avoid the accidents which might happen if they ſhould conceive in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

For, not to quarrell with the little account or knowledge we have of the Compoſer of them (ſince <hi>Genebrard</hi> aſſures us, that there is not any one book left of all thoſe old Authours, and firſt Divines, ſuch as <hi>Orpheus, Linus, Muſaeus, Phenias,</hi> and <hi>Ariſteus Proconeſienſis,</hi> grounding his opinion haply on the authority of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who fathers theſe Hymnes upon one called <hi>Cecrops,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Franciſcus Picus, Selden,</hi> and <hi>Eugubinus,</hi> who ingenuouſly acknowledge that their Authour is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us) we may ſhew in two words, that theſe Hymnes contain not any thing that ſhould bring them into the leaſt ſuſpicion of Magick; whether they be conſidered literally, or in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall interpretations of their allegoricall and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe.</p>
               <p>For to ſhew that there is no ſuch danger as to the former, we need onely reflect on the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of this firſt planter of Theologie, who, to ſubdue and refine the ſpirits of a rough and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage people, took the moſt effectuall courſe that could be thought upon, to bring about his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, which was to poſſeſſe them with a fear and veneration of certain Divinities. Theſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf celebrates in his Hymnes, as well to bring them into reputation by his example, as to leave his Succeſſours a certain Modell (as it were) of thoſe obſervations and ceremonies which ought to be practiz'd, to keep up the honour and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Sacrifices, whereof there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115273:57"/>
many kinds. For as the ceremonies of Chriſtianity, at the preſent, are not much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one from another, becauſe they relate to the ſervice of one onely Almighty God; So thoſe, of the falſe Religion of the Ancients, could not but be very contrary and diſcordant, by reaſon of the infinite number of Gods, Idols and Images, which were to be ador'd with Sacrifices peculiar to every one of them; <hi>Cum ex hoc Divorum nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>

Adde to this, his appearance with a golden thigh at the Olympick games; as alſo, that he cauſed himſelf to be ſaluted by the river <hi>Neſſus;</hi> that he ſtay'd the flight of an Eagle, tam'd a Bear, kill'd a Serpent, drove away an Oxe that ſpoil'd a field of Beans, by the meer vertue of certain words. He was ſeen on the ſame day, at the ſame hour, in the City of <hi>Crotona</hi> and that of <hi>Metapont,</hi> and foretold things to come with ſo much certainty, that many think him call'd <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> becauſe he gave as certain &amp; as inſallible anſwers, as the <hi>Pythian</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.

               <p>The proofs deduced from this Philoſophers forbidding the eating of Beans, and the courſe he took to convert them into blood, may refuted with as much eaſe as the precedent, ſince <hi>Rheuclin</hi> juſtly laught at all thoſe impertinencies, which ſome hollow and diſlocated brains have forg'd upon this prohibition, ſuch as might be that of <hi>Hermippus</hi> in <hi>Laertius,</hi> who thought <hi>Pythagoras</hi> would rather have ſuffered death at the entrance into a field of Beans, than paſſe thorow it to avoid his enemies. But the reaſon of the prohibition, was certainly no other than the firſt giuen by M. <hi>Moreau</hi> in the place before mentioned upon the <note place="margin">

either it is a pure Chimera and fiction (which I think the moſt probable) or that it was effected by the Subtlety of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who cauſ'd his geſtures and perſon to be acted by one of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or Companions, whom he ſent, in his name, to talke with ſome ſimple man or woman of either of thoſe two Cities.

               <p>But if we would ſhew how all theſe Authours
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115273:70"/>
are too prodigall of our leiſure and their own, when they take ſo much pains to hatch a ſort of ſtrange and hideous imaginations, and thereby captivate our belief, we need do no more than take a view of the firſt draught of this perſon, done not onely by <hi>Livie,</hi> and <hi>D. Halicarnaſſaeus,</hi> who drew the firſt lines of him, but particularly by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who hath clad him in his proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and all the circumſtances and particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his life, that we might thereby judge of the leaſt vices and vertues, as alſo the diſpoſition, cuſtom and proceedings of this great Politician, and ſecond Founder of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whence it will not be hard to reſolve, what credit we ſhould give all theſe after-draughts and copies of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, who have rather follow'd the Originall in their own fantaſtick imaginations, than that of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and the beſt Hiſtorians, who ſeem not to mention <hi>Numa,</hi> but out of a deſigne to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his vertues, and admire the excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, whereby he faſtened and eſtabliſhed the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Monarchy. For that, being looſe, and but newly ſet together, might eaſily have been ruin'd by the leaſt hoſtile violence, if <hi>Numa</hi> had not by a peace of three and fourty years, given it time to take root and growth, looking on the Romane people as a Champion that were to fight, having exerciſ'd it ſelf at leiſure, for the time he ſhould reign over it, would by that means prove ſtrong enough to oppoſe any that ſhould queſtion the limits of their Empire.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing he did, after he had poſſeſſed himſelf of the government, was to ſoften and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilize the City, converting their rough &amp; warlike humour into a gentle and tractable, remitting
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115273:71"/>
that height of courage and earneſtneſſe of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by Sacrifices, Feſtivals, Dances, and Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay ſometimes, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayes, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them the fear of the Gods. To this end did he make them beleeve, that he had ſtrange vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or had heard of great calamities, purpoſely to keep down their hearts in a dread of the Gods. To this may alſo be apply'd that paſſage of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> cited in the third Chapter of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> but much more pertinently that of <hi>Lactantius,</hi>

               <p>And that it is ſo, to begin with the opinion they had of the Nymph <hi>Aegeria; Plutarch</hi> having <note place="margin">Vit.

any image or Statue of him, which was obſerv'd for the ſpace of 70. years, and permitted not they ſhould do ſacrifice but with the powring out of wine, milk, and a litle flower, it is probable he had given reaſons at large in his Books of that new kind of worſhip.

               </p>
               <p>This in my judgment was the true cauſe of the condemnation of theſe books, and not that which <hi>le Loyer,</hi> and other modernes have endeavoured <note place="margin">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115273:74"/>
to the teſt which hath been held for true. And this I do after ſo many ages, as, by their long and various revolutions, are wont, as well in <hi>Civill</hi> Hiſtory as <hi>naturall,</hi> to dragge after them along traine of fables, and from time to time to give them new force and vigour by the multitude of thoſe who, out of meer reſpect to Antiquity, are enſnar'd by them.

This our deſigne leades us to maintain, by the examples of theſe three great Philoſophers or rather Daemons of knowledge, verſ'd in all Sciences, and the chiefeſt, and of greateſt Authority among their people, that is, <hi>Democritus, Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Apollonius.</hi> Theſe have undergone ſuch a change and Metamorphoſis, by thoſe who make it their buſineſſe to write without minding that precept of <hi>Horace,</hi>

that beſides that they are delivered over to us all three for Sorcerers and enchanters, it is further believ'd, that <hi>Democritus</hi> was ſuch a foole as to put out his own eyes, after he had blown away his eſtate in a fruitleſſe ſearch of the Philoſophers ſtone; and that <hi>Empedocles,</hi> as an ambitious <hi>Deſperado,</hi> caſt himſelf into the burning furnaces of Mount <hi>Gibel.</hi>

their great Learning and Polymathy. And this muſt be the more probable, if we reflect on what hath been already ſaid of the Magick of the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians,</hi> and the travels of <hi>Orpheus, Zoroaſtes,</hi> and <note place="margin">Lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de vita Apollon. c. <hi>2.</hi>

To ſtrengthen this yet further, we may adde the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative authority of <hi>Laertius,</hi> who makes not the leaſt mention of the Magick of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and but one word by the way of that of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> not ſpecifying, contrary to his cuſtom, any thing he had done by the means of it, without bringing on the ſtage the common ſolution of this kind of argument.

               <p>But as to <hi>Democritus</hi> in particular, we may <note place="margin">

So that there is much more reaſon to believe that the ſoul of this Philoſopher, not only refin'd from its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions, but inrich'd with all ſorts of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, was the true Daemon of his carriage, than toimagine him entangled in the deluſions and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115273:85"/>
converſing with Hobgoblins, crediting them or following their directions, an imagination ſo abſurd that <hi>Plutarch</hi> thought himſelf concern'd to endeavour to weed it out of our belief. For in his Book upon <hi>Socrates</hi>'s <hi>Daemon</hi> he ſaies, that <hi>Socrates</hi> ſlighted not celeſtiall things, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> would have it believ'd at his condemnation, but that abundance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary apparitions, fables, and ſuperſtitions hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crept into the Philoſophy of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his diſciples, whereby it was become abſolutely ridiculous and contemptible, he endeavour'd to regulate it by prudence, to cleanſe it from all thoſe Stories, and not to believe any more then what he thought rationall.</p>
               <p>To this we may adde a generall <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> ſhining through all his actions, and that he had no other deſigne then to lead his neighbour in the paths of vertue, and thence perceive the little ground we have to conclude this <hi>Genius</hi> to have been a bad Daemon.

               <p>This foundation layd, there remaines only to reſolve three difficulties which may happen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>Daemon.</hi> The firſt is, why he never
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115273:85"/>
perſwaded him to do any thing, but only not to undertake ſomething, and to take heed and avoid it. To this it may be anſwered that <hi>Socrates</hi> needed it not, in as much as being naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to whatever were vertuous, his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar endeavour was, by a long habit, to arrive to that reſervedneſſe which the greateſt perſons, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their moſt violent paſſions, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their courage, either have or ought to have. This is true prudence, which regulates their conduct, and makes them do all things wiſely, <hi>quae ratio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero, Poetas, maxime<expan>

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is a proof taken from the Ecſtaſies which were ordinary to this perſon, whence ſome conclude they could not happen to him but by the means of a Daemon more powerfull then that of the perfection of his Soul. As if it were not more rationall, with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Marſilius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>13.</hi> de immort.</note> 
                  <hi>Ficinus,</hi> who repreſent <hi>Socrates</hi> as a man extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly melancholy, to imagine theſe ecſtaſies as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall in him as thoſe of <hi>Charles de Bouille,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <note place="margin">In Biblioth. lib. de Scrip torib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eccleſiaſt.</note> by <hi>Geſner</hi> and <hi>Trithemius.</hi> For Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may for a long time entertaine the Soul, in a deep meditation, and when the Spirits attend the ſoule to that place where it retreats as it were into its centre, to do it ſome ſervice there, the other parts are depriv'd of their influent heat, and ſeem not to have any ſpark of life, and this is properly what is called Ecſtaſie.</p>
               <p>The laſt depends upon the great number and certainty of the praedictions of this Philoſopher, whence is drawn the ſame inference as from the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115273:86"/>
precedent, as that <hi>Socrates</hi> was certainly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of that Daemon, which not content to have declar'd him the wiſeſt of all men, would needs add a further reſpect to him by the meanes of his Oracles and anſwers.

to attribute theſe predictions of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and the advice he gave his Friends, to ſome Divinity; it were more rationall to conceive, that, as he was abſolutely enclin'd to morall actions, ſo had he ſo particularly conſider'd all the accidents that happen to men, that any thing almoſt gave him ſome light to judge of and foreſee what was to come. Hence it alſo came that he was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the eighth wiſe-man of <hi>Greece,</hi> becauſe he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely reſign'd himſelf to the practice of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and vertuous Actions, not medling with the fruitleſſe ſpeculations of the Sciences; which, like mony, are ſometimes current, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cry'd down, one while ſtamp'd one way, another, another; but alwayes embaſ'd and very leight.

               <p>There are thoſe, who, to make <hi>Aristotle</hi> not

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115273:87"/>
qualities of places, and to their vapours and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, leaving nothing at all for the ſubſtances to do. And that there is not any diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them in his workes, is, not that he could not aſſert them without ſome Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that he durſt not openly refute them, not becauſe he would not contradict <hi>Plato,</hi> who had gaind much reputation by introducing them, but that he would avoid the cenſure of impiety by oppoſing the Lawes of his Country, &amp; the common opinion concerning Gods &amp; Oracles. However it be, we cannot conclude according to his doctrine, that they were any thing but dreames and <hi>Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's.</hi> For if there were any, they muſt be either <hi>Corporeall</hi> or <hi>incorporeall;</hi> to ſay they were incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall were to contradict what he ſayes in the 12. of his <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> that there is no Intelligence but is joyn'd to ſome body.

If they were corporeall, their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were either eternall or mortall; the former they cannot be, becauſe, in all his Phyſicks, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns but one only body of that nature, that is that of Heaven. If mortall, they were either ſimple or compound; if ſimple, what he ſayes in the firſt and ſecond Book, <hi>de Anima,</hi> that ſhe is never found in a ſimple Body, cannot any way ſtand with it; if the latter, they were conſequently corruptible, palpable, perceptible, and ſubject to a thouſand changes and alterations, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be admitted.</p>

Nor does it amount to much that he hath the word Daemon in ſeverall places of his Books, for then it muſt be conceiv'd he ſpeakes according to the opinion of the vulgar &amp; the Platonicks, as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exander &amp; Niphus</hi> affirme, upon the fift of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks,</hi> and the third, <hi>Of the generation of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> Chap. 14. Or haply he made uſe of that word ſpeaking of God, as is evident from that paſſage in the ſecond Book of his <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> where he ſayes, that the Demon is ſent to divers perſons of extraordinary Proſperities, not out of any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he bears them, but to make their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity the more remarkable; for certain it is that only God can ſend thoſe proſperities.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe proofs, me thinks there is one very pertinent may be had out of his Book <hi>Of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination by dreames,</hi> where to ſhew there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſupernaturall in them, he ſayes, <hi>Omnin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115273:90"/>
refutation of all may be ſaid of the Magick of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> taking the relations of an infinite number of Authours, who would fain perſwade us to things utterly impoſſible. But ſince it were vainly to ſquander time away, to lop off the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in ſtead of pulling up the roots, we muſt with that begin the ruine of all theſe fabulous narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſhew, that whatever the Platonicks have advanc'd, either of Daemons or Magick, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be prov'd by reaſon nor experience. For firſt, as to what they ſay, that Nature cannot afford two Extreams without ſome Medium, cementing and uniting them; and that Heaven and Earth are two Extreams, which can have no other Medium than theſe intellectuall powers; The <hi>Peripateticks</hi> anſwer, that they neither aſſigne the Medium, nor the Extreams right; for they ſhould have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd the firſt Mover, which is abſolutely immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, impaſſible, and immoveable, to things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary, and afterwards joyn them together by the celeſtiall Nature, which is naturally invariable and eternall, and yet potentially ſubject to muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſembling God in its intelligences, and things tranſitory in its motion. We may as eaſily anſwer what they ſay, that the ſoul of the World being diffuſ'd and diſperſ'd thorow the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe is not idle, but produces Animals in all its parts, and that thoſe generated in Fire and Air are properly theſe called Daemons. For, beſides that this univerſall Soul is formally denied by <hi>Merſennus</hi> in his book againſt Deiſts, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Part,</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 20.</note> never held, that an Animal that muſt uſe ſeverall Organs, can be produc'd and conſerv'd in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thoſe two Elements. And for their laſt reaſon, deriv'd from thoſe many effects, which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115273:91"/>

The firſt is, his interpretation of <hi>Sacroboſco</hi>'s book, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſenſe of Aſtrologers, Necroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Chiroſcopiſts. The ſecond, his citations of abundance of falſifi'd Authours, fraught with old wives tales and fooleries, ſuch as, for inſtance, that of <hi>Salomon, De umbris idaearum; Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, De vinculo ſpiritûs; De miniſterio naturae; De Hierarchiis Spirituum; Apollonius, De arte magicâ; Zoroastes, De Dominio quartarum octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae Spherae; Hippocrates, De ſtellarum aſpectibus ſecundum Lunam; Astafon, De Mineralibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellatis;</hi> and divers others of the ſame metall.

But with this misfortune, that it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible punctually to know the particulars of their Lives, and the time of their birth, (which certainly is as indiſcoverable) as that of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Aborigines,</hi> without beginning; or of thoſe, whom the Poets make to come down out of the Clouds, to avoid the blaſting of their Noble and generous actions by the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Originall. This nevertheleſſe is not ſo much to be attributed to any negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>Arabians</hi> to leave us ſome account thereof; as to the Barbariſme raigning among the Latines in their time who have troubled themſelves to tranſlate the Books which might have given us ſome knowledge and diſcoveries thereof, ſo little, that they have not ſo much as made a collection of the lives of the moſt learned men that were in eſteem even among themſelves.

Treatiſes out of it, wherein they diſcourſe at large of the Hereſies, blaſphemies, and abſurdities which may be obſerv'd therein, as alſo of the Magick which <hi>Alchindus</hi> endeavour'd to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Hence is it, that all the Daemonographers have taken occaſion to ſpeake of him, as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and pernicious Magician. And yet <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Picus,</hi> the miracle and aſtoniſhment of his age, ſayes expreſſely in his <hi>Apologie,</hi> that he knew but three men that had made the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of naturall and lawfull Magick, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chindus, Roger Bacon,</hi> and <hi>William Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to extract truth out of theſe ſo manifeſt contradictions, me thinks, when a man hath well conſidered, in <hi>Aimery, Wimpinal,</hi> and <hi>Francis Picus</hi> the maine grounds of that Book, there may two things be rationally ſaid of it. One, that it is extreamely ſuperſtitious, and full of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall propoſitions and directly oppoſite to the principles of Faith, as having bin writt by one that liv'd under the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and took a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to write without any reſpect to Chriſtian Religion, which he accounted falſe and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded. Whence it is no miracle, if he, <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenna, Algazel, Averroes,</hi> and all the Arabians have fallen into theſe abyſſes and precipies ſince they were not guided by that pole-Starre which conducts us now through theſe manifeſt errours and falſities. The other, that there is no ground <note place="margin">Diſquiſ. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> to make this Author a Magician, when <hi>Delrio</hi> is content to rank him only among the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; that he was ſo far from having ought to do with <hi>Theurgick</hi> or <hi>Geotick</hi> Magick, that on the contrary, he ſeems to have no other deſigne in his Books than to referre to <hi>Nature</hi> whatever
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115273:95"/>
was attributed to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Devils.</hi> In which opinion he hath been ſince ſeconded by <hi>Peter d' Apono,</hi> and <hi>Pompanatius,</hi> who, in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, imagin'd an abſolute dependance of things ſublunary upon the celeſtiall, and that the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deriv'd all their vertues and properties from the Latter, and every particular from the whole, by the meanes of certain corporeall rayes which paſſed from the leaſt even to the greateſt.

To which it may briefly be reply'd that this <hi>Geber</hi> King of the Indians was nothing to this we ſpeake of; and that that Book ought no more to be condemn'd as treating of Magick, than the Commentary of <hi>R.

               <p>But to take away all ſuſpition there may be of truth in this proof, it muſt be ſaid, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe and abſurd; ſince that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">In his Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. fol. <hi>118.</hi>

                  </note> was his ſervant a long time, and having made the firſt diſcovery of what is now objected to him, makes no mention of his Magick, or his invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and <hi>Wetterus,</hi> who having ſtayd twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven months with him, ſayes only, that, when he was drunk, he would threaten to bring in mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Devils, to ſhew what power he had over them, not to take any notice of what a many ſay of the familiar Daemon which was lock'd up
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115273:104"/>
within the pommell of his ſword. For, not to bring upon the ſtage the opinion of the Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts who maintaine, it was the ſecret of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſtone, it were more rationall to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that, if there were any thing within it, it was certainly two or three doſes of his <hi>Laudanum,</hi> which he never went without, becauſe he did ſtrange things with it, and uſ'd it as an univerſall medicine to cure all manner of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>It might here be ſaid that it ſignifies not much to have glean'd up theſe proofs to ſtrike <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s name out of the Catalogue of Magicians, when he himſelf, not content to have put Magick for one of the four pillars of Medicine, hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd further to acquaint us with the precepts and nature of it, and that, in all his Books and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> particularly in that <hi>de Philoſophiâ ſagaci,</hi> where he divides it into ſix ſpecies and different parts. The firſt treats of the ſignification of the ſignes happening beſides the order of Nature, as the Starr that appear'd to the wiſe men. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of the Metamorphoſes and tranſmutation of Bodies; the third, of the vertue of words and ſpeech; the fourth, of Annulets; the fift, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted images; and the laſt, of the Cabal, which he ſaid was to be uſ'd to do all thoſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actions which cannot be reduc'd to any of the other five parts. Such are theſe, to ripen fruits in an inſtant; to make one horſe travell further in a day, then another ſhall in a month; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe intelligibly with thoſe that are above 500. miles diſtance from us; and in a word, to do whatever ſeems, and ever hath been thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. But I extreamly wonder ſince he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the abſolute knowledg of all theſe kinds
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115273:104"/>
of Magick, why he never did any thing by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of them. For certainly it had been much more reputation to him, to confirme this new doctrine by ſome of his <hi>experiences,</hi> than to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ordinary track of <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> who break out into a torrent of common and popular eloquence to celebrate the miraculous power of their Druggs, and call themſelves <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Operators,</hi> as if they had the certain cure of all diſeaſes.</p>

               <p>Adde to this, that being <hi>Syndic,</hi> and <hi>Advocat Generall</hi> of the City of <hi>Metz,</hi> he directly oppoſ'd the proceedings of <hi>Nicolas Savini</hi> then <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> for the Faith in the ſaid City, who would have puniſh'd a poor Country woman as a Witch; and ſtickled ſo much in the buſineſſe that he got her releaſ'd, and the accuſers and witneſſes well fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; which ſhews he was not ſo ſuperſtitious as the greateſt part of thoſe who calumniate him.</p>
               <p>To make his charge high enough, it is further urg'd that the Divines of <hi>Lovaine</hi> paſſ'd a ſevere cenſure upon his Declaration againſt the Sciences; that <hi>John Catilinet,</hi> a Franciſcan declaim'd pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely againſt the explication he had made at <hi>Dola, de Verbo mirifico;</hi> that the Dominicans of the City of <hi>Metz</hi> writt againſt the propoſitions he had publiſh'd in defence of the opinion of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Stapulenſis,</hi> concerning the Monogamy of St. <hi>Anne.</hi> And yet not one of theſe cenſurers could take occaſion to make any remarkes upon the two firſt Books of his <hi>occult Philoſophy</hi> printed long before any of theſe pieces, at <hi>Paris, Antwerp,</hi> and other places, and every where with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge

and approbation of thoſe who had the management of ſuch affaires. But it may haply be conjectur'd that the Adverſaries will anſwer this laſt reaſon, by ſaying, that there is indeed no danger in thoſe Books, it being <hi>Agrippa's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to make that advantage of the curious Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Learning therein contained, as a gilt pill, to make the poiſon of the other to ſlide down more eaſily; imitating therein the ſubtlety of the Crocodile, which counterfeits the voice of a man, to devour him, or rather the ſtratageme of Satan transforming himſelf into an Angell of Light, or of ſome beautifull Creature, the more eaſily to deceive us.

               <p>For two reaſons have I brought in <hi>Savanorola</hi> and <hi>Merlin</hi> into the number of the great perſons, for whom I make this Apologie; one is, that they were the Prophets of their Countries, as they ſay <hi>Noſtradamus</hi> was of <hi>France, Lolhardus</hi> of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and <hi>Teleſphorus</hi> and the Abbot <hi>Joachim</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria.</hi> The other, that it is a kind of juſtice to make a true diſcovery of them, ſo to raiſe them from under thoſe heaps of calumnies, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver both them, and what we ſhould know of them. As to the famous <hi>Merlin,</hi> all Authours hitherto have thought him gotten by an <hi>Incubus,</hi> who was a little too familiar with a certain Kings daughter, then a Nun in a Monaſtery at <hi>Carmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> What credit can be expected for all the other ſtories of his life, when we muſt be leſſe prudent, and more credulous than <note n="z" place="margin">Lib. <hi>4.</hi> de origine &amp; geſtis Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannor.</note>

On the other ſide, to attribute to the Daemons a power to tranſport the ſeed from one place to another, without diminiſhing the generative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the principle which it contains, is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hath no reaſon at all to ſupport it, when even thoſe that have the inſtrument of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an over-great length, are not ſo able for the act, becauſe the conduit being ſo long, the ſeed cools, and the principle is weakened. And that it muſt be much more thus in the ſeed of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubi,</hi> is not to be queſtion'd, ſince that <hi>Witches, &amp; cottidianae iſtae,</hi> as they are called in <hi>Lipſius, genia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam libidinum victimae, infelices mulierculae,</hi> do all unanimouſly confeſſe in their depoſitions, that they find it extreamly cold, and receive it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either pleaſure or ſatisfaction, as having not thoſe ſpirits without which there cannot be any, nor indeed generation be effected. Further, as Gold being the moſt perfect of Metals, is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly of the moſt difficult production, ſo muſt it be thought, that man, the nobleſt of all Creatures, hath by the ſame reaſon a more difficult, a more perfect, and a more accompliſh'd generation than any other. Adde to this, that the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authority, which may be brought againſt this negative, out of <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6. is no more advantageous to our Adverſaries, than the great number of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences they endeavour to collect from <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Alexander, Romulus, Servius Tullius, Simon Magus, Geffrey</hi> Great-tooth, <hi>Balderus, Luther,</hi> the <hi>Huns,</hi> and <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> or the <hi>Corocoton</hi> of new <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Nefeſoglians</hi> of the Turks.

               <p>From this <hi>Merlin,</hi> ſo highly favour'd by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> we paſſe to Brother <hi>Hierom Savanorola,</hi> born in the City of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> a Friar of the Order of St. <hi>Dominick.</hi> This man knew ſo well how to husband his eloquence, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the candor and integrity of his life, that having gain'd extraordinary reputation among the people of <hi>Florence</hi> by his preaching, which did not only charm the moſt delicate ears of his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Rhetoricall expreſſions and figures, but alſo raiſed the hearts and affections of all ſorts of perſons, by his zeal and great devotion, he began by degrees to diſcover ſome ſymptoms of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ambition. This happen'd, when in the year, 1484, as he acknowledges himſelf, in the book he hath made upon his Prophecies, he intruded into matters of Policie, and cauſed himſelf to be called to the Councell then held at <hi>Florence</hi> for the ſetling of a popular Government, wherein he ſtirr'd up all the Citizens unanimouſly to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, propoſing to them four or five points of great conſequence much conducing thereunto, which he ſaid had been reveal'd to him by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, &amp; which accordingly they muſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115273:116"/>
obſerve, to make their State the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of thoſe of all <hi>Italy.</hi> Whereupon, though affairs were not carried on as he had imagin'd to himſelf, yet did he make it his buſineſſe to adde daily to the reputation he had gain'd among the people, teaching in his Sermons of the year 1489, upon explication of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> that the Church was threatened with an approaching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to ſucceed that of the little Kings and Tyrants of <hi>Italy,</hi> who were ſoon after to feel the revenging ſcourge for all their iniquities. This he could do ſo ſtrangely, by paſſages out of the Scripture, and the ſecurity he gave them of his own revelations, that after the roming of <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth into <hi>Italy,</hi> foretold by him two years before, it was generally expected he ſhould return again, upon no other ground than his affirmation of it. Nor indeed could they be convinc'd of the contrary, till the year 1498, wherein both <hi>Charles,</hi> and he who had favour'd him ſo much in his predictions, exchanged this life for a better; the former by a ſickneſſe that took him at <hi>Amboiſe;</hi> and <hi>Savanorola</hi> by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of fire, which, in the commotion that happened in the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> upon the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall to manifeſt the truth of his Prophecies, he ſuffered publikely, with two of his Brethren, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the fire with a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> who had offered to maintain the falſity of them, by ſuch a demonſtration and triall.</p>
               <p>But to this contributed not a little, the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not onely of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, and moſt of the Clergie, againſt whom he ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily rail'd in the Pulpit, but alſo of the principall Citizens of <hi>Florence,</hi> by reaſon of the execution,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115273:116"/>
which, by his advice, was done upon ſeven or eight of the nobleſtamongthem. So that having no other friends than the faction of <hi>Paul Anthony Soderin,</hi> who made his advantages of him, to keep up the popular State againſt <hi>Guy Anthony Veſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who would have ſetled a kind of an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie, they were not able to reſiſt the contrary party, which in the heat of the commotion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced open the gates of his Monaſtery to bring him to execution, ſo to quiet the City by the death of a man who kept them at a diſtance with the Pope, by reaſon of the novelty of his Doctrine, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch factions and parties amongſt them, as had they gone further, muſt needs have buried them in the ruine of their State and Seigneury.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that many Authours are of a direct contrary opinion to me, as who am inclin'd to aſſent to <hi>Paulus Jovius, Machiavel,</hi> and <hi>Cardan,</hi> who rank this Authour, if not among the moſt fortunate, yet among the moſt eminent and famous Politicians, as being one of thoſe Monks St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Qui Daemonum contra ſe pugnantium portenta fingunt, ut apud im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritos, &amp; vulgi homines miraculum ſui faciant.</hi> For one half of the book he hath writ upon his Prophecies, contains nothing but the conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had with the <hi>Devil,</hi> taking him for a <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</hi> But what indeed contributed much to his reputation, was the influence he had over two ſorts of perſons who favoured him very much. The former were certain Catholikes, as <hi>Johannes Picus,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus</hi> of <hi>Mirandula, de Benivenius, Marſilius Ficinus, Flaminius,</hi>

In ſo much that <hi>Benivenius</hi> a Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Prieſt put forth a Book of his <hi>miracles</hi> and <hi>Prophecyes;</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Picus</hi> was ſo paſſionate in his vindication, that he ſtick'd not, though a man very religious and a ſound Catholick, to derogate much from the Authority and power of the Pope, to ſhew that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth had no reaſon to forbid him the Pulpit, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him.</p>
               <p>The other ſort of people that had a great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for him, were of a different religion from the former, that is, <note n="a" place="margin">In elogiis. in part <hi>3.</hi> of his hiſtor. Library, anno, <hi>1598.</hi>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115273:120"/>
controverſy by what meanes the Authour could arrive to ſuch a certain knowledge of things to come. Some hold he got it by the practiſe of judiciall <hi>Astrology;</hi> others, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to him by the meanes of ſome familiar <hi>Daemon;</hi> and a third ſort, that he had no other aſſiſtance then that of the capacity of the humane Soul to foretell things to come. For, according <note place="margin">Cap. <hi>7.</hi> l. q. Metaph.</note> to the opinion of <hi>Avicenna,</hi> when ſhe is diſengag'd from the government of the body, ſhe ſuffers a certain paralyſis, and leaves it as it were buried in the maſſe of its terreſtriall Element, that ſo ſhe may be free to conſider what is at the greateſt diſtance from her. Then it is that ſhee ſees things to come as preſent, which ſhe could not have done while the exigencies of the body divert her from this contemplation. And this happens for the moſt part, when, being forc'd againſt her naturall motion by the violent agitation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly ſhe diſplayes and diſcovers what is moſt hidden in her, that is her divine and celeſtiall forces and faculties; ſo that there is nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her from exceeding her ordinary Limits, and arriving to the knowledge of things to come. Of this we have ſome experience in old men, who being in the utmoſt declination of their age, do often foretell what afterwards comes to paſſe; as if the ſoul, by a certain anticipation, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at Liberty. To ſtrengthen this laſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they adde that were ſome reaſon to charge Nature with a certaine diſcare of mankind if ſhe deny'd this perfection to man when we ſee the <note place="margin">Apud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plut.</note> birds call'd <gap reason="foreign">

the changes of ſeaſons, wind, raine, fair weather, tempeſts, and all this without any other inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than that of their naturall inſtinct.</p>
               <p>I have been more particular in this laſt cauſe, then in the other two, becauſe<hi> Nostradamus </hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes in his Epiſtle to the three Centuries dedicated to<hi> Henry </hi>the ſecond of<hi> France, that he uttered his predictions rather through a naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct attended by a Poeticall fury, then by any aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the rules of Poeſy, though he had reconcil'd them to aſtronomicall Calculations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince the truth &amp; reputation of that ſo My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious book cannot ſubſiſt but by one of theſe three reaſons, they certainly are to be blam'd for their over-credulity, who would ground the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Fortune-teller, upon cauſes, which if they had well examined them, they ſhould have found more falſe than any of his Centuries. And this it were the more eaſy to ſhew, in that, of all predictions and Prophecyes that ever came to our knowledge, we have not met with any more particular then thoſe of Noſtradamus, who preciſely markes out all the accidents and ſeverall Circumſtances, even to occurrences of litle or no concernment. Whence in the firſt place I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that he could not compoſe thoſe predictions by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> the Authors whereof having not left us any rules whereby we might attain the knowledge of thoſe particulars. For theſe are no more under the juridiction of that Art, by reaſon of the uncertain emergencies of their cauſes, then things purely free and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, ſuch as are the actions that depend meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on our will, and which in regard they have not any determinate truth or falſhood cannot be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115273:121"/>
known or foreſeen by the help of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſcience, till ſuch time as they are preſent. In the ſecond place, I inferre, that he could not have done it by any revelation from <hi>Daemons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe even they, conſider'd in their nature, have not any knowledge of theſe actions which are free &amp; depend purely on our will, as being not able to foreſee them either in their cauſes, or their effects. Not in the former, becauſe they are uncertaine while they remaine buried in the ſeveral motions of our mind, as being ſuch as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of to the <hi>Corinthians, None knows the things of man but the ſpirit of man that is in him:</hi> not in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as being ſuch as cannot be known till they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. So that if we allow his prophecies any foundation, it muſt be that of the third cauſe, grounded on the naturall capacity men ſometimes have to foretell things to come, which yet is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently refuted by <note n="a" place="margin">De divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat l. <hi>2.</hi>

                  <hi>Valeſius,</hi> who digg up the very corner ſtones of this erroneous opinion.</p>
               <p>To anſwer therefore, in few words, all thoſe reaſons alledged to confirme it, we are indeed to acknowledge, that Melancholy may, by reaſon of its qualities, make men more deſirous and capable of Sciences, more earneſt in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of cauſes, and more perſeverant in the deepeſt contemplations upon any ſubject; nay that it may cauſe certain motions in the ſoul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it makes ſooner diſcoveries of the reaſon it would find out. But we muſt deny that there can proceed from it this naturall Divination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is not in it either the cauſe, principles, or beginnings. Nor is it to be credited, that old men are more likely to foretel things then others,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115273:121"/>
unleſſe it be by way of <hi>Revelation,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, or the Pope <hi>Pius V.</hi> &amp; the Archbiſhop <hi>Angelo Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> Of theſe two laſt, the former knew by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <note place="margin">Comines. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>

And laſtly for the foreſight of certaine Creatures, <hi>Leonard Vair</hi> will tell us, that the geſture of their bodies does not portend any thing to come, but only what is preſent, that is, the humid influx of the Aire, which, by a naturall inſtinct, they feel in their bodies, aſſoon as it gathers together in the Element. And as to the Birds which ſhift Countries according to the ſeverall ſeaſons of the year, it is not ſo much out of any foreſight in them, of Spring, Winter, or Autume, as a certain knowledge of thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes according to the naturall alteration of their bodies, proceeding meerly from heat and cold, or ſome other quality unknown to us.</p>
               <p>This premiſ'd, I leave thoſe to judge who are not over-eaſily drawn in to embrace opinions without any reaſon or gronnd, what eſteem ſhould be had of theſe fine Centuries, which are ſo ambiguous, and contradictory, ſo obſcure and enigmaticall, that it were no miracle if among a thouſand tetraſticks, whereof every one ſpeakes commonly of five or ſix ſeverall things, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſuch as ordinarily happen, there comes in a Hemiſtick mentioning the taking of a Town in <hi>France,</hi> or the death of a Grandee in <hi>Italy,</hi> a plague in <hi>Spaine,</hi> a Monſter, a great fire, a victory, or ſomething of this nature, as if thoſe Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were extraordinary, and happen'd not at one time or other. And yet this is the main motive
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115273:122"/>
of that little hope there is to ſee theſe prophecyes veryfi'd as being ſuch as we cannot compare to any thing more fitly then to <hi>Therame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So may we ſay of this Authour, that his maine deſigne was ſo to write as to avoid a clear and intelligible ſenſe, that Poſterity might interpret his predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as they pleaſ'd. For though <hi>John Aime Chavigni,</hi> one that, of all others, hath fooliſhly trifled away his paines upon all kinds of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes hath ſhewn in his <hi>French Janus,</hi> that the greateſt part of <hi>Nostradamus</hi>'s predictions are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd near thirty years ſince; yet are they ſtill brought upon the ſtage when any thing remarkable falls out, as for Inſtance, thoſe that are ſcatter'd abroad upon the death of the Marſhall <hi>d' Ancre</hi> the great fortune of Monſieur <hi>de Luynes;</hi> and the firing of the Palace and the Bridges of <hi>Paris.</hi> And indeed, that there are not found ſome upon all occaſions, is only becauſe men will not be at the paines to ſearch them out, ſince they met with ſomething about that imaginary monſtrous fiſh which ſome years ſince was ſold up and down <hi>in effigie,</hi> and that the Author of a little book called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> or <hi>French Conſerver,</hi> ſayes very ingenuouſly, pag. 15. that <hi>Nostradamus</hi> had ſpoken of him, above thirty four years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was born, quoting him by his <hi>name</hi> and <hi>Armes</hi> in the 31. tetraſtick of the 6th. <hi>Century,</hi>

others, abſolutely falſe and fictious. To confirm this we have <hi>John Matthew de Luna,</hi> who living <note place="margin">L. de Rer. inventor. c. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> about 120 years ſince, held, though contrary to the opinion of <hi>Polydor Virgil, Magius, Mayerus, Pancirollus, Florence, Rivault, Zezoldus,</hi> and all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that writ of the invention of Fire-workes, that <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> firſt found out the uſe of Canon, Arquebuſe and Piſtol; For I could never find in theſe Authors any thing that came near this opinion ſave that ſuch inventions were put in practiſe in his time, and that by a Germane <hi>Monk</hi> call'd <hi>Berthold Schwartz,</hi> or by a certain <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> who, as <hi>Cornazanus,</hi> an Author ancient enough, conceives, liv'd in the City of <hi>Cullen,</hi> where it is certain that <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> liv'd, ever after he had taken the habit of a <hi>Dominican.</hi>

               <p>And this makes me not a litle wonder that the Alchymiſts ſhould never bethink them of holding this opinion, ſince they might have done it with much more reaſon, than attribute to him the knowledge of the Philoſophers ſtone, as hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done their great favourer and a better <hi>Majerus,</hi> who is not aſham'd, in his <hi>Symbols upon the golden table</hi> of the 12 Nations, to affirm, that St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> had it firſt, and that thoſe to whom he had left it, communicated it to <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> who by the advantages he made of it, diſcharg'd in leſſe then three years, all the debts of his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> and afterwards taught it St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> while he was his diſciple. To give this the greater Authority, he highly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates three Books of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to him, whereof ſince there is not any of them either among the collection of his works, or ſpecified in the Catalogue made of them by

                  <hi>Mirrour of Astrology,</hi> where is treated of the approved and forbidden Authors that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of that Art.

               <p>To clear <hi>Albertus</hi> from all ſuſpicion of Magick upon the account of this Book, I can produce no better teſtimony than that of J. <hi>Picus,</hi> a perſon more fit to judge of this difficulty than any other, who in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that the Treatiſe <hi>De Libris licitis et illicitis,</hi> was infallibly writ by <hi>R.

To prove this the more eaſily we are to preſuppoſe, that ſpeech is the action of ſome thing that is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and is not perform'd but by the voice which is defin'd by St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> after <hi>Ariſtotle, Sonus ab ore animalis prolatus.</hi> For it muſt needs be granted, that, if theſe Heads ſpoke, it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they were living and animate, or that the Daemons ſpake in them. If the former, the Soul whereby they did it, muſt be vegetative, ſenſitive, or rational. It could not be <hi>vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>

Much leſſe then can it be <hi>rational,</hi> unleſſe we grant withal, that they could apprehend the Species of things, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, remember them, and, in a word, be like us.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if theſe Heads and Statues were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch, that is, living and animate, it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an <hi>accidental</hi> form or a <hi>ſubſtantiall;</hi> not the firſt, at leaſt according to the opinion of all Philoſophers, who will never grant, that to diſcourſe, to ſpeak, to teach, to foreſee what is to come; and ſuch effects can depend on an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and not on a Subſtance. The latter is leſſe poſſible, becauſe ſuch Statues could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that ſubſtantial form till they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of what they had before; which there is no colour to imagine they ſhould have done by a ſimple tranſmutation of figure, ſince the form of the copper and of their matter was ſtill ſuch as it was wont to be. Further, I would gladly know, where was their <hi>motion,</hi> the firſt <hi>indicium</hi> of life; where their <hi>ſenſes,</hi> the ſluces of all knowledge; and, in a word, (not to ravel our ſelves into thouſands of difficulties, ariſing from the original and operation of that Soul) where were the Parts and <hi>Organs</hi> neceſſary for their diſcourſe and ratiocination.</p>

               <p>AS it was not lawful for every one in the old Teſtament to lend a ſhoulder to uphold the Ark of the Covenant, even though it were ready to fall, ſo there are a many that think it were not convenient, that all kinds of Writers undertook the defence of him whom <hi>Christ Jeſus</hi> hath left as Head and Vicegerent of his militant Church. The reaſon is, that being perſecuted by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mankind, who hath taken into his ſervice all the modern Hereticks, the better to oppoſe him, and ſo to ſtrike at the foundation of ſpiritual Monarchy, He ſhould employ no other than ſuch Chriſtian and Catholick <hi>Hercules</hi>'s, as were <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius,</hi> and the ornament of Gaſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Florimundus Remundus,</hi> to whom it properly belongs to vindicate the injuries done to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to purge their <hi>Annals</hi> of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and to heal their blindneſſe who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently carryed away with the forgeries &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of Hereticks. And yet ſince, as <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſaies, every one may be a Soldier in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the defence of Religion; and that God was pleas'd to make uſe of the ſling of a poor Shepherd to abate the pride of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> we may preſume (yet without ſearching into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his will to find out the cauſe of <hi>Uzzah's</hi> death, for endeavouring to uphold the Arke) that, as he permits the Devil to ſet upon the Church by the means of the moſt inconſiderable Heretick, ſo is he not diſpleas'd that any one
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115273:139"/>
ſhould defend her. And this I think it my duty to do, as to what concerns the crime of <hi>Magick,</hi> wherewith the ſimplicity of ſome ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and the malice of modern Hereticks, would blaſt the reputation of thoſe who have ſat at the helm thereof in the quality of Popes. Not that I am ſo unadviſed as to think their innocence ſtands in any need of my pen, ſince it is ſtrong enough to reſcue it ſelf, with the aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit who never forſakes it, from ſuch an accuſation, and to overcome all the tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hurricans of ſuch calumnies,

And this the rather, ſince I withal pretend to draw from this Chapter the ſtrongeſt Argument that may be, to juſtifie all the others mentioned in this Book, whom no man will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after wonder to find charg'd with Magick, when even thoſe who command us as Livetenants of God, and whom we reſpect as the high Prieſts &amp; Prelates of our Religion could not avoid that reproach. Yet as God never permits errour ſo to inſinuate into any thing of importance, but there is light enough to diſcover it, if a man will look but narrowly thereto; ſo in this caſe, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny juſtifying circumſtances offer themſelves, and there are ſo many proofs to undermine the

very ground-work of theſe accuſations that men muſt needs be either ſtrangely paſſionate or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, if, having ever ſo little reaſon or judgment they do not perceive, that all thoſe things which concern the Magick of the <hi>Popes,</hi> are nothing but <hi>Dreames, Caſtles in the Aire, Chimaera's &amp; Fables.</hi>

who deveſted him of all honours and dignities af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Paul. Jov. in Elogiis.</note> he had put him to the Torture.

               <p>The ſame judgment may we paſſe upon <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Polonus</hi> who publiſh'd ſuch another ſtory of <hi>Sylvester</hi> in the year 1320. for it is clear that he hath tranſlated all he ſayes of him, in his <hi>Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall Supputations,</hi> out of this <hi>Godefrey</hi> who liv'd about the year 1150. and one <hi>Gervaſe</hi> an Orator of the City of <hi>Arles</hi> and Chancellour to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Ottho</hi> III. but withall the moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent forger of Fables and the moſt egregious Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that ever took pen in hand.

               <p>To levell, therefore, this Tower of confuſion, which, in ſome of our Hiſtorians &amp; Demonogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, want of judgment; in Hereticks, envy hatred and malice, have engag'd them to build up to the diſhonour of the Monarch of the Church, upon the too ſimple and eaſy credulity of thoſe ancient Authors, we muſt begin with this <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> or <hi>Sylveſter</hi> II. He, they ſay, was Maſter in Magick to four or five of his ſucceſſors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is more ground to acknowledge that he was the moſt vertuous perſon, and greateſt Light as to all manner of Sciences, of the age he liv'd in, it being much more eaſy for us to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his learning then the place of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and manner of life, till he arriv'd to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Rheims.</hi> For ſome, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common opinion, affirme, that he was firſt a Religious man at <hi>Fleury,</hi> or St. <hi>Bennet's</hi> upon the <hi>Loire.</hi> Others there are that hold the contrary, grounding their opinion upon what he ſaith himſelf in one of his Epiſtles to the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> III. wherein he openly tells him, that he had, from his Childhood, ſerv'd
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115273:144"/>
his Father and Grandfather <hi>Otho</hi> the Great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was entertain'd into the ſervice of <hi>Adal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bero</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims.</hi> But the true ſtory is, that being choſen by <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> to be Tutor to his Son <hi>Robert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he conferr'd on him that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick, whereof being deveſted by <hi>John</hi> XVII. he retir'd into Germany, to <hi>Otho</hi> II. who committed to this charge <hi>Otho</hi> III. and gave him, by way of recompence the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which he peaceably enjoy'd, till that, his Diſciple coming to the Empire, he was by him ordained <hi>Pope</hi> and maintained againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> in the dignity of ſupreame Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Theſe things well conſider'd, I ſee not upon what ground <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> and <hi>Platinus</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent him as a Magician. For I pray, what likelihood is there he ſhould quit his Frier's frock to go and learne Magick at <hi>Toledo, Salamanca,</hi> or <hi>Sevill,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> in Spain, when he never ſtirr'd out of the Abbey of <hi>Fleury,</hi> till he was taken thence by <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> or as he ſaith himſelf, ſpent his youth in the ſervice of <hi>Otho</hi> I. and II? And is it not more probable he ſhould arrive to all theſe Eccleſiaſticall Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities by the favour of two <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and three <hi>Emperours,</hi> to whom he had done great and conſiderable ſervices, rather then by any aſſiſtance or induſtry of the Devill, who never yet was ſo good a Maſter as to beſtow a half-peny on all the Magicians, notwithſtanding their moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able beggery, as <note n="a" place="margin">Diſquiſ. l. <hi>2.</hi> qu. <hi>12.</hi>

               <p>Nor is there any more marrow in what is added, that, having been anſwer'd by the Devil, that he ſhould not dy till ſuch time as he had ſaid Maſs in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> he was extreamly ſurpriz'd upon war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning given him that he was near his death, when, not minding any thing he ſaid it in the Church of the <hi>Holy Croſſe in Hieruſalem,</hi> which is in <hi>Rome.</hi> As if he ſhould be ignorant there was a Temple in the place of his conſtant reſidence called by that name, or ſhould not have reflected on the ambiguity of <hi>Oracles,</hi> and would have celebrated Maſſe in a place unknown to him. But what is ſaid of his <hi>end</hi> is much more flat and ridiculous, at leaſt, if we could but be perſwaded, that, as <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> and <hi>Platinus</hi> affirm, he made a publick acknowledgment of his fault, and that after he had given aſſured expreſſions of a ſincere and perfect repentance, he committed a thing extreamly ſuperſtitious, ordering that his body ſhould, after his death, be put in a Chariot to be drawn by Oxen, without any body to guide them, that it might be buried in the place where they ſhould ſtop. That happened before the Church of St. <hi>John Lateran,</hi> where the foreſaid Authors with divers others, affirm that his Sepulchre gives a certain preſage of the death of Popes both by a ſhock and craſhing of the bones that are within, and by a great ſweat and moiſtneſſe of the ſtone without, as is obſervable, according to <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> in the <hi>Epitaph</hi> ſet upon it.</p>

But this is all pure cheat and impoſture, not only as to experience, never any ſuch thing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been obſerv'd by any one to this day; but alſo as to the Inſcription of this Sepulchre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by <hi>Sergius</hi> IV. which is ſo far from making any mention of all theſe fables and extravagances, that, on the contrary, it is one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable teſtimonies we can have of the good life and integrity of this <hi>Sylveſter.</hi> And indeed it is no ſmall ſhame, that many Catholicks ſhould ſo much countenance this calumny, when <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Scotus, Glaber, Ditmare, Hilgaudus, Lambert,</hi> and <hi>Herman Contract,</hi> who were his Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries, make not the leaſt mention of it.

               <p>WHen I ſeriouſly reflect on the Condition of thoſe learned men, who flouriſh'd four or five ages before the reſtauration of Sciences and diſciplines in <hi>Europe,</hi> nothing ſeemes more miraculous to me then that the moſt learned and beſt grounded among our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have appear'd amidſt that Barbariſm like Roſes among thorns, or Diamonds on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Mountaines. And this ſo much the rather, in that at this day when we are encompaſſ'd with ſo great light as ſhould make us judge of things with more caution, thoſe who ſhould make great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt uſe thereof are ſo dazzl'd therewith that they revive many opinions whoſe firſt Authors we daily declame againſt, either for their want of judgment or ignorance. Whereof though the precedent Chapters of this Apology afford ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inſtances, yet have I reſerv'd for this that which we have upon the authority of <note n="a" place="margin">Daem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

man was in his wits when he writt it; and that I wrong him not, I appeal to the Reader. He ſaies then (not to meldle with any thing but what is to our preſent purpoſe) that the wiſe <hi>Virgi</hi> ſet up a <hi>Braſen Fly</hi> on one of the gates of <hi>Naples,</hi> which, for the ſpace of 8. years, that it remain'd there, permitted not a fly to enter the ſaid City, That in the ſame place he cauſ'd a <hi>Shambles</hi> to be made, wherein meat never ſmelt or was the leaſt tainted; that he placed on one of the gates of the ſame City two great images of Stone, one whereof was ſaid to be <hi>handſome</hi> and <hi>merry,</hi> the other <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> having this power, that if any one came in on the ſide of the former all his affairs proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to his own deſires, as he who came on the other, was unfortunate and diſappointed in all things; that he ſet up, on a high mountain near <hi>Nap'es,</hi> a <hi>brazen Statue,</hi> having in its mouth a Trumpet which ſounded ſo loud when the North wind blew, that the fire and ſmoke iſſuing out of thoſe forges of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> which are at this day ſeen near the City of <hi>Pouſſola,</hi> were forc'd back towards the Sea, without doing any hurt or injury to the Inhabitants. That it was he made the baths of <hi>Calatura di petra bagno &amp; adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to di l' homo,</hi> with fair inſcriptions in Letters of Gold, defac'd ſince by the Phyſitians of <hi>Salerna</hi> who were ttoubled that men ſhould thereby know what diſeaſes every bath could cure. That the ſame <hi>Virgil</hi> took ſuch a courſe that no man could be hurt in that miraculous <hi>Vault</hi> cut through the mountaine of <hi>Pauſilippo,</hi> to go to <hi>Naples;</hi> and laſtly that he made a <hi>publick fire,</hi> whereat every one might freely warme himſelf, near which he had place'd a <hi>braſen Archer</hi> with his

               <p>HAving through all the precedent Chapters, both by general and particular reaſons, ſhewn how it might come to paſſe that ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and extraordinary perſons have been charg'd with Magick, and conſequently deduc'd all I thought requiſite for their vindication; I think there cannot any thing be now expected from me, ſave that, by way of concluſion to this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, I ſhould ſpecifie the true cauſes and ſeveral occaſions whereby theſe calumnies are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and gain reputation daily, and what preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and inconvenience (if ſome courſe be not taken) they will do as well the Authors, who maintain them, as what is to be truly believ'd concerning Magicians, and what order is to be taken for the puniſhment of thoſe whom their ſorceries and miſdeeds diſcover and declare to be ſuch. For the former, me thinks the ſeveral cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſuch a ſuſpicion may be reduc'd principally to three. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that all the world is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſatisfy'd, that the ſtrongeſt proof and

                  </gap>aſt that come to the buſineſſe of writing and books, as well other Authors, as Daemonographers, grounding what they do on this Maxime, never mind the examination of what they find believ'd, and allow'd for true by their Predeceſſors, and thoſe who have written before them upon the ſame ſubject. So that what was falſe in them, ſpreads by this contagious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and applauſe, though not proceeding from judgement and the knowledge of the cauſe, but meerly to ſecond him that firſt led the dance, without ever conſidering that he who would be a wiſe and diſcreet Judge, ought very much to ſuſpect what ever the people, that <hi>peſſimus veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis interpres,</hi> is moſt taken with, and is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">Sen. de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta beata.</note> by the greateſt number, taking good heed that he be not carried away with the current of common &amp; popular opinions.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> general Cauſe is, that the greateſt part of thoſe who employ themſelves in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and evulgation of ſome piece, ſuch as they are able to work out, do commonly flatter themſelves into a perſwaſion of ſuch things, that they may do their buſineſs with greateſt eaſe. And as they write not ſo much for any benefit to the publick, to oblige it by an exact anatomy of Truth, as out of ſome motive of vanity or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or to comply with that neceſſity which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them to ſatisfie <hi>famem non famam,</hi> as <hi>Thuanus</hi> ſaies; ſo is it their cuſtome to go to work as ſlightly and as cheap as poſſibly they can, not troubling themſelves with a long and difficult evolution of the firſt Authors, or ſearching into the occaſions they had to ſcatter all theſe fables &amp; calumnies; nor racking their judgement with the conſideration of thoſe circumſtances which ſhould oblige them to ruminate, recollect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on things, ſo as to bring them to the grand Teſt of Reaſon, and thence draw ſolid and certain reſolutions. And here certainly they much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their weakneſſe, and, becauſe the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they derive from Nature are very ſlender, ſhew, how they are led away by example, groping after things by hear-ſaies and conjectures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever ſifting or examining them as they ought, eſpecially in this Age, which is more fit to refine and ſharpen mens judgements, then all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent put together were, by reaſon of the great revolutions that now happen, through the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a new world, the diſturbances occaſion'd

               <p>And to do this, they are much oblig'd to the <hi>third</hi> and laſt cauſe of the propagation of all theſe falſities, which is a Cuſtome lately introduc'd, of making oſtentation of <hi>Polymathy</hi> or great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſpeaking on any ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the mark, but who makes moſt ſhots. So that it is not to be admir'd if thoſe who exactly obſerve ſuch a method, are, like Marchants that take up all, burthen'd with many things of no value, and ſuch as only corrupt and diſparage others, which would be much more in requeſt and reputation, were they cull'd out of the Chaos and confuſion of thoſe great Volums. It is certainly a ſtrange thing, that <hi>Delrio, Le Loyer, Bodin, de Lancre, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delman,</hi> who have been, nay yet are, perſons of credit and deſert ſhould write ſo paſſionately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject of <hi>Daemons, Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as never to reject any Story, though ever ſo fabulous and ridiculous, of all thoſe falſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd ones, which they have without any diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhufled in among the true and legitimate.

their example once arriv'd to ſo much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as to ſleight and carp at any one of thoſe ſtories and opinions it had ſometimes held for true, it preſently jumps into an equall uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and contempt of all thoſe others for which it had not greater authority and better grounds than they had for thoſe that were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded,

               <p>It were therefore much to be wiſh'd, as well for the reputation of our Demonographers, as the maintenance &amp; explanation of the truth of the Subject they treat of, that they would be hence forward more cautious than to advance any Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Authority before they have diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined all circumſtances, and would afford all things their true worth and weight.
