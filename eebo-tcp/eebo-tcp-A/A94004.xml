            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMidſt the various Clans of Enthuſiaſts who being led aſtray thro blind ways by their diſtemper'd Brains and fantaſtick Notions. the <hi>Wills in the Whiſp,</hi> which they miſtake for a true light, none ſeem more poſitive of being guided right, and conſcquently more ſtubborn and daring than thoſe I am going to give you an account of.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Maſon,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Biſhops-Stafford,</hi> near <hi>Buckingham,</hi> a Man of a very good Life and Reputation, however now diſorder'd, affirm'd to his People, that our Saviour appear'd to him on <hi>Monday</hi> the 16th of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>April</hi> in his Chamber, and told him, that he ſhould appear publickly on Earth at <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and judge ſinners: This Story, and the Sanctity of the Man, ſo wrought upon the unthinking Multitude, that they flock every day into the Fields in great Companies, employing their time Night and Day in dancing and ſinging Hallelujahs, in expectation of his coming to Reign on Earth; when the Sinners are to be trampled under foot, and the Righteous to be all brought to <hi>Biſhops-Stafford,</hi> from whence they are to take a Progreſs to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in their way to call in all the wandring <hi>Jews.</hi> They have prepared a great many fat Beaſts to make a Sacrifice, and are ſo poſitive of the truth of this, that 'tis almoſt dangerous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them; whole Families, Men, Women and Children, leaving their Habitations together, as if they had utterly done with all Affairs of this World. Their Number at firſt was but ſmall, but in a few days encreas'd to Two Hundred, and I have ſince received news that they are multiplied to Five; and I imagine that nothing but finding their own Folly will be able to convince them; ſo that when their Tarantula is over, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them and their Paſtor to return to their ſeveral Vocations, and wait the good hour with as much patience as other People.</p>
            <p>Had I not received this Account from a Man of undoubted Reputation, my Friend, I ſhould ſcarce have credited it: But I hope this Paper may be ſecured from the Character of being <hi>Grubſtreet,</hi> ſince it is in the power of every Perſon that pleaſes, in a few hours, to ſatisfie himſelf of the truth of this Relation; who himſelf concludes with this Sentence, after he himſelf had been to ſee them, on <hi>Monday</hi> the 23d of this inſtant, <hi>Such a ſtrange Sight, ſuch Confuſion and Madneſs, I never expected to ſee, unleſs in</hi> Bedlam.</p>
